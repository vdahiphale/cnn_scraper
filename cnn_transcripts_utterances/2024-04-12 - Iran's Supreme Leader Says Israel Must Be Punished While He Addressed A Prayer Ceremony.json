If you would have askedme six months ago that I will go on your show again and I will speak about the fact that we still have 133 hostages being held by Hamas, I would have told you that it will be impossible. And yet we are sitting here and we will have 133 hostages being held by Hamas. I would have told you that it will be impossible. And yet we are sitting here and we are talking about the fact that we still have 134, 33 hostages that are being held by Hamas, that Hamas basically in the last few days said that they cannot identify 40 hostages, which I find very, very questionable, you know, especially when we know that these hostages are a great asset to Hamas, you know. And now, we're talking about a possible greater war between Israel and Iran. So, you know, all these things and coming here to the U.S. and watching what is happening from a little bit like, you know, a broad perspective or a broad perspective, it makes me -- I'm a little bit worried, especially after my visit here. Because, you know, in the last few days, what we saw in Israel and the last few weeks, what we saw in Israel is basically Israelis going to the streets, going back to protest, questioning and criticizing Israeli government, demanding the release of the hostages, demanding a deal, the hostages families basically asking to bring back their loved ones home. And this is on a positive note, this, you know, makes me very -- I watch the Israeli community and I watch Israelis and I say to myself, wow, we are still fighting for our democracy. We're still fighting. We're criticizing our government. We are fighting for our right to live. We're fighting for our citizens. And while I'm coming here and I'm watching, you know, protests being held on the streets here in the U.S., protests being held on the street and in European countries. And I see, and I hear people saying, you know, from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free by any means. And when I hear this, I hear this from the young generation calling and saying by any means, you know, putting claims to these colonizers, to these colonizers countries. And I'm asking myself, what do you mean by any means? Basically, you are supporting everything that this terror organization did on October 7th. Not only that you are supporting what they did, you're basically telling them do it again. And you know what? Because we are also colonizers and we in the United States also are taking part in this colonizers idea. So, do it also on our soil. You can do October 7th also in the U.S. again, and you can do October 7th also in European. And this is, I think, a great danger to Western civilization, to democratic countries who unfortunately don't understand what these terror organizations are doing, are basically using democratic values to hurt democracy. And this is what we're watching and seeing in the streets. You know, I've been on American campuses, I've been on high-ranked universities, and the fact that I hear Jewish students saying that they're afraid to say that they're Jewish in 2024 in the United States of America, this is unacceptable. This is something that I don't understand how the decision - makers are not doing anything to actually fight this bigger, like this war, this war that is happening with this Gen Z generation.",

There are sources, according to local media in Israel, there are sources who say, who have been at the negotiating table, who say that Benjamin Netanyahu seems somewhat indifferent, right, indifferent about the fate of the hostages six months in, his priorities, of course, defeating Hamas.

You know, she comes from a small village in Sierra Leone. Her parents weren't educated, but she was.

Sometimes it's one and the same, sometimes they're different. And there was a readiness to brush the story aside. There was a readiness to say, first of all, it didn't happen, because that's what the Nigerian government initially said. Then, you know, to say it's too hard to get them back, and as the years have gone by, we've seen this waning interest. The hashtag really did galvanize the world, and really it did bring together global voices to keep the pressure on the Nigerian government that led to the negotiated release of some of the girls.

UNKNOWN (voice-over):  The new site will feature classrooms as well as research and workspaces for entrepreneurs and startups with sustainability at the core of the design. CLARISSE KRAUSE, ASSOCIATE ARCHITECT, COBLOC ARCHITECTURE (through translator):  The overarching concept driving the design of this campus revolves around bioclimatic architecture, prioritizing environmental respect and minimizing reliance on electronics and machinery like air conditioning. Additionally, we emphasize the use of biosourced materials to drastically reduce the building's carbon footprint. Moreover, our approach entails designing modular buildings featuring a structural framework that allows for seamless evolution. This means that spaces can easily transition from classrooms to laboratories or meeting rooms, demonstrating a high level of flexibility integrated into the project. Furthermore, as an eco-city, the campus is designed for convenience with every building located within a five-minute walk, promoting accessibility by bike or on foot. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  With the Beninese architecture firm heavily involved in the design, the new campus is looking to harness the expertise on their doorstep. KRAUSE (through translator):  The vision of Seme City is to serve as a springboard for the youth of Benin and the broader sub-Saharan region. We believe that this new campus will truly act as a demonstrator, fostering the emergence of talent and innovation. The campus has the potential to serve as a hub for knowledge sharing and collaboration and presents a remarkable opportunity for Benin. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  As well as local architects, the design is also harnessing the expertise of Extech Labs, a Seme City-based start-up using x-ray technology to develop new compounds suitable for the Beninese climate. SEDOINE BONOU, HEAD OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORMS (through translator):  The slogan of Seme City is innovation made in Africa. It's not about going to buy cement or sand to do what is usually done.
