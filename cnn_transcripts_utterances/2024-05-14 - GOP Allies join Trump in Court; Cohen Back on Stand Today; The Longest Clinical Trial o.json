Michael Cohen will be back on the witness stand facing direct from prosecutors, at least for the morning.Michael Cohen left his apartment, headed down this way. Donald Trump left his apartment, headed down here this way. When Trump left a little while ago, former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was with him as well. You get the sense that a lot of people trying to jockey to be here near Donald Trump for this crucial part of the testimony today. Remember, Donald Trump is charged with falsifying documents to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, all to influence the 2016 election. Michael Cohen, so far, has testified that Donald Trump knew about those payments, approved the payments, and knew about the scheme to classify them as legal payments, even though they were not for technically legal services. When Michael Cohen gets back on the stand shortly, prosecutors no doubt will walk him through more of the timeline, including one meeting we have not yet reached, an Oval Office meeting when Trump was already president, between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, that we think they discussed the payment plan. We also expect the prosecution to lay out all of the potential warts that Michael Cohen has, the convictions he has faced, the lies he has told, to get that information out there all before what might be the critical moment of this entire trial, when defense lawyers get their turn at Michael Cohen and try to thoroughly discredit him. That is what we are standing by here for today. Sara, back to you.",

And I think Mike Johnson is in that group as well. Maybe not for VP, but he's assuring him that he will continue to be his puppet in the House of Representatives.

I think they would be going to a campaign rally in the last three to four weeks. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has had to sit in a courtroom during that period of time and he's now running a presidential campaign from a courtroom. So, you go to where the candidate is, and that happens to be the courtroom. So, one, I wanted to get that - I wanted to say that. Secondly, yes, I do think you're right, the American people, a lot of what the information that's come out in this trial so far has already been - are known knowns for the American people. They've taken that into account. So, there's no new revelations in this case. And the more that the prosecution relies only on Michael Cohen to try to tie Donald Trump to this case, the more political it looks.

And the reason why they are not taking this poll in terms of, you know, hair on fire and they should be panicking is because it's six months out. This is not the only poll out there. In fact, you have other national polls that have shown Joe Biden ahead or the races tied.And if you even look at this \"New York Times\" poll, Sara, the likely voters in those swing states have either the race tied or Joe Biden up. And so, again, polls are a snapshot in time. What this campaign is focused on are the issues that are important to voters, continuing to talk about an economy that works for all, continuing to talk about how Donald Trump is an existential threat to our rights and freedoms, reproductive rights, the protection of our democracy.

These new analyses look at four years' worth of data of people continuing to take Wegovy. And a lot of people have questions about the long-term safety of these medicines. At least in four years of use we didn't see any new safety concerns. We know that GI issues can be a problem for many people, particularly when they start the drugs. And those were there, but nothing major and new.In terms of the weight loss seen in the trial, they saw that typically people continue to lose weight for more than a year on Wegovy and then sustain that weight loss on the drug up to four years. And look at this chart. This is very interesting because it shows the variability in people's responses to taking Wegovy. People generally lost at least 5 percent of their weight. About two-thirds of the people on Wegovy compared with just more than 20 percent for people on placebo. When you get up to 15 percent body weight loss, you've got more than 20 percent of people on the drug, and less than 2 percent of people on placebo. There were some other really interesting studies about heart benefits in these as well, including that these drugs may work by tamping down inflammation and not just weight loss. Kate.",

Yet scientists have only looked at around 1,000 of these plants. I've traveled to some incredible places across the world in my search for nature's next medicines. We're looking for the next type of antibiotic. The work that I do is deeply personal to me. I was born with multiple congenital defects of my skeletal system, which required the amputation of my leg at the age of three. I developed a hospital acquired infection that nearly took my life.

Some of our most exciting discoveries have come from plants like the American Beautyberry, the European Chestnut, and the Brazilian Pepper Tree. We've discovered molecules in these plants that are very effective in the treatment of the worst drug resistant bacteria, including MERSA, or drug resistant staph. We've also discovered fascinating molecules from the American Beautyberry plant. These molecules restore the activity of antibiotics against very dangerous, resistant bacteria. The next phase of our research involves moving these discoveries from the lab to human clinical trials.

But what it would do is essentially classify Misoprostol and Mifepristone a schedule four controlled, dangerous substances. Putting them in the same category as highly regulated drugs like Diazepam and Rohypnol.This reclassification was added through an amendment to a bill that would have made it a crime to give somebody abortion drugs in medication without their knowledge or consent. Now, a state senator, he's a Republican, Thomas Presley, proposed that legislation he said because his sister was given Misoprostol without her knowledge, against her will. So, this proposed legislation, as amended, would make it a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, with fines of up to $5,000 for any person found in possession of these drugs without a valid prescription. It does include an exemption for pregnant women in possession of both Mifepristone and Misoprostol if for their own consumption. And doctors, the legislation says, would still be able to prescribe the drugs. But, look, medical professionals worry that this could make it more difficult for them to prescribe this for things like ulcers, miscarriages, and to - and to induce labor. Plus, look, this ads stigma and confusion they say. In a letter obtained by CNN, 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers, and medical students criticized this amendment, saying in part, quote, \"neither Mifepristone nor Misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risks, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\" They warn that classifying these drugs as scheduled for substances, \"creates the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation.\" Now, look, Presley responded telling CNN that the legislation doesn't stop these drugs from being dispense or prescribed for legitimate reasons. Sara, they must still pass this by the full house in Louisiana by June 3rd. And at that point it would go to the Republican governor, Governor Landry's desk, to determine if he would sign it into law.",

It's a concern by the administration that civilians and infrastructure and so forth will be damaged, destroyed, killed and that this could plant the seeds of Hamas 2.0. And, in fact, the challenge that Israel has is that it is destroying these individual battalions. There's maybe four of 24 that are left. And they are in the Rafah area, hence the need to go in there. But they are then leaving these areas. They are clearing and moving on rather than clearing and holding and rebuilding. And I think it's very important that they announce that they're going to explicitly make life better for the civilians in Gaza, that they clear an area and then try to hold it to keep the enemies from coming back in among the people. They're back into northern Gaza now, where the enemy was able to reconstitute. They had to go back into al Shifa Hospital, because Hamas was able to reconstitute their some months after they originally cleared it. So, they've got to look very carefully at their campaign design.
