JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  So, this morning, after two decades, a new top-selling beer in the U.S. Mexican lager, Modelo Especial, was the top selling beer last month, overthrowing Bud Light. There are a couple of things at play here, including flat-out changing tastes but also the backlash from a social media post by transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans here with the details. Romans?",

      "sentences": "Hi there, John. Well, yes, Modelo prevails, pardon the pun, over the king of beers dethroned here. Bud Light in the most recent month, a Bud Light's share of the market was less than Modelo. So, it lost its top standing there, 8.4 percent of beer sales in May belonged to Modelo, only 7.3 percent, Bud Light. So, that is a big shift.Now, you're right, there are some changing tastes happening, and also, this is the month of May. There's Cinco de Mayo, there's also a really clever advertising promotion campaign from Modelo and changing tastes. Analysts tell us that already there's been an affinity, a growing affinity for Mexican beer and spirits for some time now. So, that's sort of a tipping point that you're seeing here. When you look at overall sales though, sales for Bud Light down more than 24 percent in the month, that is kind of a staggering number here. And for Modelo, sales up 12.2 percent. So, these numbers are telling a story. You mentioned the transgender influencer who had one can, one customized can of Bud Light and did an Instagram post and conservative media and conservative social media went on a very full, full, forceful boycott of the beer. And so, that is one other kind of factor here at play. So, you've got two things happening. You've got change in taste, you've got several months, actually, years of declining tastes for light beer, in particular, and then you have this social media fail, quite frankly from Bud Light. I mean, a lot of corporate directors are watching what Bud Light did in this whole situation and finding a lot of fault with how it managed and behaved in the situation from a corporate and P.R. standpoint.",
