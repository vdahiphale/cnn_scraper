      "sentences": "A pivotal moment months in the making, we are just hours away from a major meeting between President Biden andChina's President Xi. Can the U.S. President accomplish his goal of changing the relationship? Plus, the rumble in the rotunda, a wild day on Capitol Hill as one congressman accuses Kevin McCarthy of taking a clean shot to the kidneys. And a Senator challenges a witness to a physical fight. So, what's going on with Republicans in Congress? I will ask GOP Representative Mark Alford when he joins us live ahead. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington, Wednesday, November 15. There are 61 days until the Iowa caucuses, just 355 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. The stakes are high. The expectations are pretty low. The presidents of the U.S. and China are just a few hours away from their much anticipated meeting at the APEC summit in California. Joe Biden and Xi Jinping enter this sit-down with relations between these two nations at a low point. They will face a host of contentious issues including Taiwan, Chinese business practices, and different views on the wars raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. President Biden says that he hopes to get relations \"back on a normal course\". Republican presidential candidates, however, seem to be collectively rolling their eyes at the meeting, claiming it's the sign of the administration's weakness on China. Nikki Haley says President Biden begged for it. David Culver is in San Francisco where the APEC summit is taking place. David, thank you so much for being here. Obviously, you have been reporting from Beijing for many years. Now, you're looking at it from the West Coast to the United States. What do you expect today? DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, how about the goal of keeping the U.S. and China from going into a conflict, a military conflict at that? I know it might sound extreme, Kasie, but that is certainly one of the priorities for U.S. officials, as they're hoping to focus on the other conflicts at hand, Israel, Hamas, Russia, Ukraine, as well as turn focus to the 2024 campaign. So, that's what they're entering this with the aspirations for. But, it's interesting. You mentioned the criticism that President Biden is already receiving from Republican candidates for going forward with this summit. That's something he is going to have to balance, is this desire to stabilize relationships with China, and at the same time, look tough on China. So, he can't come across too weak or soft. And the optics are going to play a big role into that. Optics are huge for China too. And China needs this, no question. I mean, their economy is suffering. They have housing market crisis that they've not seen before. They have youth unemployment at record highs. And so, it's for that reason that they're likely going to want something out of this. Of course, they're not going to concede anything without getting something in return. And Kasie, that's very likely to be something economy related. Of course, we've heard from the U.S. officials saying that reestablishing military communications, I mean, that's going to be really important as well. But, economy for China is what's going to really be the biggest focus. And it's interesting to note that they're going to be hosting a welcome Xi dinner, and this is a dinner that's put on by two U.S.-based organizations with a focus on U.S.-China relations, but it's already getting a lot of criticism, because those were invited our U.S. business leaders. And one U.S. lawmaker, the Chairman of the House Select Committee that focuses on the CCP, is asking for the names of the companies and individuals who are going to that dinner, because it is a paid dinner, Kasie. Some of the tickets reportedly $40,000 for a seat at the table with President Xi. That according to the U.S. lawmaker is unconscionable, and it's something he wants to really dig into and figure out who is behind and where all that money is going. But, it's part of China's effort to really try to woo businesses back, win them back to investment in China, because since the pandemic, they have been suffering, and that's obviously been contributing to the economy downturn, which for them is crucial, because economic aspects are what play into social stability. So, you can bet the Chinese Communist Party is going to want to focus heavily on that, Kasie.",

We have to talk to China. The problem is, what the Xi Jinping strategy has been is to give the U.S. government the cold shoulder until they come requesting the meeting, and then to get the U.S. government to pay them to talk. And they did this with Biden and they did this with Donald Trump, and they did this with President Obama. They did this with President George H.W. Bush. And so, what we had was two years of a Biden administration China policy, which was essentially pretty tough. And the premise of it was we're not going to play that game again. We're going to talk with China on our terms, and then we're not going to pay them to talk. And now, in year three is the politics come into it, and the President is distracted by Ukraine and Israel. And he is looking at the economy and the business leaders at that lunch -- at that dinner who are also his donors, by the way. He wants money from them just like Xi Jinping wants money from them. His calculation has changed. And he is depending on Janet Yellen, and not Tony Blinken. And he is saying, oh, well, now the goal is just to communicate. And that's a pretty low bar. Now, again, that doesn't mean he shouldn't do it. It just means we have to be honest about the fact that this is what Xi Jinping wanted, which was to ignore Biden until he came a calling. And I think that's what a lot of GOP congressmen are pointing to, and there is a big part of that, because it's true.",

You can't tell us anything about Hong Kong. You definitely can't tell us anything about Taiwan. And all of these tariffs and sanctions and export restrictions and outbound investment restrictions have got to go, otherwise we won't talk to you. So, they're putting Biden to a choice of pursuing the competitive, sometimes confrontational China policy that he wanted to pursue and doing what he is doing now, which is basically saying, talking is the most important thing.

Number two, we know that China in recent years has wanted to cast itself as something of a peacemaker. And so, I'm sure there'll be a conversation about how can China help with the Middle East with Russia's involvement in Ukraine. And again, we may not really know what that conversation is.
