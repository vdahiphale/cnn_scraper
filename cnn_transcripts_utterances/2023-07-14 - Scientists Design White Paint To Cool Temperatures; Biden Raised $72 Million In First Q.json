Almost every single lawmaker from both parties voted it in committee, to now where you have a nearly party-line vote where just four Democrats voted for it, four Republicans voted against it. So that's the dynamic that we are confronting here in the House. And there's no signs that it's going to be any better in the Senate. They'll come up with their own products and then they're going to have to come together and figure out what, if anything, they can agree on in the House.",

The priority for millions of Americans is finding ways to keep cool and to stay safe. A jug of white paint, the world's whitest paint may actually be the answer. A group of scientists have created a type of white paint they say that can cool surface temperatures -- actually cool it -- and in turn ease global warming. Xiulin Ruan is one of the scientific minds behind this very interesting phenomenon. He is a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University and he's with us now.

Just like a human body, the paint emits heat to the deep space. So what there happens is that the absorbed heat from the sun is much less than the heat emitted by the surface. So, you see we lose more heat than gaining heat from the sun. So, it can cool the load ambient temperature. You get free refrigeration basically.",

And the mining right now, yes, indeed it's like a commercial TR2 based paints that need to be mined, but the barium sulfate is very abundant.I will say now that this is a solution that we can use together with other solutions to help cool down our cities and our earth.

So because our paint can reduce the heating by 100 watts per meter square -- that's a meaconing power -- now our earth's temperature is going up, because the average heats up by one watt per meter square. So that's why, you know, when we apply about one percent or two percent of the earth's surface it can totally offset the heating experience right now and bring kind of the earth to stop warming up anymore. I think this is my colleague professor Jeremy Munday at the University of California Davis. Yes, it can directly cool down the earth. That's the amazing part of it.",

The president raised $72 million in his first quarter, since launching his reelection bid back in April. This fundraising total is more than any other 2024 presidential contender. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now from the White House. So Jeremy, how are these numbers being viewed within the Democratic Party?JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Well Rahel, I think the best way to put it is that it's certainly going to quell some of that anxiety among Democratic fundraisers and party strategists that we've seen about questions about a lack of enthusiasm for the president. But it's not the kind of blockbuster number that's going to put those concerns to bed altogether. And that's because $72 million is certainly a substantial haul for President Biden. As you mentioned, it's more than any of the other 2024 contenders have raised. That being said, those Republican contenders are vying for the same kind of Republican donor pool, so they aren't expected to match up exactly with President Biden. But where this stacks up, you look back to President Obama in 2011 when he launched his reelection campaign, a few weeks before President Biden along the same quarterly cycle, he raised $86 million. And since then, of course, contribution limits have increased. That being said, the Biden campaign officials are pointing to the fact that the Obama had a three-week head start on the fundraising, and they say that day per bay the Biden campaign actually raised more per day. Now how do these donations actually break down? Nearly 400,000 individuals donated to Biden's reelection campaign, and the Democratic National Convention's joint fundraising committee $39 average donation, 97 percent of those donations were under $200. That 400,000 number and put in context also compared to Obama in 2011, he had 550,000 individual donors to his campaign. Campaign officials that I spoke with today say that the grassroots fundraising environment is very different now compared to them. There's certainly been some fatigue across the political spectrum. But nonetheless they point to some signs that their grassroots is getting off the ground. And one of those numbers is the fact that 30 percent of the donors to the president's election this cycle -- this quarterly cycle -- they are new donors. They did not previously donate 2020. And they certainly say that that's a positive sign for how things are going to go going forward -- Rahel.",

The White House estimates that this new plan could affect more than 800,000 borrowers.
