This is a special edition of \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\"And happening now, residents in and round Myrtle Beach, South Carolina are being told to not - repeat - not collect debris from a downed Chinese spy balloon. That comes as we're getting one of the best looks yet at the shoot out of the balloon. U.S. fighter jets fired a single missile to crash the surveillance craft this afternoon. Right now, military crews are scrambling to try to recover as much of the wreckage as possible. Most of it sits in 47 feet of water. Also new tonight China is delivering a very angry response to what the United States did today. Let's get the latest. Go to the Pentagon first, our correspondent Oren Lieberman is joining us right now. Oren, walk us through what's next?",

When this operation was in the planning, part of what was on the ground or on the water were Navy and Coast Guard vessels ready to jump in and essentially begin the recovery effort.And there are two parts to this. The first is already underway with the security perimeter established around, essentially, the debris from this balloon that's floating on the water. And it is quite spread out. A senior defense official said earlier today that its spread out over seven miles of water. So that in and of itself will take some effort. But a large chunk of that has also sunk in as you just mentioned 47 feet of water. For that they need to salvage vessel that should arrive in the next couple of days. And that will be a whole different operation, going underwater with unmanned vessels, with Navy divers to bring that up. All of this has the potential to contain incredibly valuable intelligence and technology from the Chinese. And that's why this is such an important operation and such a delicate operation. This dramatic video of the missile taking down the balloon it then fell, this payload that's about three school buses long from 60,000 feet high, so nearly 12 miles up in the sky. Impacted the water were almost certainly would have had a tremendous force there. So now it's a question of trying to find everything, trying to bring it up.

What I think, Wolf, is pretty sad, and I was a big advocate for shooting this thing down. But as the time went on, I'm like, maybe they've been able to hinder something for them to make that decision to wait. The number of members of Congress - you have a right to criticize the President in this, and frankly, that's their job to do it, if they think he made the wrong decision.But the number of people that I saw tweeting and making statements, basically saying this is proof that the world's laughing at us. The U.S. military is the worst military in the world, basically, to paraphrase, that to me is extremely disappointing. That in a moment of, you know, somewhat crisis here, the knee jerk reaction of some of my colleagues was to see this as an opportunity to go after President Biden politically.

It is.Anytime you fly over a sparsely populated state, you realize that there's just not a lot of people out there. It's got a lot of land. And so - but my guess is the Pentagon knew that they were able to at least mitigate some of the damage being done here. And at that point, you can make the decision then to shoot it down over the water. And probably the water is a better place for preserving, preserving some of those parts. Of course, it's still going to hit with impact, it's still going to shatter. But my guess is it may help preserve it versus just lying there on the ground.",

When this thing was taken down, you could clearly see that part, the part they're interested in, dropping away in what seems to be intact.Now from the altitude where it was, more than 60,000 feet, we don't know the mass. But if the mass was that of a car, or a couple of cars, which a balloon like this could easily carry, it could have gone into the water at 500 to 550 miles an hour, maybe more. That's just an estimate based on what we do know. That means that when it hit somewhere here around Myrtle Beach, that it was like running into a concrete wall. It's going to be a tremendous impact when it hits, deforming breaking things, throwing things aside. It would not stay the way it was falling through the air. What does that mean to the recovery? That means even though it's in 47 feet of water, which is tremendous. And even though they've got good weather for the next few days, which is another good break, they're going to have to go down first and do a basic assessment of what condition it is in, where all the pieces are. Let's find out what the bottom is like here. There's lot of this embedded down here where they have to dig it up and then slowly they have to come up with the plan. What is most important to bring up? What are they most have to keep the way it is so they can see it in relation to other things, and then how will they do it? This is very delicate work. It takes time. They think this will be a fairly fast operation, not something that would go on for weeks, but it will still take time to bring it all up safely and preserve the evidence. Look at this as if it's an underwater crime scene, Wolf. That's how they have to treat it. If they want to get all the evidence they think they can find.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, it's pretty amazing when you watch this video, isn't it, Wolf? And just so the training that these pilots undergo is really significant. They, you know, go for about a year and a half of what's called undergraduate pilot training when they first come into the Air Force and first get their commissions. And then after that they specialize in their particular airframes. Most of the pilots that are flying the F-22 have flown another airframe before that, so they will have had experience with another type of airplane. But the types of skills that they acquire in these kinds of situations are then honed in places like Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, where they have the fighter weapons school. And so these kinds of tactics are really essential, not only to warfighting, but to really precise operations like this. And the targeting piece of this from the pilot, to the weapon, the Sidewinder missile, in this case, to the actual target. That really speaks to the precision that it you know, is very evident in these cases. And it speaks to the precision of the U.S. weapons systems that are available to us.",

So what may have happened is, is that the Chinese use may have had an outage, they may have felt they needed a gap filler in order to cover the particular intelligence requirement that they had for their forces is.So what could happen is they could do - put balloons in place of satellites to do this. And the types of intelligence that they would be using, Wolf, would include imagery intelligence, which is kind of hard to do, in some cases, from a platform like balloon, but also signals intelligence. And they would be able to collect data in various frequency spectrum like UHF VHF, cell phone, communications, those are the kinds of things that would be important from a military perspective. And they could also be sampling the environment, the signals environment, and the terrain. So there are a lot of different things that could be a part of their menu, if you will, of things that they were interested in. And a balloon was perhaps one way in which they could find out what they're missing, find out what other things they need to augment in terms of other intelligence collection capabilities.

And the FBI, you know, there is no better agency out there that can look at and recreate a device, assuming that it actually survived that shoot down. So there'll be looking at that.And you know, when a lot of people think about the FBI, they think about DNA analysis, forensic analysis, firearm analysis, there's actually an entire division at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, it's called the Operational Technology Division. I worked with them when I was an agent, these are the technical wizards. We would have a problem set, we would want to devise some type of way to collect intelligence in a particular way, these are the tech wizards that would create those devices. When we were overseas, we would capture a particular device, take it to this team for exploitation. So it makes sense to me that this is the team that would be looking at, trying to determine what this was and see if it stands up to scrutiny. You know, the Chinese have said that this was a meteorological assessment platform, we'll see if that actually ends up being the case. Finally, I think it's worth pointing out, Wolf, also that although the FBI, you know, they will be leading this, they will be in their location, this will be a multi-agency effort. I think that's because the Intelligence Committee almost certainly understands that, unlike a lot of intelligence operations, this is a very public incident. We've all seen this for ourselves, in these images, we've heard calls from lawmakers for accountability. And so you don't often see the CIA and NSA out there very publicly, it makes sense to me why the FBI might try to take on that role, assuming there is some type of public report.

When the decision was made to shoot this balloon down, what they'll be looking at now is, they'll be looking - taking a hard look at the various components to determine what China was trying to collect. They'll be looking to see whether or not there's any new technology that we were not previously aware of. They'll also be taking a hard look at the control mechanism for this balloon. It's unclear to us at this point, why and how this balloon ended up over us airspace. They'll want to know whether or not this is something that just sort of went errant and they lost control of it, or whether this was deliberate. And then to the degree that they can understand the devices that are there, that will help us understand how other devices that China is using may work. So you know, this could potentially be a treasure trove of information, Wolf. But as Josh said in the last segment, we simply won't know until that analysis is done.",

If this - this is determined to be a spy balloon, and it's almost certain that it will be determined to be some sort of apparatus to spy on the United States, the tensions between the United States, which have already been in recent months and years at a fever pitch, are going to rise. It is going to get more tense.Now, I think that behind the scenes, even as this balloon is been shot out of the sky, and even as we're collecting the debris, behind the scenes, the State Department is working to talk to the Chinese and to fully understand outside of the public eye what happened here. And so while we may see those tensions overflowing in the public, it's important for people to know that behind the scenes that they still be - they will still try to work together and try to figure out a way to get diplomatic relationships back - the diplomatic relationship back on track. But it's going to be challenging, Wolf. This does not help that relationship at all. And I think at some point, the Chinese are going to have to step forward and going to have to acknowledge the reality of this situation. And the reality is, they got caught trying to spy on the United States.",

China was almost apologetic using words such as \"regret,\" which is very rare to hear from the Chinese government.But now the response that we are getting to the shoot down of the suspected spy balloon, it is firm, it is forceful and very unforgiving. Let me read you just a portion of this paragraph long statement. \"China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and protest against the U.S. use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft. The Chinese side has repeatedly informed the U.S. side, after verification, that the airship is for civilian use and entered the U.S. due to force majeure,\" a French phrase meaning uncontrolled circumstance. \"It was completely an accident.\" It goes on to say that, \"It will take necessary reactions.\" So this is now moving from a diplomatic tone to one that is much more aggressive. And the backdrop of this also can't be ignored. In just about a week ago, we were planning for what may have been the first visit of a secretary state to China in six years. Antony Blinken was planning on this visit, to talk about diplomacy and talk about some of the big issues where perhaps there would be some common ground. But now we are in a much different situation. And the U.S. is going to be very anxious to see what more China says in the next 24 hours. I think I mentioned to you last hour, Wolf, the government typically has a briefing in the afternoon. It'll be Monday afternoon, when will be the quickest. We'll hear from them. So perhaps we'll get a better idea, at least on the public stage, what the Chinese government is thinking.",

Of course, if they did, it would really question the sincerity of their diplomatic overtures, Wolf.
