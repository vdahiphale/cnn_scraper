And the evidence that I'm seeing suggests we are on that path.Now are there risks? Of course. I don't want to downplay the possibility that there are risks here, but I do think that's possible. There are many factors that have been pushing inflation up that have nothing to do with the tight labor market. Russia's war on Ukraine raised, these food and energy prices, the disruption from the pandemic, caused supply bottlenecks that led to outright shortages pushed up, for example, the prices of cars dramatically, new and used cars, because of shortages of semiconductors. We're seeing those supply chain bottlenecks that boosted inflation. They're beginning to resolve. We had big shifts in the way people live. And low interest rates and housing prices rose a lot, now housing prices have essentially settled down. Rental prices of new rental units moved up a lot, but they have now settled down and they're falling, and that's an element of inflation that will continue to subside over time.",

On the revenue side, our price caps that we've put in place on Russian oil have lowered the revenues that Putin is receiving by roughly 40 percent over the last year.He expected to have budget surpluses. He now has a very large budget deficits. In terms of equipment we know that we've had great success in depriving him of the equipment that he needs to conduct this war. This is due to our export controls and importantly, it's not just the United States acting alone, it's that we have strong coalition partners who were working together to put in place sanctions, export controls, and working jointly on enforcement. Host over 9,000 pieces of heavy equipment on the battlefield and we see the Russians struggling to replace this, so we see on the battlefield Russia is now forced to resort to Iran and North Korea. to try to supply his military and we continue to take steps to make sure that vision of our sanctions isn't possible.

The way that the United States has used sanctions often in this case, in the case of the Iran nuclear deal, is to use the power of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. But that weaponization of the dollar has produced a reaction. This week, President Lula in Brazil said why are we all being forced to use the dollar?Emmanuel Macron made reference to the dollar in that same way. The European Commission has talked about after Trump pulled out of the Iran sanctions, talked about creating an alternative to Swift, to the American dominated payment system.

Most notably that Ukraine's air defenses are weak and that Kiev is in desperate need of munitions.The paper also says South Korea is worried that artillery shells it sells to America might end up on the Ukrainian battlefield. A breach of that country's policy not to supply ammunition to countries at war. They revealed that the U.S. may press Israel to provide weapons to Ukraine, which would be a change in Israeli policy as well. And there's undoubtedly information in the leaks that Russia can use against Ukraine. So what will the military fallout be? And what effect is all this having on the United States' diplomatic relations? Joining me now is retired U.S. Army General Mark Hertling and David Sanger. General Hertling is a national security and military analyst for CNN. And David is a White House and national security correspondent for \"The New York Times\" and also a CNN contributor. David, let me start with you and just set the -- you know, the big picture. What do these documents reveal? What do you -- what was the most striking things to you when you read it?",

You know, the Pentagon papers or WikiLeaks or the Snowden revelations of just about 10 years ago. And the answer is that those were much bigger leaks but these are much more current.They're very tactical. Some of the documents are 40 days old. They are from the end of February through say early march of this year. And so, some of them are very damaging because they tell the Russians what it is that the United States is worried about immediately. So in the immediate tactical problems there is, as you suggested at the beginning, one document that makes it pretty clear that Ukraine is running out of ammunition for its air defenses and by a certain date in May may have none left. Well, that would be a big red flag out there for the Russians to know that their air force which they've kept pretty well grounded would be able to go up without fear of being shot down. But there are other bigger issues that are there. The fact that we are listening in to the military officials around and some of the political officials around President Zelenskyy in Ukraine tells you we don't trust entirely what the Ukrainians are sharing with us. The fact that we have, as you suggested, gotten in deep to the South Korean National Security Council tells you that we want to know everything about their internal debate about whether or not they can ship ammunition to Ukraine. They're one of the biggest producers of 155 millimeter rounds that Ukraine desperately needs for its artillery. Some of this is embarrassing to the U.S., Fareed, because President Yoon of South Korea is coming to the United States in just two or three weeks for a state visit, you know, and he's going to have to get past the fact that the United States was listening in on his government.",

We learned a lot about the vividness of it. We learned about the sharp elbows of diplomacy. We learned about the angst when they discovered that allies were lying to the United States. But by and large, as you say, there was no great revelation beyond an understanding of the detail.And I think the longer term issue that it reveals is that while American officials love to say the Ukrainians are doing great, they're brave, they're out on the field, who could believe they could hold off the Russian so long, there is a deep concern. As General Milley has said publicly that we are headed towards stalemate here and that the United States does not see a path to victory for the Ukrainians. And that raises the big question, how does this war end then? Does it end in a negotiation in which, despite what President Zelenskyy has said, he may have to agree to at least accede to an armistice or some kind of ceasefire in which the Russians are holding on to big chunks of his territory.",

So, as somebody who's been in the battlefield tell us how important these kind of things are? Were the Ukrainians being helped enormously by U.S. intelligence? Does this set them back because the Russians now know stuff? What's your reaction? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I don't believe it sets them back at all, Fareed. Truthfully, the things that were on the documents are pretty well known by most military on both sides. The Ukrainian military knows where the Russian military are on a daily basis. I get an open source report showing exactly where all the battalion tactical groups are and their estimated strength. What this has done is showing the other side -- it's showing the Russian something that we have been assessing from our joint staff based on the intelligence we've been receiving. I don't think there's a whole lot of big surprises there. In terms of the document you mentioned or David mentioned with the air defense equipment, most military folks understand how much ammunition Ukraine is going through. I don't think this is going to change any plans from the Ukrainian military. I've always tried to put myself in the place of, what would I be doing if I were a Ukrainian general right now? I've got to do several things. First of all, an intelligence preparation of the Russian battlefield to find out what they're doing and where they're at and where I can attack. Number two, incorporating all the bevy of new equipment he has received from both the U.S. and all of the NATO nations, and how to coordinate that into a combined arms operation. How do I move from the defense to the offense, which is going to be exceedingly difficult for the Ukrainian military? And most importantly, how do I maintain my supply and logistics lines wherever I attack, wherever I conduct the offensive?

They've been bombing from long distances. Some of that isn't -- is due to Ukrainian air defense artillery. But most of it is the fact that Russians' air force is just not capable.

There have been complaints that too much is classified. And I think as you go through these documents, and I've been through many of them, you realize that many of them didn't need to be.I mean, some of this comes from sensitive signals intelligence. A lot of it comes from things that people were reading in \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post\" or foreign newspapers, each and every day and they're all mixed together. The second thing that you conclude from this is if you pull back dramatically from allowing this intelligence to flow, you run the risk of making again the error that led to 9/11. You'll recall that post 9/11, we said, why is all this intelligence siloed? Why did people in the defense department, at the FBI and others not know about the Saudi hijackers who were training in the U.S.? And that led to a big opening of the intelligence world so that more people would see the data. And then you get an incident like this and the immediate instinct is to close down again. And we keep getting in this cycle.
