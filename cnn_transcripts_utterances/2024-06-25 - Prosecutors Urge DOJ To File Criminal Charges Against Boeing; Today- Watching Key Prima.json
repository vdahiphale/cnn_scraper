That's not how the Boeing company should build airplanes. This company is too important to our economy, to our national security. And this is why the Department of Justice decision, Attorney General Merrick Garland's decision to hopefully continue to pursue prosecution of Boeing will identify who are these bad actors and those -- and hold those individuals accountable. Otherwise, I'm afraid that we're going to see more airplanes that are going to have problems and we're probably going to see more accidents --",

Bowman, among other things, look, he pulled a -- the fire alarm when Democrats wanted to buy time on the House floor to read through a bill. He got caught on camera. He apologized for that. But there was a -- that's been part of this race. But it was really his take on the Israeli offensive in Gaza, calling very early before anybody else for a ceasefire there, saying -- calling Israel's situation in Gaza an occupation for the last 75 years. And calling it genocide repeatedly. He's sort of walked back on some of those things, but he hasn't given really a full-throated apology. His opponent, George Latimer, well-known in this district because he's served at every level, is now the county executive, which is a very powerful position in Westchester County and counties across the state.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE LATIMER, (R), WESTCHESTER COUNTY EXECUTIVE &amp; CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: My opponent has made much of the support that I have. Over 50 percent of my financial support comes from people in the district. Those people may be affiliated with a PAC or they may be involved in other Jewish causes.

Well, we just saw new research on this showing that nearly a third, 29.7 percent, of adults 60 or older here in the United States, who do not have cardiovascular disease, have said that they take a daily aspirin to reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke.Now, it's no longer recommended, as you said, Brianna, to do this, if you're someone who has not had a history of heart attack or stroke. Medical groups now say the risk of taking a daily low-dose aspirin, because it thins your blood, it comes with the risk of excessive bleeding. That risk no longer -- or the benefit of aspirin also outweighs that risk. And that's why guidelines have been updated to say -- according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, their guidelines say it is no longer recommended to take low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults 60 or older. Now what I mean by primary prevention, that's to reduce your risk of having a first-ever heart attack or stroke. If you're 60 or older, and you have had a heart attack or stroke before, you may be recommended to take a daily low-dose aspirin as a secondary prevention tool. According to the American Heart Association, the group says, quote, \"Aspirin is part of a well-established treatment plan for people with a history of heart attack or stroke.\" So that's the main takeaway here, Boris and Brianna. If you're 60 or older and you have never had a heart attack or stroke before and you're taking a daily aspirin on your own, that's no longer recommended. If you're 60 or older and you have had a heart attack or stroke before and your doctor has said, you may want to take a low-dose daily aspirin to prevent a secondary or third or fourth heart attack or stroke, that's the demographic that these recommendations are for.",
