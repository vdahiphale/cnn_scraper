Windchill alerts stretch from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. Look at this map. CNN's Lucy Kafanov is live in Denver. Which could see temperatures plummet by as much as 60 degrees by tomorrow morning. So, I see the hat. I see the vest. It's not too cold yet, but how are folks there keeping warm?",

DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST Definitely the Arctic blast that's coming. Look, Victor, this might be a moot point, but winter officially begins in just over an hour across the United States, and across the northern hemisphere in fact. How But we have to look upstream from where Lucy is in Denver, and I'm going to bring you into Montana to show you exactly how cold it has been. We're talking about temperatures dropping a whopping 26 degrees in three minutes' time as this arctic cold front moved through just moments ago. That is incredible. That's coming out of Dylan, Montana, and that's basically where the cold front is located. So, we'll give you a perspective of what it looks like in Jackson, Wyoming for instance. Cold front just about to reach this location, and Denver, you heard Lucy mention it a moment ago. Could be the coldest in over 30 years. National Weather Service coming out of Denver, talking about how this will bring life threatening windchills. Well, here's the proof -- 50 degrees right now. It'll be 15 below zero by tomorrow morning. We're expecting temperatures to drop rapidly in the coming hours -- Victor.",

The culmination of more than 1,000 interviews about the attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2020 -- 2021 I should say. And why they believe the former president should be criminally liable for his role in the riots. CNN CNN's senior crime reporter Katelyn Polantz joins me now. So, what will you be paying attention to most?",

      "sentences": "Well, Victor, we had the summary on Monday that set us up to what we're looking for today. And in that summary that the House Select Committee released, they basically wrote a grand finale about their concerns and the witnesses they were paying closest attention to, and the testimony that was really most important to them.One of the areas that they said was most important was everything that they were told about president Donald Trump's desire to travel to the Capitol on January 6th because they say that all of that testimony bears on Trump's intent around what was happening in the riot that day. So that's what they're identifying as important. That seems to be an area we should be looking for. And they also point out the specific witnesses who spoke to Trump wanting to go to the White House and making that very known among White House staff and even security around them. The people that they identify as people who would have spoken about this would be Cassidy Hutchinson, Kayleigh McEnany, the Press Secretary of the White House at the time, secret service agents, other White House staff, Metropolitan Police, at least one person from that police force. But they also contrast that with what others told them, and they point out that the White House chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows wrote in a book downplaying Trump's wish to go to the White House saying it wasn't a real thing. And they do point out that there was a transcript that they have that could be released at some time from Tony Ornato who worked for Meadows at the time that Ornato was one of the people who also downplayed Trump's wish. So, they do want the public to be able to look at these transcripts and compare them. We're not exactly sure when each transcript will become available to us, but we will be looking for that. And as we're waiting for this hundreds of pages, the House Republicans are also releasing their report that is coming out now. It's largely about security failures at the Capitol around January 6th -- Victor.",

But what we are also have concern with is the fact that for almost a decade, Republicans when they were in power, gutted the funding for the IRS, and have said that they planned to do the same when they take control of the House. That is why the primary reasons we believe that this audit program was in fact broken. Because there are specialist auditors which are needed to audit tax returns of really complex individuals.One of my colleagues, Stephen Horsford talked about the fact -- and staff brought this to our attention on a number of occasions we've seen this. That regular citizens, everyday Americans get audited at a much higher rate than those millionaires and billionaires in our country. Why? Because it's easier to audit an individual who's doing a simple tax return as compared to those who use aggressive tax strategies as well as have complex taxes to review.",
