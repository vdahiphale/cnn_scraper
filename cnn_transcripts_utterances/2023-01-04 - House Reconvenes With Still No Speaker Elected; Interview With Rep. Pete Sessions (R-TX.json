He wants those talks to continue because if the vote were to happen tonight, he would almost certainly fail once again, to get the 218 votes to be elected Speaker. So they need to actually have a vote, a majority vote of the House, 218 votes are needed to adjourn. Democrats are expected to vote against it. They want another vote to let McCarthy twist in the wind. Some conservatives will look to see whether or not they decide to oppose it. But I'm told that the expectation among top Republicans that that adjournment resolution will pass tonight and they will return tomorrow. Now I just caught up with Kevin McCarthy just moments ago, and he indicated a deal is not yet within reach, but progress is being made. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

One of the things that they had asked for is to allow one individual to call for a vote to oust a sitting Speaker and Kevin McCarthy has agreed to come down to five individuals, that is down from the conference rules that require about half of the members to call for such a vote. That is one area that they're pushing for.Also, they want some key Committee assignments, including on the powerful House Rules Committee, which sets the parameters for floor debate over legislation. Those are some key issues that they have been negotiating. And it sounds like McCarthy is moving in that direction. But the concern for him is that if he moves too far in that direction, he could lose some support from some more of the moderate members who do not want him to give in too much to the right wing of the conference. So that is the balancing act of Kevin McCarthy as he negotiates with them. He has got to make sure he doesn't put off any of the other members, but they believe that they're making progress to get into 218. We'll see if they're able to do just that.",

Watch over our gathering this evening, lest we stay awake without purpose. Provide wisdom, discernment, and forbearance. Lest we eat the food of our anxious toil, and exhaust ourselves for nothing. For You have called us together from the far reaching corners of this great nation, to uphold a vision founded on our belief in the fundamental rights endowed by you, oh God, our Creator. And you have appointed each person here to represent this country's rich diversity of thought and experience, race and creed, that collectively, we would serve as a city on a Hill, a light to the world, revealing the strength and nobility to be found in our union. Remind us that we fulfill this divine mission only when we acknowledge that we are meant to function as one body. Nothing you ordain can be accomplished without the trust in and respect for each other. You have graced each of us differently, with passion and compassion, insight and oversight, voice and vote, that we would use these gifts to build up the larger body, which is these United States. Deliver us from intransigence and impedance, free us from fear and control, that in our deliberations this night, the light that shines from the dome above us would clearly reflect the commitment we each make to freedom, justice, and peace in our world.

I had an obligation and I told people, I would tell them, because it is hard to go through a hundred-page bill or a thousand-page bill, if someone doesn't tell you what has changed, because it's been vetted at the previous Committee.But with that, also the Chairman of the Rules Committee can protect that and not allow it to a point of order, which many times is important, not just to change the law, but against procedures that necessarily people want to attack it on.

They're not rooted in California, even beyond the mistrust of Kevin McCarthy and all of that, that geographically, it makes more sense.ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR OF \"INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY\": I do think that that it actually is a part of this that we haven't really talked about a lot. The distrust of McCarthy goes deeper beyond just his seeming duplicitousness of the last couple of years. I mean, he started out as a more moderate Republican and has tried to kind of move himself where the party has gone. And I think that that has mostly worked for him. But with this group, you know, I don't want to say that they're purists because I think a lot of them really honestly, it's really just about kind of giving a show of conservatism. But I think it matters to them, that McCarthy really did not come from deep red stock when he first got to Congress. So I think that's part of it. Whether or not Scalise is from the south, I mean, he could be from, you know, the West. But as long as I think his ideology is more deeply rooted in conservatism, that makes them more comfortable. I also think that he's just not named Kevin McCarthy. And that at this point, if his name were to come up, a lot of these members would vote for him, because it's an easy way to just get rid of McCarthy as an option and have another candidate. I don't think Scalise is going to have an easier time of it, but he's just more palatable at this particular time.",

I do think the smart political play for Scalise also is to do exactly what Jonah was describing, which is to sit and wait in the wings.

There is no question that it is because Kevin McCarthy doesn't want another embarrassing vote because if they don't adjourn, which might happen, there will be another vote.But it is also because there are there are movements to push somebody else. Maybe it is Scalise. Maybe it is another potential candidate for Speaker. While that is happening, we don't know how real it is, but there are talks going on behind the scenes. Chip Roy even who was on with you, Jake, yesterday, I believe, who is one of those holdouts is saying that they are so constructive that he might be able to get 10 people to come on board. Now, we have all become mathematicians in the last few days. That's still not enough, because if you have 20, and then he gets 10, he still needs to convince six other people.",

So they need to move them. So let's say they move 10 people, they still have six or seven that they need. They know they can only lose four votes and it seems to me they still aren't near the number that they need. If they lose the vote, you know, by five or 10, it doesn't matter. They lose in either case. So like I said, it sounds like they're making progress. It sounds like Chip Roy and maybe a few others are coming McCarthy's way. But we'll see. We don't know.

But we'll get a sense of what happened here. So that gives you some idea of where things are. The hope among Kevin McCarthy is that tomorrow could be the decisive day. They really feel momentum finally shifting in their direction. They believe that Congressman Chip Roy has been essential, who has been opposed to him for all these ballots so far, now is signaling potentially getting behind him after a certain number of concessions McCarthy has made further in his direction. I talked to Congressman Mike Cloud, who is a Texas Republican, someone who has opposed Kevin McCarthy through these six ballots. He told me that he is encouraged by the direction of the talks. Also Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican Leader of the House Freedom Caucus, someone who has opposed Kevin McCarthy also sounding positive, saying the talks have been encouraging so far. But still very little margin for error from McCarthy there and just showing you, they barely got the votes to simply adjourn until tomorrow, let alone to elect the next Speaker, so still significant work for McCarthy. But noon tomorrow will be a key moment. That will be the time in which Kevin McCarthy if he loses more votes, if he does not make any progress, will face even more questions about his path to the Speakership. But they hope between now and then, a deal can be iced. I asked McCarthy, can you get the deal tomorrow? He said, I don't want to put any timeframe on it.

And he also says that he believed that there are additional holdouts who might be willing to vote present. Now, of course, that is a big if. They would at first have to have these negotiations, be successful, and then all those 10 members would have to vote yes and even if that were to happen, if we were to see movement, doing the math here, that doesn't get McCarthy to 218. So he would still have a lot of work to do. But there's a lot of reason for optimism and we did see one very significant breakthrough just in the last hour or so. That is that a McCarthy aligned PAC has agreed to not play in primaries, open primaries in safe districts. That is something that conservatives have been asking for and asking for. It's a really big deal. McCarthy had resisted up until now. I mean, obviously the PAC made this deal on its own. McCarthy technically can't control spending decisions made by the PAC, but it obviously had his blessing and so conservatives see this as a big win for them. They are excited about this.

But he didn't create this kind of energy in the House, and I think that he believes he did. I think he believes that these are all just people who like him and will do whatever he wants. They're not seeing it that way right now. If anything, McCarthy actually lost one vote after Trump reissued his support this morning.Now, look, if McCarthy ends up getting a deal and becomes the speaker, Trump will claim credit. He will say he was there all along. If McCarthy loses support, Trump will be quick to support whoever looks like he's going to be the winner, because that's how Trump behaves. He goes, you know, where he sees the wind blowing. It'll be no different. This says more about McCarthy than it does about Trump, what's happening in the House right now.

He announced his candidacy in November, right after a midterms that were a disappointment for Republicans. Even when they won the House, it was by a very slim majority. They are now proceeding to make Nancy Pelosi the person that Republicans reviled over the course of the last more than a decade. They're highlighting why she was able to get stuff done and why she was effective. This is the opposite of where Republicans want to be, and Trump, you know, makes everything about himself. Yet, to your point, he's been doing nothing.

Lauren Boerbert out there getting on the floor of the House and name checking Donald Trump and essentially saying, you're wrong to back Kevin McCarthy. You should actually be asking him to withdraw from the race was a real movement and a real moment, I think, for his movement and a sign that it has diminished a bit.

He's not saying, you know, I will put somebody up against you, for instance, a primary challenger, for instance. So, he isn't going that far. But the fact that he can't even move Lauren Boebert at this point is, I think, a sign of his diminishment. I do think we should highlight that in some ways Kevin McCarthy, I think, had a better day today than he did yesterday. There are some signs that he's being able to peel some of these folks away, certainly not the never Kevin core, which is five, six, seven people, which would still be enough to block him. So, you know, the fact that they were able to get this adjournment tonight was, I think, a good sign for Kevin McCarthy. And we'll see what happens overnight with these discussions with Chip Roy.

He himself acknowledges that he said does not have a deal yet, but he does believe there has been movement. He pointed to the deal that his outside group cut with another conservative group, the Club for Growth, to essentially allow his Super Pac or ensure that a Super Pac does not engage in competitive, open primary seats that are safe Republican seats. That's a lot of words for saying that he's moving in the direction that conservatives want. He said that was a big development. He wouldn't get into other details about what they may have agreed to. I asked him whether they have agreed to the idea of what's called known on Capitol Hill's motion to vacate, which essentially to eject a sitting speaker from his position. If one member calls for such a vote, they would have to get a majority of the House to get that. That's what conservatives have been demanding. McCarthy would not say if he has come to their position on that issue or other issues such as giving them key committee assignments.But he did indicate that he is having productive discussions. He said they were going to have more discussions from tonight until tomorrow at noon. He didn't predict that he would have the votes by tomorrow at noon, but that is going to be a critical moment. Also, question is, what does Byron Donalds do, the Florida Republican, the person who has been nominated to run, the person who has been siphoning off those 20 votes to all day today, will he continue to be a candidate tomorrow? I asked McCarthy if he has asked Donalds to drop out of the race. He said no, he hasn't. But Donalds had told me earlier that he did plan to talk to McCarthy today. So that discussion will be critical to ultimately getting a resolution. McCarthy knows he has virtually no margin for error here, but they believe at the moment things are moving in their direction after days of losing vote after vote, they believe they could potentially get there as soon as tomorrow.",
