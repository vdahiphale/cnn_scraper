The IDF says its strike targeting two senior Hamas officials may have unintentionally set off weapons stored in a nearby compound, which then caused the fire. A CNN analysis of video from the scene shows Israel used U.S. made munitions. Two more strikes in Gaza have killed at least 29 people according to the Gaza health ministry, and witnesses report seeing Israeli tanks deep inside Rafah city center for the first time in this war.

That was a low court day for these jurors.But when I look at what's been reported out by the reporters that were inside that courtroom, because as you know, there haven't been cameras in the courtroom, it appears that the prosecution made a more cogent and a more persuasive argument tying in all of this essential evidence that they presented during this trial. Some of the comments from folks who heard the argument by the defense team is that it was a scattershot that Todd Blanche was all over the place, that he made inconsistent arguments, and that at times, he seemed to be making the prosecution's case. So, again, based on everything that's been reported out, I would have to go with what the pundits are saying, which is that the prosecution made a more cohesive and perhaps more compelling argument.",

Some of the evidence is just overwhelming. And Trump's defense team quite frankly didn't address during its closing arguments some of the most compelling evidence that would suggest that Trump is guilty of these charges.",

      "sentences": "Well, one of the things that Donald Trump's team did, which is still somewhat of a mystery is during the opening statements, the defense team made a big deal out of saying that Donald Trump did not have a sexual relationship with Stormy Daniels.And no one is going to believe that, the testimony that stormy Daniels gave was so compelling, she had details, the details of which would be almost impossible to make up. So, if you as a lawyer tell the jury that you're going to prove something in your opening statement, and you're not able to prove it, you will be held to account for that. So, I think that was a huge mistake and unnecessary mistake on the part of Trump's team. I think as it relates to the prosecution, the prosecution had to deal with Michael Cohen. And Michael Cohen is, you know, is a liar. He's a convicted felon. But I think the prosecution did a very good job in his summation of dealing with that, saying, look, we didn't choose him. We didn't go to like, you know, witness row and pick him out. He is a key witness in this case, because Donald Trump chose him. And he chose him for the very same reason that the Trump team is attacking him. He chose Michael Cohen because he was pretty ruthless that he would do anything to prove his loyalty to Donald Trump. So, again, prosecutors don't always choose their witnesses. And of course, anyone would have preferred a witness that didn't have the kind of baggage that Michael Cohen had. But I think jurors are smart enough to recognize that this case isn't just about Michael Cohen. It's about all of the other evidence, the testimony from Hope Hicks, the testimony from David Pecker, the written documentation that was submitted, all very compelling evidence that the jurors can rely on despite what they may think of Michael Cohen.",

A lost Caravaggio painting which was almost mistakenly auctioned at a bargain price, is now on display at a museum in Madrid after being rescued and restored. The \"Ecce Homo\" painted by the Italian master in the early 17th century is one of about 60 known Caravaggio works in existence according to the museum. The work was once part of King Philip IV's art collection. It changed hands over the years and went unnoticed, until it surfaced at an auction house as the work of an unknown painter with a starting price of just $1,600. Experts caught the mistake and kept it from being sold.Well, some lucky fans of the legendary hip hop group, Wu-Tang Clan, may get a chance to listen to the group's mysterious album, 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.' Fans would have to go to the Australian island state of Tasmania, and snag one of the limited free tickets for a private listening session at the Museum of Old and New Art next month. Wu-Tang Clan secretly recorded the album and made only one copy, kept in a hand-carved box. It was sold in 2015 for about $2 million to a former CEO, later convicted for defrauding investors. The justice department seized the album and reportedly sold it to a digital art collection or collective for about $4 million.",
