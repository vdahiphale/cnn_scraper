The Health Ministry there says more than 100 people have been killed while they were waiting for foods. The IDF releasing video from Gaza City, showing what should have been a delivery of badly needed humanitarian aid. Large numbers of people gathered around the aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire. Israel says its forces were coming under threat from the crowd. Or video taken before the trucks moved in shows a lot of people waiting in anticipation, so many desperately hungry with aid deliveries, as you will be well aware slowed to a trickle particularly in the north of the Gaza Strip. U.N. experts have repeatedly warned that the Enclave is on the brink of a famine. Paula Hancocks joins me here in the studio, and this is just breaking. We are just getting the details from the ground and it's not easy. What do we understand to have happened?",

And so what they've told us happened is that when there were hundreds of people crowded around these aid trucks desperately trying to get some food for their families. What happened, they believe is that Israeli troops and tanks opened fire, there was then panic where these aid trucks tried to escape the area. And they say that many more were killed and injured as well, because of these trucks trying to get out of this particular area. Now, we have reached out to the IDF, the Israeli military saying that they had a number of people approaching their troops. They say the troops felt under threat, which is why they did use live fire. Now we've just had, as well, a response from an Israeli government spokesperson saying that it is obviously a tragedy. But saying that they believe that many of these injuries were from when the trucks actually left the area not mentioning the live fire itself, but also pointing out it's that we're not sure of the specifics quite yet. So the details are difficult to ascertain exactly. Although we do have eyewitnesses and people on the grounds that do say to us that many lost their lives because of the Israeli gunfire that happened.",

      "sentences": "Well, the pieces seem to be actually dovetailing by and large what Israel has said is that therewas a convoy of some 30 trucks that they did open fire on them when they perceive themselves to be at threat. That's their view of it. And they opened fire also, they say at the legs of people, which then apparently obviously cause people to fall, it causes panic. It causes people to try to run away, it causes the trucks to try to back out. This is what they're all saying including a CNN reporter on the ground, who was just quoted by our colleague in Israel just now who was at the scene when it happened. This, you know, is absolutely classic occurrence as awful and ghoulish as it is when you have actually starved an Enclave of 2.3 million people for the last four to five months. And remember, October 9, 2023, Yoav Gallant, the Defense Minister of Israel said that there will be a complete siege of all basic humanitarian necessities into Gaza while this counter offensive was on. We know that according to the Head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, according to the Head of UNRWA Philippe Lazzarini, both of whom told me this week on our program, that the amount of aid into Gaza has halved, hasn't doubled. It's halved over the last month. That means that hundreds of thousands of people they say, are at risk of starvation, and there is a looming famine in Northern Gaza. So when the first 30 or so trucks get to Northern Gaza, what does anybody expect? Of course, people are going to rush to it. I specifically asked Jan Egeland and he explained and he described what happened when he brought trucks in earlier this week. He was inside Rafah, he explained the situation very, very clearly that they brought trucks in, it was a rare allowing to bring them in from Rafah. And that people yes, once they got into the Gaza Strip did start to run after them. Why? Because they want to feed their families, feed their grandmothers, their children, their nephews, their nieces, their sisters who are hungry, and so this is entirely dependent on Israeli security, they are 100 percent the only force in charge of security inside Gaza. So therefore, the security operation has to be maintained and because they bombed so many of the police stations, so many of the infrastructures. There is very little security, Becky.",

The Hamas militants have food and they are in tunnels. They had nothing to do with the people that we ate. The chaos yes, around the aid line is becoming worse and worse, because there's so little aid coming in today. I'm pretty shaken actually, from what I saw, the minute we crossed the border from, you know, orderly and sparsely populated Sinai, you see the aid trucks going full speed down the road, being chased by gangs of youth who jumped the trump, the trucks and before eyes, loot mattresses and blankets, food, et cetera to the desperate people outside who want to get some aid.

I'll just give you one more anecdote. The Head of UNRWA told me on this program this week, that in the north, they are even running out of animal fodder, and I said, excuse me animal fodder, he said, animal fodder because that's what people are being reduced to eating.

I think since we first started reportingthis, and it's 9:30 in the morning here in Washington, we have not yet heard from the White House or the State Department about this incident, we have reached out to both for their reaction. I imagine they're putting together statements now that will come out in the coming hours. But I imagine what we're going to hear, Becky, is something along the lines of what we have heard before that the U.S. believes that the civilian death toll has been far too high in Gaza, and that more humanitarian aid needs to get into Gaza, whether there's any kind of condemnation of the actions of the Israeli military that certainly remains to be seen. And it will be a big question. But Becky, they're certainly going to emphasize the need for a pause in the fighting for this humanitarian pause for the ceasefire, the truce, whatever you want to call it, that the U.S. has been pushing alongside Egypt and Qatar, mediating with Israel and Hamas. That deal that the U.S. so desperately wants to put in place, of course, is not just about getting Israeli hostages released, or getting to a pause in the fighting, which of course, more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, would love to see. It's also about getting humanitarian aid to those Gazans who so desperately needed. Currently, as our colleagues have been laying out, all of that humanitarian aid is coming in through two crossings in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, Rafah and Kerem Shalom, it is not just a question of the quantity of aid that is going in which by the way, the U.S. says is far too low. It's also that aid getting to where it needs to be. And the U.S. has been critical of Israel for not allowing that aid to get to where it needs to go for de conflicting, as they say, with those aid agencies, with those truck drivers. It is impossible for those truck drivers to get that aid north where this incident took place today when so much of the infrastructure, the roads have been damaged when there is still ongoing fighting and bombing that those truck drivers have to contend with. So I imagine you will see some kind of forceful statements from the Biden administration today. But it really will emphasize the need for this ceasefire that they have been negotiating. That has been showing some signs of progress but now maybe in jeopardy. We have heard a senior Hamas official earlier today, saying that this does threaten those ceasefire talks. At the same time, I could see it actually speeding them up because of the added emphasis this horrible incident, really highlighting the need to get to this pause in the fighting, Becky.",

You know, we don't need more footage than this to show the level of desperation that we're finding in the north, especially after yesterday Kamal Adwan Hospital, which was near the incident that happened yesterday, said that fuel shortages are ending. And you know, operations about to end in Kamal Adwan, which is only partially operational, and other patients will die. So of course, appalled the deliberate targeting of civilians violates international law and our shared humanity really. And you know, rather than circumventing international responsibilities under the guise of humanitarian aid, you know, there needs to be a concerted effort to end the state of impunity, this event is not isolated. And it's not the first time and it's indicative of a pattern, you know, similar justification of sensing danger have been used in the past by Israeli authorities in the West Bank, when there's unarmed civilians being killed, especially in the case of --- for example, where the officer was acquitted. And he says danger from an autistic disabled child who was going to his school and was unarmed. And sensing danger was why the officer had shot him. So you know this attack only exacerbate an already critical humanitarian crisis and blockade that Israel's imposed on the entire strip. And, you know, reports from journalists on the ground, including firsthand accounts are indicating that victims were targeted directly in the head and the chest. And there are also reports that this really -- does the grading of the bodies of victims. Now, nothing is verified yet. And investigation, I'm sure will be, you know, held and ongoing. But you know, this is -- it's, again, it's not a tragic event. The unfolding tragedy in Gaza is just a reminder on the need to address the root causes, you know, of this conflict and this impunity. And you know attacks on health and the reduction of aid, because of Israeli restrictions are unacceptable.
