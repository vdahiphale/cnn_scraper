President Biden is headed to a crucial swing state as he looks to amplify his State of the Union message and battlegrounds across the country. We're going to have new reporting on his campaign plans.Plus, breaking news this morning. Donald Trump just posted a nearly $92 million bond in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Where do you come up with the cash? And does he have enough left to pay that $454 million judgment in the New York fraud case. And TikTok boom. TikTok users are outraged and with the help of a lobbying campaign bombarding lawmakers with calls after the House advanced a bill that could ban TikTok across the country. We'll tell you what's its stake for the social media platform and roughly 170 million Americans who use it. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. First up, I'll have what he's having. That's the feeling among Democrats today after Joe Biden's fiery and energetic performance, campaign kickoff in the form of a State of the Union address.

Finding that Trump defamed her when he denied her allegations of rape and made some other statements.Now that the bond is more than the judgment because he has to put up more money for interest because it will be held in by the court until the appeals process is over. So, this a big question of been where would Donald Trump get this money? The company underwriting the bond is Chubb. It's an American insurance company well-known business. So, they have put up the bond. And then you can actually see on the bond Donald Trump signature. He signed this bond on Tuesday of this week, even as he was asking the judge overseeing this case for more time to put the financing together. So now this chapter is closed for now, assuming the judge approves this bond. But it does raise questions about how Donald Trump is going to come up with the next big judgment he's facing. He has a little more than two weeks to come up with $454 million. That's a satisfy the judgment in the New York Attorney general's civil fraud case. They did appeal to one judge who said that they would not give him more time. Trump is now bringing this up to a panel of judges at the New York appeals court. They will then decide whether to give him an extension or additional time. But until then, the deadline for this as the -- is about two weeks away. Source tells us that the appeals court is expected to reach their decision around the same time, which by the way is also in jury selection will begin in the New York criminal case that Trump is facing and 34 counts of falsified business records.
