Some of the fighter jets flying low with their after burners on at times.So unusually we're able to see them. We can see them on the bombing sorties, coming in, flying low, and then pulling up and turning away. And after they've done that, we've seen big, yellow flashes of bright light on the horizon, illuminating the horizon. The whole sky seemingly lit up with these big flashes. And following that, huge detonations, missile after missile after missile landing on Gaza. That's been in the past couple of hours. Before that it was heavy, sustained rounds of tank fire being fired out from very closely here, from a few hundred feet away from here, fired into Gaza. Again, this is something that we have not been experiencing over the past few weeks. The intensity this evening I would say even stronger than last night. Those rounds of artillery -- outgoing, shaking this house. So what we are witnessing tonight I think is the further evidence of this bigger build-up, this shaping the ground for this next phase of the operation of a larger incursion. Troops already in Gaza. But what we're seeing from here this evening is the support effects, the tank fire, the artillery strikes, the missile strikes, taking out those Hamas positions. But as we've been able to see from the video coming out of Gaza tonight and what we saw last night, as well, those huge impacts that we feel here absolutely shattering the silence and the darkness in the cities behind us there, Wolf.

So with a lot of blood on their hands. The Hamas also wanted unlimited fuel supplies for its fighters and it wanted a cease-fire. Now, you understand a cease-fire for Israel is death. Ceasefire means that Hamas gets away with mass murder. It means we can't restore our security, we can't restore our deterrence power in the region, we're finished. So we couldn't accept that. But as the forces, the Israeli forces move into Gaza slowly and encircle Hamas, Hamas is going to have to use those hostages as sort of a get-out-of-jail free card. They could pull what -- you remember this, what Yasser Arafat did in Beirut in 1982. They'll say, ok, let us out of here and we'll go to -- we'll go to Algeria or something, and we'll give you the hostages.

The amount of Palestinian civilian casualties will shoot very, very high up.On the other hand, many Israelis, especially the families of these 222 Israelis who are held hostages are saying why should we give food and fuel to the Palestinians when they won't let us know who they have as hostages. They won't let the Red Cross in to see them. By opening those corridors we're basically giving up the last leverage we have to find out about our loved ones. So very difficult calls for the Israeli government. And I'm not representing the government now. You know, Wolf, I would say in the long run it's to Israel's benefit because if we -- you don't have that type of humanitarian corridor, you're going to have increasing international pressure on us for a cease-fire which would, as I said before, would be disastrous for us.

They're actually calling it the American strategy which is you target a certain neighborhood or a village, you bomb that village to clear it out the best you can, you move forces in there, and then you establish that village as a bridge head to the next village or to the next neighborhood. So it's not a mass of soldiers, moving in as we did in 2014. Remember, we moved the army, all at one time, we suffered a tremendous amount of casualties.

There's a certain debate going on here, I've been part of that debate whether Israel should have attacked Hezbollah first. Hezbollah has 15 times as many rockets as Hamas has. They have bigger rockets, they're more accurate rockets, they have a terrorist force that has been massacring Syrians for the last ten years. Very, very dangerous. They're the same people, they do the same thing to our people up north, what Hamas did to our people in the south.

He was brought on to tell Evangelicals that they could trust Trump, that Trump was one of their guys. And evangelicals went along with it, and then they didn't need Pence. Once they had decided that Trump was their guy, Pence almost made himself obsolete. And so I do think that that has sort of -- he's kind of, you know -- all of his purpose has been served.
