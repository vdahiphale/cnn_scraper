There's no news about five of my members. We found out last week that my aunt has been pronounced dead and found along the border with the Gaza. I still have a half cousin who was in that community. We have not heard from him as well. He's still missing. His name is Ravid Katz. And it's been really challenging times for all of us. For family, for a nation, for Jewish people around the world. Just yesterday I talked to my community in Los Angeles via Zoom, and we talked about all of that grief and how challenging those times are for us as a nation. The fact that we're still looking for any kind of relief, any kind of news, are they well, are they not well, are they still alive, these are day-to-day and hour-by-hour struggle. It's not easy, not for me, not for my family, not for anybody out there who has a missing and kidnapped people with Hamas. We just don't know anything.",

This evening, those candidates are expected to make their pitches to their Republican colleagues in a candidate forum before an expected closed door vote tomorrow.CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox joins us now live from Capitol Hill.

That magic number of 217.What you can expect is that tonight there will be a candidate forum. It is the first opportunity for those nine Republicans to make their pitch to their colleagues as to why they think that they should get the speaker's gavel. Tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. the voting begins. It will be behind closed doors first. This is an opportunity for Republicans to choose their speaker designee. There have already been two times that they have chosen both Steve Scalise, then Jim Jordan in the closed door room. After they emerge, though, neither one of those candidates were able to clinch the votes that they needed to become the actual speaker. So, the next two days are going to be this process to try to find that person. And while Representative Tom Emmer, who's the Republican whip, is certainly probably the frontrunner given the fact that he has the endorsement of Kevin McCarthy, given the reality that he has experience in leadership, there is a thirst and a hunger from a lot of hardliners that they do not want to see the status quo continue. That likely means they're going to be looking and have their eye on someone else, perhaps Byron Donalds or another one of the hardline Republicans who are running, hoping that they can get the 217 they need on the floor. Again, it is such a difficult margin because you can only afford to lose a handful of Republican members. Just about four members, Phil.",

I mean, what Israel is suggesting to those countries, but also to the Palestinians, we would basically expel you, millions probably, and this is a definition of ethnic cleansing. If you are allowing refugees to exit but never to enter to the land they belong to, you are basically creating a massive refugee crisis. So, a country that is already paying the price of other refugee crisis.So, the only alternative that they are trying to ask the administration, pressure Israel to create basically a place where, if you really care about human life, and the sanctity of human life, and international law as well, Israel is the ultimate power that can determine what - what to do with, you know, refugees. Maybe movement. If they really care, move them somewhere else, but guarantee that they would come back home. If they really care about distinction between Hamas, which is 30,000 or 40,000, but there's 2 million people.
