Kevin, what do we know about this meeting? I take it there will be cameras in there. We eventually will get the tape from the top of the meeting. Is that right?",

And I think it shows that the president is trying to bring this team together in a way that reinforces his view of the next four months.We're now today exactly four months from when the next president will be inaugurated, but President Biden making clear, at least for now, that he is the one in the Oval Office and that he does have a number of things that he still wants to achieve. Of course, the president is looking to his legacy, to things like the Inflation Reduction Act, to the infrastructure bill, and ensuring that those pieces of legislation are finalized in some ways. In some ways, the money has been relatively slow going out the door. That's to be expected. Of course, it's a lot of money, and they wanted to ensure that it wasn't used in a fraudulent way. But now, in the president's mind, is the time for this money to really start being spent, for some of these proposals and projects to start getting under way so that, when he leaves office, that there is this robust package of items that he can point to and say that he accomplished while he's in office. There are other areas, of course, where the president is still working to enforce his legacy. And I'm thinking of the Middle East in particular, trying to bring that conflict to an end. Prospects now seem dim of a cease-fire agreement, at least while the president is in office. That has been something that he has been very intently focused on now that he is no longer running for president. So, you see all of these areas where the president is trying to focus himself and his team in the run-up to the election.",

We will get back to the White House once that Cabinet meeting videotape begins to feed in and we will show it to our viewers as we get it. We are now some 46 days away from Election Day here in the United States. Absentee ballots, by the way, are scheduled to go out in the battleground state of North Carolina later today. And now there's a major new scandal involving the Tar Heel State's Republican nominee for governor, the current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. A new CNN KFILE investigation, as you know, uncovered dozens of inflammatory posts he wrote on a porn site message board more than a decade ago calling himself -- and I'm quoting him now -- a \"black Nazi,\" calling for slavery to be reinstated and ridiculing Martin Luther King Jr. Robinson has denied making those comments. CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona is here with us. Former Trump campaign communications director and Republican strategist Erin Perrine is with us as well. Erin, could Mark Robinson be a drag on Trump's campaign efforts to win the critically important battleground state of North Carolina?",

Vance are at the top of the ticket, because they are those things, but the rest of the Republican candidates who they have put up for voters to choose. And the comments that Mark Robinson has made in the past and whatKFILE has uncovered are just disgusting. They're indecent. They're gross. And it demonstrates how out of the mainstream and how out of touch Mark Robinson is, along with the rest of the MAGA Republican Party, starting with Donald Trump on down, are with what mainstream America wants and deserves. And I think it also goes to the really smart and compelling message that the Harris campaign is putting out there in terms of, it's time to just turn the page on this silliness, on this divisiveness. And it is silly and it is divisive, but it's also dangerous, because those kinds of comments puts targets on the backs of vulnerable communities.",

I won't be surprised if it's along the lines of \"I don't know what's going on with that.' But I would expect to see Republicans all across North Carolina try and put some distance between themselves. Whether or not they're calling for Robinson to step down, which at this point it is too late in the cycle to do so, or whether they're going to actively say it or not, they will likely put space between themselves, even if they believe what the lieutenant governor has said that these are not true, or if they believe the KFILE reporting. Because, at this point, he was already down in the ballot, and it's not going to help you to be seen with someone where all of this is in the news on them.",

Oops, no, we don't, because it happened after the Supreme Court got rid of Roe v. Wade. And what we have seen, and it is very active right now, very energetic, huge mobilization on this issue, is that women and men, swing voters can go into the booth with more than one thought on their minds. The economy is important, but what I have heard so many Republican women tell me, Wolf, is, you know, Maria, the economy is coming back. I'm feeling better about where I am economically, but if my rights are gone, they are not going to come back. And I refuse to raise my daughter in a country that has -- where she has less rights than I did. It's incredibly compelling, the story that was on TV for so many millions to see last night. There was not a dry eye from people who watched that, is going to have that gut punch of this is not the country that we want to raise daughters in, that we want to raise our families in.

But I don't believe that those in the firearm-owning community in the United States are necessarily buying this pro-Second Amendment language that Kamala Harris is using now, given that previously she was in favor of mandatory buybacks. And when I have heard her speak previously about what she would do to try and lessen firearm casualties in the United States, she doesn't seem to have really a full grasp on how the background check system works in the United States, let alone how the gun show -- quote, unquote -- \"gun show loophole\" works when it comes to being able to address this. So my first question to Kamala Harris is, what firearms do you own? What kind of shooter are you? Are you enjoying it for sport or is it for personal protection? Because being able to understand what kind of firearms she owns, I think, could be actually a more persuasive part of this argument for maybe swing, moderate, low-propensity firearm owners.",
