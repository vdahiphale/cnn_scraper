I'm Jake Tapper at the Republican National Convention here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the state of our union is on edge.We are learning more this hour about the shocking assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally yesterday afternoon. Multiple sources are telling CNN that authorities found explosive materials inside the car and the residence of the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by the U.S. Secret Service after he fired upon former President Trump. Also, crucial new information, the shooter was flagged by local law enforcement before the shooting because he was acting suspiciously around the security check outside the rally. So far, investigators have not found any initial signs, no social media or other writings that would help provide motive for his sick and twisted act. Trump has said he was shot in the upper part of his right ear. He was examined at a hospital and released. One person attending the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally was killed in the attack. Two others remain in critical condition. Right now, law enforcement agencies are briefing President Biden in the Situation Room on all the latest, a senior White House official tells CNN. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now to break it all down. And, Evan, it sounds as though this man was immediately on law enforcement's radar upon his arrival to the rally?",

It's about an hour from the venue where this -- the former president was holding a rally and where this shooting occurred yesterday. One of the things that are -- we know the law enforcement is doing is trying to put together a picture of this shooter. How long has he been planning this? What was his motivation? And, as you pointed out Jake, not a lot is emerging. Certainly, he doesn't seem to have a social media footprint. We know that the company that operates Discord, this chat group online, says that he had an account, but, again, not a lot of information there coming out as to what might provide an idea of his motivation. We know that, according to his online registration, he was a Republican or he registered as a Republican. But we also found that, at 17 years old, he made donations to a Democratic-linked group, so, again, a complicated picture of a young man who's 20 years old. What we know also is that this was an AR-15-style firearm that was used, a rifle. He was seen beforehand, Jake, near the magnetometers. The police believed that he was acting suspiciously. So they thought they were going to keep an eye on him. Apparently, they did warn this to Secret Service. And then the next thing we know, according to witnesses, is, he is seen on that rooftop. And that's when you see -- some of the social media, you can see and hear from some of the witnesses raising the alarms, trying to get the attention of law enforcement about the presence of the shooter on that rooftop, which is about 500 feet from where the former president was speaking. We know also that, in the search after the shooting, they found explosive material in his car. They also found it at the residence. Jake, he wasn't carrying any I.D. So one of the ways they were able to identify him initially was because of the firearm, which was traced back to his father. We also know that, at this stage, they're trying to go through witnesses. They're trying to talk to his family members, his employer, all of that to try to put together a picture of how long he's been planning this attack on the former president at that rally, Jake.",

BOB CASEY (D-PA):  Well, Jake, this is a terribly sad 24 hours for our commonwealth and our country. And we're just grateful that, despite the fact that we lost a Pennsylvania to this horrific shooting and that we have two in the hospital, that -- that President Trump is OK. We're thankful for that. We thank God this wasn't worse, but it was -- it was -- it was horrific that this happened in our commonwealth.

Remember, many of them travel with him all the time. They see the protocols that go into place. They believe that, if any circumstances had been different on that stage, Donald Trump could have been killed. Shaken because many of his senior advisers weren't actually with him on the ground. They were in Milwaukee getting ready for the convention, meaning that some of them were actually learning the details at the same time a lot of us were because of the security around the former president. You acknowledged some of that in a statement that we saw from Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles out to some of these campaign aides, essentially saying that they were beefing up security, that people shouldn't be afraid, but if they were in D.C. or the West Palm Beach area, that they should stay away from those offices. Now, when it comes to defiance, we often hear this word thrown around when it comes to Donald Trump, but I will tell you, Jake, seeing more resolve, an actual resolve from the former president's team around this election after this defining moment. From Donald Trump himself, we heard a message this morning and it was one asking for the country to be united. Here's what he said in a statement on TRUTH Social. He said: \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed. In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand united and show our true character as Americans, remaining strong and determined and not allowing evil to win.\" And, as you noted, we expect Donald Trump to keep the same schedule. He's expected to be on the ground in Milwaukee later today. Obviously, Jake, this is still a very fluid situation. And they are learning some of these security details at the same time or even from media reports.",

First of all, Dave, you were at the front row of that rally. And, in fact, just minutes before the shooting began, former President Trump gave you a shout-out, said he was going to have you come up on stage. How are you doing? How's your family? DAVID MCCORMICK (R), PENNSYLVANIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  You know, it was -- it was one of these moments where he actually -- I saw him beforehand, and he was very upbeat and excited about the rally because it had such a big turnout. And then he got on the stage and I think he was thinking about that. So he said, in front of the whole audience: \"Dave McCormick, I want you to come up right now.\" So I started to walk up onto the stage. He said: \"No, no, I will have you up in a little bit.\" And then the shooting started a minute or two later. And so, had he not changed his mind, I think I would have been up on that stage. And it was one of these surreal moments where you have -- you're watching and, all of a sudden, you hear this staccato of shots. And it was pretty clear somewhat quickly that it was a rifle. And the president went down behind the podium, and the Secret Service was on top of him. And then, all of a sudden, they were up and ushering him out. And you saw this fist come out of the group with sort of defiance and reassurance and leadership and him yelling \"USA.\" And then, over my shoulder, it was -- all of a sudden became clear that someone else had been shot a few rows behind me and was in the prone position on the bleachers, with people trying to administer first aid and stop the bleeding. And so you had these -- on one -- to one side of me the president being ushered off the stage, the other trying to get medical care to this poor man who had -- innocent bystander who had been shot, and not knowing whether the shooting was over. You know, I thought, originally, there were two shooters, because there were so many shots. And we didn't know for some time whether it was over or what was going on. And it was -- obviously, in a crisis like this, it's confusing. And you need to stay calm and try to sort things out and be in a position to help people if they need it.

And I would have -- I think that climate certainly probably contributed to what happened yesterday, although it's an environment that is somehow sanctioning violent -- violent behavior. And I think it's a responsibility for all of us to -- we have a big conflict. We have a conflict of ideas. President Biden and the Democratic Party, in my opinion, and I think in many Republicans', are taking the country in a direction that is not good for America. And we think, as Republicans, that we have a vision that's much better than that. And we need to have a real debate and fight and argument, conflict about the right direction of the country. But it need not be dehumanizing. It need not lead to violence. And, in fact, it can't. And my -- the baseline of my experience is, I was a platoon leader in the 82nd Airborne Division, and I had a young man from Alabama and I had an African-American man from Newark in my platoon. I had a platoon sergeant from Puerto Rico. I don't remember ever talking about religion or politics. We were just Americans in support of a common mission. And whatever differences we have, and they are profound, the differences are profound, they are small in the context of we're Americans first. And so I hope we can see a dialing back of that rhetoric. And I certainly am going to try to do my part in being a strong voice for where I think the country should go, but also one that speaks out against violent -- violent rhetoric that contributes to the horror we saw yesterday.",

That's the most cheerful thing I have heard in 24 hours.I think, provisionally, what these details tell us about the shooter is that this was a highly organized person who was involved in an expansive plan. Like, to obtain those materials, to weaponize them into some sort of explosive devices or to be in that process, all of this stuff takes time and it takes decisions long before the rally yesterday. So it gives us some insight that this was a very premeditated, well- planned action, one that probably included some sort of attack beyond just the shooting, the attempted -- the shooting of the president. We don't know. He may have intended those devices to go off remotely or in other places. But, nevertheless, he spent the time and effort necessary to obtain those materials, to deploy them in some way. You have them in two separate locations there. At least in the car, that seems more like a deployment than just a storage issue. And so it kind of paints a better picture about this individual. It also, I think, elevates the chances that he may have been working with someone else, or at least that someone in his orbit may have had some idea of what he was doing, because, again, that planning cycle takes time. It usually provides opportunities for communication to share your plans or your intentions with other people. So I would expect that the investigators are really focusing now on his communications with others, social media, anything he may have written or notes or manifestos, things like that, that may be around the house and in his vehicle. It really opens up a lot of additional avenues for investigation.",

Were they using drones to be able to cover the outer perimeter to see whether or not there was any kind of threat? The Secret Service, the FBI, the local police, State Police, everyone's going to have a conversation around this to find out what happened, because that event took place yesterday.

So the moral clarity that I think all leaders can have and all columnists and all analysts and everyone is that, whatever our disagreements and even, honestly, Jake, fears about whether Trump is president or Biden remains president, that violence can be condemned. And so what I hope -- you're looking for silver linings at this stage, because this is not just historic -- it's very scary, what could have happened yesterday -- is that one hopes that what we can unify around is the condemnation of violence -- we can disagree as much as we want -- as part of that democratic discourse, whether it comes from the right or the left, whether it's nurtured by the head of a party or it's nurtured by commentators on TV.

Does the country set aside its differences? Does the country say we all need to come together, this is horrible, but being American is more important than any of these divisions or not? When I hear something like Democratic Governor Shapiro, who just gave a really great set of remarks, he didn't shy away from the fact that the man who was killed was a strong Trump supporter. And that doesn't matter, because he was an American, and his family is going to be missing somebody at the dinner table. I mean, that, to me, feels like the kind of unifying thing, right? And then you open up that phone, you look on social media, and you see -- it's like lifting up a rock and you see the spiders all crawling out. And I just -- I worry that -- I hope that our nation is up to the task of dealing with this moment, and I'm worried very much that we might not be.",
