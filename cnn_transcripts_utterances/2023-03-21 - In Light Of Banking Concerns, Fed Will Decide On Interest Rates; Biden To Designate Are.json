Are the markets responding this morning? Well, it's been about the same all-day look. They're slightly up since trading opened just about an hour ago.

Kind of kowtowing the Wall Street. That's the last thing that the Biden administration wants to be seen as doing. On the other hand, if they do hike, and it's a strong hike, then, you know, we may start to see more dominoes fall. And that's where we are. I mean, we are really at a pendulum shift.

I mean, it makes it easier to buy things when rates are low. I'm not saying that that's not the case. It buoys (ph) stocks that makes us feel richer. But it also is kind of a blanket that covers risk, right?And risk is like water, it eventually finds its way out and that tends to happened when rates go up and they're going to have to. Now, we can do it slowly, and I think the Fed has done a pretty good job of that. You know, you could argue that they got a little bit behind inflation, but I think they've been pretty slow and steady. And, you know, one of the things I wonder about with the Silicon Valley Bank story is we have had a message that rates were going to be going up for some time. I mean, why didn't the management of that bank get that message? And who else is playing this game of shorter-term profitmaking and, you know, ignoring longer-term risks?",

And so, you know, folks that tend to have a more conservative approach may be rewarded a bit more.
