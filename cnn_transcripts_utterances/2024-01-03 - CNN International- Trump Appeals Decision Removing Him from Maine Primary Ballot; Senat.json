Now she is a Democrat but it's Maine's policy that the first stop for questions about whether someone is eligible to appear on the ballot, go to the Secretary of State.But in the filing tonight, Trump's lawyers insist that she was, quote, a biased decision maker who should have accused herself, had no legal authority, made multiple errors of law, and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Her decision was based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Now, this particular piece of the Constitution and who should enforce it, this has been litigated across multiple states over the past several months, and we've seen differing outcomes. Now, most of the states, except for Colorado and Maine, have opted to keep Trump on the ballot, but those states mostly did so based on procedural grounds. They didn't get into the merits of the argument. But that leaves the door open for this to continue to be litigated through the 2024 election. Now, we're also still waiting for Trump to file his appeal on the Colorado decision. That appeal is expected to go to the Supreme Court. The Republican Party of Colorado has already filed an appeal there, but it is expected that Trump will also appeal that decision. And what's clear is the Supreme Court just has to weigh in here, give some clarity on who the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment applies to, who is supposed to enforce it. And there is a desire by many parties and states to have some clarity on this before Super Tuesday. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Ed Lavandera reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: On Wednesday, a group of Republican lawmakers, including the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, will tour the border here in Eagle Pass and get a briefing from state authorities. Of course, Eagle Pass has really become the flashpoint of the border migration crisis that we've seen unfold for months and months now. Lawmakers here will be visiting from the House side. This, as Senate lawmakers, Democrat and Republican, have been negotiating through the holiday break, trying to come to terms on the framework and a possible deal in a border security bill. Senator Chris Murphy says that it is not likely that a deal will be in place by next week, but that they hope that there will be some sort of progress made, that they will be able to update each side, Republicans and Democrats, on what kind of deals and issues might come up in this border bill. Republicans are pushing for more expedited removals of migrants who cross illegally, as well as pushing the Biden administration to adopt something similar to a Title 42 plan that they believe was used to keep migrants from crossing the border. Of course, that has been very controversial. And many Democrats say Title 42 did not work as well as Republicans like to think it did. But those are some of the issues that both sides are continuing to work through. Here in Eagle Pass, where we have seen over the last few weeks large numbers of migrants crossing. In fact, according to Homeland Security statistics, in the month of December, more than 225,000 crossings were seen along the U.S. southern border. But in recent days, it has slowed down dramatically here in Eagle Pass. Ed Lavandera, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is with that overarching consideration in mind that we have accepted Gay's resignation. Harvard leadership wrote, adding: We do so with sorrow. Conservative media had been unearthing multiple examples of plagiarism in Gay's past works, including an entire paragraph being lifted almost verbatim in her 1997 PhD dissertation without citation.
