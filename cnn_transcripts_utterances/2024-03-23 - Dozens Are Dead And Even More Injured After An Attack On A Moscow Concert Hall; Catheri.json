But what this really marks is the end of a tumultuous process on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers we're sprinting up into the deadline multiple times passing these short extensions to get to this point. And we saw Kevin McCarthy lose his job over his handling of government funding back in October. Speaker Mike Johnson now faces a threat from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene over his handling of the appropriations process. And from a broader perspective, what we really saw is how difficult it is to fund the federal government in a divided Congress. Republicans have a very narrow majority in the House, Democrats control the Senate. It was always going to be a showdown. But Republicans tried to pass a number of partisan measures that were going to go nowhere in the Senate. So this really set up painstaking negotiations to get to this point.

And they're slaving -- they're putting Ukraine as a leading suspect in at least supporting the attacks.Because if it's true that the FSB, the Russian Security Services, knew that a plot was in the making, and failed to stop this, then what does that say about Vladimir Putin's ability to keep his own people safe? It might posit the argument that Russia is too focused on the war in Ukraine when there's a threat much closer to home. And the FSB has done in recent weeks that it stopped various ISIS plots. So it seems let this one through. BLACKWELL: Kimberly, it's almost unthinkable, especially here in the U.S. that an event like this would happen. 115 people would be dead.

So it seems that no matter who was actually responsible, Russia wants to turn this to its advantage, blame it on Kyiv, and somehow take the responsibility away from Putin for failing to keep his people safe. BLACKWELL: So ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack in Iran early this year. They've now acclaimed responsibility for this. What, if any, threat is there to the U.S.?

But what U.S. intelligence officials have been more worried about at this point is inspiring attacks, ISIS-inspiring lone wolves inside the U.S. to carry something out.

So abdominal surgery could be many of the organs in the abdominal cavity, the liver, the pancreas, the gallbladder, the spleen, the intestines, the colon, but also the reproductive organs, the uterus, the ovaries, the cervix. And so all of that maybe is included. And what that means is -- is unclear. We certainly see an increased rate of cancer, unfortunately, in people under the age of 50 and under the age of 40. We see this continuing to rise, especially with colon cancer.We see with the cervical cancer as well. There's been a decreased rate of cervical cancer in women in their 20s who were sort of this first wave to get the HPV vaccine. But beyond 20, 30s and 40s and 50s, we still see slight increases in cervical cancer. And again, this human papilloma vaccine, the HPV vaccine, 90% protects you from cervical cancer. And men as well would need to get the vaccine because they can transmit the virus to their wives or their partners and increase their risk of cervical cancer. Of course, I'm not saying it's cervical cancer, but this is part of all that perhaps she is describing when she says abdominal cavity, lots of things in the abdomen, the pancreas as well.",

You can mix any number of things without knowing exactly which type of cancer it is. It's unclear what kind of chemotherapy she's receiving.But chemotherapy in itself has toxicities, has side effects. And so we may be able to expect a change in her appearance depending on what she is getting infused, including hair loss. It causes an incredible amount of fatigue in many people as the cells are destroyed because normal cells are also destroyed in addition to the cancerous cells. And you become incredibly tired while your body tries to regenerate these new cells. You can get mouth ulcers. And so it may be that we can expect a change in her appearance.

Once you get up into upstate New York, also the green and white mountains, that's why you've got these winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories for more than half a dozen states.You've also got some spread out for the next system that's set to arrive along the northern tier of the country. That's going to arrive later on tomorrow. Flood watches along the coast of Boston, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia. You're looking at all rain from this system. So we're talking about two to four inches total there. The good news is this system moves out by the time we get to the latter half of the weekend. So Sunday is going to be much drier. Quite a different story in the central U.S. where Sunday is really going to be the trouble day, especially the central portion here. You can see that low pressure system making its way from the Dakotas, Nebraska in towards the Midwest by Monday. And we're talking a lot of snow with this. For some of these cities, they could end up getting more the next few days than they did in all of winter.",
