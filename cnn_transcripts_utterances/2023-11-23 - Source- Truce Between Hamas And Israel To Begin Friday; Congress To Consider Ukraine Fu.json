      "sentences": "Crucially, the delay here that seems to be for about 24 hours -- perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less -- does not look like it endangers the deal itself. Every expectation is that the deal moves forward. It's purely a question of timing.And the expectation from Israel's National Security Council is that this could begin as soon as tomorrow. Now, whether that means there's a pause in fighting at midnight that allows the hostages to be released, or at 10 in the morning, or noon, or sometime after that -- that remains to be seen. We're waiting for an announcement from Qatar on when the pause begins and effectively, the deal begins taking shape and we see hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons. The delay was over what were called final logistical details. As we understand it, that's the locations and the routes which the prisoners will take out of Gaza. And because this has to be worked out in very fine detail the agreement was made between Israel, Qatar, and Egypt to simply delay the implementation of the agreement so those details could be hammered out and so that nothing is being rushed at the last second. Of course, Max, that makes it very difficult on the families who are waiting to find out if their names are on the list and if they're coming out. But this is the process. In fact, the IDF even cautioned yesterday that it wasn't finalized and to wait to see when there is an official announcement. So we're waiting for that here.",

It's absolutely excruciating for them, isn't it, just waiting for the list and then obviously having to see other hostages probably released ahead of theirs.But in terms of the lucky families, if I can call them that -- the ones who have hostages being released -- how would it look?

Now, whether that's through the Rafah border crossing, which would take them through Egypt into Israel, or straight into Israel through one of the other border crossings -- that remains to be seen.From the Red Cross, it will go -- the hostages, that is, will go to the IDF. The IDF will then bring them to the hospitals where there -- where they'll be examined. And either immediately upon release and entry into Israel, they'll meet their families. For the younger hostages or for the hostages above the age of 12, their families will be waiting for them at the hospitals -- a moment they have waited for nearly even weeks at this point. That's the expectation on how this plays out on the ground.",

Thank you so much for joining us. First of all, your reaction to Qatar's announcement. We've had this delay. It's so painful, isn't it, for the families to see that? We still don't know who is on the list for people to be released and we still don't actually have a time for when they will be released. What do you make of all of this -- its handling and the reality that they are dealing with massive logistical issues? JODI RUDOREN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE FORWARD, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. I mean, like everything else in this horrible, horrible situation and horrible war it is complicated to -- there are many moving parts. There's the release of the hostages, the release of the Palestinian prisoners, the pause in the actual fighting, the protections against Hamas kind of regrouping under the pause. And, of course, the influx -- the bringing in of aid into Gaza during the pause. So there are a lot of things to be worked out. There are multiple parters -- parties. Israel does not directly negotiate with Hamas nor does the United States. So it is complicated and there are many logistical things that could disrupt it. So we're hoping, I think, all that -- this pause -- this one-day pause that seems to be happening isn't a breakdown in the -- in the deal or the negotiations, and there's no indication now that it is. So hopefully, it's just a matter of time.",

There's the larger ceasefire for this round of warfare and then there's, of course, the larger resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The eradication of Hamas, which is Israel's goal, is -- that's a very significant goal and imagined milestone. And, of course, there's the liberation, the sovereignty, the freedom of the Palestinian people. Neither of those things are going to be accomplished by this deal but if there is a path, that would obviously be much more promising than just a pause.",

So I think everybody is relieved at the idea of a pause.But there are differing opinions in our communities but I think everywhere that -- is the pause itself a goal? The release of hostages feels objectively good but what -- if you pause before the goals are accomplished, what about -- are -- is Israel more or less secure than it was on October 7? I think people are still reeling from the kind of the paradigm-shattering act that happened on October 7 and pausing is a relief. But there's a deep concern about well, what is the status of Hamas and therefore, of Israel's security? And what is the status of the Palestinian people's hopes for freedom and having a state of their own? Until those very big, complicated, underlying issues -- unless there's progress or resolution of them, I think people don't feel comfortable with the situation.",

They'll eat turkey and call military members to thank them for their service.And while lawmakers get the day off to celebrate as well, they're set for a busy couple of weeks just ahead. A vote on Ukraine funding at the top of their agenda upon their return to D.C. -- when they get there -- at which point the fate of Mr. Biden's $61 billion aid request for Kyiv seems pretty uncertain at this point. Let's bring in Samantha-Jo Roth, congressional reporter for The Washington Examiner. Thank you so much for joining us. This money is absolutely vital to Ukraine but there are big hurdles for Biden and Congress. SAMANTHA-JO ROTH, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Yeah, absolutely. Basically, what we're hearing from our sources is lawmakers -- they want to be able to pass a package that includes aid for Israel as well as Ukraine. And here is why it is so tricky. Republicans really want to insert immigration into all of this. So there was a working group last week that came out with some specific framework that would include -- basically, that Biden would need to include -- continue to build former President Trump's wall as well as changing some of the asylum laws. So that makes this all very tricky. And then on top of all of this you have House Republicans who really do not want to fund Ukraine. They want to do this separately. So you have Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who wants to advance this two-pronged solution with Ukraine and Israel, and then you also have the House of Representatives and the new speaker there that just recently passed aid to Israel separately. And we have seen how complicated it is. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had such a hard time wrangling his conference. And there isn't any imminent funding deadline as we've seen in recent weeks. As we saw before the break, lawmakers were able to fund the government just a couple of weeks into January. So basically, the goal right now is lawmakers really want to be able to do this before the end of the year. The big question is are they actually going to be able to do this?",

So when you look at the numbers overall it isn't a big number. Specifically, when you look at the Senate, it is really only two members of the Senate out of 100 senators -- out of all the Democrats. But I do think that those calls are not going to end with this deal. You're going to continue to hear it from those progressive lawmakers who believe that this should -- you know, there should be a ceasefire. But at the end of the day, this certainly is something that a lot of lawmakers are happy about. They want to see more of these hostages released. They want to see some kind of end in the fighting. The big question is for how long will these tensions be eased.",
