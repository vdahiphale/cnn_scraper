And what we're seeing now is we had seen with President Obama as the first African American president is that the threat level is higher for that particular individual. So, you're going to have to have some sort of combination. Not every -- you know, not every former president is as public or politically involved as the nominee as Donald Trump. Most of them retire.

But it never really lost that power. It continued to have the power because, well, the water is still so warm out there. This is not the end of typhoon, cyclone, or hurricane season. This is the middle of it. So, when a storm gets going, it has that much potential. And yes, we had a 187-kilometer per hour wind gust on one of the islands out here.

Here's the one here now with a brand- new name, Pulasan. Here we go. Just coming on shore. Still not going to be a big typhoon, but when you already have things that are slightly damaged, including tree limbs and power lines, and you put more wind on top of it, that is not a good scenario. Here it comes right on shore, going to be making its way right across and parts of Okinawa and then very close to Shanghai, but not with the effect certainly we had with Yagi last week and certainly maybe not even with the effect we have so far with this storm that just came through today. The rainfall will still be there. Then we look at another storm that came through right in the same place that Yagi did hit Hanoi, and that's the next event that's going to possibly make some significant rainfall for Vietnam. Now, look at all the rainfall we're having in Europe. This is a big story. There are places that have picked up at least a third of a meter of rainfall. The flooding across parts of Poland, Czechia, all the way through these areas, I can't even name all the countries because everyone has seen some type of 370 millimeters will make significant rainfall and significant flooding. And it certainly, certainly did. Over four times the average rainfall for the area pretty much in general. And significant snow in the Alps. I don't know if you have a trip to the Alps planned this year, Julia, but they're getting a good start. About two meters on the ground already at some of the top of these Alps highest elevation.

He's not tried to hide it. This is a very close election. He is running on the premise that he's been persecuted unfairly by the Biden administration, and he's going to use everything he can. His entire political persona is based on never letting an attack go unresponded. Remember the first gesture that he made after that attempt in Pennsylvania was to stand up and pump his fist and say, fight, fight, fight. That's his instinct.

And if it does, is there sufficient justification in terms of these national security concerns to crack down on speech in this way? TikTok, of course, is arguing that the law is an illegal and unjustified violation of the First Amendment rights of both the app and its U.S. users. And in this hearing, TikTok's attorney really hammered on that point. He argued that for the government to restrict the speech of a specific entity like this, it would need to face strict scrutiny and have sufficient justification. And given that essentially all we've publicly heard from the government at this point is hypothetical concerns that the Chinese government could potentially seek to access U.S. user data from TikTok, they say that bar has not been met. But the judges did push back pretty hard in questioning. They asked if the law would really violate the First Amendment when it still leaves room for TikTok to operate in the U.S., just not under Chinese control, they said. Now, it's not clear how the judges will rule based on today's hearing, but we're expecting to get a decision in the coming weeks and for the losing side to appeal so that this can go to the Supreme Court before that January 19th deadline for a TikTok sale or a ban.

It becomes the show in a single season to win the most Emmys, also becoming the first non-English language show in the drama category to win. Also, Anna Sawai, who won for Best Dramatic Actress, is the first Asian actress to win in that category. Now, the biggest surprise of the night was when \"Hacks\" won for Best Comedy Series. This came after Jean Smart winning for best comedic actress, but nobody had predicted that \"Hacks\" would win in the best comedy category. It was expected that \"The Bear\" would win. So, this was a huge shock. There was a big audible gasp in the room. I was there in the theater. Now, \"The Bear\" doing just fine, winning 11 awards last night, beating its own record from the last Emmys when it won 10 awards. Last night, walking away with three major acting awards, including for star Jeremy Allen White and for star Liza Colon Zayas, who became the first Latina actress to win for best supporting comedic actress. Now, in her speech, she spoke to her community, but she also had a message for voters. Let's take a look.
