GENERAL MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: None whatsoever. John, when I'll tell you is, you know, a nation's values normally drives a nation's policies which drives a nation strategy. So when you're talking about the values of what we're seeing in Ukraine, a sovereign country, a nation that has territorial boundaries, that has been invaded by another nation that interferes with their conduct of their government, it would seem to me that the United States values says that's not right. The freedom and democracy is an important thing for all nations. And we should stand up for that, especially the point about the fact that Ukraine has so many connections with the United States, going back to several accords, where we promised to help them with security. Once they gave up some of the things that they had during the period, they were part of the Soviet Union. So, no, this would be a violation in my view of our values.

Much of it comes down to disagreements between Ukrainian and U.S. officials over timing, as well as execution. Here's part of the reporting. By May, concern was growing within the Biden administration among allied backers. According to the planning, Ukraine should have already launched its operations. As far as the U.S. military was concerned, the window of opportunity was shrinking fast. Intelligence over the winter had shown that Russian defenses were relatively weak and largely unmanned, and that morale was low among Russian troops after the losses in Kharkiv and Kherson. U.S. intelligence assess that senior Russian officers felt the prospects were bleak.That quickly changed over the coming months after that. But on the other hand, the Ukrainian troops needed more time for training. And when this original plan actually did go into action, it lasted about four days. You're proof once again, everyone has a plan until they're punched in the face. But looking forward, you know, can Ukraine regain the momentum here and is it even possible without U.S. support?",

It also accessed the subset of family tree information. They used old user names and passwords from other Websites, to break into the accounts.

But ion other businesses that hold our sensitive data, there have been this call, for many years, to put the burden of security on the user.
