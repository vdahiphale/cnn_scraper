A reporter with exclusive details and pictures is OUTFRONT.Plus, breaking news, new court found in a defamation case against Fox News has just been released. You will see the message that Tucker Carlson sent to Trump lawyer, Sidney Powell, called her out for cruel and reckless conspiracy theories. Why didn't he do something different on TV? And two Americans kidnapped in Mexico now back in the U.S. for treatment. The other two killed. As the search for the killer ramps up, let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, on the run. Here's the new video of Russian soldiers appearing to abandon their posts just south of Bakhmut, the shell of a city. We've seen the most vicious fighting of the past months. Ukraine's president in an exclusive interview to CNN, made it clear that when it comes to Bakhmut, Ukraine is not about to retreat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  This is tactical for us. We understand that after Bakhmut, they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, to Sloviansk, it would be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut, to other towns in Ukraine in the Donetsk direction, in the east of Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a crucial route, right now covered in mud, cars and trucks have been blown to pieces. And they line that muddy pathway, which is essentially what it is. But this is what's keeping Ukraine going, and allowing it to push back against Russian soldiers who have been in continual disarray, and even tonight, new video, just listen to this one, lashing out at their superiors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  I am refusing to obey orders after we took on losses in just three days, one reason being that our troops are not trained properly, and yet sent to the front lines.

It's not clear whether Putin is listening to this, for his party is rarely seen in public and really acknowledges the horrible struggle that his forces are facing on the front line.In a moment, I'm going to speak to a reporter who has exclusive new reporting on Putin's whereabouts, and his lavish lifestyle with his reputed girlfriend, a former Russian Olympic gold medalist Elina Kabaeva. Russian independent journalist Roman Badanin reporting that this luxury mansion, where Putin often stays, it's a home he can often get to by armored train, reportedly now his preferred way of travel, as we told you. And tonight, we have images, reportedly, of the interior. According to Badanin, the home is decked out in gold from Putin's office to his bedroom, which you can see here, to his so-called, night seller with gold dining chairs. And as for Putin's reputed girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva, the mansion was constructed about half a mile from Putin's home, where she apparently resides. Now, CNN cannot independently verify these images of Putin's home, because the Kremlin guards every detail of Putin's private life. But publicly, the Kremlin is struggling to silence growing criticism over the invasion and Putin's role in it. Melissa Bell is OUTFRONT live in Kyiv tonight to begin our coverage.
