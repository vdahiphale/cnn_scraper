      "sentences": "Just a stunning day, a stunning moment there in Fulton County, Georgia where they are in a brief recess as we await Fani Willis, the district attorney for Fulton County to take the stand. Of course, she has, for years now, been going through the process of this case against former president, Trump, and now his 18 co-defendants, this sweeping RICO case having to do with election subversion in 2020. And now she is facing these questions, as well as we just heard Nathan Wade, one of the lead prosecutors on the case, facing questions as well. There are some conflicting bits of information, key bits of information, that are of considerable interest to the defendants in this case as they are trying, really, to use this to their advantage and they might very much be able to.",

      "sentences": "And let's put it into context, the implications here for this case could be huge. If the DA is dismissed, it may be hard to find another prosecutor that would want to take on such a complex, sprawling RICO case, not to mention one that is politically fraught. I mean, the DA has gotten threats to her life. So going up against those co-defendants, including the former president, some of the rhetoric that we've heard from him, it would not be an easy task for anyone to take on this case if Willis is dismissed.So the entire case, potentially, is at play here. We have a star- studded panel of folks to discuss all the legal implications of Willis testifying. Let's go to Laura Coates and talk about, specifically, what the defense team wants to probe here with the District Attorney. They were talking about the issue of reimbursement, the idea that was presented by Nathan Wade that Fani Willis gave him cash for trips that they took together, that he paid for with his business credit card as he was being paid by the DA, essentially by public funds to prosecute this case. So that's one aspect, the funds. And then secondly, the timeline of the relationship, were they in a relationship, a romantic relationship, when she hired him, Laura?",
