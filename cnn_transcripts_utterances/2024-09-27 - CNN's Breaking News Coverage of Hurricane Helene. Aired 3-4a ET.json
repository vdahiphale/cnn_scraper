This is \"CNN Newsroom.\"We begin with breaking news as we track Hurricane Helene. It's now the strongest storm to ever make landfall in Florida's Big Bend, sweeping across the coast hours ago as an extremely dangerous category four hurricane with winds of 140 miles per hour. Now, the effects have been felt far from the center of the storm. The mayor of Clearwater told me his community has been inundated despite being 100 miles from the center. Now, Helene is weakening now, but has knocked out power to more than a million and a half homes and businesses in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. At least three people have been killed as the storm continues to pummel the southeast, two in Georgia and one in Florida. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We have had a report of a fatality on the roadway. Car driving on I-4 near Ybor City in Tampa was hit when a sign fell onto the highway. So that just shows you that it's very dangerous conditions out there. You need to be right now just hunkering down. Now is not the time to be going out. We know that travel on the roads can be hazardous and we typically, unfortunately, will have fatalities in every storm from that. When you are out on the roads in the middle of one of these storms that is very, very dangerous. So please do not do that. Stay put. Also, if you're sheltering in place, know your surroundings in terms of trees. You are going to see trees that are going to get knocked down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The rain has calmed down since the last time that we spoke. We always knew that was going to happen it was anticipated that right around that three o'clock hour, the rain would get a little bit less. The wind however is going to stick with us here possibly for the next couple of hours until it continues its trajectory a little bit more North.In terms of power outages, you mentioned that across the state of Florida alone, 1.3 million customers are without power. Here where we are in Leon County, it's right around 72,000 customers without power. Now the population here in this county is about 300,000. So it's a good amount of people here who are experiencing power outages. From where I'm standing, a bit of a hill here good vantage point behind me of the city here of Tallahassee and you can still see a lot of buildings with their lights still on here on this street where I am. These street lights have flickered on and off now for a few times as well. But you know at this point some good news here for the people of Tallahassee. We were expecting a direct hit in the hours leading up to that historic landfall as a category four hurricane. It moved a little bit east. So we were on that west side of Hurricane Helene. Great news here for a lot of folks, but as the sun begins to come up, we're going to see some of the damage that was left behind here, specifically in Tallahassee. A big effort moving forward will be power restoration. And we know crews aren't going to be able to do that until all those roadways are clear. Then they'll be able to get to that important work.",

And again, you have to have some perspective for people who don't know these are hundreds of miles away from the water. These are not beach communities.So again, just to know how far away they are, we've just got the hourly update now down to 80 miles per hour. That's still a category one hurricane. Again, this is what we expected as it continues to make its way inland. It's going to weaken. The interesting thing though is just how far inland it's been able to maintain its hurricane status. Again, you can see here is that center of the storm will continue to slide. It's going to start to make its way a little bit more in a westerly direction here in the next 24 hours. But by the time it gets to Macon in Atlanta, it will still be a very high end tropical storm with those wind gusts up around 60 to 80 miles per hour. Then it will stretch up into Tennessee and Kentucky. There's going to be the problem is it just sits. That means it's going to have a long period of time where it can drop a tremendous amount of rain. Here is a look at the radar. Again, you can see a lot of that really heavy rain is on the northern side of this. So a lot of the areas south in Florida finally starting to see things dry out now that this thing has really taken off in speed. But the worst is really yet to come for portions of Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, as well as Kentucky, especially in terms of wind and rain. We also still have the potential for tornadoes. You're talking cities like Charlotte. Charleston, Savannah, Columbia, even down through Jacksonville, Florida. A lot of these still go for at least another three hours before they expire, but some of them may be extended beyond that especially as we continue to get some tornado warnings. Here's a look at the rain that has already fallen. You can see from this map, again, this widespread area here that's the yellow color, at least about four inches of rain that's a hundred millimeters has fallen. But when you look at some of the orange and the red colors there, now you're talking six to eight inches has fallen and we're going to be adding more on top of it. The green color right through here, these are all areas under a flood watch, meaning conditions are capable of seeing some of those flooding. The red color indicates active flooding that is ongoing, Kim. So we've got the flooding component, the tornado component and still the wind component, even though it's made landfall, we are still expecting impacts the next 24 hours.",

Models of Hurricane Helene's impact predicted a storm surge up to 20 feet in the area. Now, even though the strongest part of Helene has now passed and weakened. People are still being advised to shelter in place. And one county official told CNN there were fears that storm surge could push water 20 miles from the coast. And joining me now is Captain Jeffrey Yarbrough from the Wakulla County, Florida Sheriff's Office. Thank you so much for being here with us. So just take us through how bad was it when it passed through? CAPT. JEFFREY YARBROUGH, WAKULLA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: Thankfully, we actually were able to skirt kind of the worst of it and the most dire predictions that were given for our community given the fact that the storm shifted eastward as it came in.

LOGAN PARHAM, STORM CHASER (on the phone): Yes, so it came in right here on the Gulf Coast. We actually ended up in the dead center of the eye. So we actually had a temporary calm. You can see the skies, a couple of stars, but clear skies. It was pretty intense. Honestly, the back eye wall was a little bit on the less intense side, nonetheless gusty, but a lot drier. However, that first eye wall was really, really ripping. Definitely some pretty intense gusts through there.

The wind- wise, I think wind-wise this definitely was closing in on the type of wind that we saw with Hurricane Ian, for example. Maybe not quite to that extent, but definitely nearing those types of speeds, especially in that first eyewall that was just quite the blast. Definitely worse than Adalia, in my opinion. Adalia was a pretty rough storm, but this would be the benchmark storm for this region, the Big Bend, for probably quite a long time.

We always make sure here that we get going back to normal as soon as possible. And usually they do a pretty good job of that around these areas. So I don't think it'll take too, too long. Power outage wise, I think that may be a while just because this storm had such a large wind field and it also was moving very quickly. So those winds were spread out over a huge area and they had the ability to move farther than just coastal or near coastal areas. So these winds move deep into the state of Florida, even into the state of Georgia, and causing some serious power outage issues. I have no clue yet on the condition of towns out there toward the coast, like Steinhatchee, Horseshoe Beach, those types of areas. But I do know the surge was really bad out there. So tomorrow we'll be doing, you know, helping with recovery efforts and getting to the bottom of what exactly these areas will need.",

You sort of ride through these as a matter of course, but I mean, do you ever get worried, you know, as we're seeing the pictures of just how bad the winds were and so on, I mean, just as a visceral experience. I mean, it just must be awesome to experience that the power of nature, but frightening as well.PARHAM (on the phone): It is -- it is it can be a little bit frightening. I think honestly a big part of it is just the nerves. The nerves are going into it. That's the main thing. But once you get there, usually you want to have a good game plan, a vehicle, you know loaded with supplies. Anytime you chase a hurricane, especially you want to have at least three days to a full week's worth of supplies with you. Just having a good game plan, having a spot that you can shelter, a plan A, a plan B, all the way down to Z, that way you're ensuring that you're protecting yourself and others around you, all the way through the journey of a hurricane. So, it is a very crazy experience. However, you know, that it definitely had quite the number of them now so the one thing I can say that I can't trust enough and I think hopefully a lot of the United States now and hopefully the world understands about the storms especially after what Helene done is that no storm is the same as another.",

Here specifically conditions in terms of whether they've really calmed down a lot. The wind is the only thing that's left behind but at this point it just comes in terms of waves. It might be a little strong and then it might calm down for the next several minutes.The rain has been gone now for at least 30. But when I am looking around into other counties throughout Florida, they're beginning to report some early damages in those early assessments coming in. To highlight a few, for example, Suwannee County, sheriff officials there say, quote, \"we're fearing for the worst when the sun comes up.\" They're in that county. They're saying that there is extreme destruction reported in the area. Extensive damage they say reported along the western side of the county trees falling on homes. Also, causing a hundred percent outages throughout that county, Sarasota County as well. We're talking about bridges that are not passable because of severe flooding. The mayor of Sarasota, we heard from them and they say that they haven't seen anything like this since they've lived in Sarasota for the last more than 20 years. So really when the sun comes up, we're going to see the full picture here of all the damage that was caused throughout the state of Florida. And we know it is going to be very extensive. We've seen images of storm surge in some communities, very high, flooding homes. So it's going to be a very hard situation for many families in these communities, without the state of Florida and all of this is what we're talking about as the hurricane continues its path northward heading in to Georgia and all the destruction we could possibly see in that area as well.",

Well my main message would be, you know, even though we're not working on we still have a storm around but you got to stay where you're at, shelter in place, do not go walking through those flood waters. You know, there's reports of -- of down trees, down power lines, et cetera. And you know, when you're walking around in these waters, you may not know what them. And we really just want our community members and, and all of Florida to stay safe, stay vigilant and stay updated. There's a plethora of information, both from Sarasota County and many of the other great counties in Florida.

And the way that senior U.S. officials were putting this to us was that this had been seen by both sides, so by Hezbollah and by Israel, that it was an optimistic reception that this was going to be publicized.But then we did see the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu throwing cold water on it. There were reports that there was an imminent ceasefire to be signed and he rejected those through the Prime Minister's office, saying that they are simply incorrect. Also pointing out that he's pushing the IDF, the Israeli military, to continue what they are doing in southern Lebanon, to continue fighting with full force. Now there was some confusion among the Biden administration. At these comments, there was somewhat of an assumption that it may have been more for a domestic audience. The fact that the far-right elements of Netanyahu's coalition did not want this ceasefire to go ahead. He has in the past had to make certain announcements and decisions, it's believed, to try and keep that coalition together. And the more far- right elements could potentially walk if this ceasefire were to go ahead and that would collapse his coalition. But there has been clarification from the Prime Minister's Office saying that there are discussions, that this is an ongoing process. So it doesn't appear to be as imminent as we may have believed it to be about 24 hours ago. We do hear from the Prime Minister's Office that Netanyahu appreciates the U.S.-led efforts. And we also know that Netanyahu is currently in New York. He postponed his trip because of what is happening in the region, but he is now in New York. He will be speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday. He's one of the first speakers, so Friday morning in New York we will hear from him. And we are likely to hear more about what is happening in Lebanon against Hezbollah. We are likely to hear from the Prime Minister about what is happening in Gaza as well. So these discussions are still ongoing behind the scenes, but what we are hearing from the Israeli military side is that they are preparing potentially for a ground offensive. We have heard it from numerous military officials, the defense minister, the chief of staff of the IDF, the head of the Air Force, that this that we have seen in over the past few days and the past week in fact, has been an aerial bombardment preparing for a potential ground offensive.
