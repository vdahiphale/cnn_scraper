She says, her campaign says that they are talking mostly about President Biden and that's who she's running against. But when she goes on to say the next line that we need a new generation, she's talking about both Biden and Trump.And I thought her message today was very clear. Because Haley over the past couple of years has really struggled to find out -- figure out what her message is. But today, I feel like she brought the optimistic Haley and I feel like she was -- had a coherent and very targeted message in trying to, you know, find her space in this Republican primary.",

You have a loving crowd around you and you go. The question is can she build from here, a very well done event. A very well produced, looked great with the crowd right there. Does she have Donald Trump's attention? Well, the answer is yes.This is four pages when it print it out, of opposition research from the Trump Campaign. Not from Trump himself, those statement from Trump. But she once said nice things about Hillary Clinton. She supported Paul Ryan's plan to trim Medicare and Social Security. It goes on and on. Said she's weak on immigration. Said she did not support the transgender bathroom bill. Says she flip-flops on 2024. She's got his attention. JEFF ZELENY, CNN'S CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Sure. I mean, welcome to the race. I mean she of course knew all of these things were coming. I think this was a hometown crowd of people who twice elected her as Governor of South Carolina in a historic move of its own. This is -- she has a clear base of supporters there. The question is, as she moves down the field here, she'll be in Iowa next week, what's her reception there? There is no doubt, there is an appetite for a new generation of leaders. She spoke to that. I almost lost track of the number of double entendres, if you will. Was she talking about Biden or Trump during this talking about the age? But she did say something interesting. She wanted to have a mental acuity test for politicians over 75. She could have said 80. That would have applied to Biden. She said 75, it applies to President Trump as well. But look, the bottom line here, her ability to move forward is going to depend on how she straddles that line of mega supporters who she needs versus really the old Republican Party. I was struck she came onto the stage with the theme song \"The Eye of the Tiger.\" That is the song Newt Gingrich played again and again and he won South Carolina in 2012. So there is a hungering and appetite among Republicans for a new way. Is she the candidate? We'll see. But she did herself a lot of good getting in early and this was a very good event for her. We'll see what comes next, day two is harder.",

We now know the names of the three students who were killed and you see them there. They are 20- year-old Brian Fraser, 19-year-old Arielle Anderson and 20-year-old Alexandria Verner. Fraser was the president of his fraternity. Family members say Anderson was studying to become a surgeon. And a family friend remembers Verner as \"Everything you'd want your daughter or your friend to be.\" They were all from suburban Detroit. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is live on the campus. She joins us now from East Lansing with the very latest. Adrienne, what is the latest?ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): John, in just under six hours, people will gather here in front of the Sparty statue which is behind me to hold vigil. They will reflect on eight of the victims. And when I say eight, we're talking about the three deceased who you just mentioned as well as the other five who are in critical condition, still fighting for their lives after that shooting on Monday night. We have learned the name of one of the five and that is Guadalupe Huapilla-Perez. Her family says they are thankful she's still here but they also said they are devastated, telling us that Guadalupe has a long road ahead when it comes to recovery. They say it will take months, including the rehabilitation process. Meanwhile, people still wanting to know why did this happen, and that is unclear. Investigators are still trying to find out how that 43-year-old shooter, who had no ties to MSU according to police, obtained the gun. Meanwhile I spoke to a senior a short time ago. She wept as she shared what was on her heart, trying to cope with what happened here Monday. She reminded me of something that all freshmen do when they start school here. They take a picture in front of Sparty. I did it some 21 years ago. And she says that reason we take the picture in front of Sparty is to see how far you're come and how much you've changed when it's time to graduate. She said the freshmen who took the picture here had no idea what would be ahead. She is now a mass shooting survivor. John.",

The Special Counsel Jack Smith now asking a Federal Judge to invoke what's known as the crime fraud exception. That would allow prosecutors to bypass traditional attorney/client privilege and to force one of Trump's attorneys, Evan Corcoran, to answer more questions. It's a huge step and it tells us prosecutors are prepared to argue in court that Trump or someone in his orbit used Corcoran to further a crime.A spokesman for the former president calls this move, \"a targeted politically motivated witch hunt\" designed to keep Trump out of the White House. Joining our conversation, CNN's Paula Reid and the former Federal Prosecutor Elliot Williams. Paula, let's start with you. It's a very aggressive move to try to puncture the tradition of attorney/client privilege. To get a judge to sign off, you have to present evidence, at least probable cause, that the lawyer was involved in a crime. What are we going to see? PAULA REID, CNN'S SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: That's right. It's not a very high bar and this is the first time we've seen this from Special Counsel Jack Smith. Of course, previously the Justice Department had to present probable cause of a possible crime we'd say in order to get the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago. But here you see them, they want to bring back Evan Corcoran and they want to ask about the events leading up to the search of Mar-a-Lago. So they are arguing to a judge, they are trying to convince the court to allow them to use one of these few exceptions to attorney/client privilege saying, \"Look, we believe that Corcoran or his legal advice were used in furtherance of a crime.\" Not a high bar. It's likely they will be successful. Literally (ph) interesting to see how much evidence they can get out of him. But look, it's never a good day when one of your lawyers goes before a grand jury and now we're up to three Trump attorneys going before the same grand jury.",
