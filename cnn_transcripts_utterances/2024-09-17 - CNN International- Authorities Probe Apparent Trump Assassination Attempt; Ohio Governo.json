Right, the stock market in New York will open in around 30 minutes from now, it's a big week, as the Federal Reserve is expected to make a decision on interest rates. We're also waiting for some key data as well, which will possibly drive the markets. As you can see, U.S. futures all pointing to a positive start today. Well, Donald Trump is speaking about the apparent second attempt on his life in as many months as new details emerge about the suspects on the X platform, Trump recounted the moment while playing golf on his course in Florida when he heard gunshots. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All of a sudden, we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that. But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me, and I think probably the other one, Steve is one of the people. Steve Witkoff, a great friend of mine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Secret Service says the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, did not fire his weapon and never had a line of sight on Trump. Cell phone records indicate Routh was in the vicinity of the golf course for about 12 hours before he was spotted, he fled and eventually was caught by law enforcement, with the help of a witness who took a picture of his car and alerted police. Now, Routh appeared in court on Monday. He currently faces two weapons charges, and far more serious charges are possible. CNN's Carlos Suarez joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida, and U.S. National Security Reporter Zachary Cohen is in Washington for us. Great to see you both. Carlos, I want to start with you. We've got two weapons charges right now. As we learn more about the suspect, his whereabouts and what played out on that day, more charges are probable. So, what more are we learning at this point?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): If he needs the resources, he will get those resources from Congress. But I also think we have a process and protocol problem, not just a resources and manpower issue. They're saying Donald Trump is getting the highest level of protection. Well, if this is the highest level, we need to see several higher levels that they need to create for level of protection, because it's inadequate. It's clear.

It's also about the system that the Secret Service uses, and the protocols that they have in place to protect not just for President Donald Trump, but other political candidates who do not get the same protection level as a sitting president. Now, Donald Trump has been given additional security resources since the first assassination attempt back in July, at his butler Pennsylvania rally where he was nearly shot, but still Congressman on the other side of the aisle calling for the Secret Service to really take a fulsome look at the way that they protect Donald Trump, especially given the immense array of threats that he currently faces, not just domestic, but also foreign. We've reported in recent days about another recent briefing related to intelligence that shows Iran is planning to escalate its attacks against Donald Trump. We know Iran has been plotting assassination plans against Donald Trump and former administration officials. But all these threats taken together, current and former Secret Service officials tell me that the service itself needs to really look inward and see if they need to change their entire system for protecting political candidates and Donald Trump specifically, that's something the acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, did acknowledge yesterday. He defended the agency's response, but he also said that there is a quote, paradigm shift that needs to happen in terms of the way the service addresses Donald Trump's protection.",

You know, there was sort of this general malaise and disinterest in seeing Joe Biden, both from Democrats and from independents. And I think after that first attempt on Trump's life, there was a lot of residual effect from that, helping Donald Trump sort of see this surge in interest and enthusiasm behind his campaign. But now the race is completely changed, and with Vice President Harris there, it's unclear what kind of reaction we will see from voters. We also saw in the immediate aftermath of that first assassination attempt, Donald Trump tried to pivot towards some sort of message of unity, bringing the country together. Obviously, that didn't last very long, and instead, this time, he has a very different message, and so does his running mate, it seems very clearly focused on galvanizing the Republican base and conservatives and making sure that they are -- they vote this November.

Yesterday, Trump and his son spoke about it in an X spaces, virtual events. But here's what we do know, Donald Trump, if he is elected President, would be in charge of regulating the cryptocurrency industry going forward, and he is someone who has promised to put in place pro cryptocurrency policies. Well now he and his family have a brand-new venture in that space that could potentially benefit from whatever policies he puts in place. Another concern I heard when talking to experts in this field is that this is an industry that has already attracted a lot of regulatory concern that there have been scams and hackers, there have been fraudulent cases. You think of what happened with Sam Bankman-Fried in some of these high- profile fraud cases. This is an area that is ripe for enforcement, and how will this new SEC or Justice Department overlook Trump's own business interests in this space if there is some sort of compliance issues or regulatory risk. And the other concern is that there are so many hackers in this space who are sort of leeching onto these celebrity cryptocurrency ventures, and that Trump entering this space will give a whole new avenue for them to pray off of people who are simply interested in getting involved in crypto, not because they've done a ton of due diligence, but because of Trump's celebrity status. And we have already seen that with this new cryptocurrency venture, world liberty financial, their social media page actually has a warning on it as a profile, beware of scams, clearly, just showing how much this is already affecting this business where you have all these people trying to make profit off of this, this venture before it even launches.",

Our CNN's National CorrespondentBrynn Gingras joins us for some more updates on this. I mean, the big question is, Brynn, how is law enforcement dealing with these bomb threats? There are hoaxes. There's a hope it'll stay that way. But clearly, it's putting pressure on the system. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Exactly right. I mean, that's what I was just going to say, Eleni, you took the words right out of my mouth. Of course, the governor just saying there that these are all unfounded threats that are coming into these schools, into that town of Springfield, Ohio. Based on those claims that were made by the two, you know, the Republican ticket, but it's a serious strain on law enforcement, so much so for the local law enforcement there in Springfield that the state has now had to get involved. And so, the governor is now sending 36 highway patrolmen to come to Springfield, a town of about 60,000 people in Ohio. And essentially go into schools prior to faculty getting there, and students and sweep those schools making sure they are all clear for the students to actually go in and have their normal day. Think about that. That's pretty incredible, considering this is all based on baseless claims. And so those same highway patrolmen are actually going to even stand post when school gets out for dismissal, to hopefully ease some anxiety for family members and parents who are sending their kids to school, and that's just for the younger kids. We also know that two universities in that town have switched to virtual learning. There have been threats against Haitian immigrants, Haitian students as well there for the universities, and so they are also having to be on sort of a high alert system as well. In addition to just those highway patrolmen going into that town, we know that they are bringing bomb sniffing dogs into that town. They are installing more cameras. They are actually having the Homeland Security for the state go in and conduct assessments for critical infrastructure, like schools, like other possible vulnerable areas for that town. So again, I can't highlight enough. This is a town of 60,000 people. It's very small. You know, American Midwestern town doesn't have a ton of resources, so the state really does need to step in. Now, on top of that, Republican, you know, nominee Trump says that he would like to go visit Springfield now, and the mayor is saying, please don't come. Take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've had two senior Biden Administration officials telling CNN that there are no imminent plans to present an updated proposal. This sort of final bridging proposal by the National Security chiefs to the U.S. President, to Joe Biden to sign off on it, and then to try and convince Hamas and Israel to sign up as well. Now this at the beginning of the month, Biden officials were saying it was going to come any moment now. It was very soon that this was going to happen, but now we're being told there are no imminent plans. One of the issues we understand from officials is that they don't want to put this plan forward, believing it could be one of the last plans and proposals, until they believe Hamas will eventually agree to it, and they don't think that they will at this point. This is the concern, and of course, there's also this increasing skepticism that the Israeli Prime Minister will agree to it without having a guarantee that he can put troops along the Gaza-Egypt border, which Hamas would not sign up to.

This is the area that has been surrounded by fires. In fact, there are roughly two dozen large rural fires burning out of control within Portugal. At the moment, 5000 firefighters battling the blazes as best they can, but it is tinder box conditions, extremely dry. And I'll show you that the drought that is ongoing across much of Portugal at the moment, but just look at these horrific scenes. You're looking at smoke just billowing up into the sky, and that orange hue to the horizon as well. Very ominous look as civilians are evacuated from their homes. Schools are closed because of the wildfires. Now, the flooding across Central Europe and the wildfires are all part of a larger, broader weather pattern that I like to call a stuck weather pattern, a blocked weather pattern. If you think about a Rex block, if you look at the Omega Rex block that the Greek letter, you can kind of see it here in the upper levels of the atmosphere. So, we have a high-pressure system located to the north and a low-pressure system located to itself, not really allowing both of these systems to move very quickly. So, the low stay situated. This is the low that's been responsible for the heavy rainfall over the central parts of Europe. But because of these two systems working together, it's creating that offshore wind component to the Iberian Peninsula, where Portugal is located. And you'll see from space that as these fires started to flare up, the winds just helped fuel these flames. So, you're looking at space imagery, satellite imagery of the wildfires in Portugal and how the wind is blowing right off the coastline of Portugal that is the Iberian Peninsula, and it's because of that stuck weather pattern I showed you in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Of course, this is in combination with the dry weather that is in place. Look at the moderate to severe, even extreme drought conditions across much of Portugal right now. And then, of course, the opposite. We wish we could send some of this rain to Portugal, but that's just not the case. We have this slow-moving, low-pressure system that's stuck within the weather pattern. It's not really moving anywhere anytime soon. The good news is it's raining itself out. The bulk of the rain moving away from Czech Republic Poland, for instance, but the river levels are going to remain high. Here's an example.

Just to give you a sense of this data, it rose what 0.1 percent we were expecting, a bit of a decline. We also saw a revision higher actually, in what we got for the month prior in July. This is good news. What was dragging as lower, actually, as gasoline prices and auto sales. But even if you strip out that actually, the monthly reading is 0.4 percent significantly better than expected. You and I know well that you have to be careful when you talk about aggregate numbers on these because for lower income Americans, they're struggling. And we've had a whole host of retailers saying, look the consumer, as we push out towards the end of the year, is likely to experience more challenges. And I can give you a whole host of names, Dollar General, Home Depot, Gap, Foot Locker, Abercrombie, are all saying, look, we need to be a little bit cautious of the consumer. And I think that's what the Fed is looking at, beyond these individual numbers, having said that, and this is the challenge, I think, on economic grounds, most analysts out there are saying, look, we should expect a quarter of a percentage point cut from the Federal Reserve tomorrow, but what the market's pricing, Eleni, is far closer to a half a percentage point cut. So quite frankly, at this stage, it's anyone's guess what the Fed do tomorrow, we could get one or the other. I think it's a bad excuse for cutting a half a percentage point that you don't want to upset or shock investors, quite frankly, particularly when we're, what, one to two percentage points off record highs. But when you've got Senators like Elizabeth Warren coming out, we've seen that, suggesting that they should be cutting three quarters of a percentage point.

And arguably the hottest property in world football at the moment has now joined them, strengthened their cause. But this is a different format to the competition to the one we've seen over the last 20 odd years or so. It's gone from 32 teams to 36 teams. We haven't got the usual eight groups of four. Instead, there's a league scenario with each team playing eight matches in this opening stage, which takes much longer seeing them through until the start of next year. The players, I think it's fair to say, aren't happy because of the extra demands on them. What impact will it have on their performance, on the standards? We shall wait and see. But we've got plenty more looking ahead to the big competition in just a couple of minutes in \"World Sports\".",
