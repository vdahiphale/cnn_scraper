Governor Brian Kemp said, \"There's absolutely no place for this hate and antisemitism in our state.\" And Sen. Raphael Warnock has tweeted \"We must all raise our voices loudly against this vile hate.\" Three San Antonio police officers are facing murder charges after a woman experiencing a mental health crisis got shot in her apartment. The police chief says they didn't use deadly force. CNN's Mike Valerio has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, we need to start with the victim who is at the center of this case, Melissa Perez, 46 years old. She is a mother and she was having a mental health crisis very early on Friday morning just after midnight. She was cutting, according to law enforcement authorities, the wires of her apartment's fire alarm system. So firefighters show up at that very early morning hour and they ask her \"Hey, what's going on? What are you doing cutting the wires to the fire alarm system?\" And she tells the firefighters she was cutting those wires because she thought that the FBI was listening to her. So it's very apparent that she needed help. Officers show up to that scene, though, and they determine among themselves that they need to charge her with criminal mischief, a felony count, for cutting those wires. She is scared though. She goes into her apartment and she grabs a hammer. She moves closer to her apartment window twice and in both of those instances officers open fire -- two volleys of gunshots that lead to her death. Now, we're going to show you about 20 seconds of the body camera footage. There's an unsettling exchange of words between the victim and an officer, and then those two volleys of gunfire. Here it is. MELISSA PEREZ, SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE OFFICERS:  Stop it! Stop it!",

Prigozhin -- the one thing he wanted, which was very clear, was to get rid of the defense minister, wasn't it, and a couple of other military officials? And today we see images of the defense minister on the front lines. What can we read into that?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is Sergei Shoigu in a video produced by the Russian Ministry of Defense visiting what they say is a command post with the Western group of forces in the zone of the circle of special military operation. They don't say when it was shot. They don't say exactly where -- which location probably for obvious reasons there. But he does not often go to visit the zone of the circle of special military operations. So it would seem that this is an effort to restore calm and to perhaps increase morale among the Russian troops as this counteroffensive by Ukraine continues. But also, I think as a counterpoint to that criticism by Prigozhin and others that Shoigu is incompetent and is out of touch.And I think as well because we see Prigozhin so often close to the front lines and in scenes of battle this does sort of set up Prigozhin -- Shoigu, himself, as being in the position as sort of a hard, tough guy in charge of the special military operation. It does not, though, given that we don't know the location or the time, in particular, of this to speculation as to his whereabouts or his job security in the wake of events over the weekend, Max.",

That was apparently part of the deal that included his exile to Belarus. Now we hear, this morning, state media quoting a source close to the prosecutor general's office saying that those charges have, in fact, not been dropped. The investigation continues against Prigozhin.So we hope to find out more from Dmitry Peskov if he holds a regularly scheduled briefing with journalists this morning. But it's unclear why that would happen -- whether the Kremlin and the prosecutor general's office are working in concert or perhaps separately. And if perhaps it was seen that there was too sweet a deal perhaps given to Prigozhin so this is some kind of climb-down from that. Either way, it is worth noting as we look forward in these very mixed messages that we're getting and the many questions that still remain on this, Max.",

This is a case concerning extremism charges against Alexey Navalny.These were charges that were brought against him in 2021 when he was already in prison serving what he is currently serving, which is 11 1/2 years for various crimes, including contempt of court, breaching parole -- things like that. These extremism charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years, which would go on top of the 11 1/2 years that he's currently serving. But this is, as I say, closed to press. A previous hearing in this trial was suddenly interrupted. The feed was interrupted there, the court said, because of fears of some kind of provocation. So we don't know yet. We'll wait for more news from his team -- his lawyers and perhaps from the court itself. But very much worth watching the events around Navalny because as we know, when President Putin is in any way weakened, backed into a corner, or trying to regain control of the narrative it does inevitably lead to an increase in repression, particularly of critics at home. Navalny is, of course, the poster child of that.",
