And there is disturbing bodycam video released in the death of a woman holding a pot of hot water. Shot and killed by a deputy who is now charged in her murder. Victim's father joins me tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" Well, and just like that, Democrats seem to have flipped the script. They're done nudging, they're done hand-wringing, and are now rolling up their sleeves, working to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris. If you thought that was going to be a slow process, think again. Just tonight, she has already secured enough endorsements from delegates to win the democratic nomination. And remember, these delegates, they belonged to Biden. It's up to them and their prerogative whether they wanted to support Harris or maybe anyone else. It seems though they've already made up their minds, and it's her. It caps a day that saw her rack up a number of endorsements and money as fast as President Biden, the candidate, was losing them. More than 240 members of Congress now say they are with her. That includes former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And Harris has raised a whopping $81 million bucks in just 24 hours. And forget what Biden once said about maybe party elites putting their thumb on a scale. These are voters who are also giving a big thumbs up. Look at this new poll that we have out today. Seventy-nine percent of Democrats want Harris. Just 21% want someone else. You know who is raising their hand to throw their own name into the ring against her? Buehler, Buehler. And no one else has dared to stand in her way. Delegates could now formally vote her in as the party's nominee as early as or maybe even before August 7th, and that is before the Democratic National Convention. She is wasting no time making the case against Donald Trump. Here she was today not only thanking her staffers, but also very clearly reminding everyone in that room that they now have a former prosecutor running against a convicted felon.

And she has a reputation for being fair. I think she should do this.But I also think that she should just campaign on who she has been. There's no need to try to do a remake right now. Realize that what she has been has brought her this far, and I think it can take her to the finish line. And if I may say this, we ought to be thankful to Joe Biden. This man gave it all up so that she could be on the ticket. I mean, it was a risk to put a woman on the ticket. No one has ever done this and succeeded. He did it. I think that he -- but for him, we would not have her in a position to do what she's doing now. So, let her do what she has done before. Rest on your laurels. You were a great senator.

I do wonder if she will embrace it in a different way.But one thing is certain, congressman. Some Republicans are attacking her.

The Republicans now deal in campaigns associated with character assassination. They're not interested in being truthful about people. They're interested in having the vote turned down, not out. They want to make sure that it's an election where in the basis of running against each other, the independents say, I don't want anybody in the race.

Number one, Pennsylvania, big swing state, arguably the most important swing state on the map. More than that, he has a strong electoral record. If you go back to last time around, back in 2020, when he was running in a presidential year, he actually outran Joe Biden on the ballot and, in fact, did best, did the best for any Democrat running statewide.What about some cons? Well, let's talk about the big con. Some liberals think he might be a little bit too moderate. You know, Kamala Harris has really energized the base after Joe Biden left the race, and there is some question about whether Josh Shapiro would, in fact, bring down that enthusiasm. But overall, the clear pros for him, he's from the state of Pennsylvania. You can't do better than that if you're picking a V.P. and want a swing state effect.",

How about this? A great biography. I mean, my goodness gracious, can you do better than an astronaut? I'm not sure that you necessarily can.(LAUGHTER) But what about the cons, right? He lacks executive experience. So, Kamala Harris really doesn't have much executive experience either, right? She, obviously, was the attorney general out in California, she was the D.A. in San Francisco, she was a senator from California, but she doesn't -- she hasn't ever actually led a state. And neither is Mark Kelly. He's somebody who was an astronaut, and then basically became a senator.

In fact, he is the one who is arguably the most experienced in the field, at least when it comes to these three V.P. -- potential VP choices, in terms of executive experience, in terms of running on the ballot, being on the ballot. This is obviously -- he's completing his second term as North Carolina governor.How about this? He has won twice. He has won twice. And it is potential swing state that Dems lost in the presidential races in North Carolina. Of course, Joe Biden lost it last time around. Of course, Hillary Clinton lost it back in 2016. But perhaps the one con, if we know for sure that Arizona and Pennsylvania are going to be key swing states, is North Carolina. I know a lot of Democrats want to play there but, in fact, if you are going to get a swing state effect by choosing a V.P., and that's one of the few measurable things that we know about VPs, is that it does tend to boost the president in that particular state. North Carolina is sort of on the edge of being a swing state, and adding Roy Cooper may help Kamala Harris. But if she's going to lose the state by five or six, it doesn't really help her too much if instead she loses it by two or three.",

He was put on probation instead of imprisoned for a pretty brutal beating. And a year later, he wound up killing someone. And in the Trump campaign's estimation, this is an example of being soft on crime and an example of bad progressive justice policies. The Harris campaign points out, look, this was a first-time offender, and he was sentenced to probation and sort of treated in accordance with the general policies of first-time offenders. So, they're going to litigate that. There are a few other cases where she didn't pursue the death penalty for a cop killer and in another case, in 2020, she had supported a bail fund that later on, this was during the George Floyd period, later on had helped release or give bail to different people who went on to commit murders or were accused of murders and other serious crimes.

I said, what are you talking about? A deputy-involved shooting. We were led to believe that the intruder or someone from the neighborhood may have killed her. We were absolutely shocked to find out that it was a deputy who shot her.",

But we watched that video just now. I mean, you can see in the video, he made no attempt to move away. This statement that she says that she rebukes him in the name of Jesus, it seemed to trigger something instead. I don't know the reaction and why it happened at that point. I mean, is there a circumstance where this would possibly be even a plausible defense that he could raise?",

When she said, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus, he said, oh, no, you effing won't, I'm going to shoot you in your effing face. And then he did it, Laura. And it's so senseless. I mean, it is disturbing.This video is reminiscent in the last presidential cycle in 2020 where the George Floyd video, you know, encouraged our community to act. And in this 2024 election, I believe this Sonya Massey video is going to encourage our community to act because Sonya Massey deserved better than this.",
