If they don't do that in this case, and they and they send to the Ethics Committee, I think the argument could be made that they are being held to a different standard, they are getting special treatment. That is, I think, something that they have probably had to consider as they decide what steps to take.

There's a code of official conduct that's part of the House rules. The first provision prohibits members from engaging in any conduct that may bring discredit upon the House. Well, all of the conduct attributed to these members by this committee, of course, brings appalling, enormous discredit on the House, but it's going to take some Republican member to agree that the institution of the House and protecting the integrity of the House is more important than protecting the fortunes of a particular member for this to get past the get-go. And I -- we will have to wait and see what happens, but it's improbable to me that any of these complaints will advance. A member in the next Congress could make a complaint. Jamie Raskin, for example, could go to the floor and offer a motion. But it still has to be dealt with by the committee. And I think it's going to be frozen from the beginning.",

They had that sort of shown to them very explicitly this summer. And I do think that is something that had an effect overall. So, while I know it's very easy to say, well, what about Trump, what does this mean for Trump, I do think they have had a kind of cultural impact that can't be denied.",

I would be surprised, frankly, if they don't or if they haven't already, and we just don't know it, right?I mean, they have -- clearly, they have done it with the president's former chief of staff. It would be surprising given the fact, as you point out, he was a material witness, for them to not be looking at that. And to Audie's point in terms of the impact this committee has had, committee members would tell you, look, we have had that impact. Look at what happened in the last election. Many election deniers lost their races. Many Trump-endorsed candidates lost their races. Now, of course, we can't definitively ever draw the direct line, but I think they would argue that it has had an impact. As Jamie said, today is going to be focused primarily on Donald Trump. And, of course, his team is gearing up for a whole P.R. blitz to try to undercut the committee's credibility. They're going to argue they're never-Trump partisans. They are going to try to undercut these criminal referrals. One way I'm told they're going to do that is by claiming the committee left out Trump saying -- asking for his -- the protesters to march peacefully and patriotically to the Capitol Building on the Ellipse. He did say that. And that is true that that was not played. But the committee's overarching point was that the former president knew there were armed protesters. There were people armed. He wanted them to go march on the Capitol. And he -- and he told them to go fight like hell. That was a big focus. And then, also, Trump -- team Trump is going to argue that Bennie Thompson, among others on the committee, in the past had objected to election results. It is important, though, to note the difference between that and the efforts that this committee has laid out in terms of the overall efforts to overturn the presidential elections...
