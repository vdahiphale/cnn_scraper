I'm Kim Brunhuber with CNN's Breaking News coverage of Israel at war.United Nations calls it an impossible task likely to turn a tragic situation into a calamity. Israel is telling all civilians in Gaza City to leave their homes for their own safety and protection and head southwards today. The Israeli military says Hamas' terrorists are hiding in tunnels underneath houses using people as human shields. Now, it's the clearest signal yet that Israel plans to intensify its military operations in Gaza after the Hamas terror attacks over the weekend that left 1,300 people dead. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops, tanks and other military vehicles are now gathering along the Gaza border. Meanwhile, there's enormous and worsening suffering for the civilians in Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry says there are more than 1,500 people killed by Israeli airstrikes and shelling. And without power and water, the health care system is on the brink of collapse. I spoke earlier with Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Major Doron Spielman and I asked him about that call for civilians to leave Gaza City. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: We've let the residents know that we are having -- a lot has been moving forward in Gaza City and there will be continued in the future, perhaps targeted attacks on Gaza City and therefore we're doing our best to minimize civilian casualties on their side. We wish that they had done the same thing on our side and warned our own civilians to move out of the way, but we're different from Hamas and this is just one more example.",

And so we want to move them safely out of the way. We have Israeli civilians moving out of the way on the Israeli side.

It's obvious this is why we are saying this. We've given them a window in which you've encouraged them to do this. And we very much call on all the Gazan civilians to do this because we want to minimize as much civilian life.This is, of course, as opposed to Hamas, which has put their civilians directly in the line of fire as they've done throughout past years and certainly as they're doing now.

A river is something, even you don't have a map, that bisects Gaza, they will know how to reach it. Again, Gazan civilians know where this river is and it's a clear point.

Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has asked for clarification. Israel's envoy to the U.N. has called the U.N.'s response to its early warning shameful.So that's, you know, debate is obviously ongoing and all the while Israel is continuing its strikes on the Gaza Strip to try to take out not just infrastructure and weapon storage facilities and rocket launchers, but also the very people that it holds responsible for launching this devastating and brutal attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, which of course set off this current war that we're seeing right now. At least 1,300 people inside of Israel, the vast, vast majority of them Israelis, and now what, more than 1,500 Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip have died as a result of those attacks, as I say, which began on Saturday morning. And just to update that deadline now, we're talking about 16 hours, sorry, excuse me, 12, where are we now? We're 10 hours, so 14 hours until that deadline for Palestinians in Gaza City to evacuate before that time runs out. And presumably, Israeli airstrikes will be ramped up, potentially paving the way for that expected ground invasion. Kim?",

The last time was 2014. And clearly when Israel goes into the Gaza Strip, there is a likelihood of further not just Israeli casualties but further civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip as well. And of course Israel knows that Hamas is expecting them.Hamas is not only expecting Israel to launch a ground invasion but probably would welcome it because it gives them more opportunity to inflict more casualties on Israel and also to potentially kidnap, to take hostage more Israelis as well. There will be booby traps, there will be improvised explosive devices, there will be snipers just waiting for Israel to move in. And of course there's a very sophisticated tunnel network that Hamas has underground in the Gaza Strip, Israel will no doubt have some of those mapped out, but not all of them. And so there is I think right now from where we're standing, if and when this ground invasion comes, that it will probably be worse than ones that we've seen before in terms of casualties, and the bitterness of the fighting that we have in store, Kim.",

And I think the Biden administration now realizes that is a mistake, given what they see as Iran's complicity in this Hamas attack on Israel.They say there's no direct evidence -- no compelling evidence that Iran was directly involved with Hamas in this war, but they think that over the years the support that Iran has given Hamas and Hezbollah, other terrorist organizations makes them complicit in this, and so they don't want to be seen as providing any money for whatever purpose to Iran right now. They probably sense it was a mistake to begin in this direction, given the fact that for several administrations, Iran has been seen as the number one state sponsor of terrorism. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
