Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin is speaking out publicly for the first time since the end of a short- lived insurrection which rattled his grip on power and threw the country into uncertainty.In a nationwide address, Putin lashed out at those who organized the uprising by Wagner group fighters but did not mention leader Yevgeny Prigozhin by name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): An armed rebellion would have been suppressed in any case. The organizers of the rebellion, despite the loss of adequacy, could not fail to understand this. They understood everything, including that they resorted to criminal acts to divide and weaken the country, which is now confronting a colossal external threat, unprecedented pressure from the outside.

He was last seen in public on Saturday and his whereabouts are still unknown. Prigozhin said the march was not a move to oust Putin but instead a protest.

      "sentences": "Yeah Rosemary, this was a much- billed speech by President Putin that didn't really live up to its promises. He thanked the Russian people for staying united, but I don't think that does anything to reassure people that have been rattled, shaken by events of the weekend in a way that they haven't been over the 23 years of Putin's rule over Russia. So that's one thing.I think what we did learn is that Putin now very clearly sees Prigozhin as an enemy. The fact that he didn't speak his name in itself a sign of that. He tends not to speak the names of his enemies. People like Alexei Navalny, you never hear that name come out of Putin's mouth, but he was very clear that he said those who organized the rebellion had betrayed their country and lied to their people. He was much less critical of the Wagner fighters themselves, offering them essentially a free choice, carte blanche, to do whatever they want in terms of joining the MOD, the Russian regular army, going back to their families, he said, or going to Belarus, which of course raises big questions since we know that the Kremlin says Yevgeny Prigozhin is being sent to Belarus. Does this mean we're going to get some kind of Wagner 2.0 in Belarus? We await to hear further comments today from the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko which may shed light on that. Interestingly it doesn't seem like Prigozhin has reserved as much vitriol for Putin as Putin has for Prigozhin. Prigozhin said that the march was nothing to do with trying to overthrow the government. He also didn't mention Putin. He said this was just about the protest and trying to avoid the destruction of the private military company Wagner. So that was that. I think the key thing in terms of the Kremlin's messaging is that we're getting an increased sense of inconsistency. And that is compounding the sense of chaos in the country. As I said, the Kremlin had billed Putin's speech according to state media, quoting the Kremlin's spokesperson before the speech as something that would determine the fate of Russia. [03:05:06] When that did not materialize, the Kremlin walked that back, accused those reporting it of reporting fake news. So I think the messaging around this really shows. The sort of narrative is slipping away from Putin to some degree. Rosemary.",

He went with a column of 25,000 heavily armored men. Very loyal to him, very set on this goal, and they blinked. And now Wagner is being somewhat dissolved. Prigozhin is exiled to Belarus, and Putin is still in charge.

So maybe in the South, closer to the war, people feel more, I don't know, more closer to him. In places like the Capitol, people were clearly scared of him. People in the Capitol tend to, a lot of them have their lives tied up with Putin and the regime he created. It's why you didn't see any of them join, at least publicly, Prigozhin's coup. They all sat around and waited to see who would ultimately win. And I think there was a real sense of relief when Prigozhin blinked and turned around, because they understand who Prigozhin is, and that change might be to be not that kind of change (inaudible).",
