So, if it's not today, it does need to be sometime in the upcoming days, likely this week.But here's what's holding them up. Because they need to release these tax returns without any personal information of the former president, they've had to do heavy redactions on a lot of these documents. And that's taking a little more time than maybe some had expected. What could we learn from these tax returns? One thing that we're going to look for is that it's not just about the tax returns themselves, but it's also about the fact that they are going to releasing other documents potentially related to audits or any other work files that the IRS had on these tax returns. So, that is going to be something that could be a treasure trove of information how the IRS looked at the former president's tax returns, Jessica. So, a lot of information we are waiting for up here on Capitol Hill today. Will it come today? I think that's the big question, but it does have to come very soon, Jessica.",

What we do know is that the New York district attorney was actively investigating that very question, and Mr. Bright closed down that investigation.It's possible that the tax information that is released may restart that investigation, but I actually have to think that he had it already before he closed down the investigation. To not have gotten it before closing the investigation would have been irresponsible. So, it seems likely that even though there are indications of financial structuring that are beyond the capabilities of most ordinary people, that the responsible authorities have already kind of taken a pass on this.",

The passage of time doesn't stop. If the Department of Justice is going to act, it probably has to act in the first, maybe the second quarter of 2023, in order to avoid interfering with the election of 2024 too much.
