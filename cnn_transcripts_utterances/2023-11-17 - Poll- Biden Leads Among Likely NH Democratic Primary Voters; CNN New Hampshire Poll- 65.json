      "sentences": "Breaking this morning, some good news and some bad news for the President. A new CNN poll finds Joe Biden with a massive leadin the New Hampshire primary, even though he will not appear on the ballot there. Still, more than half of Democrats say the President's age is their greatest concern. Plus, Congressman Ken Buck joins me live. I'm going to ask him about Israel's war against Hamas, Republican actual fights in Congress, and who he will endorse in 2024. And could a third-party ticket actually stand a chance against Biden and Trump? Which one would they torpedo? I'll put that question to Joe Cunningham, the National Director of No Labels. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, November 17, 59 days until the Iowa caucuses, and 353 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Happy Friday. First here on State of the Race, new polling from CNN and the University of New Hampshire shows Joe Biden cruising to a win in the Granite State's Democratic primary despite the fact that his name will not be on the ballot there. Here is what we've learned. Most likely, primary voters say they'll support the President at the polls as a write-in, and that Biden has the best shot at winning the White House again. But, you can see all of the usual difficulties for the President in these numbers. Among adults in New Hampshire, the President's approval ratings are tough, although they're worse for the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump. Then of course there is the President's age. It is the top concern among likely Democratic primary voters, even more so than performance, much, much more so than performance and electability. Let's dive into all this with today's panel. Kevin Madden, a Republican Strategist, former Advisor to Mitt Romney. Karen Finney is a CNN Political Commentator and Democratic Strategist, and Laura Barron-Lopez is a CNN Political Analyst and the White House Correspondent for the PBS NewsHour. Thank you guys for being here, especially on a Friday morning. Karen, I want to dig into some of these numbers with you, because New Hampshire, clearly the President is the frontrunner. I don't -- I haven't heard anyone talk about any realistic chances that he is going to lose in an -- in a New Hampshire primary. But, he does have to write in his name on the ballot. And you can see in the numbers, 65 percent say that they want to vote for Biden. That's 35 percent, and we're like, really love the President. What do you take away from some of this information here, and some texture on what people are concerned about as well?",

But, when you have one third that are dissatisfied or angry about Joe Biden's performance right now, and the idea of having him as a nominee, it is a huge problem. It is not time to panic. But, it is time for any Democratic strategists who are looking towards November of 2024 to think we have to come up with a plan.

I heard a lot of that when I was up there, but they're less pleased with Donald Trump. We -- in this poll, it seems as though we asked voters to just tell us what kind of problems you have with this nominee? Obviously, we told you that the biggest one that came up with Biden was an age and fitness for office bucket. But, look at this list that they came up with for President Trump. The biggest group, 16 percent said none, but then we have attacks by media opponents, ability to win general election, indictments or imprisonment, divisive/unpopular, undermine/destroy democracy, bombastic, general character concerns. If you think that's not enough, let's keep going. Results in election fraud, narcissistic or self-obsessed, incompetence, dishonesty, potential violence against him, chaos or drama, do not want as President, and retribution in a second term.

And he is only focused on his own grievances, when the American people want their problems addressed and they want to plan for the future.

Only 20 percent have a positive view of Trump's. His honesty and integrity, Biden comes out ahead, understanding people like you, that number that Kevin was just talking about, that's a little closer. And then it starts to switch here a little bit, policy decision making, communication skills. And then there is that physical and mental fitness question, just 25 percent give Biden a positive ranking for that. What do you see in some of these comparisons? BARRON-LOPEZ: I think that on that temperament, that's something that reminds me a lot of 2020, because when I was in swing states like Arizona and Georgia, there were so many Republicans or Republicans-turned independents that I talked to, that our margin voters and they were the ones that were saying I can't vote for Republicans anymore. I can't vote for Donald Trump, because of that temperament, because of what they saw as his threats, his threat to democracy. And now I think there is more of them, because, again, this is post January 6, and I've talked to some of them since and they bring that up as -- I actually switched my registration from Republican to independent after that happened.

Andthat's on top of the time they were already surrounding and moving towards the hospital itself since the ground incursion began. The key question for Israel and Israel's credibility, the IDF's credibility, was essentially at stake on this question. Is there Hamas infrastructure underneath the hospital? Was Hamas using what is supposed to be the sanctuary of the hospital on top to protect its own network of tunnels underneath? And that's why the video they put out is so important. It is not definitive, definitive, but we have been able to geolocate the video that they put out of a tunnel shaft to the Al-Shifa Hospital complex itself. They say this is an operational tunnel belonging to Hamas. They had been backed up at least on the broader claim by the U.S., which says they have their own intelligence that Hamas was using the hospital as cover for their own infrastructure and network underground. But, this isn't definitive in and of itself. We don't know what's on the other side of that tunnel shaft. We don't know how extensive it is, if it's part of the hospital in some way, or if it is what the IDF has said all along the beginning of what they hope to reveal more of, which is a network of tunnels, command and control node, a headquarters underneath the hospital itself. And Kasie, it's worth noting, this is effectively a black and white question. It's either there or it's not. There is not really a spectrum here on which this could happen. Doctors and health officials in the Hamas- run enclave have repeatedly denied the accusations, and said this is a medical center, the Al-Shifa hospital complex, the largest in Gaza, and Hamas doesn't use it. So, that is their claim, as the IDF continues to operate and tries to uncover more of what's underneath, which is why this is so important, as we wait to find out more from the military. Kasie.",

So, considering that where we are right now with all Trump's indictments and the economy doing pretty well and the fact that Biden is losing to Trump, is concerning. It's concerning to me. It's concerning to a lot of Democrats who are begging for another option in the Democratic primary. It's concerning to independents and to Republicans as well.

That number drops down like 15 percent for Biden. That leads a very, very large opportunity. The biggest assumption that folks will make in saying that this will help out Trump or throw it one way or another is that Trump's base is impermeable, and the same people who have been calling us a spoiler or saying that we will impact it and vote for Trump, these are oftentimes the same people who said Robert Kennedy would be a spoiler if he got in as an independent. And we've seen in the last couple of weeks with Robert Kennedy taking more votes from Trump than from Biden.

But, we've been at this for about a year and a half, and we're on a dozen states right now, look to be in play in over 20 states by the end of the year.
