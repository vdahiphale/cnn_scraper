U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to speak with Democratic governors and congressional leaders in the hours ahead as concerns mount over his re-election bid following a poor debate performance.At a fundraiser in Virginia, Mr. Biden blamed that performance on a tough travel schedule, saying he almost fell asleep on stage. Reporters who were in the room believe that line was intended to be a joke. But so far, there's been little to quiet concerns. Mr. Biden's approval rating hit a new low following the debate. A new CNN poll shows it dipped to 36 percent. In an effort to calm concerns, Mr. Biden is expected to sit down for an interview with ABC News this week. This comes as the first Democratic lawmaker publicly asked the President to step aside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): I salute President Biden. I just feel that it's time for him to step aside if we were to be able to protect what he allowed us to in 2020, which was a victory for democracy. But he delivered us from Trump then. He could be delivering us to Trump this year if we had more of what happened last Thursday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So the fact that he acknowledged the next day that he did not have a great performance and that he's a little older, doesn't walk as quickly or speak as smoothly as he used to, I think was an acknowledgement that, yes, that may be the case, but he's still fully capable of doing the job. And we have seen him so far in several events since then, where he was vigorous, he was focused, and he made the point that he is not Donald Trump in that he respects America, he respects our democracy, he doesn't lie to the American people, and doesn't have any desire to be a dictator on day one. And I think that Democrats need to keep this in perspective. It sounds, in theory, let's just replace him, we just remove the incumbent, and we'll put somebody else new there.
