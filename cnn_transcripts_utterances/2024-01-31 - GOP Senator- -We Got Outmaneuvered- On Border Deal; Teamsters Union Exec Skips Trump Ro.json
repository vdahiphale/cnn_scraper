And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, outmaneuvered. That is how a Republican senator is describing what is happening to his party on the border bill that right now is essentially dead on arrival on the -- in the House, a border bill that would affect this entire country. Democrats are seeing an opportunity and they're wasting no time tonight in piling on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

That's just not going to happen.And Democratic Congressman Greg Casar said, and I quote him: It's bad immigration policy. It's bad for our economy. It's not humane. It's bad for Americans.
