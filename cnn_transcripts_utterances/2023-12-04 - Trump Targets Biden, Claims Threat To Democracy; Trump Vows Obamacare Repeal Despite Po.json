He has gone over and over again to criticize the election, which is the democratic process, not just in 2020, but just the process overall. But this is a bit of projection, as you said. Now, his main reasoning, the crux of his argument, is that Biden is using the Justice Department to essentially persecute a political enemy, that enemy, of course, being Donald Trump.Now, what is so interesting about this is that Donald Trump has said on the record publicly that he, if reelected, would use the Justice Department to go after his enemies. Now, some of that argument, he says, is because Biden did it, but also saying that he, too, would do this. Now, in terms of who this resonates with, well, his supporters cheer for him. They do believe that this is political persecution. They do believe that it is a two-tiered justice system. And they do believe that it is a two-tiered justice system. And they do believe that it is a two-tiered justice system. Does it go beyond that? Likely not. But this is clearly his version of trying to turn the tables and say, no, I'm not the problem.

When it comes to electability and the argument on electability, when that argument was first being made in 2022, right around the midterms, right after the midterms, when Donald Trump really, even though he wasn't on the ballot, lost so many of his candidates that he had supported lost.People really believe that argument. And I think Republicans, even his supporters, believe that argument that he was not electable in a general election, that he could not beat Joe Biden. I do think that time and the kind of the media climate and polarization of this country have changed that. Even if it is not true that Donald Trump could win in a general, which we just don't know right now, obviously, they don't believe that Biden can win in a general election. They are so unsatisfied with the current president that they believe any of the Republican candidates could beat Joe Biden. So that argument is just not as strong, particularly about Donald Trump.

And I talked to one of those moderate Republicans, Don Bacon. He's someone who's been very skeptical of impeachment. And he told me that he would vote in support of opening this inquiry. But others have been a lot more skeptical, have not said where they would vote. So this is going to be a critical week for GOP leadership in whipping those votes and getting the necessary support.Now, they did have a special conference meeting last Friday where a bunch of GOP committee chairmen and leaders made their case behind closed doors for why they believe it is time for them to officially vote to authorize this inquiry that's already been going on for a few months. They say this would strengthen their hand in court. They argue that the White House has been stonewalling them, but the White House has forcefully pushed back on those claims. So, these next two weeks are going to be critical. Like I said, Speaker Mike Johnson also, I'm told, talked at a New York fundraiser over the weekend in front of donors about impeachment. Clearly, they are not shying away from this. He vowed to hold a vote before the end of this year, but they're going to have the votes before they ultimately get there. And in the meantime, Speaker Mike Johnson has really been trying to wrangle the hardliners in his conference. Of course, impeachment is something they have been pushing for, so this could be a way to placate some of those members. But Marjorie Taylor Greene has been one of the most outspoken critics in the party. She's been criticizing some of her fellow Republicans for not getting on board with some other impeachment efforts, including to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security Secretary. Our Manu Raju caught up with her just last weekend. Let's hear what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R- GA): And I'll remind everyone that I didn't come here to make friends. I came here to do a job, and I represent my district, and I unapologetically represent the American people. As far as other members of Congress, if they're upset with me, they can come talk to me anytime they like. But my position will be that we need to be doing the jobs that we promise our voters and that we tell people we're going to do instead of just talking tough on the campaign trail and coming up here and falling apart.

And that's why they have to have almost all Republicans vote to start this impeachment inquiry, because we're not expecting House Democrats to vote for it.They're arguing that this is just the next step. It's a formal step. And there are some Republicans who are already sort of dismissing the idea of actually taking the next step of formal impeachment.
