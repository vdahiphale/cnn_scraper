We haven't heard anything like this. What we now need to see is, OK, what comes next from this? There have been a lot of Republicans grumbling privately, some publicly about Trump and his impact on the elections over the past week. The \"what next\" question is where Republicans need to decide, is it going to be the continuation of Donald Trump as the leading figure in the party or will they turn in another direction, whether that's Ron DeSantis or Mike Pence or whomever that may be?

We know anybody who crosses Donald Trump, whether real or made up, is somebody that Donald Trump is then going to be personally very critical of and insulting and all the juvenile comments that we get from Trump. Sometimes racist, of course, whether that's about Mitch McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, or someone else. So we know what Donald Trump does.

Researchers say the record highs started even before the pandemic.Hospitalizations for suicidal thoughts jumped nearly 60 percent between the fall of 2019 and the fall of 2020. Some of the cases involved children as young as 5 years old. Joining us now is one of the co-authors of the study, Dr. Audrey Brewer. She's an advanced general pediatrics and primary care physician at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. Dr. Brewer, thanks so much for being here. There's so much that's shocking in this study. Can we just start with the 5-year-olds. So 5-year-olds having suicidal thoughts, what's that look like? What do they say to the doctors when they go to the emergency room? DR. AUDREY BREWER, ADVANCED GENERAL PEDIATRICS &amp; PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: Thank you so much for having me. I think, like you mentioned, just thinking about 5-year-olds coming in with thoughts of wanting to kill themselves or thoughts of death. It's very concerning when we think about that. Kids are coming in for various different reasons or concerns, and things they've said, whether to their parents or other caregivers or even someone at school.

I would say 00 and I've said this a lot -- it's definitely multifactorial for sure, leading to a lot of these concerns amongst kids in terms of illness.

And if a parent isn't feeling comfortable about having these conversations, of course, external pediatricians like myself and others, we're definitely here to be able to provide resources and counseling support to our families that are struggling and they don't know necessarily how to approach talking to their kids. But I also think, as parents, it's definitely important to sort of validate your kids' concerns. Oftentimes, kids are looking for their parents to listen. Often, we don't do that enough. I think it's important to really normalize what's going on with our kids and to not put stigmas behind it. And also just thinking about ways that we can support our families and thinking about relational health and focusing in on encouraging the parent-child relationship. So building positive relationships, help kids to thrive as well as helping families to thrive. So providing different resources for families is definitely important.",
