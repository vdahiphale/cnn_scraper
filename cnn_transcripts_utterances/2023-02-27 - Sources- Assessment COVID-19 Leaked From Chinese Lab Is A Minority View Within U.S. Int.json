In fact, one of the lead researchers in the lab there in Wuhan is Shi Zhengli, known as the \"bat lady.\" She is known as that because she has been studying bats and coronaviruses really since the days of SARS, so for some 20 years. So that is not new information.What I think we need to know is, were the coronaviruses that were being studied in the lab similar, identical or related to the virus that caused COVID? You want to look at the actual viruses and do genetic sequencing of those viruses. Another thing that you could do, Alisyn is there were blood samples that were taken from workers in the lab at that time. If you are able to go back and look at those blood samples and say, did they show antibodies to the COVID virus, then that would be another pretty definitive piece of data. And then, you know, you would obviously want to have a complete forensics investigation of the lab. But it is these things, these types of things that we don't have still. That has been the lack of transparency that so many people have been talking about. I think the answer to the question, I think, everybody is answering in knowable, but we don't know it because we don't have all the data.",

So, you have a very poor state, you have a white leadership in the state level, you have Black leaders in the city level, and you don't have any industry in which you can actually begin to think about getting people out of poverty.
