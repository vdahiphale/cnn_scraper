Who has Trump's ear as the hunt for a running mate intensifies? And a judge in New Mexico is weighing whether to throw out the criminal case involving the actor, Alec Baldwin. We'll bring you the latest developments on the hearing underway right now. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. This hour, a lot of questions about when and how Judge Aileen Cannon will rule after a day-long hearing on one of the many attempts by Donald Trump to delay his trial in the classified documents case in Florida. Let's go right to CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez. He's covering the hearing for us in Fort Pierce, Florida, just north of Palm Beach. Evan, you were inside the court today. How did Judge Cannon handle today's important hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this was a very unusual hearing in the first place, and Judge Cannon had some very sharp questions for the government, for the prosecution. She questioned the prosecutors about what specific actions the attorney general, Merrick Garland, oversaw, actions that were taken by Jack Smith, the special counsel. She wanted to know, for instance, whether the attorney general specifically and personally approved the indictment, this indictment against Donald Trump and a couple of other people who worked for him here in Fort Pierce.And she also questioned Trump's attorneys when Trump's attorneys Emil Bovee said that he believed that Jack Smith was essentially a shadow government. The argument that they were making here today, Wolf, was that Jack Smith was illegally appointed by the attorney general because he came from outside the government. He's not someone who has been approved by the Senate. This is a long shot request, but it is one that the judge, for some reason, decided needed to be heard, needed to have an entire hearing, and she also allowed outside parties, groups that had nothing to do with this case, to actually spend a couple of hours making arguments before her today. She did not rule from the bench, as she tends to not do, but it is clear, Wolf, that she is entertaining pretty much every argument that Donald Trump and his attorneys have to make.",

Now, the special counsel is asking for the court to issue a gag order on the former president, because of some of the incendiary remarks he has made accusations, he has made, the government says that he's putting FBI agents at risk. This is all over the search of Mar-a-Lago back in 2022.She's also going to have a hearing on Tuesday where Trump attorneys are trying to get some of the evidence that was seized in that search at Mar-a-Lago, have that tossed aside as part of their efforts again to try to delay this case or to try to make sure that it never goes to trial at all, Wolf. All of this, of course, these delays that we're getting as a result of the judge entertaining pretty much every one of these, is what's eating away at this calendar. It makes it very, very unlikely that we're going to get a trial anytime soon, but certainly not before November.",

And based on what Aileen Cannon has done, Norm made the point, overcautious, methodical at some level, having hearings on everything, even if it diverges from how the court usually operates down there, it just gives the Trump team what they want, which is you continue to push it further down the calendar.

This is one of the biggest questions on presidential power that the Supreme Court has contemplated in recent years.And in the lower courts, this idea for the former president has some sort of immunity or broad immunity has been completely rejected. But what was interesting is even those sources in Trump world didn't expect that this would be accepted by the high court, during oral arguments, the justices seemed open to at least recognizing even some limited immunity for presidents, which would mean this whole case goes back down to the lower courts. And a lot of folks have been asking, well, why is it taking them so long? They've been in no hurry to move on this. Jack Smith asked them to decide this question back in December. Instead, they waited for it to go through the appellate process, arrive at them. And now we're in the last week. What we expect will maybe be the last week, and we're still waiting on this decision.

We're going to have to wait until we see. But no matter what, I think the important point is that, just like the classified documents case, it is going to kick this even farther down the road.

One of them is obstruction. Depending on how this case goes, this could potentially impact the case against the former president. When you talk to his lawyers, they refer to this case and the immunity case as, quote, our cases. But to Phil's point, I think while these cases all potentially have an impact on the former president, when it comes to the election, the outstanding abortion case out of Idaho, depending on what the justices do there, that decision could have the biggest impact on the election in terms of galvanizing voters.",

I'm told that at a dinner that he held with top Wall Street financiers on the night of his criminal conviction, that he went around the room and asked each of the roughly two dozen attendees who they would pick for vice president and why.I'm told that there was some support for Doug Burgum, the former North Dakota governor. There was some support for Senator Tim Scott. There was some support for Senator J.D. Vance. There was even one attendee, I'm told, who vouched for one-time Trump cabinet official and his most recent GOP primary challenger, Nikki Haley, to which Trump was just silent and scowled. But Senator Marco Rubio, I'm told was the informal winner of this straw poll. He received the most votes from the attendees at this donor dinner, and they cited one reason in particular. They believed that were something to happen to President Donald Trump who is 78 years old, that the 53-year-old Rubio, a seasoned politician and candidate himself with a strong Latino background who could help them in some states like Nevada, that he would easily be able to step into that job. So, it's clear that Rubio is one of the favorites of the donor class, but it's not clear that that is going to be Trump's pick because influential right wing voices in the Republican Party have been urging him to pick Senator J.D. Vance. Among those individuals, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, and his own son, Donald Trump Jr. And then there is the Murdoch empire, which has been lobbying behind the scenes for Doug Burgum, touting his business bona fides.

LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, we really don't expect to see President Biden in public much, if at all, the next couple of days, as he's going to be hunkered down at Camp David with a small group of advisers to really do intensive debate preparations. The team is expected to go through really anything and everything that could come up on that debate stage, a wide range of policy issues, but also the full range of potential insults and attacks that could come their way from Donald Trump, including insults that are directed at members of the Biden family. And then, of course, as we get closer to Thursday night, we expect the Biden team will do full run throughs of the debate. And just to give you a sense of what those mock debates might look like at Camp David, Bob Bauer, who is the president's personal attorney, who is expected to once again play the role of Donald Trump at these mock debates, he said on CNN earlier today that the person who is playing Trump really needs to recreate the experience of what it is like to go up against Donald Trump, but at the same time, avoid being too fully theatrical, that that could actually end up being distracting. Now, all of this, of course, Wolf, sort of boils down to one overarching goal for the Biden team, and that is to make the case to the audience that is tuning in, you have two choices come November. It is me and it is Donald Trump, and I am the better alternative. And this was Vice President Kamala Harris earlier today talking about what she said was a binary choice. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Joe Biden and this debate will make clear the contrast. You know, of the many issues in our country and our world that are complex and nuanced, November of 2024 is binary.

That's according to the U.S. State Department. They offer their condolences, but they're not saying anything more due to sensitivities and privacy surrounding those deaths. But multiple Americans have been killed. It has been an extraordinarily hot year for the Hajj when Muslims from all around the world make their way to Mecca, the holiest site in all of Islam.Temperatures peaked earlier 125 degrees on Monday, that's 51.8 degrees Celsius, the hottest day in Mecca's history. So far, the death toll is right around 500 people, and we have seen scenes, disturbing scenes. I have to warn our viewers of video coming in from Mecca with some of those who died on the side of the road. Pilgrims who go to Mecca walk around the city. They spend days there. Many of them are sleeping in tents at night. And you can see there some of the casualties from this heat. The estimated death toll right now is around 500 people from all around the world, but it could double that. There are countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia that have not yet reported their death tolls.",

What the Baldwin team has alleged is that while the gun was being tested by the FBI, this was the gun that Alec Baldwin was holding back in 2021 when it went off, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Baldwin claimed that the FBI testing destroyed that gun, which means that they're not able to recreate whatever that testing was. Of course, the gun itself, a key piece of evidence because the FBI determined it could not have gone off unless someone actually pulled the trigger.Now, there was a separate motion to dismiss that the judge said, no, we're not going to do that. But we're waiting on this one motion here, which could come at any moment. And then, separately, the armorer on the the set of the movie, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the person responsible for firearm safety, she was previously convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the judge ruling today that they will not grant her what's called use immunity. She could still be called to testify in Baldwin's trial, but she can't be asked any questions that might incriminate her. So, a busy development in court today.",

And what they claim is that Actor Alec Baldwin had been engaged in a pattern of unsafe practices. They claim that based on a review of video evidence that they obtained on the set of the movie, that Baldwin was using the gun as a pointer, that he was engaged in what they referred to as horseplay at one point while setting up for a scene, allegedly fired a blank round at a crew member. Of course, Alec Baldwin has denied all of all of that, saying there weren't unsafe practices. He's pleaded not guilty.But all that tracks with what the initial prosecutor in the case told me early on whenever the charges were first brought.

This case happened just after midnight on Wednesday morning, and thisis the doorbell video into CNN. It shows Southwest Flight 4069 on approach to land at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City. About nine miles away from the airport, in the town of Yukon, Oklahoma, the plane was lined up to land on the runway that point southeast and the data from Flight Radar 24, says the flight got down to 525 feet above ground level. Let's put it in context. It's about 1-1/2 football fields, only four lengths of the 737 itself or the height of the Washington monument, half the height of the Empire State Building. The point is very low for that distance from the airport. The FAA says a minimum safe altitude warning or MSAW alert sounded at the control tower, prompting the air traffic controller to issue Southwest 4069 low altitude alert. Listen here.

Nothing is more important to southwest than the safety of our customers and employees. The question here is how this could happen. Did the pilots improperly configured their instruments like in the crash of a Korean Air flight in Guam in 1997 or were they simply fatigue after a really long day? Remember, this flight was coming in after midnight and pilots I talked to you say they'd been worked especially hard lately, big questions here for investigators.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's an alleged gang-rape that has sent shockwaves through France. That over 12-year-old Jewish girl who is heading home in a Paris suburb on Saturday afternoon when three boys, all 12 and 13 years old, approached her and forced her into this abandoned building according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, citing police sources. As two of the three boys allegedly raped her, antisemitic insults were also allegedly used, including calling her a, quote, dirty Jew. Two of the boys have been taken to custody, according to the local prosecutor. It comes at a critical time in France with an election call to test the rise of the right but that has put the future of the government itself on the line, an attack that has sparked intense political debate on antisemitism, further heightened by Israel's war in Gaza. President Emmanuel Macron has condemned a scourge of antisemitism that he says is festering in French schools. According to France's interior ministry, antisemitic incidents in France rose 284 percent from 2022 to 2023. But this attack has brought demonstrators to Paris's city hall.
