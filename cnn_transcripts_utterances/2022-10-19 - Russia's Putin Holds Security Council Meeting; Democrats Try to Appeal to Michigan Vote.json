This is a key southern city they seized just after the beginning of the invasion. The commander appeared to suggest that the Russian hold on that strategic city is tenuous at best. And we learned moments ago the Russians have started evacuating civilians further away from the line there.",

But what appears to be happening is the mass evacuation of civilians to the sort of left bank, if you will, on the Dnipro River, to try to, in the words of Russian authorities, move these people to safety because there's some huge Ukrainian attack anticipated. Although Ukrainian authorities are saying that that's ludicrous and that it's propaganda and they aren't planning any kind of attack, particularly not on civilian infrastructure or civilian targets.But nonetheless, we do start to see the beginning of this civilian evacuation. I think the question that everybody is asking is, does this now presage or portend a larger troop evacuation? Are we going to see Russian forces start to withdraw from Kherson? That would obviously be hugely significant for a number of reasons, not least because it's the only regional capital that they have held since the beginning of the war. So, everyone watching very closely, and judging by those comments from Russia's top general, Surovikin, who used to be in charge, that was his area of operation, Kherson, in that interview, he really acknowledged the difficulties and challenges that Russian forces have been facing as the Ukrainians have carried out a series of successful counteroffensives. So, everyone now keeping a really close eye to see what happens there, because it will have a huge impact on this war.",

Speculation is that potentially it could be a declaration of martial law. It could be a declaration of further mobilization. But I want to caution people that we really don't know anything until we know exactly what will be said in that meeting. Because we've seen this before where there's anticipation that there's going to be big news, there's going to be a big announcement, and then one isn't actually forthcoming.

So, this was just a very unusual thing to see up close and up front after all the denials that we've heard from Russia. Yesterday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, saying that only Russian weapons with Russian numbers are being used here in Ukraine. The Iranians also coming and saying, we have not been supplying any weapons to the Russians. And yet we were taken to see an Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone. It's a large drone, much bigger than the sort of kamikaze Shahed 136s that have been the focus of a lot of attention recently. And, essentially, this drone kind of works in conjunction with those Shaheds. It's part reconnaissance but also can carry up to four war heads. And what this military officer who told us that is particularly alarming is that they're now anticipating the Iranians are preparing to give the Russians another new generation of drones known as the Arash 2, those capable of carrying five times the amounts of explosives of the Shahed 136 drones.

Her understanding was that felons had their rights restored. Oliver pleaded not guilty to the illegal voting charge and has a trial set for December.These were the first arrests by Governor Ron DeSantis' the newly formed Florida Office of Election Crimes and Securities, which was an agency created to probe alleged voting irregularities. Almost immediately, after the charges were filed, questions surfaced about whether the individual knew they were violating the law by voting. CNN affiliate WPLG spoke to one of the individuals arrested, Ronald Miller. ROBERT MILLER, MIAMI RESIDENT, ACCUSED OF VIOLATING FLORIDA'S VOTING LAWS:  I got it out the mailbox thinking that my rights were restored, as the guy told, me when I had filled the paper out.

Democrats have been driving abortion rights as an important voting issue. Republicans bringing the focus back to the economy and inflation.So, let's discuss this now with Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. I know that you're watching what your party is doing. You always have constructive criticism. So, I wonder, what do you think the Republican Party, these candidates should be doing that they're not doing? GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, I think what you've seen is a shift of the Republican candidates into really talking about the issues that you just identified, of inflation, violent crimes, those things that are impacting our families. And as a result, you're seeing that there's some momentum on the Republican side. I'm more optimistic now than I was three months ago. And so today, we're focusing on that as well with our Idea Summit three weeks out from the election. We've got to be talking about ideas that make a difference in people's lives and whether that is (INAUDIBLE) or whether is dealing with inflation and crime, border security. This is what people care about when we move up in the polls.",

My wife is from Atlanta, and so I have some connections there. And I think it's obviously going to be tight.
