      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper.In the New York hush money cover up case, Michael Cohen on the stand facing more questions about the many lies from his past. Sources told CNN yesterday that the defense wanted to paint Cohen as a, quote, \"liar\" today. And that indeed was theme addressed today. Cohen's lying to Congress in 2017, lying in a tax evasion case in 2018, lying to a federal judge about that case in 2018. Does the prosecution have an airtight case? I'll let my next guests debate that. Also ahead, did these University of Michigan protesters cross the line? Masked anti-Israel activists putting fake corpses and bloodied stuffed animals outside the homes of several regents at the university? One regent who woke up to a list of demands on his door will join me this hour. Plus, the latest in our series homeless in America. City and park service employees closing homeless encampments in Washington, D.C. Today, I went out to see their efforts. Are they fixing a problem or just chasing it a few blocks away? But let's start with Donald Trump's hush money cover up trial in Manhattan, where the defense went after Michael Cohen and his past lies under oath, even suggesting that some of his testimony in this current trial has been dishonest. Cohen's cross examination will continue on Monday, we're told. CNN's Paula Reid is outside the courthouse. And Paula, the defense challenged Cohen's memory that he testified about just earlier this week about this October 24, 2016 phone call. Cohen said that call was with Trump about the hush money reimbursement. But tell us about how the defense tried to undermine that today.",

      "sentences": "So the first thing they did is they brought up exactly what he said under direct examination by prosecutors. When he was asked, why did you need to speak with Trump at that point in the evening of October 24? Cohen testified, to discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it. \"And did you have an understanding about whether during that conversation you resolved that, you were moving forward to fund the deal?\" \"Yes,\" Cohen said.And the reason this was significant evidence for prosecutors is that this suggests that Trump was aware of this conspiracy to conceal this hush money payment to Stormy Daniels in the days leading up to the election. There's also new evidence. This is not something that we'd ever heard previously. But today, Todd Blanche came with receipts and he pointed to a log, a timeline of events from that day where that evening Michael Cohen texted Keith Schiller, so Trump's body man, about prank phone calls that he had been getting from a teenager. Schiller then tells Cohen to call him. Cohen then calls Shiller and they have a 92nd conversation. The defense attorneys, of course, asked, OK, why are we supposed to believe that you called him after that exchange when you have a 14- year-old prankster who's begging you not to stick the secret service on them? We see these receipts, we see this evidence. Why would we think that 92nd call was about Stormy Daniels? Cohen responded saying that part of the call with Schiller was about the 14 year old. But I know that Keith was with Trump at the time, and there was potentially more than this. Now he says, \"That was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump. You talked to Keith Schiller, you can admit it.\" Cohen replied, \"No, sir, I don't know that is accurate.\" And at one point in this exchange, Cohen kind of fell back just saying, look, I don't recall. But this was a significant blow to Michael Cohen's credibility about this specific phone call because, again, they came with records and Michael Cohen has never testified to this before. So in terms of sowing seeds of doubt about this significant piece of evidence, it appears that Todd Blanche was incredibly significant. So, Jake, over the next three day weekend, prosecutors have from this case, you can bet they're trying to brainstorm ways to clean this up.",

This is one person who did so in the middle of the night. It is not peaceful protest. And let me remind you that this university has taken a very hands off approach in allowing some freedom of speech to occur on our campus. I don't like some of the language. Globalizing the intifada is personally offensive to me. But there's a certain level where you have to understand these are kids, and sometimes they do things and they say things that might be offensive. The flip side of that is that once you show up to my house, that is no longer a peaceful protest. You are looking to intimidate, not be part of our political system in this country.",

In a sweeping statement, the two despots say they aligned on energy and trade and security and geopolitics, with specific references to Ukraine, Taiwan and the Middle East. Russia's economy has become increasingly reliant on China's since Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022. And on the subject of Ukraine, Russia does not have the number of troops it needs for a, quote, strategic breakthrough in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, according to a senior NATO commander today. Still, Russia's recent surprise cross border assault is causing immense anxiety on the ground as Ukraine accuses Russia of blocking civilians from evacuating towns near Kharkiv, where there is intense ongoing fighting.

It's a border town, and it's where so much Russian force has been applied. We saw inside there ourselves tanks, Ukrainian tanks. We saw blown to pieces. U.S. supplied Humvees, flipped over. Literally every street, it seemed to be aflame.We traveled with the Ukrainian police unit trying to evacuate one of 35 groups of families they said wanted to get out that morning. They took three people out with them, including an 85-year-old lady, Maria, hard of hearing, could barely hear the constant explosions around her but still wanted to get out. Let me just tell you behind us here, because all of this violence north in Vovchans'k is really about trying to exert influence on Kharkiv here, Ukraine's second largest city. In the last hours, we've been hearing pretty constant explosions behind us. I say constant, probably about probably single figures still at this point. But reports of drones, missiles that we've been hearing, we've seen anti-aircraft fire. We can't go into too much detail. But still another sign of the intense pressure Russia is trying to put upon Kharkiv and why they're aiming at border towns like Vovchans'k. Now, the civilians being pulled out of there at extraordinary numbers. And it's clear to say intense fighting inside the city. From what we were hearing, the Russians appear to have got into the north of it. They're still separated from Ukrainian forces by a river, but the distance between them is getting smaller and smaller. And the small arms fire, we heard ourselves suggesting that there are street to street clashes potentially between both sides. But elsewhere, Russia's seeing other success in this northern area. Remember, Jake, this is not another front line that's been contested for years, suddenly seeing a change. This is a completely new offensive by Russia occurring to the north of Kharkiv here, the second biggest city of Ukraine and pushing pretty fast, frankly taking the most territory that we've seen since the initial days of the invasion, so quite startling progress. And that's reflected in the volatility of tonight here in the city. Jake?",

D.C.'s annual the point in time count found homelessness went up 14 percent just last year. Today, city officials tried to clear out several encampments, and they say they will clear more out in the coming weeks. Hundreds of people who are homeless will be moved from their encampments. But does that solve the homelessness problem in any real way?As part of our Homeless in America series, I visited one of those camps with workers on the front lines of the crisis who think that what D.C. and the Park Service did today is actually, in some ways, going to make the problem worse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WESLEY THOMAS, ADVOCACY SPEAKER, MIRIAM'S KITCHEN: The average American is only one paycheck away from being right here. TAPPER (voice-over): Just blocks from Washington, D.C.'s most picturesque landmarks, a community of roughly 70 people is being torn down. The residents scattered. It's on both federal and city land. And now the city and the National Park Service are both saying these people have to leave. ADAM ROCAP, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, MIRIAM'S KITCHEN: Our outreach team has been working diligently for, you know, months, helping people prepare, thinking about where you want to go, walking them through the shelter options. But there's nothing major. All the shelters are mostly full. We're doing everything we can to try to get people a solution. But for most people, there's nothing definite that it's being offered. TAPPER (voice-over): Staffers from the non-profit Miriam's Kitchen have been going tent to tent, trying to help. This is one of seven such encampments around Washington, D.C., that will be cleared in the next few weeks.
