Plus, another high note for the U.S. economy as a December jobs report comes in above expectations. What does this mean for the Fed's inflation policy? And Prince Harry begged his father not to marry Camilla, that and more revelations about his relationship with Prince William and other royals are coming up in his memoir. I'm Eleni Giokos. Hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. We are live from Dubai. Now CNN observed artillery fire from both sides in eastern Ukraine after the start of Russia's temporary ceasefire for Orthodox Christmas. And air raid sirens blared in Kyiv earlier. The streets of the capital appearing more or less normal on Orthodox Christmas eve. Ukraine's top officials dismissed the ceasefire as hypocrisy shortly after it was announced Thursday. A Ukrainian official in Luhansk is even warning locals not to attend Christmas services, calling the ceasefire another lie and trap. Here is what Ukraine's president had to say about it in his nightly address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE (through translator): Those who continued the terror against our country and sent all those people of yours to the slaughter, rejecting our offers to stop the Russian aggression, certainly do not value life and definitely do not seek peace. Now they want to use Christmas as a cover to at least briefly stop the advance of our guys in the Donbas, and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized men closer to our positions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Sure, so yes, as you mentioned our colleagues on the ground, Karim Hadder (PH), Ben Wedeman, said that theyheard not long after that ceasefire began, they heard and witnessed both incoming and outgoing fire across the frontlines in eastern Ukraine. And so it appears that it is business as usual. Of course the Russians blame the Ukraine for breaking this ceasefire. The Ukrainians say the Russians have carried out shelling in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine and in Kherson in the south as well, where there are dead and wounded, they say, though we don't have numbers on precisely how many. But the reality is, Eleni, that this cease-fire was doomed from the get-go. It really never had a chance because the Ukrainians never signed on to it. They never agreed with it because they viewed this as simply a chance for the Russians to improve their position on the battlefield, to get more weapons, ammunition, troops to the frontlines, to try to get the upper hand in a battle that Ukrainians feel that right now the Russians are losing. And so you would be hard-pressed to find many people in Ukraine who actually believed that anything would change along the front lines, in fact I met one woman this morning at a prayer service for the military at this Saint Michael's Church behind me who said that, look, she read at the wording of the Kremlin declaration quite closely and noticed that it said there would be a cease-fire along the line of contact. Didn't say anything about the rest of the country. So in her mind, she figured well, there would be missile strikes likely in the rest of the country. This is how little faith Ukrainian people have in what the Russian government and what the Kremlin actually says. I also spoke to the head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine who led the prayer service earlier today, and he said, look, we do not trust with the Russians have to say. You just have to listen to the air raid siren that went off during the church service, and it tells you everything you need to know -- Eleni.",

I mean, look, if we go back a few years, Putin has co-opted the Russian Orthodox Church tobe part of his narrative about what Russia's, and the future of Russia, so it is a little surprised that the patriarch is -- you know, he gets a lot of support from Putin, is supporting what Putin wants which was this a 36- hour unilateral cease-fire. Putin one said because he is not making gains on the battlefield, he wants to give some respite to his troops, he wants to signal to people back home in Russia that, you know, he is in control of the war, when he isn't. He wants -- there's nothing that Putin wants more really than to be able to freeze the frontlines right now and hold the territory that he's got because he's very aware that the military supplies that Ukraine is getting, the French, the Germans, the United States, to name the three countries in the past couple of days who said that they'll send armored fighting vehicles, which means Ukrainian troops will have greater ease to move the frontlines forward, take more territory from Russian forces. Putin is aware of this. He wants to kind of freeze the battlefield where it is. But the frugality, as Scott was saying, for the Ukrainians is very straightforward. Putin invaded, illegally invaded, invaded without reason. There was no provocation from Ukraine, so Ukraine has an aggressor, if you will, in their house breaking things up. And they are told OK, we are going to pause for a minute. It's not the way that war works. And for this reason, whatever noises, whatever we hear from the Kremlin, whether it's criticism now of Ukraine because they are not on a cease-fire or however President Putin plays this at home, this is not a moment that is changing the narrative of this war other than they're more deeply polarizing both sides.",

Then he was lying that he doesn't control the separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine. Again it was a lie. Then he was lying that he will not attack Ukraine, then he was building his military presence in our borders, again he was lying. So he's lying all the time. And this time he's again lying. He won't -- he has two objectives. First one is to win the time because yes, he needs time to refresh, replenish his troops, and to restarts his attacks. And second objective is to make mess in the international territory in the general Russia, to show that Putin is a peacemaker. You know, it's so ridiculous.

He is doing everything he can to make these changes to provoke some problems in these countries, both with food crisis, energy crisis, refugee crisis, that is his hope. And for a military point of view he understands that he can't issue the goals he had in the beginning, and his goal today is just to hold the line, which he has for the moment. But it is very difficult for him. Russian troops are demoralized. They don't know what they do in Ukraine. They're clearly demoralized with the loss of (INAUDIBLE). I want to stress your attention that an act against a Russian military base in Makiivka was exactly precise. No one civilian was hurt during these attacks. It's absolutely opposite to how Russia is doing the war, killing thousands and thousands of civilians, and yes, because of some of these attacks and hide losses of Russians, Putin is now trying to show himself as a peacemaking inside Russia, too, because he wants to say to his people, OK, I understand that you are suffering.

He has proposed a number of measures to give them more power, give the rank-and-file members, especially members of the far- right Freedom Caucus, some of those members denying him the ascension to the speakership, giving them more power, more say over the legislative process, the ability to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker. Now, under the rule proposed by McCarthy, one member could do that. That is down from conference rules that about half of the Republican conference, 111 members traditionally to be able to do. McCarthy has gone all the way down to have one member, which raises concerns about keeping the speakership stable, the stability of the speakership, assuming he gets the job.

Experts say the data was likely stolen from Twitter in 2021, and is extremely valuable to identify thieves. Intensely personal and very detailed, Prince Harry's new book and his media blitz are causing a stir. What that could mean for the House of Windsor, next. And we have an update on the condition of the NFL player Damar Hamlin days after he suffered cardiac arrests on the football field. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

We've had a lot of intimate detail from everything about Harry's growing up, hisrelationship with his father, death of Diana, how he experienced the death of Diana right up to his real fallout with William, fallings out between Meghan and Kate. I mean, there is so much detail here, really there is nothing I think that Harry hasn't held back. He's told us everything. This is a memoir so far, I mean, I think there is more to come as well because it has even been published yet, although this is a memoir that lays bare a very, in Harry's view, an incredibly dysfunctional family in which he as the number two, the spare, has suffered a lot. Suffered the death of his mother and suffered always being second best. So I really think he thinks the relationship between him and his brother and father is so damaged, there is no point holding back. He's telling us everything and this is very, very damaging to the royal family.",

They felt it didn't go far enough. Prince Charles didn't put his arm around Harry when he told him that Diana was dead and how he feels he was left alone, and all these physical altercations with William. All of these -- everything that's in the book I think the royal family should answer, but I don't think they will answer. I think they have sources talking on their behalf. What the royal family are going to do is really step up their charity work, step up their appearances, and hope that speaks for them. But Charles' reign is very, very, early. This is not helping it along.",
