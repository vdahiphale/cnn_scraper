The country's two main political parties are already claiming victory. Voters are set to elect their first female president. A top contender is the former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a protege of the outgoing president. Her rival, Xochitl Galves, is supported by a coalition of opposition parties. Now, this race is part of the larger set of elections in the nation's history with more than 20,000 positions on the ballot nationwide. There have been disruptions, long lines, and delays plaguing some polling stations while authorities say voting was suspended in one town because of violence there. Now this has been a particularly bloody political cycle, one marred by multiple assassinations and violence. One local candidate was killed just hours before voting began. CNN's Gustavo Valdes joins me now, live from Mexico City. Good to see you, Gustavo. Bring us up to date on the election, an important one for Mexico. When can we expect results? GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Michael, we are expecting results within the hour. The National Electoral Institute is poised to announce within the next 30 minutes. The first preliminary assaults there are likely to give us a pretty good idea of who the next president will be, even though both main candidates have ready claimed victory. On the one hand, Morena, the official party, the party in power right now, the head of the party came out early, very early on and claimed not only that they had won the presidency, but also the eight governorships in play. Later, Xochitl Galves, the opposition candidate, came and she didn't quite claim victory. She just stated that they had won, stating that they had had a successful campaign all over the country. Now, there are some early polls that favor Sheinbaum, the -- Claudia Sheinbaum, the Morena candidate. And there is some early results coming from the official institute that also favor her, but pollsters have been telling us that most of the people they talk to outside the polls were reluctant to talk to the pollsters, so they're not quite sure that their polls are reliable. And that's why there hasn't been anybody calling for the next president. So that's where we are awaiting, and it was a very interesting day. There were long lines in many places. People abroad were able to vote. And they were frustrated, because more people showed up to vote than there were ballots. They were -- about 20 percent of the polling stations in the country didn't open for about two or three hours. That delayed the closing of the voting in Mexico. And as you mentioned, we also saw acts of violence in parts, in South Mexico. But overall, success. People seem to be expecting the result without any doubt of what is going to happen. So we just have to wait who the next president is going to be.",

The problem is that there's not enough capability for all of these people to actually vote. So what officials said was that about 1,400 people here in Los Angeles registered to vote, and they had an additional 1,500 spots. By seven in the morning, they already had about 2,000 people lined up to vote, so they already knew that those spaces that they had saved for those people that had not registered to vote were already taken. You see this line wrapping around multiple times around the entire block. These voters are excited. There are many issues that feel -- that they feel are important for them, especially because a lot of their family members are still in Mexico. But there are things like this historic election and electing the first woman president. Also, the fact that there is a security issue, the migration issue; the economy, the trade between the two countries. Those are issues that are important to voters, both in the United States and in Mexico. Take a listen to what one voter told us.",

BERNALthe party of the current president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and of the favorite to win this election, Claudia Sheinbaum. That's what you're hearing from a lot of these voters, who continue to be extremely passionate and who are voting in person for the first time here in the United States. So again, officials here saying that they're excited about the turnout, and they hope that, in the future, more and more people will register to vote so that they don't have to turn people away. What's also very interesting in this election is that, in Mexico, you have six-year terms for the president to here in the U.S., you have those four-year terms. This is the one year where those two align. It happens every 12 years. So it will be extremely important to see who leads Mexico and who leads the U.S. and how that relationship is going to play out.

Seoul officials reported about 700 of the airborne waste deliveries floated into South Korea over the weekend, littering parts of the country with things like cigarette butts, paper, and pieces of both. In response, the South Korean officials said the country will take, quote, \"unendurable measures\" in the coming days against North Korea. For more on all of this, I'm joined by CNN's Mike Valerio in Hong Kong. What -- what a story. I mean, these balloons actually stopped operations at one of the busiest airports in the world, Incheon. I mean, tell us about that and the general disruption of this rather bizarre balloon trash operation. MIKE VALERIO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, Michael, you really got a feel for the air traffic controllers at Incheon who see floating garbage, and that leads to everything stopping at Incheon, not once but twice. And as you mentioned, this is not just a tiny airport. This serves a metropolitan area of 24 million people, the fourth largest urban area on earth, stopped because of floating garbage. So Saturday, Michael, we actually had an incident of one of those floating garbage parcels crashing onto the runway and stopping everything at Incheon briefly. Everything is back to normal. But the North is saying, you know what? We're going to press pause on this campaign for the moment. And, you know, putting this into perspective, why this is happening right now, for years, Michael, the South Korean government and human, you know, agencies or I should say human rights agencies in the South have been sending these floating balloons North over the DMZ, replete with leaflets, with medicine, and also sometimes flash drives loaded with K-dramas, K-pop albums. And also images that show what it's like to live in South Korea: to cook with hot water on a regular basis, to have electricity whenever you want. Images that could be threatening to the North Korean regime. So the North is saying that tactic is trash. So here is our garbage. But listen to what it's been like on the ground around Seoul over the past few days, Michael. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SONG KWANG-JA, YONGIN CITY RESIDENT (through translator): I had goosebumps. It felt like a childish prank. I was surprised to hear about it. KIM MIN-HEE, YONGIN CITY RESIDENT (through translator): Why are they sending things like this?

And it just goes to show how Japan is not only continuing to hunt whales but also is trying to revitalize this shrinking industry in a very, very big way.HOLMES (voice-over): We get a tour of the ship, led by Hideki Tokoro, the president of Kyodo Senpaku, the whaling company that made it, who doesn't hide his fondness for whale meat and rejects the idea of changing his business model. HIDEKI TOKORO, PRESIDENT KYODO SENPAKU (through translator): We will not switch to whale watching, unless it is eating whale while whale watching, which sounds very chic. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): This ship hunts whales in Japan's territorial waters, before getting served in the country's supermarkets, school lunches, food carts, and vending machines. But public appetite for whale meat, just 1 percent of its former peak, according to government data, is still far from satisfactory for Tokoro. And with the launch of this expensive new boat, Tokoro says bills are piling up. But even if the new boat sinks him into bankruptcy, Tokoro insists there's no Plan B. Internationally, whaling is criticized as a brutal and unsustainable practice that once pushed many of these mammals to the brink of extinction due to centuries of overhunting. And may still carry environmental consequences today.",
