Congress probing theSilicon Valley Bank collapse caused lawmakers blaming bank management and regulatory flaws. Taiwan's President visits North America giving China more diplomatic pause and attack triumph Valley Beavers six weeks split gets investors applause. Meanwhile, global stocks are higher after Tuesday's snores that mean no change. U.S. futures in the meantime, higher and Europe as you can see in the green too. The CAC are on over in France, the outperformer, UBS is contributing though to sentiment after announcing the return. A former CEO Sergio Ermotti he presided over UBS his own crisis recovery after the rogue trader scandal if you remember back in 2011, and he is now going to be the man to oversee the Credit Suisse consolidation. But of course beware the ghost of Credit Suisse scandals of the past. A new U.S. Senate report says the firm continues to help wealthy investors evade taxes. The very latest on that report just ahead. Chinese tech out on top in Asia in the meantime, after the Ali Baba split announcement with the HANG SENG jumping more than 2 percent. Lots of talk over whether a less imposing sizable Alibaba will become a less enticing Chinese regulatory target also, as we discussed on the show yesterday might and Alibaba breakup trigger and Ant Group IPO makeup. The Chinese government has already given tentative approval for the offering after putting the kibosh on it more than two years ago. Alibaba, of course owns more than 30 percent of Ant financial. Now from FinTech to fin put in check, hearings into the recent U.S. bank failures continues today in Washington, D.C. Fed Vice Chair Michael Bob bashing Silicon Valley Bank Officials Tuesday, calling the collapse of the institution a textbook case of mismanagement. Though, admittedly, he also came under fire himself. We've got all the details coming up and later in the program. We'll talk with the CEO of payment firm Chipper Cash about the new reality for tech startups in a tighter lending environment. The Capital Management arm of Silicon Valley Bank is also an investor in Chipper. So plenty to talk about on that but first, off the shotgun wedding of UBS and Credit Suisse, UBS is getting engaged again, this time with an old flame Former CEO Sergio Ermotti will take over the reins of the bank again next month. The bank said its current CEO Ralph Hamers agreed to step down to serve the interests of the new combination the Swiss financial sector, and the nation. But the problems keep piling up for Credit Suisse. And as I mentioned in the last few hours, a U.S. Senate Finance Committee investigation has concluded the Swiss bank is complicit in ongoing tax evasion by super wealthy Americans. Clare Sebastian joins us on this. Clare, this was something that we learned, I think from bank consolidation during the financial crisis that you can absorb a bank but you also have to absorb their legal liabilities along with it. What more do we know about this investigation and the potential consequences for Credit Suisse and therefore UBS?",

This is about finding the very best person for this because of the scale of the task at hand. He said this isn't just the biggest transaction of its kind since 2008. This is bigger even than what we saw back then. This is two of the world's biggest banks combining. He said that this involves really sort of an unprecedented amount of financial engineering, which comes with he said, significant execution risk. I think it's telling, the statement says that Ralph Hamers is stepping down not just for the good of the company, but for the good of the country. That is how they view this and Sergio Ermotti for his part thing that he felt that he had a duty to take this on, Julia. So that is really why a couple of weeks or even less into looking at this deal they are realizing just the scale of the task at hand.",

The Wagner group had been battered in Bakhmut, but he also added that they had battered the Ukrainians as well. And since the 21st of February, Bakhmut has been off limits to journalists. I spent much of January there and we had a pretty good idea of what was going on. But since then, it's sort of a black hole. We don't know what's going on. We're dependent upon what little information is actually coming out of there. But it does appear that both sides are taking very heavy casualties at this point, and it's not clear.

Another piece of history, this is the first time we think things since the Second World War, that there has been a full ceremonial welcome of any Head of State here at the Brandenburg Gate. So it is, you know, history playing out here right now. And the couple over there with the President and his wife in front of the cameras, they're going to come down here to the red carpet and inspect the guard of honor. So he's on his way over here now. He's here until Friday, King Charles and the Queen Consort as well, a Camilla, a country that they have deep ties with, but it's always the government, the Foreign Office that leads these events. And it's interesting that they chose France and Germany as the first two countries. Post-Brexit, of course, to try to, you know, uses the diplomatic power of the royal family to perhaps build those relationships after a pretty fraught period under Boris Johnson, of course.

And that's an honor that the Germans wanted to bestow on the King as he came in. Of course, there are family links between the British Royal Family as well Queen Victoria's husband was of course German, there's German blood in these veins and Prince Philip had lots of family here as well. The last time I was here with the royal family was with the Queen and Prince Philip. And there are many parallels between this visit and that one. So that was her last state visit. This is King Charles's first state visit. So interesting that it's all playing out here in Germany today, you can see that the King and the President the two Heads of State on the red carpet, right behind me are taking the guard of honor. And, you know, big smiles on everyone's faces. I think everyone is very pleased with how everything's playing out today. I can't tell you how many notes I've got intricate notes, Julia, from both the German side and the British side about every single detail of this trip, a huge amount of work over a period of months. And there was a last minute jig of course, because the first leg of this European tour to France had to be cancelled on Mr. Macron's advice. The King going up there to meet a group of German well wishes, love them with German flags and love them with the British flags as well so interesting to see who's in the crowd and what he'll be saying to them on his first visit here as King.",

So we've got to fight really hard to remind people why Lyft to pick people up on time, to give them a competitive price to make sure they get where they're going do all the basics, right. And I think if you see, you know markets like that, where there are two players. You often see sort of a shift in share over time, you know, a funny example is, you know, the SAT and the ACT here in the United States, for those of you who have a kids going through that, you know, these things tend to shift over time.

And I guess we'll go back to the question again, how do you bring down wait times if you're not attracting drivers because they have an alternative option? And how do you attract customers, if perhaps, the alternative option is cheaper, too.

But there's a lot of work we can do with that laser focus on that one person who wants to get picked up right now at you know, 6:40 in the morning. If we focus in on one person and make sure that driver is getting paid fairly and well, that tends to take care of itself. As long as people remember that Lyft is a great option. So to a certain extent, and I know it's a little repetitive, but it's focused on those basics with such laser precision, not get distracted by delivering pizzas or packages or all sorts of other things that other companies are doing really focused on that I've got a lot of optimism.

All this as the U.S. House gets set to hold new hearings into the banking terminal today. Rahel Solomon joins me now. Struggling to read that Rahel, half because I'm laughing and half because there seems to be lots of B's and T's in there. What we heard yesterday was three top regulators think that they wanted to see more stringent regulations on banks that have assets above $100 billion.

The next hearing on the House set to begin in about 20 minutes and then Julia, we know that SVB executives have also been asked to testify that it's expected to happen at a later date, but you can bet there will definitely be fireworks when we hear from that testimony when we hear from those witnesses.",

      "sentences": "Julia, it's great to be back with you today. Thank you for having me. And indeed, it's been an eventful and busytime. And you know you're always this for us in our world. I think one thing that probably goes unsaid is that there's always a lot of stuff that we're working on and developments and we constantly have to navigate interesting challenges. So in the last 12 months, six months have definitely been no different in that sense. But they've been unique. I think, you know, one thing to say is that, for Chipper, our mission, and you know, our long term, vision for building hasn't changed. And if anything, I think times like this underscore the importance of what we're building. When does, you know, stress in the global economy, people rely on our products and services more, they support each other more, they need tools to store their money safely, the need to transfer money safely. And now with you know features that we've been building and rolling out the last couple of months, like our cards and our stocks product, even more so interact with the global economy is of the highest importance. So I think, you know, these times further underscore the importance of what we're building. And we know with regards to what happened with SVB, as I said in my statement, fortunately for Chipper, there was very little impact. And I think more importantly, SVB's capital arm, which is the one that invested in Chipper, was largely unaffected. So that's a very different pool of capital from SVB, the bank, which is the one that collapsed. So for us, even with the people that we deal with it SVB those relationships are so strong and as vibrant as ever. So, you know, fortunately, we came out on the right end of what happened with SVB.",

And then obviously, now this, you know, global economic crisis that we're going through right now. And you know, there's a wave and at the same time, there's just a lot of uncertainty and fear in the world right now. And those are all things we have to navigate as well, I think, generally speaking, because our vision of our mission remains unchanged. And all the investors that we have who are highly supportive, subscribe, that vision and that mission, there's really very little change in the long term prognosis and the subscription of what we're doing. I think what really changes in times like this more than anything, is that not just for Chipper, but for everyone, there's probably more emphasis on efficiency, and having to do more with less. So if there is an adjustment in how we think about our business. Or how we think about where we are looking at resource in the short term? It's more focused on alright, what do we do now, with tighter resources in terms of less capital in the markets probably less fundraising activity going on across the industry? How do we make sure that our business is operating as efficiently as possible? And what are the most important areas that we need to double down on and focus on as a business? And we've done that work ourselves as a business; we constantly try to do it. But I think in times like this, with the buyers raise a little higher, and everyone to make sure that every single dollar of investment that the company is making is good when the most important thing. So you will tend to see less aggressiveness in terms of expansion, and more focus on doubling down on products have been launched under the scaling and growing quite strongly. And that's quite true for us as well as a business.",
