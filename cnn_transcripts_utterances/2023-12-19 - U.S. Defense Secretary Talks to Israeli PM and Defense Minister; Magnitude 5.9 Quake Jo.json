(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Make no mistake, Hamas should never again be able to project terror from Gaza into the sovereign state of Israel. And we will continue to work together for a safer, more secure future for Israel in a brighter future for the Palestinian. We will continue to stand up for Israel's bedrock right to defend itself. And we will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The captives are elderly men who were kidnapped from the Nir Oz kibbutz. In the video, one of them is seen pleading for their release. He describes their suffering in Gaza and their fear of airstrikes. CNN is not showing the video because the men were likely speaking under duress. The Israel Defense Forces says the footage is a quote, \"criminal terror video.\" Addressing the three captives, an Israeli military spokesman says the IDF is doing everything they can to return them safely. The families of the men seen on the video say it's imperative to act fast because it's clear their loved ones are not in good shape. But many Israelis believe their government is not doing enough to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. Jeremy Diamond has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The pleas are only growing more desperate. RAZ BEN AMI, FORMER ISRAELI HOSTAGE (through translator): I begged the cabinet and we all warned that the fighting would likely harm the hostages. Unfortunately, I was right. DIAMOND (voice-over): Recently freed hostages and the families of those still captive are ramping up the pressure on the Israeli government to reach a deal for their freedom, after Israeli soldiers mistakenly shot and killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza. Their desperate plea smeared onto a white sheet on the building adjacent to where they were killed. Help! Three hostages read the Hebrew letters stained with red sauce. Former hostages like Doron Katz-Asher, who was shot as she was whisked into Gaza, now beginning to share their stories of captivity. DORON KATZ-ASHER, FORMER ISRAELI HOSTAGE (through translator): The first day was foggy because I lost a lot of blood and they stitched my wounds on a sofa with the girls next to me. Easy to understand that it was without anesthesia. DIAMOND (voice-over): In an interview on Israeli TV, she revealed that she and her two daughters spent part of their captivity not in a tunnel but hidden in a hospital. KATZ-ASHER (through translator): We were in a 12-meter room, 10 people, no beds, only a sink. And to go to the toilet, we had to knock on the door. They could open it after five minutes or after an hour and a half. Small girls couldn't hold it. DIAMOND (voice-over): Cramped conditions, but also unending fear. KATZ-ASHER (through translator): Fear. Fear that because my girls were crying or making a noise, they would get an order from above, be taken from me. Fear, always fear. DIAMOND (voice-over): For 49 days, Katz-Asher shielded her daughters from that fear until the moment they were handed to the Red Cross on the streets of Gaza, where hundreds of people crowded their vehicle. KATZ-ASHER (through translator): It was the first time after a month and a half that Raz said, Mom, I'm scared. DIAMOND (voice-over): Multiple former hostages also described the terrors of living under Israeli bombardment in Gaza. OFIR ENGEL, FORMER ISRAELI HOSTAGE (through translator): There was a bombardment on the adjacent house. It sounded like it was going to hit us. One of the guards was notified that his family member is dead. So you tell yourself, I hope he doesn't turn against us. DIAMOND (voice-over): Nearly every single former hostage spoke of feeling abandoned by their government while in captivity, now channeling that feeling into action. SHARON ALONY-CUNIO, FORMER ISRAELI HOSTAGE: I think that everyone needs to understand that. Not enough is being done in order to free the hostages from the Gaza Strip. They need to come back now. You have to do everything you can to bring them back now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(END VIDEOTAPE) PATON WALSH (on-camera): Now we reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment about this use of CS gas and receiving their response. But it is something there have been several reports of from Ukrainian military around the front lines and some Western analysts have suggested this is perhaps Moscow using a lower-level control agents in a military way to sort of test what's the response is to them essentially breaching the chemical weapons conventions. I say this is a non-lethal CS gas but you can see there the intensity in which it was used those soldiers saying caused a casualty a death in their own ranks. Just another one of the hazards the lethal issues that Ukrainian soldiers are facing now. The temperature dropping, which makes some believe the chance of the front lines changing dramatically over the winter is reduced. But you saw there the ferocity in which the Russian assaults appear to be coming. They are heavily equipped and backed by drones in huge numbers now. That is an immediate threat to the Ukrainians. Now remember what you're seeing there is the Ukrainian military that still in theory has aid coming to it. The aid has not stopped and yet they are already struggling because of the way Russia is prosecuting this war again. And so, yes, absolutely everybody we speak to here on the front lines are acutely aware that when the money runs out things will change here very gravely, most likely very fast. Some suggestions, ammunition already being rationed, some suggestions from Western analysis. This could be a matter of weeks or months until there's a severe change in Ukrainian fortunes on the front lines. Rosemary.",

And yes, Egypt has been extremely reticent to simply open the gates and allow for refugees to come in, quote unquote, \"willy-nilly.\"But there are two reasons for this. One, there is a historical precedent that every Arab leader, as well as, frankly, everyone in the Arab world remembers. Whenever Palestinians leave their land in Palestine, they are forcibly not permitted to return home by the Israelis. That happened in '48, that happened in '67, that happened in every conflict where Palestinians were forced to leave. So the public mood in Egypt is extremely reticent about this, because it would make Egypt accomplices in ethnic cleansing. And the Israelis have made no bone of the idea that they prefer to see the Palestinians leave, and they've been very clear about this and many within the Israeli government have also made it clear they don't want them coming back. They want them to be, quote unquote, dispersed across the world's nations. So it's unsurprising that they would be quite reticent in that regard. The second point again relates to the other borders. There are seven land borders between Gaza and the outside world. There is no corresponding pressure on the Israelis to open any of the other six borders in order to allow refugees to come in, which is the natural solution in this regard, because of course the Israelis would insist that the refugees be returned to Gaza after the conflict.",

It seized the Camp David Accord, which wrote that peace agreement as a pillar to its regional security architecture, an assessment that Washington, D.C. shares, and has been cooperating over the recent period trying to find ways to diminish tensions. There've been a number of flare-ups in violence, different bombardments of Gaza by Israel over the past decade.And Cairo has played the role of mediator more than once. So I think that role will continue. Of course, it's very difficult when you have such an immense bombardment of, generally, a civilian population. We've seen around 20,000 Palestinians killed in the past three months. Most of them had nothing to do with Hamas. And we've seen quite a few reports now illustrating how Israel's rules of engagement have been lessened and diminished to the point where they've even killed their own hostages. Of course, they didn't know that they were hostages. But the point is that you see huge collateral damage, the scale of which I think is really quite unprecedented in any conflict that Israel has entered into before. So the Arab world sees this more generally, the Egyptian population sees this more generally, I think the world sees this more generally, which is why you constantly have these calls at the regional and national level calling for a ceasefire because the death toll of civilians that have nothing to do with any militant group is really quite staggering.",
