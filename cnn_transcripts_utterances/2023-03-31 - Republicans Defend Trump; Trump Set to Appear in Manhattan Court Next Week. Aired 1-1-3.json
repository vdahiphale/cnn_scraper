      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Alex Marquardt in Washington. Thank you so much for joining us today.We begin this hour with new details surrounding the indictment of former President Donald Trump. He is now the first ex-president in U.S. history to face criminal charges. Trump is expected to travel to New York on Monday, then surrender and appear in a Manhattan court on Tuesday. That's when charges against him, of which sources tell us there are more than 30, that's when they will be formally unveiled. Attorneys for Trump say he is -- quote -- \"ready to fight\" and will not accept a plea deal. Now, ahead of his appearance in court next week, the NYPD is preparing for potential unrest. All officers are being told to report to work in uniform and to prepare for deployment today. CNN's Kara Scannell is outside the Manhattan courthouse. And CNN's Leyla Santiago is near Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kara, I want to start with you in New York. What more are you learning about what may be in this historic indictment?",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, sources tell us that, in the indictment, there are more than 30 charges. This indictment is still sealed. It won't be unsealed until Tuesday.So we don't know the specific charges. But prosecutors have been investigating the falsification of business records, and potentially the falsification of business records to commit or conceal another crime, a felony, in New York state. These 30 charges could be for everything ranging from every invoice that the Trump Organization received, as well as any checks that were made to reimburse Michael Cohen for facilitating those hush money payments. All those details will become public on Tuesday. And that is when the former president is expected to come in to be arraigned. We're expecting that around 2:15 in the afternoon. That is the normal time that they do these arrangements. Now, this grand jury handed up this vote at the very end of the day yesterday, after they had heard from a number of witnesses, including former -- current Trump Organization executives, members of Trump's campaign, including his former fixer, Michael Cohen, certainly a central player in this, as well as David Pecker, the former publisher of \"The National Enquirer,\" who was at the very beginning of these hush money deals. He was involved for decades with the former president, a longtime friend, and was an orchestrator of these so-called catch-and-kill deals. Now, sources tell us that witnesses in the grand jury were asked questions about other hush money deals beyond the Stormy Daniels payment, including a payment made to stop former Playboy model Karen McDougal from going forward with her alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. So, a lot of material that the grand jury heard. We are waiting to see what the specific details will be in the indictment when it is unsealed on Tuesday -- Alex.",

We have seen some protesters that have been out in the nearby bridge. But, really, what we're learning from sources as to what is happening inside is that much of Trump's team was caught off guard by this indictment when it was announced last night. They absolutely were preparing for the potential of that, but they were caught off guard by the timing. So what will happen now? Well, as you said, we expect him to spend the weekend here, then, on Monday, head to New York.

Elie, thank you so much for being on today. We do know, of course, that this case in Manhattan is centered on these hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.

Generally speaking, federal prosecutors tend to take more conduct and try to charge it more broadly in fewer counts. State prosecutors -- and, again, I'm generalizing -- tend to break the conduct into smaller bits and bring higher numbers of charges. And it sounds like that's what we're seeing here. But what this also suggests to me, Alex, if this is, in fact, a financial and bookkeeping case, is that prosecutors may have taken each individual entry, each individual transaction and charged each one of those individually.",

So, before he appears in court, Donald Trump will be fingerprinted. There will be a mug shot taken of him. Now, that's not supposed to become public under New York state law. Very important to know that. Inside the courtroom, the judge first will unseal the indictment, meaning that's the moment when the indictment will become available to the public, barring something out of the ordinary. The judge will then read the charges to Donald Trump, who will be standing at the defendant's table. Donald Trump will be asked to enter his initial plea, which certainly will be not guilty. The judge will then set bail. In a case like this, it seems very likely that the judge will give Donald Trump what's called a release on his own recognizance, meaning there are no bail conditions. You can go home. Just come back when we need you back in court. And the judge may also set a schedule for the filing of initial pretrial motions.",

What you're trying to do is get certain charges knocked out or reduced before you even go to a jury on a trial. I think we see a couple potential bases here. First of all, as we just heard in the clip from James Trusty, one of Trump's lawyers, they're going to argue that you cannot charge a violation of federal campaign law, because this related to a race for president, in state court. I think they're also going to make an argument -- and Mr. Trusty alluded to this also -- that, in these business records cases in New York state, if you look at them, virtually all of them involve somebody taking a business record, falsifying it, then using it outside of their business somewhere to defraud someone of money, using it to get a bank loan, using it to rip off investors or customers. And I think they're going to argue that a campaign finance violation doesn't apply here. I think we also should expect to see a motion for what we call selective prosecution, meaning this defendant has been picked out, singled out for political reasons. Very difficult to succeed on that type of motion. But I fully expect to see those claims made.",

It has been this way for the last week-and-a-half or so. But there is certainly an increased presence in police. You can see those officers standing guard right there. As you just said, there was a memo that went out yesterday to the entire NYPD for some 35,000 police officers, that everyone needed to be in uniform today. Didn't matter rank or position. And, of course, that is just a posturing for anything that could possibly break out as we get into Tuesday over the weekend. No credible threats at the moment, but certainly a lot of what you're seeing as far as posture is happening behind the scenes, intelligence officials looking at online chat rooms, looking at social media, making sure there's no coordination or mobilization of people to come to New York and start any sort of unruly demonstration or unrest. Also, as we look toward Tuesday, sources are telling us, as you said, Alex, Secret Service is meeting with all the players here on the ground about what this arraignment will look like. Sources are telling CNN, if possible, one thing that's being considered is that the entire cases that are happening in 100 Centre, which is quite a bit, those might all come to a halt while the former president's arraignment is happening. Again, it's not definite. These are all things that are being considered, everything on the table. I can tell you that floor where the arraignment is happening, we know that there's restricted access even today to get to that floor. So there's just so many security measures that are in play right now, discussions still happening again through all the players as to how exactly this is all going to go down when Tuesday happens -- Alex.",
