It's just a snapshot of the presidential race. As it stands right this minute, who wins in a matchup between President Biden and Donald Trump? And what happens when the Republican on the ballot is actually former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley? Plus, what are voters' biggest concerns right now in the midst of the Republican primaries? CNN's political director David Chalian is standing by with the brand new results and Governor Haley herself is here to react to the new polls. Plus, I'll ask her about President Biden's new sanctions in the Middle East and how she says she would deal with Iran and its proxies after one of the groups killed three U.S. soldiers, we're going to ask her that and much more live on THE LEAD in just a few minutes. Plus, President Biden, also on the campaign trail today, courting voters in the key battleground state that helped deliver him the White House in 2020. Soon, he'll meet with auto workers after winning in a coveted union endorsement. We're covering all of this and more. Let's start with the release of the results of CNN's brand new poll of registered voters. Note, it's registered voters, not likely voters, not yet. Our political director David Chalian joins us.

This is going to be a close race, Jake.Take a look at our brand new numbers from this poll conducted by SSRS, Donald Trump at 49 percent among registered voters, Joe Biden at 45 percent, as you noted, just outside the margin of error. That is a narrow lead for Donald Trump. And I want good to see how stable this race has been since we last polled at the end of October, beginning of November. It's identical. Neither candidate has moved. That was a 49-45 race at the time as well. Take a look at how Governor Haley matches up against Joe Biden in a hypothetical general election. There's no doubt she will like this poll number, 52 percent support among registered voters, a majority there for Nikki Haley, to 39 percent for Joe Biden, a 13 percentage point lead for Nikki Haley. She's been touting this on the campaign trail. But she's got to get there and the nomination race among Republicans is a lot trickier for her. This is saying among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, who is your preference to win the presidential nomination in 2024? Seventy percent of Republican and Republican leaners say Donald Trump, only 19 percent say Nikki Haley, Jake. TAPPER:  So if it ends up a Biden-Trump rematch, how do voters feel about that?",

Well, the number one answer, 19 percent of them said they don't have any concerns. 15 percent said his tact, his mouth, what he says. Eight percent opposition attacks. And you see it goes down from there.For Joe Biden, it's much more clear what the concerns are that Democrats and Democratic leaners have -- 46 percent of them say Joe Biden's age is the concern that they have about his candidacy, only 9 percent say they have no concerns and you see the economy, Israel and the Middle East, mental sharpness below that, Jake.",

Governor Haley, you just heard from David Chalian, this new CNN poll shows and a head-to-head matchup between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Trump beats Biden by only four points. It's just outside the margin of error, which is 3.8 points. In a matchup between Biden and you, you clobber Biden. Biden -- you get 52 percent and Biden gets 39 percent. That would be a huge victory for the Republican Party. It would bring the Senate and the House and governors races and state legislative races with it, no doubt. Why doesn't this electability argument seem to mean more to Republican voters do you think? NIKKI HALEY, 2024 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I mean, that's the argument we're trying to make. I think the reality is 70 percent of Americans don't want to see a Biden-Trump rematch. I mean, that's just the fact. The fact that we would have to 80-year-old candidates running for president is absurd. We've got a country in disarray in a world on fire. We need someone who can work eight years to get our country back on track, to heal our country, and to make sure we get our economy strong and that we prevent wars. And so that's the focus of where we are. But if you look at the Quinnipiac poll yesterday, it showed that Trump loses the Biden by seven points. So if Republicans decide that they want to nominate Donald Trump, the same thing that happened in 2018, 2020, 2022 will happen again in 2024. You can't keep doing the same thing and think you're going to get a different result. Donald Trump will lose the election for us.",

And we cut taxes and we became the beast of the Southeast for all the manufacturing that we brought in. So we're just going to remind them again what we did as governor.

It explains why he doesn't want to get on a debate stage because he doesn't want to talk about why he's doing it. It explains why he had a temper tantrum, you know, the election night of New Hampshire is because he wants me out of the race and he wants to be the presumptive nominee, so that all of that cash starts going to him and he doesn't have to spend anymore. But that's a reality of a real big problem for Republicans going forward. This is not personal for me. I don't have issues with Donald Trump. I voted with him -- voted for him twice. I was proud to serve America in his administration. This is about the fact that we have a country to save and we've got to focus on the fact that we've got an economy that is still out of control, and a lot of wasteful spending by Republicans and Democrats. We only have 31 percent of eighth graders in our country proficient in reading. We have an open border that is unsafe for everyone.

Is Biden now going to say anyone who's convicted in Germany or France, or Europe is now going to be allowed to have sanctions on them as well? What he's doing is not having the backs of Israel. He's falling all over themselves to avoid any conflict with Iran. He's trying to appease Palestinians, but he's not acknowledging what it means to be a friend to Israel. It's ludicrous. I don't even know what he's thinking at this point.

It's Israel's place to stay -- to say. It's the Palestinians' place to say. And I'll tell you this, Jake, when I was at the United Nations, we worked a lot on Israeli-Palestinian relations. Israel always came to the table when it came to a two-state solution, the Palestinians said no every single time and it's because they don't want a two-state solution. They want Israel -- they want to eliminate Israel. They don't want Israel to exist. We need someone that's going to go in with moral clarity. You have to know the difference between right and wrong.

You're not letting them know that there's a price to pay when you do something to our friends. So, it's -- this is why Iran, you're going to see them continue to get more aggressive.

So they were released after being tracked down by police. What I've learned today from NYPD sources is that some of those in custody and some of those that they've identified and are still seeking, though they've only been here for about a year already, have extensive best records for robbery, larceny strangulation, and other crimes.So the idea that bail wasn't even brought up or considered is something that is bothering police in this case as they continue to hunt for some of these suspects and try and track the ones that are already in custody and now released again.",
