      "sentences": "All right. Coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianna Golodryga is off today. You are watching ONEWORLD. I want to begin for you in Lebanon, where the IDF says it is striking Hezbollah targets amid growing fears of a wider regional conflict. It comes as the leader of Hezbollah spoke in a televised speech as Israeli jets broke the sound barrier over Beirut. A short time ago, Hassan Nasrallah said the deadly attacks in Lebanon over the past few days amount to a declaration of war by Israel, and he vowed a, quote, just punishment. Nasrallah referred to the pager and the walkie- talkie explosions as massacres and warned that all the red lines had been crossed. The attacks targeting militants on Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least 37 people and wounded thousands more. It is the highest death toll for Hezbollah since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly one year ago. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us live now. So, Paula, Hassan Nasrallah is essentially saying, look, this was a powerful blow and certainly a red line and that Israel could have chosen to just focus on Hezbollah fighters, but they also killed civilians as well. In terms of response here, in terms of a possible retaliation, Hassan Nasrallah really does have to walk a very, very careful and fine line here. Take us through that.",

But, of course, the question is as well, how soon could some kind of retaliation come? Because bear in mind that the communications of Hezbollah have been compromised at this point with the pages exploding, then walkie- talkies exploding. There would be, we know, there is paranoia and fear across Lebanon as to which wireless devices are even safe to use at this point. So communication is a key factor. Now, Hassan Nasrallah did refer to this. He did say that the infrastructure of Hezbollah is still robust, that that has not been destroyed. He also pointed out that Hezbollah's leadership was largely spared as they were using an older version of this pager. So pointing out that the leadership and -- are still very much intact. He did, though, point out that he believed that Israel was trying to kill about 5,000 people in about two minutes. This is what he said was the number of pagers, approximately, that had been targeting, so saying that Israel is crossing the red lines. But when it comes to how exactly Hezbollah can respond, that is something that we have to wait and see. We have been seeing missile launches across the border. We also know that there was anti-tank missile that was fired into northern Israel earlier today. We heard from the Israeli military that eight Israelis were hospitalized in that particular attack. And the Israeli military said that they were, in the early evening, carrying out strikes against Hezbollah targets in Southern Lebanon. So we have to wait and see what kind of response there is. But, of course, there are great concerns as to whether this would tip the balance into more of an all-out war beyond this low-intensity war that we've been seeing for months. Zain?",

When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes to the U.S. next week, he won't be meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, as according to an Israeli source. The Prime Minister is scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly here in New York. A source is telling CNN the Prime Minister's trip is for the U.N. speech and nothing more. Let's delve deeper into what is developing in the Middle East. H.A. Hellyer is an expert in the Middle East studies and joins us live now. Let's just talk about what a war, what a wider war would actually mean for Lebanon of all places. This is a country that has been reeling, especially economically. Just walk us through what it would mean for them. H.A. HELLYER, SENIOR ASSOCIATE FELLOW, RUSI: Thank you for having me on your program. So I think that escalation with Lebanon would be, frankly, quite disastrous, not only for the people of South Lebanon, but more widely, regionally speaking, because, of course, it wouldn't just be Hezbollah that would jump into the fray. I think that you could see an expanding of escalation with the Iranians. And I think that you would not see the accomplishment of, quote-unquote, Israeli goals when it comes to the return of their citizens to the North. On the contrary, it would just be more war, more devastation, more destruction, and the risk of wider regional conflict.",

The Iranians can retaliate over a long period of time. They define whatever they will consider to be an acceptable response. And what I mean by that is that if they fail to respond in the way that we expect, it doesn't mean that they will regard it as a failure. They will simply present a narrative that says, actually, we meant to keep them on the edge of their seats for such and such amount of time. And we're responding over a longer period of time with smaller pin-pins strikes. You know, they can easily turn around and do that. But I think that all of these calibrations and calculations that we've seen over the past few months, they're not calibrated, because you can't calibrate the law of an unintended consequences always supplies. If Hezbollah tries to escalate but only just (INAUDIBLE). If the Israelis think that they can escalate by only up to a point, well, they're not -- they're not in control of all the factors that will mean that it will just be up to that point. We're in a very dangerous situation right now. De-escalation is really quite paramount as a -- as an imperative, but it requires using leverage on the actors involved in order to ensure that they change their behavior. And, fundamentally, that's a D.C. -- a Washington, D.C. question for the Israelis.",

Incidentally, these are not ceasefire negotiations. These are negotiations for a pause in the fighting to get the hostages out with the explicit -- with the explicit demand that the path be laid open for returning to war by the Israelis.

There is a strong Arab-American community in places like Dearborn, Michigan, and they have shown real despair at the Biden-Harris' administration's response to Gaza. And I think an unwillingness to even support her, even though they were more willing to hear her out on the issue. But they have other coalitions that they can lean on as well. I was just there in Detroit not long ago for a big union rally she held. We know that unions are an organizing force in this country.

I guess if someone held the door open for me at Penn Station, that would surprise me a little bit. But, you know, look, you mentioned that we have polls, polls, polls. So, why don't we just talk about some of the polls that we got out today? Look, let's start off in Pennsylvania, right? It's the Keystone State, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Basically, the road to the White House probably goes through Pennsylvania. And this is Harris versus Trump in the state of Pennsylvania. Look, we got four polls on your screen. They all have something a little bit different, right? Which is kind of what you'd expect with a margin of error. Quinnipiac, plus five points. \"New York Times,\" plus four points for Kamala Harris. Plus three points for Harris, the Franklin and Marshall poll. A tie in the Marist poll. And I'll also note, not even on here was a \"Washington Post\" poll that had Harris ahead by one point. So a lot of different numbers see here. But the bottom line is they all generally point in one direction, and that is a slight Harris advantage. But this is Pennsylvania. You and Eva were just talking about Michigan. So let's go into Michigan. We're going to go into Michigan and we're going to go into Wisconsin, the two other big, very important Great Lake battleground states. And both of these polls show the exact same thing in both of the states. I like it sometimes like that when in fact you have a very easy puzzle to solve. Marist College in Michigan, plus five for Harris. Wisconsin, plus one for Harris. Quinnipiac, the exact same thing. So you're talking to Eva, can, in fact, Kamala Harris win in the great state of Michigan? Absolutely, according to these two most recent polls. But, of course, I just threw a ton of numbers at you. So let's just boil it down and take into account all the numbers that we have from the month of September, not just the ones that we were talking about. So this is Harris versus Trump in the Great Lake Battleground states. On average, in September polls, Harris is ahead in Michigan by four, in Pennsylvania by two, and Wisconsin by two. Tight races, to be sure, but one in which you would rather be Kamala Harris than Donald Trump. So what does this mean for the electoral map? That's what it all boils down to, right? It's a race to 270 electoral votes. Well, if Kamala Harris wins in Wisconsin, wins in Michigan, and wins in Pennsylvania, she can lose in those southern battleground states, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, and she, Zain, would get to exactly 270 electoral votes, the exact number needed to win the electoral college. Still a long time to go, a lot of things going on, but the past 24 hours of polling data has, I would dare say, been some of the best that Harris has received in her, let's say, about two months on the campaign trail so far.",

And it's done that. It's conducted attacks in those areas. So one is somewhere other than just the region. A second, as your story noted, Hezbollah has the capacity to strike directly back at Israel with standoff weapons. It has 150, by our count, upwards of 200,000 standoff weapons, some guided, some unguided, some ballistic missiles. And then third is, it certainly could work with allies and partners in the region, the Houthis in Yemen, some of the popular mobilization forces in Iraq, and some of the Iranian-trained Shia militias in Syria to all those strike back.

Israel wants to resettle its internally displaced people up in the north. So this is what both U.S. and French negotiators have been trying to do is resolve diplomatically what the Israelis are trying to do with Hezbollah, so broker some kind of a settlement and has not succeeded.
