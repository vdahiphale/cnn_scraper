And on the other side of the country, a major nor'easter is expected to cover New England and parts of New York in snow.Millions of people in cities like Boston, Syracuse and Portland, Maine were under winter alerts ahead of the storm. And days ago, U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in more than 30 California counties. That includes Monterey County on the Central Coast. Some 5000 residents there were under evacuation alerts on Monday, and that number could rise. Officials were also working to repair a levee breach that caused even more flooding in the area. Meanwhile, officials are warning that rising waters from the Salinas River could cut off the Monterey Peninsula from the rest of the state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Fair enough. Depositors, well, there's not enough money left in the vault, maybe. And so, the federal government has said, what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that you get paid anyway.Money doesn't come from thin air. So, what they're doing is they're putting a levy on the broader banking system, whether you want to call that a tax or not, whether you want to say that's taxpayer's money or not. Well, that's all up for debate. But the important thing is they did this not because they care about Silicon Valley's bank's customers. They did that so that you and I and all your viewers know, if their bank would go south, your money is safe. As a result, your viewers need to know, they don't need to be worried about the financial distress of their bank. They're going to get their money either way.
