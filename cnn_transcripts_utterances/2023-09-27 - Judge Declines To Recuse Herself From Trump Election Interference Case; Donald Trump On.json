Any hope of denuclearization that the US had, well, they shouldn't be encouraged by this quick return of the soldier.

How they came to be a couple and how they pleaded to the bribery charges today, what happens next. And later, the manhunt for a convicted predator and alleged murder, a man one top police official warned will kill and do anything he can to cause harm. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with breaking news. The end of what would already be a difficult day even for someone whose business empire which was just dealt a devastating blow by one judge. Tonight, another judge, federal district judge, Tanya Chutkan, denied the former president's motion that she recuse herself from his election subversion trial. In her ruling, Judge Chutkan said that her comments made during the sentencing of two January 6 defendants were not evidence of bias as Trump's attorneys claimed. The court, she writes, \"has never taken a position. The defense ascribes to it, that former President Trump should be prosecuted and imprisoned.\" Now, this comes of course after a New York judge's summary judgment yesterday that the Trump business empire was built on fraudulently and often comically inflated valuations of assets, and now must be dissolved. How that happens? Not yet clear. The New York judge today gave the defense 20 more days on top of the 10 days, they'd already had to put forward a plan for putting the Trump Organization into receivership. Meantime, the rest of the civil trial, which could result in a quarter billion dollar civil penalty goes on. Whatever happens next, the judge's fraud ruling has certainly knocked down some of the foundation upon which Donald Trump's business was built over the years and how he portrayed himself.

So far, the opinion really dealt with two major properties in New York City, but there are properties all over. There's properties outside New York, and it's unclear whether the ruling can reach those properties eventually, too. So I don't know if the whole empire is going down or just the New York portion.

So many things, in addition to real property are going to be at risk here and dissolved.

They will go hard on the abortion issue. A little bit even at Donald Trump's saying he is back to a yes, he gave you the Dobbs decision with those Supreme Court justices, but now he's gotten soft on abortion. What does Nikki Haley do? She is trying to be more of a moderate. She says she is pro-life. She's like, let's not judge people. Let's not get in women's faces on this because she wants to take back the suburbs.

JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over) : Here is some of what Nadine Arslanian-Menendez said during an interview with The Armenian Report posted in April 2020. ARSLANIAN-MENENDEZ: Both my parents are Armenian. I was born in Beirut, Lebanon and during the Civil War, we fled Lebanon to Greece to London, and came to the United States. I went to NYU undergraduate and graduate school and I majored in international politics and French culture and civilization. CARROLL (voice over): Menendez also talked about having Armenian relatives who were among the hundreds of thousands massacred by Ottoman forces during World War One, and how grateful she was to Menendez who helped pass a US Senate Resolution in 2019 recognizing the mass killings as genocide. ARSLANIAN-MENENDEZ: I know when he puts something in his mind and he believes in it, he doesn't stray. CARROLL (voice over): Menendez also told The Armenian Report she has two children now grown from a previous relationship. The couple told \"The New York Times\" they met in December 2018 at an IHOP in Union City, New Jersey, where Menendez grew up and had served as mayor. She told \"The New York Times\" she thought Menendez was very intelligent, and very, very hot. Their courtship led to a proposal in October 2019 while on a trip to India. ARSLANIAN-MENENDEZ: Oh my gosh.   CARROLL (voice over): According to the indictment, Nadine Arslanian before she became Nadine Menendez befriended Wael Hana. Hana is originally from Egypt, and has close connections with Egyptian officials. Hana in turn introduced New Jersey businessman, Jose Uribe rebate to the couple. Fred Daibes is also an associate of Hana and friends with the couple. He's a real estate developer and longtime fundraiser for Menendez. Prosecutors say the three men offered bribes in exchange for Menendez's influence, to enrich themselves, and in ways that benefited the government of Egypt. The couple received gold, $500,000.00 in cash and a $60,000.00 Mercedes Benz convertible according to the indictment, which says on or about February 3, 2019. Nadine Menendez texted Hana, \"All is great. I'm so excited to get a car next week.\" Prosecutors say she was unemployed before she began dating Menendez and received a low show or no show job from the men in exchange for allegedly arranging meetings with Menendez and Egyptian officials requesting military sales and financing. All five of them, now co-defendants have entered not guilty pleas to the charges. Nadine Menendez's attorney says she will vigorously defend against these allegations and if that 2020 interview is any indication, it would seem Nadine Menendez will stand by her husband. ARSLANIAN-MENENDEZ: He's very, very caring, almost to a fault. Because he goes non-stop, but whatever he does, I just support him. CARROLL (voice over): Jason Carroll, CNN, New York.

Three committees in the Republican-led house in charge of that investigation. Tomorrow, one will hold the first impeachment hearing about President Biden and the business dealings of his son, Hunter. Today, a second committee released 700 pages of material based on the information from two IRS agents.The Republican Chairman called it, \"new and alarming.\" On Tuesday, Republicans said that they subpoenaed a bank for Hunter Biden's records and received two wire transfers from Chinese nationals to Hunter Biden in 2019. They attached a lot of importance to the fact that the records listed the president's Wilmington, Delaware address. The question is what does that add up to? Melanie Zanona joins us now from Capitol Hill. So, I know you've been combing through the more than 700 pages of material, what have you found?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, Anderson, these documents shed some light on the interactions and disagreements between IRS agents who were investigating Hunter Biden and the prosecutors at the DOJ. And how that case has been handled has become one of the central pillars of the House UP's (ph) impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. And in this latest trove of documents which includes emails, letters, handwritten notes, memoranda, these IRS agents describe in their view encountering road blocks every time Joe Biden's name came up.But prosecutors say there were some legitimate reasons for why they were steering clear of the elder Biden. One example of this is a search warrant pertaining to whether Hunter Biden was violating foreign lobbying laws. In an initial draft of that search warrant, a Justice Department official instructed her colleagues in an email to remove that reference, saying there was no legal reference to be -- reason to be referencing Joe Biden's name. Now, we did see a copy of that email as part of that trove, but the search warrant itself was very heavily redacted. So I just want to note that here. But Republicans have said, this is an example of the way the DOJ was trying to protect Joe Biden. Now, important to point out here that this was in the summer of 2020 when Donald Trump was in office and Joe Biden was not. But nonetheless, Republicans still pushing ahead with their claims and the White House saying, it's important to remind everyone here that Republicans have not provided any evidence of wrong doing by the president himself. I want to read you the statement from Sharon Yang. She is the spokesperson for the White House. She said House Republicans have again cried wolf and provided no evidence tying President Biden to wrong doing. Instead of wasting time with media stunts, trumpeting half-baked conspiracy theories, House Republicans should realize the clock the ticking. It's time they stop to trying to strap and start focusing on priorities that matter to the American people. But, Anderson, nonetheless Republicans pushing ahead with those investigations even with a looming government shutdown this weekend.",

This impeachment hearing into President Biden begins tomorrow. So Congressman Raskin, what do you make of this newly released material from Republicans?REP. JAMIE RASKIN, (D-MD): It's pretty much the same old stuff we've been seeing. It's about Hunter Biden; it's not about President Joe Biden or anything that he's done in office. They have not been able to connect him to a single dime of all of these allegations. And we've looked at more than 12,000 bank record pages. We've looked at more than 2,000 SARS reports. All of these witnesses, Hunter Biden's former business associates, former FBI special assistants, you name it, and they have not laid a glove on Joe Biden. And this should have been called off a long time ago. Lev Parnas, who, you know, was at the center of the Burisma conspiracy theory, which is still the basic foundation of the conspiracy theory that they're promoting today, wrote us a long letter explaining how he and Rudy Giuliani were gallivanting all over the world to cook up evidence against Joe Biden and that nothing is there. And that Chairman Comer should call off what he described as the wild goose chase. The problem is that Donald Trump won't let them call off the wild goose chase because he says they impeached me, so we should impeach him. And of course, that's not the constitutional standard whether you're mad at the president. The constitutional standard is treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors, and we will hold them to the constitutional test.",

But he just keeps saying, there's nothing there. There's no evidence. There's no smoking gun. So, of course, the burden is on them to show something, so they have to take these memos that keep showing the same thing over and over again, which is that Hunter Biden was involved in these various business deals and tried to pretend that that has something to do with what they call the Biden crime family, which is elocution which attempts to link Joe Biden to Hunter's businesses.But of course, there's a Special Counsel who's working just on Hunter Biden. He has already indicted Hunter Biden on gun charges. And that was the guy who was the U.S. Attorney for Delaware appointed by Donald Trump. So, the rule of law and the Department of Justice are working in that case. They've not going on Joe Biden.
