As you mentioned, the president has put forth some executive actions that he can -- that he has been able to take to protect a woman's right to choose, a woman's right certainly to make decisions on their own health care. And so, that's what we're going to continue to do. We're going to speak very loudly. We're going to be very, very clear about this. And we saw, we saw what happened in the midterm, Sara. I know you reported on this and what the American people want to see. They want to see their freedoms protected, and we cannot forget that. As far as the legal process, the Department of Justice certainly is going to take the next steps and make sure that we protect, continue to fight for those freedoms.",

In the village we saw recaptured yesterday, the first -- Urozhaine, was the place that just about two weeks ago the Russians dug into to shell the Ukrainians from. A sense of definite achievement amongst them, but also hard losses in fighting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (voiceover):  There may be ruin around them, but their direction is forward. We're with the 35th Ukrainian marines, the first reporters to get to the outskirts of Urozhaine, yet another village announced liberated, Wednesday. The victories maybe small, but are constant.",

We were just seeing the neighboring village taken last week, but they keep moving.With that much incoming, we're getting out of here as quick as we can. While they control Urozhaine, the Russians do everything they can to make it a nightmare for the Ukrainians to be there. WALSH (voiceover):  The unit showed us the intense fight captured by drone. This is their tank advancing, dropping a string of anti-mine explosives behind it, they said, which then, once it turned, detonated. The unit released a video of them in the town, Wednesday, of how they turned their fire power on what was once a Russian stronghold that shelled them. The company commander recalls many more Russians hidden there than he expected. Very many died, he says. Especially when they started to run. And when they held houses, lots of them died there. But they were caught as they fled. The smoke around Russians, likely made by cluster munitions. Ukraine has said it is already using some rounds controversially supplied by the United States. We cannot confirm if these fired here were the new American cluster bombs, but the losses suffered were clear. And they say, their use is less of an ethical dilemma when you're in this brutal fight. I don't understand it, he says. That side is using whatever they want. Our people are dying from all this and it's OK. When the other side die, it's not? I don't understand.",

So much damage done, it's hard to imagine what plans Moscow had for here at all had they kept it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (on camera):  A key part of the resources Ukraine desperately wants is some way of turning around Russian air superiority, which makes their advances so slow. Russians can drop bombs at will on Ukrainian troops. Today, Ukraine accepted an air force spokesman that it isn't likely to get the F-16s they urgently want from the U.S and its allies by the end of the year, citing training problems. We know there's a logjam in getting that very complex task to happen. But it's another sign, really, here of while the west expresses support, moves what it can forward, Ukrainians are suffering daily because of those delays, John.",

Hundreds of wildfires are burning across parts of Canada's northwest territories. Now, officials are evacuating the capital city of Yellowknife after declaring a state of emergency. Residents have until noon tomorrow to get out.One woman shared her terrifying drive on Highway 1 while evacuating. Just look at that. You can't see anything. She tells CNN, the smoke and the flames made it hard for her clearly, not only to drive, but also made it hard for even -- for her to even breathe. The situation on the ground literally has also turned the skies red over Fort McMurray. Look at that image. It's so eerie. Some residents had to be airlifted from remote villages as the flames got dangerously close. CNN's Derek Van Dam is tracking all of this for us. He's joining us now. Derek, the impacts from Canada's fires, we've already known previously, they have been felt and have impacted the United States. What are you expecting to see here?",

And we also have air quality alerts in place for central Canada extending across our border into the United States throughout portions of the upper Midwest. So much of Minnesota, into the State of Wisconsin under air quality alerts, and that lasts through the rest of the workweek. As these over 100 wildfires continue to burn out of control across the entire country of Canada, several now impacting the Yellowknife region with, of course, mandatory evacuations. Now, what does the weather hold for the next 36 hours? Well, a cold front is going to come through and this is going to, not only bring chances of rain and thunderstorms, we don't want to see lightning sparking additional fires, but it's also going to pick up the winds out of the northwest. We have wind gusts from forecast wind gusts here anywhere between 15 to 25 miles per hour, so that could complicate efforts regardless of the rain that helps douse these out. Check this out, Kate. This is incredible. An astounding devastating year for wildfires in the country of Canada, nearly 34 million acres burned so far. That is nine times the amount of acreage they burned last year, and it has eclipsed the past 40 years in terms of acreage burned year to date.",
