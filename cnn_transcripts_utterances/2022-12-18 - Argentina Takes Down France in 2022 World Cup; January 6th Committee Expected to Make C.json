Argentina took down defending champion France in a shootout after ending regulation time tied 3-3. Unsurprisingly Lionel Messi carried Team Argentina on his shoulders throughout the tournament. This marks the 35-year-old's fifth and final World Cup appearance, but his very first victory. And you are looking live right now, the city of Buenos Aires beyond elated. A roar rising up from the city that probably can be heard from outer space. Thousands of fans flooding the streets to watch their team make history. Children cheered, grown men cried, and right in the middle of that loud celebration is where we find CNN's Stefano Pozzebon.",

They've waited for more than 36 years, since 1986, when the Diego Armando Maradona, the great Diego, won against great Germany. This time, it's not Diego. His heir, Lionel Messi, the (INAUDIBLE) who went through Spain to learn how to play soccer at Barcelona Football Club and who came back as the prodigal son to bring the cup back to Buenos Aires.And you can tell that the city is really now bustling with joy, bustling with pride. Yet again pride of being Argentinian and it will be a party that will last throughout the night. And even more tomorrow, on Monday, as the Argentinian national football team will come back here to Buenos Aires with the cup and the trophy that they won in Qatar. This is a national team that really has been able to capture the spirits of this nation. There are 45 million Argentinians in love with their national football team. It's been years of suffering, years of defeat, and now, finally, Messi was able to do the trick and by leading the national team to the victory against France was able to just let the party commence here in Buenos Aires -- Jim.",

Tomorrow the House January 6th Committee will open a new chapter as their work culminates in criminal referrals as they're expected at this point for former President Donald Trump. The House committee is expected to refer at least three charges including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. But it's not just Trump. The panel is also going to go beyond that, beyond the former president and his actions, looking to the lawmakers and the officials who supported his claims, enabled him and allowed January 6th to unfold. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): We will also be considering what's the appropriate remedy for members of Congress who ignored a congressional subpoena as well as the evidence that was so pertinent to our investigation and why we wanted to bring them in. So that will be something we'll be considering tomorrow. You know, we have weighed what is the remedy for members of Congress? Is it a criminal referral to another branch of government or is it better that Congress police its own? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They've been asking for it publicly. Merrick Garland at his last public statement a couple of weeks ago said please give us all the evidence, Committee. We need it for our investigation. And we also know, Jim, that the committee has uncovered several pieces of important evidence, either before DOJ got there or perhaps the DOJ didn't even have. For example, we know the committee got Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony, they got Pat Cipollone's testimony, they got thousands of texts from Mark Meadows.

That said, real prosecutors have guidance, including at DOJ, saying you should never charge a case unless you believe you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt because ultimately that's what you're going to have to prove to a unanimous jury. That is the highest standard under our laws.And the reality is if you're thinking about a charge against Donald Trump or some other powerful person that will get more scrutiny within DOJ than a charge against a normal person without question. And I think when we look at these three charges that the committee may be voting on tomorrow, obstruction and conspiracy are sort of no surprise. DOJ has already gone on record with a judge saying they believe they have some evidence of that. Insurrection is new. That's really interesting. I don't know that DOJ ultimately will be interested in that because it's so difficult to prove. But that's a new sort of element to the whole mix here.",

Like I said before anyone who's tried cases knows that it's never easy to prove someone's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury, never mind a person like Donald Trump who is at once both widely loved and widely hated, it makes it even more difficult to get to unanimity.But, Jim, I do think that the signs are clear that the Fulton County D.A.'s investigation has been accelerating in the last few months and I think they're going to have to make a decision very, very quickly about whether they do or do not indict.

At least a million people can't access their funds. He is denying defrauding customers. The lawsuit alleges they did not properly disclose the scope and amount of compensation they personally received in exchange for the promotion of FTX. One of the plaintiffs in the proposed class action suit, Michael Livieratos, says, \"As a New England Patriots fan my entire life, you can imagine the influence that Tom Brady would have,\" claiming he moved nearly all his money from another crypto exchange to FTX. Adam Moskowitz, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, told \"The Washington Post,\" \"You have very rich people we all love telling us that they checked this out and it was OK. Why shouldn't they be held responsible?\" This is just the tip of the iceberg for the crypto fallout.
