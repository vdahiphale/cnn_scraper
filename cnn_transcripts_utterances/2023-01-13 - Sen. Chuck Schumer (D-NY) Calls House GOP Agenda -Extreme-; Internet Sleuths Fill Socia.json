Consider this. This Facebook group, University of Idaho Murders-Case Discussion, has more than 225,000 followers. And this is just one of many groups discussing and hypothesizing about this case online. Prior to the arrest of Bryan Kohberger, a user who goes by Pappa Rodger was a prolific contributor on the site, with many creepy and insensitive posts and what turned out to be incorrect speculation, such as the white Elantra is a red herring. But he also declared, \"Of the evidence released, the murder weapon has been consistent as a fixed-blade knife. This leads me to believe they found the sheath.\" The fact that he got the detail correct about the sheath despite getting so much else wrong is one of several reasons many on social media think Pappa Rodger was Kohberger. This person saying, \"I really think Pappa Rodger was BK!\" -- Kohberger's initials. And this person, \"OK, this Pappa Rodger stuff is wild. How would anyone besides him know some of this? Very unsettling.\" There is no indication Facebook or the police believe Pappa Rodger, who is no longer in the group, is Kohberger. Then there is this video taken at an Idaho prayer vigil for the four murder victims prior to Kohberger's arrest, with many people hypothesizing online. ASHLEY GUILLARD, \"ASHLEY SOLVES MYSTERIES,\" TIKTOK:  People think that the Idaho murderer attended his victims' vigil. TUCHMAN (voice-over):  This person commenting, \"Bryan Kohberger. Spotted. Prayer vigil. Moscow, Idaho. And this person, \"Sure looks like the psycho.\" But a T.V. crew from the newsmagazine \"INSIDE EDITION\" was at the vigil and has videotape of the man close up.

Taylor Dudley, a Navy veteran, was in Poland last April attending a musical festival, was detained by Russian border patrol police after crossing into Kaliningrad, a Russian territory that lies between Poland and Lithuania. It's not clear why he crossed the border. But there is good news to share this morning that he is home. Joining us now, one of the people who negotiated his release, former New Mexico governor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson. Ambassador, thank you. Good morning. You literally -- like, two hours ago -- just got back, so thank you very much for joining us. BILL RICHARDSON, (D) FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, HELPED NEGOTIATE RELEASE OF TAYLOR DUDLEY:  Well, thank you. This was a good news event. We brought back Taylor Dudley, the hostage. His mother went with us to the Russia-Poland border. This is not a high-profile case. It wasn't like the Griner case, which we were involved in, the Taylor (sic) Reed case. But the good news is that through local efforts with local Russian officials in Kaliningrad, which is far away from Moscow, a more grassroots effort resulted in the deportation and we were able to bring him home. The good news, I think, is that it shows that the Russians, on some of these humanitarian cases like the Trevor Reed case, like Griner, how with Taylor, and hopefully, with Whelan -- that they're ready to negotiate. They're ready to deal with these issues. I think that's the good news. And they deserve credit for turning Taylor over to us yesterday without much incident.",
