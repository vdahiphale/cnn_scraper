His fellow grads were happy to be in the same graduating class as the NBA star, especially because Paul is giving each of his fellow grads an investment account funded with $100 and fees waived for the first year.Well, more athletes they are going public with a topic that used to be taboo, mental health. Still ahead, one athlete quits the game he loves at just 22 years old. So we're going to take a broader look at athletes, anxiety and what it means for all of us. The next hour of CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. The top stories for you on this Saturday night. Waiting for rescue. Tourists in Peru caught in the chaos of a political crisis that has shut down the country. Plus, U.S. cities brace for a wave of migrants crossing the border as a critical policy ends in just days from now. And inflation. A stubborn problem impacting nearly every part of Americans' lives, even their love lives. We're going to dig in to how inflation is changing the ritual of first dates. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, Americans abroad and in limbo. In Peru, evacuations have apparently stalled again for hundreds of tourists left stranded in the ancient city of Machu Picchu. Dozens of Americans are among them. Trains to the remote city have been suspended because of violent protests erupting across the country after the ousting of its president. CNN's Rafael Romo has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

They go wait there and depending on the resources available on the U.S. side, they are taking with them no more than 15, 20 minutes. That is preventing the image we had a few days ago of thousands of people waiting out here. Now they are being processed a lot faster.What I have noticed is like this group were about 30 people. I have seen groups of up to 100 just today. I wouldn't be surprised if Border Patrol in the U.S. side releases the numbers for today and it would be at least 1,000 people who crossed from this point, not counting other entries along this side of the border.

So many of them are waiting. And according to city officials, there are thousands of them waiting here in Ciudad Juarez.Some say that they don't care. They just want to go and turn themselves in because they don't know if it's not Title 42 they might come up with another policy that might prevent them from going in.

A new chapter in this legal saga for the former president. So with us now to talk about this and what it all means is former federal prosecutor and now defense attorney Shan Wu.

But politicize it? Merrick Garland and Jack Smith are in this position of damned if you do, damned if you don't. It's already heavily politicized.I think the problem here for Merrick Garland is that he's tried to insulate the department by appointing a special counsel. That act in and of itself was viewed to be a political act. And the amount of detail that's going to come out in this report is going to make it very, very difficult for him or Jack Smith to actually decline to prosecute because the public has been educated.

So there is a huge amount of legal analysis that they're doing. Lots of commentators and analysts are doing it about which type of charge would really fit these facts.

And there have been times where Sony has flagged those for copyright violations and my account has gotten locked until I delete those. So I guess I kind of viewed that as just sort of a matter of course of being on Twitter. But, you know, I certainly understand the thought here that there really wasn't a good reason to lock anybody's account in the first place for linking to a Facebook page that tracks Elon's jet, which is why I was initially suspended. But when I logged on last night they basically said, you know, if you delete this tweet, we will reactivate your account.

      "sentences": "Stress and anxiety are a part of sports, whether it's a field goal, a Hail Mary pass, or a game-ending strikeout, winning or losing often comes down to one player. And recently, more and more athletes have been speaking out about their struggles off the field.Tyrell Terry, a 2021st round draft pick up the Dallas Mavericks has announced his retirement from basketball at age 22 citing anxiety. He called it \"the darkest times of his life\" while describing the stress the sport caused him. And other players have spoken about similar struggles including Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, tennis star Naomi Osaka and the NBA's Kevin Love. I want to bring in Dr. Andrew Jacobs, a sports psychologist to talk a little bit more about this. First of all, I think this is just so important that more athletes are being more open about this and not just keeping it inside, but why do you think this is? Why do you think we're seeing more athletes go public with their mental health struggles? DR. ANDREW JACOBS, SPORTS PSYCHOLOGIST: Well, first, thanks for having me, Pamela. You know, Kevin Love a few years ago at an anxiety attack in an NBA game. They didn't know what it was. He ended up in the hospital for this to determine he was having an anxiety attack. They thought there was something physically wrong with him. And from that he's become a spokesman now. He has sort of opened the door for us to realize that athletes are people. They're not any different than anybody else. They have feelings, they have emotions, they deal with stress. And over the last several years, you mentioned, Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, we're seeing more and more people now come out. Michael Phelps has talked extensively about his alcohol and all the issues he has had, personally. So we're seeing the discussions now about athletes being people, they have the same emotions the rest of us do. But you know, they're in the spotlight, just like you are, you are in a public spotlight, and an athlete is expected to be perfect at everything they do. But athletes aren't perfect. I deal with this all the time in my practice. Young athletes come in here talk about \"I've got to be perfect if I want to get to the next level.\" No, you don't. You have to learn how to fail, how to deal with negatives, anxiety, pressure, stressors, and learn to handle those things as part of your success and failure.",

But there is tremendous pressure all the way around, that is unique to sports that athletes deal with. Tell us a little bit more about that kind of pressure specific to them.",

I tell them all to get off social media when they're competing, because the problem is, if they miss a kick, strikeout, miss a shot, everyone is going to tell them how awful they are. If they make it, everybody is going to tell how great they are. The problem is that those people don't know them. They don't know them as a person. They don't know their feelings, their emotions, and they've got to deal with all these things. And I think today with how social media has put tremendous pressure and expectations on young people, it has caused more and more stress and anxiety.

Who are the core people? The core group of people that support you. And it's like, with young kids, after a game, I always encourage parents, don't ask them, you know, tell them how they played, tell them, you know, I love watching you play, it was great being with you. Give them that support system. And I think one of the things that we need to do with a lot of young athletes today is teach them about how to fail and how to lose because it's part of what goes on. If we can teach younger athletes how to deal with that as they get older, they wouldn't have the issues as much so as a lot of people have, because we've got to learn how to deal with those things, because we're all going to do it.",

Let me figure out another way to do this to succeed, and I think that that mentality is really important.So wow, Dr. Andrew Jacobs, this is such -- this is an issue we cover a lot on the show, mental health, and it's really good to talk to you and hear your perspective on it.
