Derek Van Dam is tracking the system for us this big system. Where is the biggest risk? What's the timeline here, Derek? Derek Van Dam, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, good morning, Christine. This is going to be a dangerous day that will unfold and it's all because of this collision of air masses in the nation's heartland. It's going to set the stage for strong to severe storms to form right along this advancing cold front and associated low pressure. Cold air dryer to the northwest, that's going to interact with that warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. That's the collision zone that will fire off these thunderstorms later this afternoon and evening. Already a few stronger thunderstorms developing across central portions of Kansas and into the Texas panhandle heads up which a time got some storms just to your West. Storm Prediction Center has an enhanced risk where you see that shading of orange damaging winds, large hail. They've explicitly used the words strong tornado or two possible within this area. So keep an eye to the sky, Oklahoma City all the way to Shreveport and into Houston and Dallas Fort Worth. In terms of the timing, we do anticipate the thunderstorms to form through the afternoon but it is potential we could see some of these tornadoes develop after sunset tonight. That means nocturnal tornadoes are particularly dangerous for this area because they catch people off guard typically when they are sleeping. Greatest risk of tornado, greatest probability, Dallas Fort Worth to the east. And again, that's for later tonight and into the overnight period. Some of these tornadoes could form overnight and into the early morning hours of Saturday as the storm system advances eastward. It's not only the severe weather threat, Christine, it's also the potential of flash flooding. We have 2 to 4 inches in the rainfall forecast for this particular area.",
