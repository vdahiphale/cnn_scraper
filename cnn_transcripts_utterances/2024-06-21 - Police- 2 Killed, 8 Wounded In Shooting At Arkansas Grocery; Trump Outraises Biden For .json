We do know that the situation has been contained and we expect to get brand new details here in about half an hour, that is when Arkansas state police are holding a press conference to let the community know what has happened here.But here's what we do know from a press release from Arkansas state police. This mass shooting which CNN defines as four or more people wounded or killed, happened at 12:30 Eastern. So just in the afternoon and Fordyce, Arkansas. That's in Dallas County. It's a small community, about 3,700 people. And it happened inside of a grocery store, the Mad Butcher grocery store. You mentioned that eight people were wounded, two sadly, Phil, have been killed. We know that a law enforcement officer has been wounded, but non-life-threatening injuries. And a shooter has been critically injured but taken into custody. We have also -- CNN has spoken to Matthew Gill, a witness, somebody who was inside of that grocery store. And in fact, he works there. He's the meat manager who saw a man come in he says with a shotgun, and ended up in a shootout with police before they were taken into custody. Now, we also heard from a witness, David Rodriguez, who was outside just trying to fuel up his car at a gas station when he heard all this popping, he took a video. In fact, where you can hear popping in the background that he at first mistook for fireworks because there's a firework store nearby, then he saw people running. And shortly after that is when ambulance sirens came in, police came into control of the situation, told them to leave. He did also notice that in the front windows of the grocery store, it appeared to him they hadn't shot open as though somebody was trying to get inside with gunfire. Phil, the governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has been informed of the situation. She's in contact with state police. She had this to say: I am thankful law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident. So all this to say the situation is contained, but we are seeing from our affiliates who are still there on the scene, lots of police presence, obviously, as they're going to work here to gather evidence, talk to witnesses, potentially have any -- any surveillance footage, and see what the scene is, piece this together, figure out why this all happen -- Phil.",

Yes, overall, the Biden campaign has still raised more year to date, but in the last two months, there has been an upward tick from the Trump campaign.And as you said, you can exactly track that to the conviction. His convictions in May certainly elevated his contributions. But if you look at this from February to March, April to May, Biden, there is in blue, Trump is in red. Biden enjoyed a cash advantage and that allowed the Biden campaign to really start advertising spending a more than $70 million so far in television and digital advertising, as well as building offices across battleground states. In fact, this week alone, they hired the 1,000th campaign staffer. The Trump campaign is far behind on that score, but in raising money in terms of having a parity with the Biden campaign, no doubt the Trump campaign is coming on strong. Phil, not a surprise. We did not expect the money to be a defining factor in this. The question, what does the Trump campaign do with this money? Do they actually spent on television or perhaps hold some of it for legal expenses?",

He wrote a check for $50 million to be a super PAC supporting the election of a former President Donald Trump. He also is given considerable money to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He, of course, is the grandson of the late former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, as well, as just a member of the Mellon family. He is certainly a bit of a reclusive donor. In fact, in recent years, he's been giving more and more, most Republican candidates he gives to have never met him before. Michael Bloomberg, on the other side of the aisle, has given almost $20 to the Biden campaign and Democratic efforts. Of course, he is much more well-known. He ran for president himself in 2020. But, Phil, just a snapshot of some of the billionaires giving money here. But the Trump's super PAC is getting most of its money now from Tim Mellon at least recently. They are intending to spend money on television here. So a central question to all of this, how much will the Trump campaign actually spend or will they outsource most of their ground game and campaign efforts? So the advertising efforts, so that's what they are signaling. We shall see. Of course, the reason this matters is when both candidates are face- to-face and the debate stage next week.

The ground game is going to be critical. That's typically where Democrats do have an advantage given that the moneyed interests have not traditionally been on the Democratic side of the aisle. But the amount of money being spent in presidential campaigns is more than absurd. Democratic candidates in total in 2020 spent $3 trillion, $3 trillion is three times the national debt.

It shows southwest flight 40, 69 on approach to land at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.This is about nine miles away from the airport in the town of Yukon. The plane was lined up to land on the runway that points to the southeast and the data from Flight Radar 24 says the flight got down to 520 feet above ground level. Let's put it into context. Only about four lengths of the 737 itself, about the height of the Washington Monument, half the size of the Empire State Building, about one-and-a-half football fields. The point here is that is very low for that distance from the airport, the FAA says a minimum safe altitude warning or MSAW alert sounded in the control tower prompting the air traffic controller to issue Southwest 4069 a low altitude alert. The pilots then climbed backed up and maneuvered for a safe landing. Nobody hurt here. The FAA is investigating. Southwest also doing its own internal investigation. But here's what the airline said in a statement: Southwest is following its robust safety management system, is in contact with the FAA to understand and address any irregularities with the aircraft's approach to the airport? Nothing more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees. The question here is how this could happen. Did the pilots improperly configure their instruments like in the crash of a Korean Air flight in Guam in 1997, or they just simply fatigue after a long day. Remember, this flight was coming in after midnight. Pilots, I've talked to, say they've been working especially hard lately. Big questions here for investigators, but the good news is the layers of safety work, that low altitude alerting system use by air traffic control stop the accident chain that was headed toward disaster -- Phil.",
