In the short term, however, we're still dealing with some rain and snow showers across portions of the Great Lakes and the Northeast this morning. You can see a lot. Most of its kind of focus more interior, but you do still have some heavy rain across portions of coastal Massachusetts as well as Maine. You've also got very strong winds, and that's not just limited to the Northeast, it stretches down through the mid-Atlantic all the way down into portions of the Southeast Georgia and the Carolinas. Looking at some of those wind gusts up around 40 to 55 mph. Now that system this morning is going to finally start to wrap up as we go through later on into the day today. But right on the heels, we have our next system. This will be spreading into the Midwest as we go through the day. Thursday could end up bringing some snow showers to areas just south of Chicago before it spreads into portions of Indiana by later on into the evening. Those temperatures we talked about, they are going to be coming down. Thirty-one for the high today in Chicago, down to the 20s by the weekend. Washington, D.C., New York, 50 degrees today, but barely above freezing by the time we get to the weekend.",

And there has been a continuing mop-up operation against Iranian targets inside Syria. Now, Netanyahu, by the time Trump gets sworn into office, may have mopped up all of the Israeli Defense Force wish list targets and deliver to Trump the gift of what looks like a quiet battlefield.

I mean, I think that Netanyahu will feel more compelled to listen to Trump than he listened to Biden because he relies so much on the Republican Party and the right-wing in America for his political base of support in the United States.But remember Netanyahu also has pressing domestic imperatives. And that the right-wing members of his cabinet have made clear that if he makes a hostage deal, which results in the release of Palestinian prisoners, or if he involves the Palestinian Authority in any way in governing the Gaza Strip, they could very well leave the government and topple Netanyahu. So I expect that Trump will continue to press, as Biden pressed, into the war in Gaza, because obviously, it doesn't look good and Trump wants to claim to be a great peacekeeper -- peacemaker. But, you know, I think Netanyahu will be pressed from the other side, and he may very well listen to his domestic constituency more than he listens to anything that any president of the United States says.",

And with European forces coming into Ukraine as peacekeepers to guarantee the ceasefire lines. I think that's the best case.[06:45:16] I think the worst case is that, you know, Trump forces Ukraine into a very one-sided deal where Ukrainian sovereignty is fundamentally compromised, where the Ukrainians have to agree not to have a large standing army, have to agree not to accept foreign weapons, not to accept foreign support. And basically that would turn Ukraine potentially into a country like Belarus, which is, you know, basically the satellite state of Moscow. So I think that's the worst-case scenario.",

And they want to keep supporting Ukraine and those who are either tired of war or their populations are divided and some are pro-Russian. So you could see real diplomatic chaos breaking down from that. I got to say on the positive side, what Max outlined, where you've got a cessation of violence and European NATO forces on the ground in NATO to keep the peace that would be a pipe dream of most Ukrainian officials.",

Disturbing hotel surveillance video of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. In May, CNN published exclusively obtained video from 2016. In it, you see the hip-hop mogul physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in the hallway of a hotel. Combs previously denied Ventura's allegations of assault, which were the basis of a now settled federal lawsuit filed by Ventura in 2023. Soon after the video was published, Combs apologized for his behavior in a video statement posted to Instagram. Now, in federal custody, Combs was arrested in September after a sprawling federal investigation. He's awaiting trial on numerous charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He's pleaded not guilty. Combs is also facing dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. Attorneys for combs deny the claims. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
