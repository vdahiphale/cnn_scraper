The House Select Committee investigating January 6 has ended its meeting where members discussed criminal referrals. This is according to multiple sources as reported to me, Annie Grayer and Zachary Cohen. One source told me, the meeting was seen as successful by committee members but didn't want to elaborate on that. The subcommittee focused on those referrals, presented its recommendations to the full panel, and one source telling my colleague, Jamie Gangel, the committee agreed on a path forward on referrals. Let's bring in CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. So, Elie, what are you expecting on this front? And just help us better understand, what are some of the complexities with making a decision like this? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, Pam, first of all, the committee obviously is in the process of deciding what they're going to do. They've said different things in the past. They've said they intend to. They said today's meeting was successful. So, we'll see what they do. But what's important to understand about a criminal referral from Congress or anybody else is that legally it has no specific impact. It's not binding on DOJ. They don't have to investigate because Congress or anybody else asks them to, and they don't need to be asked in order to investigate. They can do it on their own. We know DOJ is already investigating Donald Trump. But of course, this is an important way that the committee is going to have to think about how they want to end their presentation of evidence to us and do they want to sort of use a criminal referral as a capstone to all the findings and all the hearings that we've seen.",

And Congressman Adam Schiff, he spoke earlier today and he talked about one of the challenges being, well, if we put some names forward for criminal referral, we don't want to leave the impression that we didn't think these other people may have committed crimes or there may have been wrongdoing with them. And so, getting everyone on the same page could be a challenge. Here is what else he said about the possibility of referrals.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIF (D-CA):  We are as a subcommittee, several of us that were charged with making a recommendation about referrals, going to be making that recommendation full committee today. We will be releasing a report, I think, around the 21st. That will include whatever decision we've made on referrals. If we do make referrals, we want to be careful about how we do them. But I think we're all certainly in agreement that there is evidence of criminality here and we want to make sure the Justice Department is aware of that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, the committee is staffed with a bunch of elected, partisan members of Congress. And so, like it or not, it will look political and Donald Trump will say, you can bet, if he is part of this or anybody who is part of this referral, look at that, this is a political prosecution.You have Congress, a bunch of elected partisan officials, asking DOJ to prosecute. And there goes DOJ doing just as they're asked. So, that is the risk here. There's also the risk potentially of DOJ sort of recoiling and saying, listen, we don't take our marching orders from Congress. We're an independent body. We're part of the executive branch. So, it could cut both ways. There is a very delicate balance that the committee needs to achieve.",

Then this attack, the bombing took place on the 21st of December 1988. So, this is almost 34 years to bring this particular suspect to U.S. justice. And this is significant. He is accused of making the bomb. The bomb was put in a cassette player, wrapped in clothes, put in a hard-shell suitcase, went between several airports. The contention was worth, it was Libyan intelligence officials that did this. He was one of those intelligence officials.

Now, the council member president, she did resign, de Leon did not. He said he was going to take some time away. And now he is back in the public spotlight at this toy drive that ended in something that doesn't look anything like what the holiday spirit is supposed to be about. You can see him there wearing a Santa Claus hat. And then the activist that he was having this argument with, this altercation with, was wearing the green coat. You can see for yourself what happened. But who was the aggressor? Who committed assault potentially? That depends on who you ask. Let's look at a statement released by Kevin de Leon. Part of that statement where he says that he was simply acting in self-defense. He says, \"Once we were able to push open a door, try to get out, he says that Reedy, Jason Reedy, the activist in the video, launched a pelvic thrust, head butted his forehead. And his response was simply self- defense.\" But an attorney for that activist, Jason Reedy, says, \"No, no, no, that's not what happened.\" He says, it was de Leon's supporters who initiated physical contact by shoving the activist when he confronted the council member, and that his hands were straight up in the air. He did not initiate physical contact. You can see, though, in the video that this is terrible for the L.A. city council. This is our nation's second largest city. De Leon has been called a racist over and over and over again. And there have been calls for his resignation. This only adds fuel to that fire that he is not the right person for this job. Now, we've reached out to the LAPD. We were told that they do have this video. They know about the incident. No word yet on if any criminal charges have been filed, but this will continue. And Pamela, it really dates back to this ongoing issue within the L.A. City council about some members of the council, some from Latino heritage, who have been accused of trying to weaken, dilute the power of black city council members and the black community in L.A. This is a longstanding feud that has been boiling over in recent months because of that recording that was released in October. And now you have this cellphone video to add to it all. Pamela?",
