So, this is the last place that they can go. The Egyptian authorities are afraid that if the IDF goes into Rafah, this would cause people to panic and try and flee across the border into Egypt.

But it's really, it seems taking international political pressure and turning it over to the military to solve. And the military have solved this in essence already. The way they've been operating has been to try to move civilians out of the way. They drop flyers, they send text messages, and civilians are told, if you live in these neighborhoods, then take this route at this time and go to the Mwazi (PH) refugee camp next to the Mediterranean Sea.

[07:29:40] WALKER: Newly released results from a survey of the transgender population is giving us a close look at their lives at a time when their lives and rights are at risk. In 2022, the National Center for Transgender Equality polled more than 90,000 binary and non-binary transgender people ages 16 and older. Now, the survey covered everything from family life, work, and education, housing, and public accommodations. And they found that the majority of people who have transitioned said they are satisfied with their lives. 94 percent, who lived at least some time in a different gender report being a lot more or a little more satisfied with their lives. Only three percent indicated they were a little less or a lot less satisfied. The survey also asked respondents who were receiving hormone treatment, how they felt about their lives, and nearly all of them, 98 percent said, receiving treatments increased satisfaction with their lives. Just less than one percent said taking hormones made them less satisfied. Let's talk more about this, and the survey findings with Rodrigo Heng- Lehtinen. He is the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. Rodrigo, good morning. Thank you so much for joining me. So, first of, why did you do this survey? What did you set out to learn from it? RODRIGO HENG-LEHTINEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR TRANSGENDER EQUALITY: Good morning. Thank you so much for having me on today. Well, we really wanted to do this survey, because there is so much misinformation about what it really means to be transgender. We wanted to be able to provide the public with some real facts. You know, transgender people we're really small population. So, it's understandable that people may have questions about what it's all about. So, we wanted to make as deep and wide of a survey as possible, to really paint an accurate picture of who we are.",

And yet, overall, people are still saying that they are better off and feel more satisfied with life for having transitioned. And one thing that really stood out to me especially was growing family acceptance, oh, nearly half, 49 percent of respondents said that their immediate family was supportive of them, coming out as transgender. And that's just so heartwarming to me. Because at the end of the day, every transgender person is a part of someone's family. And everyone deserves to have that love and respect from (INAUDIBLE).

HENG-LEHTINEN: Well, since the last survey in 2015, there is been a dramatic escalation in hostile state legislation against transgender people all around the country. So, this time around for the survey, we asked people about if they've thought about moving out of the state that they live in because of the growing anti-transgender laws. And tragically, we found that nearly half have thought about moving, only because of this legislation or policy that makes it hard to live their daily lives as openly transgender people. And even five percent of respondents have already moved. And that's just so heartbreaking. You know, moving is disruptive, no one should have to make a decision between staying in their hometown or with their family, or having to essentially flee to another part of the country just to be safe.",

So, you can see that actually, transition-related health care is life- saving essential care. You know, it's understandable that people have some questions about what transition related healthcare entails, especially for young people. It's reassuring to know that this has been researched for decades. It's health care that's been looked into by the American Medical Association and all the leading medical institutions, and they have age-appropriate guidelines to make this really work for everybody. And we found through the U.S. Transgender Survey that the overwhelming majority of people who have been able to go on hormones or access transition related surgery, are more satisfied with life after being able to do it.
