Today, a federal appeals court in D.C. unanimously ruled that Mr. Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he may have committed during his presidency as he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The three federal judges strongly writing in their decision that, quote, for the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become a citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as president no longer protects him against this prosecution. The three female judges, two appointed by Democrats, one by a Republican, went even further than that today, however, repeatedly eviscerated citizen Trump's behavior after the 2020 election as an attack on American institutions. The judge is writing, quote: Former President Trump's alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were, if proven, an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government. He allegedly injected himself into a process in which the president has no role. The counting and certifying of the Electoral College votes, thereby undermining constitutionally established procedures, and the will of the Congress, unquote. Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump and his legal team are signaling that they're going to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, potentially with the former president writing on his social media platform that, quote, if immunity is not granted to a president, every president that leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party. Without complete immunity, a president of the United States would not be able to properly function, unquote. It's odd, one might observe, that the republic has somehow managed to survive more than 200 years without this being an issue until Donald Trump tried to overturn the election. CNN's Paula Reid starts off our coverage with a closer look at today's ruling and what comes next, as we move even closer to the 2024 presidential election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a unanimous historic ruling, three judges on the D.C.

The party -- political party affiliations of the judges is utterly irrelevant to their decision as it is to the decisions of all judges, all the way to the Supreme Court but today's decision was a historic decision. It is a landmark interpretation of the presidential powers under the Constitution of the United States. The former president had made the argument that he was absolutely immune from federal prosecution for any crimes that he may have committed while he was president. And today's decision, the court rejected that argument straight down the line and it was not an untimely decision. I know that there had been a lot of criticism of the court up to today, that it was dallying and taking its time at the expense of the trial that was scheduled for March. I never thought the court was dallying. I thought the court would rule about when it did and I also believed that the court would rule as it did today.

And Donald Trump has never had strong arguments in this area, but it's the U.S. Supreme Court that has the right to be the final arbiter of what is in the Constitution. And there might be some justices who think that they should do it. They also might be some justices who think that they shouldn't give Donald Trump any kind of, in their mind, short shrift here. It takes four justices to grant a case. It would take essentially five to try to expedite this, the way they're asking and I think in the end, it will probably produce a denial, but I'm not -- I'm not 100 percent certain, just because of how it plays out. But let me tell you what our audiences can start to look for. By Monday, Donald Trump will have to have made his initial filing to the Supreme Court, then the court will probably give us a schedule of when Jack Smith's responses do on behalf of the Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States. Probably his lawyers are writing that right now because they will want to keep the pressure on and so that if there's a chance for a trial to happen this spring, it can. And then Donald Trump will, of course, be able to do -- have a reply to however, Jack Smith responds. The justices next meet in private on February 16. There's a chance that they could actually take it up that soon. But I would think something of this magnitude actually might take a couple of weeks for them to decide whether they're going to take it and then to Judge Luttig's point about whether this is going to be an outright denial, there might be one or two justices who dissent from that, and they might actually be thinking about writing something and that's the last thing that John Roberts would want is for someone to dissent and say Donald Trump is not getting his fair day in court.",

There is no doubt that the Biden administration could be doing a much better job of securing our border and folks have heard me criticize this administration time and time again over the last three years for their failure to appropriately address this crisis. But it is absolutely true that there are tools that our government needs to have through statute to do a better and more complete job.One of those things that we must do is change the asylum standard. Right now, it's much too easy to claim asylum, even if you have no legal right to it. Four out of five people who come to the border and claim asylum passed the initial screening right now. That's absurd, when only 15 percent of people ultimately gain asylum in our country. So, we have to change that by statute. A second thing is closing the border. We had the authority during COVID to close the border under Title 42. As we know, a court ended that authority after the COVID pandemic ended. Our bill creates a new legal authority in statute that both allows and requires the government to shut down the border during times of heavy traffic.

The Qatar has said it was also positive, but they clearly indicated it wasn't a straight up and down yes/no answer. Hamas themselves and their own statement not detailing what they're actually putting that proposal, but it saying they have responded positively, but it still talking about the items that have so far way beyond reach of the scope of the deal, which has a complete ceasefire and the handing back of all their -- of all their prisoners. This is sort of language they're still using, but we don't know whatprecisely they've said. We know Mossad is evaluating this right -- evaluating Hamas's response right now, but I think let's break it down for a second. I mean, let's look at the timing of Hamas's response. We now know that it came literally an hour into the hands of the Qataris, an hour before the emir sat down with Secretary Blinken. So the timing of all this by Hamas, if had over a week to respond, everyone's been waiting for a week and they're doing this now, knowing that they're putting it right on Secretary Blinken's plate as he lands here and has his meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and others in the government tomorrow. So, it's really the timing here. It's got -- it's Hamas and it's under their sort of control and aegis, that part of it. But you know, the secretary of state, as he arrives here right now, is faced with this huge challenge. Prime Minister Netanyahu has indicated is not going to go along with one with what Hamas appears still to be asking for is members of his right-wing government have said that they would -- that they would leave the government, break the government. So it's hard to see where the compromises are going to come. So why is the language positive? We don't know, because we don't know what's in the detail.",

This makes sense that this was a central issue to the jury during deliberations. There was a specific question relating to how Ethan Crumbley got the gun. The jury asked, can they draw an inference that the prosecution did not put forth any evidence as to how the shooter actually gained access. And the judge, of course, said you have to base this off the evidence of the courtroom, so we know that that was a central issue to the jury and certainly something that seems to have swung the day in the prosecution's favor.",

In Jennifer Crumbley's case, that was a large part of the defense was pointing the finger at her husband, clearly, that was not successful ultimately.

You know, there may be a lot of -- the outcome may be tied up in the individual facts here, rather than a broad approach, but I don't know.
