      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Mother's Day. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We are tracking new developments in Gaza where Israel appears to be moving ahead with plans for an invasion of Rafah despite stark new warnings from top White House officials. Israel Defense Forces launching fresh attacks against Hamas overnight, targeting Northern and Central Gaza, as well as Rafah. The UN says at least 300,000 people have evacuated the city amid fears of an impending Israeli ground operation. Today, the White House says National Security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his Israeli counterpart about those plans. CNN's Paula Hancocks and Kevin Liptak are following all of the latest. Paula, to you first, what is the latest on the ground in Gaza? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, we are continuing to see people try and move out of the areas where the evacuation orders have been given, and also other parts of Rafah as well assuming that their evacuation orders will be coming later. Now, they are being told to move to the western part of the Gaza Strip, to the Al-Mawasi, it is one of the areas just along the coast, but is being described by UN teams on the ground as inhumane and saying that it is just not suitable for people to be moving to as the humanitarian situation is not good enough there. So what we are seeing is, of course, some cannot move. We are seeing some of the sick, some of the wounded are unable to leave. We are hearing from UN groups as well that some of the people who are leaving now have left on average, once a month. They have been moved on by the Israeli military, or they have been moved on for fear of being caught up in the fighting about once a month since October 7th. So a desperate situation, and of course, it is making the humanitarian crisis even worse as well. We know that the Rafah Crossing at this point, the Israeli military is in control of it, but Egypt is saying that they are not willing to coordinate with Israel at this point to try and reopen the crossing and bring more humanitarian aid trucks in, and they are citing security concerns. It is not just the concern about getting the trucks into Gaza, it is, of course, the distribution once they are in there and they are concerned for those truck drivers as well, driving into what is an active war zone. Now, we are hearing also the IDF saying that some 200,000 trucks did manage to get in over the past few days through Kerem Shalom. This is the fuel at this point, but many UN groups on the ground are saying, there is simply not enough food and water getting in. In fact, they are warning that some of their teams on the ground will run out of food to be able to distribute by Sunday. That is today. Also concerns that some of the bakeries, which have partially opened at this point will run out of stock completely by tomorrow, by Monday, so an already desperate situation becoming even more desperate. The IDF says, though one extra crossing has been opened in the north of the area, very few details on that. And they are also carrying out these military operations in the north and in the central part as well. We are not just talking about Southern Gaza here because the Israeli military says that they have intel that Hamas is actually moving back to those areas. They are regrouping, they are trying to re-establish infrastructure there and we are seeing evacuation orders of civilians in Jabalya for example, in the north, the refugee camp. This is an area that the Israeli military said that they had cleared months ago, that they had eradicated Hamas operatives from that particular area. But of course, this is now showing just how difficult it is to try and rid the Gaza Strip as Israel puts it and destroying Hamas completely, showing just how difficult that is, because they are having to go back to areas that they say were cleared of Hamas militants -- Fred.",

We are engaged in conversations with them about that.

You've heard a range of reactions, certainly from Republicans who are opposed to his decision, but also a range of view among Democrats. Listen to how two Democrats, the senator from this state, Delaware, Chris Coons and the senator from Connecticut, describe their views on this matter this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

What we learned in both of those efforts was that you cannot defeat a terrorist ideology. You cannot defeat a terrorist movement with military force alone. SEN.

Tomorrow, Trump's former fixer and attorney, Michael Cohen is expected to testify. Cohen's testimony is seen as key for the prosecution's case and could signal the final stages of this historic trial. He will testify to his role in negotiating the alleged hush money payment to adult film star, Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf., and how his former boss reimbursed him. It follows a week of blockbuster contentious and at times , graphic testimony from Daniels. CNN's Zach Cohen joining us right now. So Zach, what can we expect from Cohen's testimony?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Fred, this is really a make or break moment for prosecutors in this case. Michael Cohen is the only witness who will take the stand and can testify through the two core tenants of what prosecutors are alleging against Donald Trump. He can testify that Donald Trump agreed to this plan to pay Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress in order to stay quiet ahead of the 2016 election about their alleged involvement with each other romantically, and then there is also this -- the second act, after Donald Trump took the Oval Office, this meeting where they allegedly discussed a plan to reimburse Michael Cohen for fronting the money in order to keep Stormy Daniels quiet.So again, a lot hinges on what Michael Cohen will say when he takes the stand and takes the oath starting tomorrow is the expectation. And look, jurors have already heard a lot about Michael Cohen so far from other witnesses who have been testifying over the last three weeks. And frankly, much of it has been unflattering. Witnesses have testified that he is essentially unreliable, unpredictable, and aggressive attorney and one who really demonstrated a lot of loyalty towards Donald Trump when he was both an employee of Donald Trump as a private citizen and then also after Donald Trump took the Oval Office. So, it remains to be seen how prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys will question Michael Cohen, but you can be sure that Donald Trump's attorneys will almost certainly continue to hammer home this idea that Michael Cohen is not credible and they will try to convince the jury that anything that he says should be thrown out and questioned, frankly as he is a convicted liar. Prosecutors are going to say, look, we've laid the groundwork for his testimony in the last few days, even by introducing documents, text messages, and e-mails that do support the narrative that Michael Cohen has presented so far, both in the civil case against Donald Trump and his public comments. So we are going to see which way the jury leans, but again, a pivotal moment in this trial, and one that could determine -- ultimately determine whether or not Donald Trump is found guilty or not.",

There are bridges that are in many places inadequate and/or in a state of serious disrepair and subject to collapse. So we have the money there. There are two different pots of money. One is what we call the major bridge pot of money and is several hundred million dollars available for a single bridge to be built. For example, the big bridge in Southern Ohio into Kentucky that was funded by that. So that is possibly a source of money for the Baltimore situation.

The United States has for 40 years now called for a two-state solution. The current prime minister has not supported that. There will be in Israel a change in their government at some time, maybe sooner, maybe later. But when that happens, the United States will continue to work as it has for decades, seeking a peaceful resolution of this most difficult conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and there is a solution. But we need also to be aware of the lessons that the United States learned in Iraq and specifically in Afghanistan. You cannot remove at terrorist organization with a war. You have to do it in multiple ways. Certainly, the continuation of the war effort will be necessary, but not in a way that creates even more conflict. Consider for a moment, at the outset of this Gaza War, Israel had the support of dozens of nations around the world, almost all of Europe. The conduct of the war by Israel has turned the world, much of it including now much of the United States and certainly the campus of the United States turned them against Israel. You don't -- you think you can win a war with military, but there is more to it than that, and Israel, in the way in which it conducted its campaign has in fact lost the war -- the support necessary to gain the support of well, right now, the president of the United States and a good deal of the Congress of the United States. So Israel needs to keep this in mind. Final thought, we are not going to divorce from Israel.

Pretty small. [15:50:00] This time, the buzz was really electric. All 55 planes and I could see the crowds on the ground there on the National Mall. I could see the cameras and the highlight was really being able to broadcast live from my airplane to the AOPA Live web stream and here I am talking to Tom Haynes, aviation journalist and a name longtime CNN viewers might be familiar with, Miles O'Brien who were on the ground hosting this.

How great. I think you probably inspired a lot more pilots and anyone else who wants to work in aviation just by virtue of what you just showed us.

You don't have to be a professional fly like one, although a lot of professionals in the pilot group here.All 55 planes were also inspected really heavily by the Secret Service ahead of time. There was a dog sweep. There was a lot of coordination also with the federal government, with the FAA, the TSA, Customs and Border Patrol, Secret Service.

And so we are talking about the airports that are in your backyard that have a flight school. It is the stepping stone for a lot of people to bigger and better things.But really, for a lot of us, it is the way to enjoy aviation, just for the thrill of it. You don't have to be a professional to fly like one. This is the way to do it. For me, it is a family tradition and the big thing here is I fly in honor of my parents, Scott Muntean, my dad, he died of brain cancer. He was a pilot. He died when I was 12. And then my mom, Nancy Lynch, she was an aerobatic pilot and air show pilot, she died in a plane crash when I was 18 and I felt it was so fitting that they were able to give aviation to me, the greatest gift I could ever possibly receive. And really so fitting that this was on the day before Mother's Day. I felt like my mom and my dad were in the airplane with me. I was with one of my best friends with me in the airplane. It was so, so, so incredible. And my mom's big crusade was trying to get more women and more people of color in to aviation because the representation there is really disproportionately small. And so hopefully, we are able to change some of that. The big thing here, take a flying lesson. If you get to your local airport, try it out and see it. If you've ever been thinking about it, I said in the air, you're not too old to try and you're not too young to try. We try and hook people early, but you should really try and do this soon.",
