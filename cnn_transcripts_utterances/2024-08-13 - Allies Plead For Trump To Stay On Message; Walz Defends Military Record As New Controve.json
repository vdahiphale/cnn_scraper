And it was a startup backed by J.D. Vance meant to employ local Kentucky workers, but those workers allege nightmare conditions as the company went under. We've got the CNN investigation. Good evening, everybody. I'm in for Laura Coates. I'm Jim Acosta. Tonight, a plea from Trump allies to Trump himself. New CNN reporting shows that those closest to the former president are alarmed he cannot stay on message. They acknowledge Trump's race baiting insults and conspiratorial rants are unproductive and the campaign has wasted an early opportunity, they say, to blunt the momentum of Kamala Harris. One source close to Trump saying this: \"This is a different race now. The Democrats are energized. They have a massive machine -- and she's raising money, and she can put a coherent argument against him. It should be easy. Talk about the economy and talk about immigration.\" So, what's the campaign for Donald Trump doing tonight? They're talking about immigration, except it's leaning into an old strategy that those same Trump allies are worried about, race baiting and dehumanization. His campaign war room sharing this anti-immigrant meme online. It shows side by side images, one with an American flag flying outside of a house labeled \"your neighborhood under Trump,\" the other shows a 2023 photo of Central American and African migrants in New York City waiting to get temporary housing labeled \"your neighborhood under Kamala.\" And the headline reads, \"import the third world, become the third world.\" It goes without saying illegal border crossings, we've reported this over and over, are significantly down the last six months. The numbers also show violent crime has dropped across the U.S. during the first quarter of this year. But Trump is clearly eager to exploit what he sees as a weakness for Kamala Harris and it fits with the same divisive language he has used to talk about immigration throughout this campaign.

Videos revealed by \"The Washington Examiner\" show Walz appearing with an imam in Minnesota who has shared antisemitic posts on Facebook in the past and defended the October 7th terror attack by Hamas. Walz appeared with Imam Asad Zaman at several events since 2018 and praised his work in the community. But Walz has not met with Zaman since October 7th. A campaign spokesperson said that Walz and the imam do not have a personal relationship, adding -- quote -- \"Governor Walz strongly condemns Hamas terrorism.\" Zaman saying tonight that he shared the posts -- quote -- \"without fully looking at them,\" adding, \"desiring harm to people is against my faith and my personal convictions.\" The panel is back with me. Kadia, what do you -- what do you make of this issue with Walz? I mean, we knew this was going to happen. It was relatively unknown nationally.

Biden was vice president at the time. The White House says tonight he knew nothing about it. Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, called the request proper and added --quote -- \"No meeting occurred, no project materialized, no request for anything in the U.S. was ever sought and only an introduction in Italy was requested.\" Kenneth Vogel of \"The New York Times\" broke this story. He joins me now. Ken, what are the implications here?

They started dribbling out this information. And it wasn't until after President Biden dropped out that they actually released the particular information, these records that led to this story. And so, while that timing seemed coincidental and certainly was worth us noting, if you talk to folks who specialize in the Freedom of Information Act, they will tell you that these -- these processes sort of take on a life of their own, tend to be quite glacial in their progress, and it would be unlikely for them to be able to turn it around quickly enough to be able to peg it to his dropping out.

Now, the prosecutors have suggested that they have evidence that he reached out to the U.S. government on behalf of foreign clients. They didn't specifically mention this one. Instead, they were focused in a filing last week on his work on behalf of a Romanian real estate magnate reaching out to the U.S. embassy in Romania.

The bureau's Little Rock field office is going to be opening a case. Let's get right to CNN senior law enforcement analyst Chief Charles Ramsey. Chief, good to see you as always. I mean, talk about this video if you can. I mean, it's remarkable to me.

Now, whether or not they terminated him in a union, got his job back, whatever it may be, he had no business being a police officer.And when you see cases like this, it really points to a big problem that we have in policing, and that is a chief's ability to really be able to hold an individual accountable or keep an officer from moving from one department to another.",
