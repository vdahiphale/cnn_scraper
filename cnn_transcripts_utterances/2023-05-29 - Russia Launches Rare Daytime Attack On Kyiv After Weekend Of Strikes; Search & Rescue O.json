It does suspend the debt limit through January of 2025, which is critical, as it saves the country from having this fight again until after the 2024 election.It also caps nondefense spending but allows for a 1 percent increase in 2025. Neither Social Security nor Medicare will be affected by this. The deal tightens work requirements. This was a big sticking point for Republicans. These are for work requirements for programs meant to help families in need. Right now adults without children who are between the ages of 18 and up, they need to work at least 20 hours a week to receive food stamps regularly. This plan increases that age from 49 on the top side to 55 under this agreement. The deal also claws back $30 billion in unused COVID-19 funds. And it also cuts new spending on the IRS. Congress approved about $80 billion in new funding for the IRS last year. This plan now reduces that by 20 billion over 10 years. John?",

The video shows the moment debris from one of those intercepted missiles fell from the sky barely missing a bus and bringing another car to a stop there.

These latest attacks where were they scan their surface to surface or air to surface missiles.They're among the more potent weapons in the Russian armory. And clearly a new intent or a renewed attempt, I should say, to go after the civilian population because of course, schoolchildren are out, people are going about their daily business. Kyiv is a city that is in many ways returned to semi normal life. Following the beginning of the war more than a year ago now they have learned to live with the overnight bombardments which marked last night the 16th day this month that Kyiv has become under focused attack in an attempt to overwhelm its air defenses ahead of the anticipated summer offensive. And now we've got this series of attacks 11 very substantial missiles, all of them mercifully shot down by Kyiv's air defenses, whilst the Ukrainians continue to threaten this new summer offensive.

But it also shows that they cannot let their guard down because so many people are traveling 2.72 million people flew on Friday.That's the highest number we have seen since the 2020 downturn in air travel. It's bigger than the same day in 2019. In fact, we've seen that over and over again this week. You know, so this is really being celebrated by passengers also by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg who showed off that the cancelation rate going into this weekend has been about 1 percent which is a lot lower when you think back to last Memorial Day when airlines canceled about 2,700 flights in total, kicked off those cascading meltdowns all summer long between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Airlines canceled about 55,000 flights nationwide. The good news here is that through this first wave of travel and now the second wave is everyone comes starts -- starts coming home all at once, the cancelations have been pretty low, only about 600 cancelations nationwide since Thursday. We're seeing only about 60 so far today. So, so far, so good. We will see if airlines can keep it together as people start coming home. Today is going to be a pretty busy day according to the Transportation Security Administration expecting about 2.6 million people at airports nationwide. Also a really busy day on the roads. Remember, Memorial Day is much more of a driving holiday and AAA anticipated more than 30 million people driving 50 miles or more. The worst time to travel right now is right this moment between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. AAA says. So try and leave a little bit later if you can, although really depends on what metro area you're in. I-95 between Richmond and D.C. here, that's one of the worst stretches everyone kind of knows that if you're on the East Coast. And traffic they're going to be four times the norm. So you should try and put it up if you can. Even AAA says wait until Tuesday, even Wednesday. Although that's only if you're not working Memorial Day for some labor day for you and I, Kate.",

Not far from here, though we are seeing some families coming together on the issue of staffing lifeguard positions has really been a persistent problem for several years ago -- several years now. A spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association estimated that about half of America's pools, public pools, could be impacted either by closing or with a reduction in hours. And as you'll hear from him, there have been some initiatives from some municipalities to try to boost their lifeguard numbers, but they're falling short. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
