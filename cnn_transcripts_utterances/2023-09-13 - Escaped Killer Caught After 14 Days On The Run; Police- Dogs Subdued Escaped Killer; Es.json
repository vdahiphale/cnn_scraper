We don't have word that he has done that yet. And we got word that he did not talk or cooperate right after being captured.The sequence went a little bit like this. And a little after midnight eastern time last night, there was a burglar alarm that went off in a house inside the perimeter of the search area. Officers went to that house, did not find anything there. But about 1 am Eastern Time, a fixed wing aircraft flown by the DEA found a heat signature on the ground. Unfortunately, the timing was such that a lightning storm came in right after that, and the aircraft had to get out of the sky. But they weren't able to send a tactical team to the area where the heat signature was found, and kind of surround that area. At a little after 8 am, they closed in on Danelo Cavalcante. He apparently was not aware of their presence at first, but quickly became aware of it. And that's when he started to try to get away. He crawled away with the rifle that he's still with him. And that's when they released the dog that actually subdued him. This is my exchange with Lieutenant Colonel George Bevins of the Pennsylvania state police about the encounter between the dog and Cavalcante. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When I spoke to him after the news conference, he said that while Cavalcante was crawling on the ground, trying to get away, he had that rifle that he's still within his grasp. I mean, within his arm's length of him. And when the dog was on top of them, the rifle was within reaching distance. So, it was a bit of a close call when the dog was on top of him. And the dog didn't bite him.There was a wound on his scalp apparently. But it's not clear if the dog actually bid them on the head or whether he got that wound from something else. But it was kind of a close call, Dana, because the rifle was within his reach when the dog was on top of him. Thankfully no injuries to law enforcement personnel, to the dog or any member of the public, but it was a bit of a close call there.",

People don't realize just how difficult that is in terms of the logistics and bringing everyone together, but they do come together, and they come together seamlessly. This was a very intense effort over an extended period of time. They finally caught a break with that burglar alarm or alerted them to a particular area. The DEA playing using FLIR technology was able to get that heat registered. So, they knew they had a person in that area. So, they were able to kind of surround.Being in Philadelphia now, we had a tremendous rainstorm last night. And so, they obviously had to shut down the areal support during that period of time, but it gave them an area to really focus on. And then as soon as they were able to close in and thank God for that dog who deserves a medal, by the way. They were able to capture him without having to resort to lethal force. And he was armed. We don't know if he were to use that gun or not. But he's already killed two people and he definitely was a desperate individual, but it was resolved without any bloodshed. And that is just always a positive outcome.",

It was an outstanding job in partnership, not just with law enforcement, with the community also. And I think, when I heard a governor speak this morning, he talked about how important that partnership was. How important funding is to make sure we have the right equipment. The technology really played an important role in this. The use of the canine. But also, the state agency deciding to wait until daylight to go in after the subject, that for his safety and also the safety of the officers that were there. So, it was an amazing job by all law enforcement partnerships. And we see that across the country. And so, like Chief Ramsey said, it was a great job.

It's an enormous accomplishment through two incredibly hard weeks for these folks that have been literally cutting their way through the woods.However, unfortunately, we live in a time where law enforcement is under incredible scrutiny. And they are the actions and micro actions of every law enforcement officer under the microscope of every single day. And anything that we do that creates an impression of gratuitousness, or kind of self-congratulatory feel, I think, doesn't help the public's perception of law enforcement.

What does it mean?It's important because it has its return value. However, that's not the only item that authorities have to look at. They have to look at everyone else who assisted, who aided, who in any regard tried to right facilitate him escaping or eluding police.

We had, I remember when I was in the FBI 2013, we had an FBI dog, a two-year-old German Shepherd, who had a barricaded subject in an abandoned bar in upstate New York. And the team couldn't even send a robot and it was so dangerous to get in front of this guy had been shooting at them. They sent the dog in first. The dog was shot in the chest and died.But by going in first, he enabled our team to go in and take this person to actually shoot the subject without sustaining any additional injuries to the team.
