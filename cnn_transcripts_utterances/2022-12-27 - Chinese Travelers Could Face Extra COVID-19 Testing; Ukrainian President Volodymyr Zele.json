You have two hours of CONNECT THE WORLD, live from Abu Dhabi.Well, we begin with the growing international fallout over China's announcement that it will ease restrictions on its citizens traveling overseas. And it will stop requiring international arrivals to quarantine. This latest U-turn on China's zero COVID policy comes even as COVID cases are surging across the country. And that has other nations worried. Japan and India say they will require travelers from China to show a negative COVID test upon arrival. They may soon see more Chinese visitors than they have in three years. More now from CNN's Selina Wang in Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

China is dropping quarantinefor all international rivals from January 8th and promising to gradually restart out unforeseen (ph) for Chinese citizens. Inbound travelers still need to get a 48-hour negative COVID test before boarding. But they dropped all the other cumbersome requirements. To understand why these changes are such a big deal, we have to look at what the reality has been in China during the pandemic. The country has been severely limiting who can go in and out of the country, with strict border controls. Flights have been very limited and expensive. All arrivals had to go through quarantine and government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines myself, including 21 days earlier this year. And we are talking about harsh quarantines, no choice in where you get sent, no opening your door, except for food pickups and COVID tests. All of that is now going away. This new change would effectively also end the ban on Chinese citizens from going overseas for nonessential reasons. But the timing is still unclear. Authorities have not said when they'll restart issuing tourist visas or allowing foreigners to apply for business, study or family reunion visas. But finally, people are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Online searches for popular international travel destinations on China's travel booking site jumped 10 times within an hour of when this announcement was made. I've also spoken to a few Chinese citizens who have been stuck overseas for years. They're overjoyed and relieved that finally there is a way for them to see family. But there's also some bitterness over how long this has taken. They have already missed so many important moments -- family deaths, births, reunions. But in response to this change, other countries are starting to issue restrictions on travelers from China. Japan announced travelers from the country will be tested for COVID upon arrival. Japan's prime minister also said the country will restrict plans to increase flights in and out of China. India announced similar COVID testing guidelines. Authorities in India said the guidelines are aimed at ensuring COVID does not spread as quickly as it has been in China -- Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They've beenenduring relentless Russian shelling and, of course, civilians often getting caught in the crossfire. That as well, a handful of people remaining in Bakhmut have no electricity, they have no heat. The only way they can get any small comfort is in an underground bomb shelter. They have to spend a lot of time in those shelters. They're essentially playing a game of roulette. Every time they step outside of their homes or even within their homes, because they could have shells coming down on them. President Zelenskyy, when he talks about these difficult and painful times in the Donbas, it's an unspoken way of referring to the heavy casualties that are likely being sustained on both sides. Numbers that usually go unreported. But nonetheless, that is something that happens every single day here in Ukraine, people are dying. They're not just dying on the front lines, they're dying in other places as well. Whether they are people who are suffering through bitter cold without electricity and without heat, without the ability to cook, this is incredibly difficult for the vulnerable, elderly and medically, you know, medically disabled population here in Ukraine. And of course, for the children who are suffering the emotional scars of this constant barrage of Russian attacks. There were the air raid sirens that went off nationwide, earlier today. The sirens have stopped for now, Becky. But the Ukrainians think the Russians might be using their bombers to cause air raid alerts across this country to plan for some sort of a New Year's Eve attack. In other words, they put these planes up in the air. They know that Ukraine will sign the air raid alerts because, if these bombers were to fire, Ukraine cannot shoot a lot of these bombs down, they don't have Patriots yet, they don't have the capability. Then Russia uses that intelligence to figure out where to fire upon next. And so, they're really bracing themselves here for what may be to come in the coming days, Becky.",

And they track them for some five hours. So we've been told that five came across the border. One approached the capital, Seoul, and then four of the others were flying around Ganghwa Island, which is just off the west coast of the peninsula. Now South Korea's reaction was that they scrambled fighter jets and attack helicopters. In fact, one of those fighter jets did crash. The defense ministry say there's no injury to the crew itself.

So a tit-for-tat response for what North Korea had done as well, the spokesperson saying it's a clear provocation and an invasion of our airspace by North Korea. Now it is unusual for this to happen but it's not unprecedented. The last time that a drone was detected by the South Koreans was back in 2017. That is when they discovered a crashed North Korean drone. At the time the military said they believed it had been photographing a U.S. built missile defense system in the country. Also, a similar situation in 2014, when they discovered a crashed drone from North Korea. Now this has been a concern from the South Korean side but it's also coming at a time, a historic time, when North Korea has been continually firing missiles and launching missiles throughout 2022. Never in its history have we seen what we have seen this year. It also comes at a time when relations between the two Koreas are particularly bad -- Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In the meantime, the lines of migrants are growing longer at the U.S.- Mexico border, with the Trump era immigration policy known as Title 42 still in limbo. The policy, which allows border officials to quickly expel migrants to slow the spread of COVID-19, was due to expire last week. CNN's Camilla Bernal spoke with one migrant family about their hopes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A dream come true in the form of a hula hoop, toys their parents say they would not be able to afford in native Venezuela. An opportunity for his children, says this 30-year old, who left his country more than three months ago with his partner and four children. In November, they made it to the U.S. and turned themselves in to immigration authorities. \"They sent us back,\" he said. And because they're not legally married, the two got separated. And after about a week in a detention center, they ended up in two different cities in Mexico. Elvin's partner, Caroline, says she was told they were being sent back to Mexico because of Title 42, which allows border agents to immediately expel migrants, citing COVID-19 concerns. And this is what they say led them to an illegal crossing 20 days later. \"I wanted to cross legally,\" says Caroline, but as a family, they felt they had no other option. It's a desperation felt by many here. And, as a result, they end up on the streets during a cold front in El Paso. The city accommodates those who have documentation taking more than 400 people into this makeshift shelter in its convention center over the holiday weekend. Others ending up in Washington, D.C., outside of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence.",
