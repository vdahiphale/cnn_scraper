      "sentences": "This latest episode involving the lavish trips that Justice Thomas took, but did not disclose, touches directly on concerns about the Supreme Court's integrity and why the justices do not have a formal code of ethics.These kinds of off-bench activities have been cropping up more and more. But this report is probably one of the most staggering. ProPublica after an extensive investigation found that Justice Thomas has benefited from travel and lodging at these lush hotels provided by a private individual on a scale like no other Supreme Court justice has. Harlan Crow is a major Republican donor who has an interest in reshaping the judiciary. At his expense, Thomas and his wife, Ginni, took trips to Indonesia, New Zealand and other places across the world. These trips were not disclosed, and in fact, remained largely secret until now. There's some ambiguity about what Justice Thomas should have disclosed under federal law. The justices currently put only minimal amounts of information on their annual financial disclosure forms. They also have no formal ethics code or a way for the public to lodge complaints, ethics complaints against the justices and have them resolved in some way. The justices say that they abide by rules for lower court judges, but it's very difficult for the public to know if they do. In 2011, the last time Chief Justice John Roberts addressed the ethics issue, he said, essentially trust us. We follow rules that lower court judges use. He said he had confidence in all of his colleagues. But he has been essentially silent since then, even though these questionable activities keep coming to public light. Neither Chief Justice John Roberts nor Justice Thomas responded to our questions after the ProPublica report. Earlier this year, we learned of extensive efforts undertaken by Thomas's wife, Ginni, to try to reverse the 2020 election results that landed Joe Biden in the White House. Justice Thomas did not recuse himself from election related cases. Step back and consider how much concentrated power over American lives rest with the Supreme Court, these nine justices. Public approval of the court has been dropping, particularly since it reversed nearly a half century of precedent in the June Dobbs decision. That ruling reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had declared a constitutional right to abortion. Harlan Crow said that in a statement -- first given to ProPublica, and then to CNN -- that he and his other guests did not discuss cases with Thomas. But consider the access that these corporate and conservative leaders had to Justice Thomas. And also consider the appearance that justices could be vulnerable to such gifts of travel and hospitality. Unreported gifts as they were. Maybe this latest episode will lead the high court to finally adopt some formal rules, or at least to respond to questions and be more transparent about their off-bench behavior.

So, let's perhaps seen as a as a moment of optimism. But make no mistake. There are distinct differences between these two nations and their approach to the war in Ukraine. President Macron is blaming Russia for disrupting the peace in Europe. On the other hand, we have China and President Xi trying to take a hands-off neutral approach yet not going far, according to some, to condemn Russia for the invasion. We also had seen diplomatic ties and economic ties between China and Russia actually strengthened during this time of war.
