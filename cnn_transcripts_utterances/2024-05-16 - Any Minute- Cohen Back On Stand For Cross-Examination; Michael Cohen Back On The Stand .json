The Trump hush money coverup trial right now is on a brief break. We do expect Michael Cohen to retake the witness stand soon.We are told by reporters inside the room that he was breathing heavily as he left the room. He has to cross behind where Donald Trump is sitting at the defense table in order to leave the room. And then Donald Trump and his coterie of Republican allies who were seated in the rows behind him have also just left the room for this brief break.

And for a brief period of time, he represented Michael Cohen. He was the only witness that the Trump defense a year ago put before the grand jury in this case. They're not calling in here. But some of his interactions with Cohen are coming in through this testimony about the pardon.Now, the -- really, the key part of Rob Costello's testimony before Congress, and his story that he's told publicly many times is he said when he represented Michael Cohen, he repeatedly asked if he had any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of Donald Trump. Because, Costello said, that could help you -- because you are currently under investigation, that could potentially help you. Do you have anything? And Cohen according to Costello said that he \"had nothing on President Trump and could not cooperate against him.\" And Blanche just brought that up. And he said, did you say that that you had no evidence of allegedly criminal conduct? And Cohen got a little squishy. He said no. Then Blanche followed up and said, well, do you mean you didn't say that, or you don't recall? And Cohen says I do not recall. So, that lends credibility to what Costello is saying that at least for a time, Cohen claimed to have no evidence of criminal conduct on Trump.",

And that was Michael Cohen talking about Costello, saying he was sketchy, saying that he was essentially at certain times, holding over him that he had this relationship with Giuliani, who was so close to the former president.

However, the one correlation I will say here is once we start seeing or hearing from our court reporters that Michael Cohen's voice is getting more rapid, that he is starting to have to explain things, that he sounds a little bit less measured, that's where you're starting to see Donald Trump perk up. Remember Donald Trump wants to see Michael Cohen destroyed on the stand. It's not just Michael Cohen who hates Donald Trump, which we've obviously has been laid out in this case.

I think that it feels like from the reporting I'm getting for you, all that -- the cross is going pretty good. It seems like Blanche has a pretty good rhythm going. There have not been a lot of objections. You know, I've been in front of this judge and with these prosecutors on a very similar case, and you know, their goal when you're on cross-examination is to stop the rhythm.

Michael Cohen is back on the witness stand. And, Michael, as much as -- you know, obviously, we knew Trump's team wanted to say that Michael Cohen is a liar and to raise doubt in the juror's minds about whether or not they can trust him. But it seems like this is at a point where really the question for the jury will be, when can they start believing what Michael Cohen said, and can they believe what he said on the witness stand earlier this week? I mean, when as a defense attorney, do you know if you've achieved your goal? I mean, the jury doesn't really give much away. VAN DER VEEN: Well, that's a really good question. Really, I think the main goal of this cross-examination is to set up the closing argument, to answer that very question you just asked. That they're setting up the closing argument, and they're going to hit the jury instructions hard. They're going to hit the credibility of witnesses, oh, there's a wicked good jury instruction for the defense which is you are the --- you the jurors are the sole judges of credibility. And then he's going to bank all of the things that were incredible in his past, and even in this trial. Faults in one, faults in all. They're going to argue -- and because the judge is going to instruct the jury, if you believe the witness testified falsely about any one thing in this case, you can believe all of the testimony was false. And then -- and it rolls right into guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This is the linchpin of your case. And what -- this is what you're left with. You're left with a guy who's incredible, who lied to you before this trial, lied to you in this trial, and they haven't met that high burden of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

His inability to at really any point in his life that's been examined of is, to tell the truth. And that's been very difficult.
