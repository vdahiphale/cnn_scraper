But first this evening, we are following two major stories for you this hour. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Friday's decision by the court is not a ruling on whether Israel's actions constitute genocide. The court also stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. We were live in The Hague in just a few moments. But first, two new reporting about a major U.N. agency that operates inside Gaza, as we told you at the top of the show in what is a stunning allegation, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is firing several staff members accused of being involved in the October the 7th Hamas attacks on Israel. CNN has reached out to the agency as well as to the Israeli authorities for more details about the alleged involvement of workers. In response to the accusations, the U.S. State Department says it is pausing additional funding for UNRWA. Our chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt joins us now from Washington. And Alex, these are indeed startling allegations. Do we know at this point the nature of what the start of the UNRWA staff as involvement here?",

But UNRWA taking immediate action, saying that they are investigating these staffers, that their contracts have been terminated. There is quite a bit of animosity by Israel directed towards UNRWA. But for the time being, Israel isn't offering any more details. We did hear from the Defense Minister. Yoav Gallant who wrote on Twitter that these humanitarian workers, and he put that in quotes just to speak to that animosity, he said that they have blood on their hands, but UNRWA not wasting any time. They know that their credibility is on the line, that they know that their focus needs to be getting this aid into Gaza. Such a desperate situation primarily in southern Gaza, we want the secretary -- that on the State Department side, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, he learned about this from UNRWA on Wednesday, that additional detail that we've gotten is that there are 12 staffers involved according to the United States.

Well, the news about UNRWA came just hoursafter an International Court of Justice issued a landmark-ruling ordering Israel to take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza. It rejected Israel's request to throw out the case brought by South Africa, but did not call for a ceasefire. The court hasn't actually ruled yet on whether genocide is taking place in Gaza, but says the catastrophic humanitarian situation requires emergency measures before it even gets worse. Well, a Palestinian official says its decision means the cries and suffering of our people have been heard. Israel's Prime Minister calls it a vile attempt to deny Israel the right to self-defense in its war on Hamas. Our Melissa Bell joins us now live from The Hague with more.

And the Foreign Minister saying, again that we've heard before that the charges of genocide are false, and this is an abuse of the genocide conventions. These are things we've heard before.

She held her grandson's hand. In his other hand, he had a white flag. CNN's Clarissa Ward has this report. And a warning, some of the following images are difficult to watch, but they are important to show the full picture of events as they unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) These are the last moments of Hala Khreis's life. You can see her here, leading a group of 30 odd people. They wave white flags, a plea for safe passage out of their neighborhood now surrounded by Israeli forces. She holds the hand of her 5-year-old grandson, Taim, tightly and then suddenly. Little Taim quickly runs away as her son, the Hamid, rushes towards her. If you slow the video down, you can see Hala start to turn just before she is shot, as if she had caught sight of something. From the angle of her fall and the movement of the fleeing group, it is clear that the bullet came from the west or the south. CNN has geo-located the intersection. Hamid told us when he reached his mother, he looked up and saw two Israeli tanks ahead of him to the south. And just 200 meters to the west, we know Israeli troops were stationed at the new Gaza Prep School for Boys, as captured here in satellite images and a photograph published on November 12th, the day Hala was killed. SARA KHREIS (through translator): It's really hard for me to look at the pictures, but I try to remember the beautiful gatherings that we used to share together. WARD (voice-over): Hala's 18-year-old daughter, Sara, was further back in the group. Now safely in Istanbul, she tells us the family had agonized over whether to leave their home. But after two nights of the most intense bombardment yet, decided to move. KHREIS (through translator): I remember that my mom, after we all sat down and discussed, she got up and went to the kitchen to make breakfast for everyone in the house. When she was making breakfast, she also went to pray a Duha prayer. It's really hard. Really hard.",

Because he wasn't too long ago, he just signed a contract extension through 2026. But look, he's been honest. He's reflected on the reasons, the energy and the energy that he needs to stay in that top-flight job. I will say this, when you go back to 2002, I think of Alex Ferguson announced he was retiring in 2002. He reconsidered and he went on to manage United at until 2013.
