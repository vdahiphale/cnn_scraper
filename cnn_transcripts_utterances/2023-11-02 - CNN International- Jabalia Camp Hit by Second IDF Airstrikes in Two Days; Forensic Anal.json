Nobilo.Live images now of the Rafah crossing from Gaza into Egypt, where a group of people have gathered, hoping to make it through today. On Wednesday, we saw a brief opening of the gate from Gaza to the outside world, letting some Palestinians leave the enclave for the first time since Israel declared war on Hamas. Egyptian officials say at least 361 people with foreign passports left Gaza and ambulances carried dozens of wounded Palestinians out so they could receive treatment in Egyptian hospitals. Israeli air strikes hit in the vicinity of the al-Quds Hospital in Gaza Wednesday evening and have continued. The hospital director tells CNN the strikes intensified this morning and are getting closer to the hospital, where 14 thousand displaced people are taking refuge. Meanwhile, Israel has now confirmed both air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. But what remains unknown right now is the full extent of the devastation and just how many people were killed in the attacks. The IDF claims a Hamas command center was the target of Wednesday's strike. While on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it targeted and killed one of the Hamas commanders responsible for the October 7th attacks on Israel. But the strikes have left behind catastrophic damage in the densely populated camp. More now from CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and a warning to you that her report contains graphic images and scenes that are very hard to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dust and debris filled the air after an Israeli airstrike. Ambulance, ambulance calls the man carrying the child. These are the moments after the Israeli militaries attack on the Jabalia camp in Gaza. Everyone is disoriented and terrified. And this is the result. Several city blocks levelled in an instant. The scene is apocalyptic. Survivors desperately digging for their loved ones with bare hands. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas commander hiding in this densely populated residential area. An IDF spokesperson called the death of innocent civilians a tragedy of war. That tragedy tearing apart this community, no one yet knows how many still lie under the ruins. Shortly after the bombs fell, cams in the enclave were mostly severed. But one Palestinian cameraman was among those able to post on social media. The anguish is heart wrenching. The victims small and afraid. Moms and dads will bury their children. All three of my children are dead, this father screams, all three. Entire families are wiped out. This man holds up the name of 15 relatives killed in the airstrike. My whole family, innocent people are dead, he says. Total destruction. Our whole building is gone -- 20 stories. This is a massacre. At a nearby hospital, the carnage is on display. The bodies keep piling up. With her dead children at her feet, this mother prays for strength. Many in this forsaken enclave feel they have no one but God left. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a dire situation for the hospital, which is the closest healthcare facility to the Jabalia refugee camp. The hospital's chief says a secondary generator is working in some areas, but many vital systems, including the ventilation system in operating rooms, the hospital's only oxygen station and refrigerators in the morgue are all without power.The utter cruelty of the Hamas attacks on Israel on October the 7th is being starkly revealed in Israel's forensic laboratories, fragments of bone, flesh and other pieces of the terrorist victims are going under the microscope with the hope of identifying those who were killed.

The letter warns those institutions against giving anti-Semitism a foothold and to avoid false equivalency. It says in partIt is ironic that the very halls of enlightenment in America and Europe ostensibly, the bastions of intellectual and progressive thought that are your campuses have adopted Hamas as a cause celebre, while Israel is demonized. Let's be clear, Hamas shares no values with any Western academic institutions. It comes at a time when university students in the U.S. and Europe are protesting Israel's air strikes on Gaza. Many accused Israel of targeting civilians. Israel denies that, saying Hamas is the target of its bombings. Universities around the world are also reporting an uptick of anti-Semitic threats. College campuses in the U.S. have a long history of being hives of political activism, especially during times of conflict. CNN's Elle Reeve spoke to students at three American universities on how they feel about on campus protests in the midst of the Israel Hamas war. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
