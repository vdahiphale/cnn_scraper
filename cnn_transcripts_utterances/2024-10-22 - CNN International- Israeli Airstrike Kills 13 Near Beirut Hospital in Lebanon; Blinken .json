      "sentences": "Yeah, the mood (ph) for this meeting I don't think is great. And of course, it comes amid what American officials had hoped would be a window of opportunity to try and bring both of these conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon to an end after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week. You heard from officials, from President Biden on down (ph) that they did view this as a moment to try and bring all of this suffering to an end. But I think it remains an open question of how much the Secretary of State will be able to accomplish in his meetings today.And we should note that he is meeting with Netanyahu as we speak. That meeting began about 45 minutes ago, but I don't think that any State Department officials who are traveling with Blinken or officials here at the White House necessarily had huge expectations for how much he was able to accomplish. For one, Hamas remains in a state of flux. They don't -- haven't named a successor to Sinwar just yet. That leaves their negotiating position somewhat unclear for American officials who are trying to ascertain exactly how much they would be willing to come back to the negotiating table. On the other hand, you have Israel who -- which has only expanded its operations in Gaza and in Lebanon, and it also appears poised to strike back at Iran for its missile attack earlier this month. So, this all leads to sort of dampened expectations for how much Blinken is able to accomplish in these talks. I think what State Department officials really do hope that he is able to do is make some progress on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. And you'll remember last week, Blinken along with the American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote to Israel and said that unless urgent action is taken to improve the humanitarian situation, to allow more humanitarian aid into the Strip that U.S. weapon supplies could be at risk. And so, they do expect him to discuss that with Netanyahu today. The other aspect that they expect the two men to discuss is a plan for Gaza once this war ends. That is something that President Biden mentioned specifically last week, but of course, that war doesn't appear any closer to ending today than it did before Sinwar's death. And I think that all leads to sort of pessimistic outlooks for this talks today.",

As I ask him what will become of Gaza's Palestinians, his response is Stark. We will encourage immigration, he says.

He actually turned this state red, in large part because of the way he was able to mobilize support in the Cuban American community, among certain Puerto Rican groups, certain Venezuelan groups, often by attacking his Democratic opponent as socialists, and actually had one of the best performances by a Republican candidate for president in this part of Florida in decades. And he is hoping to build on that nationwide knowing that there is large voting blocks of Latino voters in states like Arizona and Nevada, but also in Pennsylvania, who could ultimately prove consequential in this race. So that is a big motivating factor for why he is in South Florida today.And then later today, he will be in North Carolina for the second time in just two days, really showing how important the state is becoming in these closing weeks. Candidate schedules often reflect where they see opportunity and where they need to protect their flank, and North Carolina is clearly a state where Trump's campaign feels like they need to protect their flank. It was the closest battleground state that he won in 2020, and there are signs that it is going to be incredibly competitive yet again. So that is a big motivating factor for why they are spending so much time there in these closing weeks.",

That is because the Russian leader is holding an expanded BRICS Summit in Kazan, Southwestern Russia. Mr. Putin's invasion of Ukraine, of course, hangs over the gathering, but Kremlin watchers say the Russian leader is using the summit to show that he's far from isolated despite Western sanctions. It's important to note that this year, Moscow has expanded the BRICS group and acronym for core members, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and now includes Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, and Iran.Now, the three-day summit will be the largest international gathering the Russian president has hosted since the start of the Ukraine war in February of 2022. Let's get right to CNN's Clare Sebastian. And Clare, big picture here, I mean, why this meeting and what is the message that Putin is trying to send to the West?",

That same aide is saying this might be the biggest foreign policy event ever to be held on Russian soil and the coverage on state media has really echoed that, calling it the most well attended BRICS Summit ever. Of course, that is to be expected since this is the first one since the group was expanded.But this really is a way to show the West, they know the global spotlight is on them to show that the efforts to isolate Putin have failed and to present the BRICS in this new expanded format, really as a counterweight to the sort of Western U.S.-led alliances like NATO and the European Union, all of which we've seen involved in various meetings in recent weeks. So, it's convenient counter programming for Russia. They also want to show this as the global majority. There's a lot of talk about how much of the world's oil and gas reserves they represent, how much of the world's GDP -- the narrative being that these economies are growing while the West is in decline. So that is all the sort of the rhetoric that we're hearing. In terms of concrete deliverables, traditionally, the BRICS have not been particularly heavy on those over the sort of 15 meetings that we've seen before this. But the focus today will be on the sort of global financial system. Russia is pitching a new payment system that could circumvent SWIFT, which is of course the international payment system that their banks have been largely cut off from, so sort of a way of eroding the dominance of the U.S. dollar. And that is something that despite the fact that there are disagreements between some of these BRICS members, they are all mainly starting to coalesce around this idea of reducing the dominance of the dollar and in fact, the U.S. and the West in general, Amara.",

At campaign stops in the hurricane-ravaged state yesterday, the former president continued to push lies about federal disaster relief. Both Harris and Trump are trying to reach beyond their party's traditional supporters in the final weeks of an election that couldn't be any closer, we're talking razor-thin margins here. For more on this, CNN Senior Political Analyst, Ron Brownstein is joining me now live from Los Angeles. Good morning to you, Ron. So, you wrote this really interesting piece on cnn.com about shifts in the electorate's composition. They may -- some may be small, but potentially significant shifts that could impact the election. Let's go through some of it. So first off, white voters without a college degree, they have shrunk as a share of the electorate by two percentage points. This is according to a demographer that you spoke with at the Census Bureau.",

Generally since the 1970s, certainly the '80s, white voters without a college degree, who have become the absolute cornerstone of the Republican electoral coalition, starting with Ronald Reagan accelerating under Trump. Those white non-college voters have declined about two points over every four-year cycle as a share of the electorate. And they have continued to do so between 2020 and 2024 replaced about equally by increases among white voters with a college education as well as people of color.Now, from election to election, these are glacial changes. They have only a minimal kind of thumb on the scale, but I thought it was especially noteworthy that Bill Frey, who did this analysis, found that these non-college white voters have declined as a share of the electorate more in Michigan and Wisconsin, two of the former blue wall states, than they have nationally, not so much in Pennsylvania. So that could be a critical distinction. And it does help explain, Amara, I think, why you see Trump trying so hard to reach beyond that base, to reach to more black and Latino men in particular, and why you see Harris trying to focus on these college-educated, historically Republican-leaning voters in the big suburbs outside Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee, especially the women. Those Liz Cheney events were precisely targeted at the voters, I think, who offer her, her most realistic prospect of improving on Biden's margins in 2020.",

And as I said, it's kind of a precision missile at the kind of voters that might give her bigger margins than Biden won in 2020. She's struggling to hold Biden's margins, for example, among black and Latino men. But in the suburbs, what we saw in 2020, the four big suburban counties outside of Philadelphia, Oakland County and Kent County in Michigan, the so-called wow counties outside of Milwaukee, as well as Madison and its suburbs. We saw Biden improve over Hillary Clinton's performance in them in 2016. And that was a big reason, probably the biggest reason that he tipped back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin in 2020 after Trump had dislodged it for -- dislodged them from what I termed in 2009 the blue wall.In 2022, we saw the Democratic gubernatorial candidates in the first election after the supreme court rescinded the constitutional right to abortion run even better than Biden had two years earlier, exactly in those same white collar suburban counties. And that suggests, I think, pretty strongly that Biden's numbers in them were not the ceiling for Harris. And I think it -- given what's happening in urban centers, where Trump may run a little better among black and Latino men, given the fact that he is going to get towering margins in Trump country, the smaller and rural places, on the edge of the metros, I think it is absolutely critical for her prospect of holding these three former blue all states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin -- to actually improve on Biden in the same way that the gubernatorial candidates did in 2022 in these suburban areas.",

So when we look at the numbers and take a look at the stock, how it traded throughout the day, down about 6 percent in the first few moments of trading, and then recovering ever so slightly.Now, despite these headwinds, the storyline of how this remains an important theme in India's economy, the amazing resurgence of India's economy certainly remains true. So to take you into the context of how we got here, let's look at India's place in the world in terms of the automotive industry. India finding itself as the third ranking member of the top-three nations when it comes to the largest automotive markets in the world, joining China and the United States, leapfrogging ahead of Japan. So analysts tell us Hyundai India, what they're trying to do and what the parent company of Hyundai here in Seoul, what it wants to do is try to make its bastion in India, a much larger player in the region, to make it a greater exporter of EVs and SUVs throughout the region. And you know the question that many have brought up when we're talking about this IPO is, why not expand to China? There's been a lot of analysis in the pages of the \"Financial Times,\" and analysts here in Seoul are saying that Hyundai is really trying to look for an alternative to China. When we have Beijing and other regional governments within China giving domestic Chinese automakers a lot of subsidies, it's crowding out so many of the international car makers. So from Hyundai's point of view, it makes sense to expand their position in India, to turn out more of those EVs and SUVs. So, a rocky start. We're going to watch this stock over the next couple days and weeks, worthy of keeping in mind, Facebook and Uber also had some pretty rocky moments for their IPO debuts, and they managed to recover in the short term.
