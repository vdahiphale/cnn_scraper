Officials say IDF soldiers are taking part in training exercises ahead of a potential ground incursion into Gaza. All this as conditions in the enclave get worse by the day.A doctor working at the largest hospital in Gaza told CNN, it'll become a mass grave if they lose power. Aid groups are desperately trying to get supplies like food and medicine into Gaza, but they say it's not enough to fix the problem. Meanwhile, two Israeli women have been released from Hamas captivity and have now been reunited with their families. Hamas says they were released for humanitarian and health reason. Now we're going to bring you a story of one American Israeli victim of the mass attack 2 weeks ago. These are photos of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. He is believed to be a hostage in Gaza. CNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed his parents last week on live TV. They told Anderson that Hersh's arm had been partially blown off by Hamas gunman who threw grenades into a bomb shelter where he was hiding. Anderson realized he'd seen video of their son and had it on his phone. He waited until after the live interview to tell the couple about it. They just spoke with Anderson again. They say they want the world to see what Hamas has done to their son. A warning, the video you're about to see is extremely graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
