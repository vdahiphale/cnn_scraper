      "sentences": "Democratic Senator Mark Kelly for his thoughts on the race. Vice President Harris next heads to Nevada for two more campaign rallies, including one with singer and actress Jennifer Lopez. Will J. Lo sing, unlike Beyonce, at the Texas rally? Well, we shall see.Donald Trump held his first event of the day in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this afternoon where he focused significantly on the southern border and immigration. Soon, the former President will take the stage in Las Vegas for a rally followed by an event with Tucker Carlson tonight in Arizona. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is covering the Harris campaign in North LAS Vegas, Nevada. CNN's Alayna Treene is about a 25-minute drive away covering the Trump campaign in Henderson, Nevada. Priscilla, you first. Harris has not been out west in a while, what is the message she's conveying to voters there?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is certainly going to be an appeal to Latino voters who are crucial in a state like Nevada and also a state that President Biden only narrowly won in 2020. And so far, polls indicate that both the Vice President and former President Donald Trump are about evenly split when it comes to Latino voters here in Nevada. So she is trying to gain an edge in her messaging here. But what she has seen over the last several days is a groundswell of support from Latino celebrities. You mentioned Jennifer Lopez, Mexican band Mana is also going to be here. There has been a lot of support, especially Jake, after the remarks made by a comedian at former President Donald Trump's rally in New York City earlier this week assailing Puerto Rico. So that may be part of the theme here tonight.Of course, that has mobilized Puerto Rican voters but it's also mobilized Latinos. But when I speak to senior campaign officials, they tell me, look, now is the period of mobilization. That's important in a place like this. Nevada, of course, has in-person early voting. That ends tomorrow so timing here is no coincidence. Mail voting will continue and then in-person voting will continue again on Tuesday. So there is a focus here, of course, on capitalizing on early voting. But she'll also be talking about the issues. You heard her talk earlier today responding to former President Donald Trump's remarks on women. She's going to hammer in reproductive rights today. But she'll also talk about immigration and the economy. We've seen ads on all of those fronts over recent days.",

      "sentences": "Well, I did hear him talk a lot about immigration. I continue to hear in my conversations with Trump's senior advisers that he really believes that the border is the number one issue. Even as people are telling him economy is the Number One issue in the minds of voters. Donald Trump believes that immigration is what helped him win in 2016 and he thinks it is what will help him win this cycle. That's why you've seen him spend so much time on that.And especially in states like Nevada, where I am, later tonight, he's going to be in Arizona. That's going to be his main message. And similar to what Priscilla said, look, when I talk to Trump's campaign, knowing that we are five days out, they admit that there's no special strategy up their sleeve right now. Their main focus over this next stretch is really to turn out as many voters as he can. That is the big goal and that's why he's going to every single battleground state before Election Day. And I do want to talk about, though, what Priscilla mentioned, which is Kamala Harris responding to his comments to women last night. This is a huge issue we have seen Donald Trump have, and it's something that his advisors are telling him as well, is a major issue for him. They have not been able to solve for that massive gender gap, noting that Harris does better with females, and that's kind of why you've seen it seep into some of Donald Trump's remarks himself. And last night, he got upstage and said he wants to be the protector of women, whether they like it or not. That is not something his team wants him to be talking about. So I think you might hear some of that later today, because that is Donald Trump's version and really strategy, in his own way, of trying to connect with female voters even as he continues to struggle with them.

According to FCC records, that super PAC that Musk has, has spent $140 million since forming this summer.

He's also a physician. Congressman, what exactly does your committee believe Cuomo lied about? REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH), CHAIR, SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: Well, first of all, let me -- let me just say on behalf of the -- the victims of -- of COVID and their families, and especially in New York in this case. You know I wish we weren't required to make referral, but the facts left us no choice, and so we recommended charge -- to charge criminally on -- on false statements. So, let's just start with one. You know, Governor Cuomo said that he was not involved with the review or drafting of the New York Health Department report from July 6th, which was intended to downplay the -- the accusations that his directive to put COVID patients into nursing homes was -- was a problem. And it was to downplay that. He said he had nothing to do with it. He said he didn't review it and didn't edit it. But we were able to get documents. We spoke to people on his team, we requested records, and we were able to clearly get evidence that he did do that. But in his transcribed interview, he said he did not. Another one that stands out is they said there were no discussions with him about getting the report peer reviewed. You know, if you didn't have anything to do with the report, I guess you wouldn't have anything to do with the peer review. But evidence shows to the contrary that he did, that he made recommendations of who he wanted to peer review the article. And, you know, at one point, he said he had no knowledge of anyone outside the Department of Health reviewing the report. But clearly, by the evidence, that shows that he did have influence on that as well. \\ TAPPER: And the evidence is mainly people who worked around him contradicting him. I mean, I saw the -- the transcript of his former assistant who was forwarding a document with edits, and she told your committee that, your subcommittee, that was his handwriting, the notes on the edits for this New York State Health Department report.

Police saying that they were working toward determining a motive. They were able to do that, Jake, after combing through his digital -- his digital records.
