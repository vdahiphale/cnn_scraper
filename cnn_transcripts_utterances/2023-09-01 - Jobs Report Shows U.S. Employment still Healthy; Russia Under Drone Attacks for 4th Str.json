      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", this Friday, great to be with you. It's however the weekend just yet. Andwe do have a Friday flurry of important data to bring you breaking in the past hour. The latest U.S. jobs report 187,000 jobs were added net to the American economy in August. We can call that I think a solid number and it was a touch better actually than expected, then it gets a little bit more complicated. Job gains for the month of June and July were revised lower by a total of 110,000 jobs. And if you take a look at the numbers, the unemployment rate also ticked higher to 3.8 percent too. Now however, the number of people actually participating in the jobs market also rose. So you can argue I think that's a good sign if you want to see a bit more slack in the labor force. As we know the Federal Reserve do wage gains on the month will also slightly softer than expected, also good news for the Fed, less good news of course for workers. The real question for investors is whether this changed is anything for the Federal Reserve at their meeting this month when no change is expected. And I think the answer in a word is no investors are though in the meantime pricing out the prospect of a move higher in November too. Here is look at the market picture. We're going to discuss all this in just a moment. But as you can see U.S. stocks on track to begin the new month with solid gains no September slog in Europe either that you can see the central axis slipping into unchanged territory major averages mostly higher, as you can see there. And a September stimulus chair in China too, the country's Central Bank announcing new efforts to support the Chinese Yuan by cutting the amount of foreign currencies. Banks need to hold as reserves, the Yuan falling some 5 percent against the U.S. dollar this year that despite the dollar weakening against other currencies. It's making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies and Beijing out with further steps to improve housing affordability amid the ongoing property slump. The government is enticing first and second time homebuyers with preferential mortgages, regardless of their previous credit history. The SHANGHAI COMPOSITE advancing almost half a percent, with Chinese stocks chalking up their best week in fact since July, as Beijing amps up that economic support. In the meantime, Hong Kong markets closed for trade today as the Super Typhoon approached the area. Widespread flight cancellations leaving many stranded at Hong Kong Airport to the full effects of two big storms starting to be felt in the region. We've got a full report and analysis coming up of that too. But first, let's give you a reminder again of today's job numbers. The August jobs report just the latest piece of data this week suggesting that perhaps the federal interest rate hikes are now being felt. Nela Richardson joins us she's Chief Economist at Payroll and HR Solutions Firm ADP. Nela wouldn't be a jobs Friday, if we didn't have you on the show. I caught this moderating but healthy. What do you make of these numbers?",

And then when you add really low layoffs, from other data that came out this week in layoffs in the United States to the step backwards, so they actually dropped this week versus last week. You're seeing a picture of sustainable growth. It's lower, but it's likely to be at this level for a while now. And that's good news for the American worker.",

And you're seeing areas of both strength, like in services, education, healthcare, leisure and hospitality and weakness, manufacturing has struggled all year long. And now information not just in terms of Hollywood screenwriters and actors, but also fields that were looked at as future proof like, you know, data science and technology. We saw big headline layoffs at the beginning of this year. So there's not one sector in this economy. There are a lot of them, there are microcosms.

And we're close, but not at that 2 percent goal. We're closer. But by some measures, we're double the levels that the Fed would like to see. So what do they do? Do they hold on and take a pause and see how the economy flows? Or do they act definitively? I think that's a hard choice for the Fed. I think they'll get a lot of commentary either way. But that question is the one immediate. The second I think is a little easier, which is how long to keep these rates at higher levels. And I think that is clear, the rates are going to stay at higher levels regardless of what the terminal rate is for a significant amount of time because you're seeing these pockets of re inflation still emerging in the economy.",

This city takes these storms very, very seriously, Julia, its canceled flight, schools were canceled today. The residents are being urged to stay indoors to take shelter to stay away from the windows as well. And there are warnings that there could be storm surges, there will be storm surges because we're approaching high tide in the next probably two hours. So this is a very serious storm coming through. The CNN's weather team said that this is only the fourth time in 23 years that Hong Kong has issued a T10 warning. That's the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. So as you can see, this is not a joke. Now, this super typhoon is slamming into one of the most densely populated parts of the world into the Pearl River Delta. So the neighboring City of Shenzhen, it too, is seeing these kind of conditions, flights have been canceled there, the airport shut down midway through Friday, schools close there. So the entire coastline is hunkering down for this. The Hong Kong observatory is warning that with the high tides. That in some parts of Hong Kong, you could expect the storm surge of three or more meters more than the usual levels you would see at high tide. So just to give you another sense, this is Causeway Bay that really the beating heart of the city on a normal Friday night.

That forward movement to the west northwest at about 17 kilometers per hour. A lot of those really strong winds and very heavy rain bands are already barreling across portions of Hong Kong. You can see from the Hong Kong observatory, the radars, a lot of that yellows are beginning to end or push into the area indicating very heavy rainfall. And that's going to come in waves, you're going to have wave after wave of these heavy rain bands and some thunderstorms coming in. This system will continue to move to the west and then about 36 to 48 hours from now begin to dip back down to the south and west. As it does so, it is expected to weaken some. But keep in mind just because it weakens does not mean that the threat for the winds or the rain goes away those will both still be there. So still looking at some rain in the forecast as we go through the next 48 hours and that system moves to the west. Now just behind Saola, we have our secondary storm that we're keeping an eye on, this typhoon sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour moving practically due west at 19 kilometers per hour. This is expected to push across Taiwan in the next 36 to 48 hours. Keep in mind however, just about 24 hours from now you will already start to feel those winds begin to pick up those outer bands beginning to increase not only in intensity but frequency. So providing more and more rainfall before finally is continuing west into Mainland China slightly as a weaker storm. Now again, both of these systems rain is going to be a huge concern. With Saola we're looking at widespread amounts of around 50 to 100 millimeters, but there will be some spots especially along the coastal regions 150 even as much as 200 millimeters of rain. Our secondary system as it crosses over Taiwan, you're looking at widespread amounts of 200 millimeters, and some areas could exceed 250 millimeters, just over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours as both of these systems continue to push off to the west.

And people do to some extent want to go back to work, the studios for sure want to get production rolling again. But there is no agreement in sight. I mean, the studios tried earlier this month, or last month, I should say to get negotiations going again. They made another offer to the writers but the writers feel that the studio offers are still very insufficient. And so, right now they're at a standstill, it's a waiting game to see who makes the next move. The problem is that the window, as you said, for the winter season is closing very fast. And so basically, if a deal is not hammered out in the next several weeks, the idea of being able to shoot and produce shows that would premiere in January, that's going to be out the window. A studio executive just told me yesterday, he just simply evaporates. And that would mean that even if a deal then is hammered out let's say in October or November, that people wouldn't be getting back to work because there would be no January season. And so, this is a big problem moving forward because obviously the writers are not getting paid, but the people who rely on the hum of the Hollywood engine. There's a huge economy built out around this in Hollywood in California. They're also not getting paid they're also struggling to make ends meet, just a terrible situation for the writers and everyone that relies on this business as well as the studios that want to get back to producing those movies and films we all love.",

One firm that wants teachers to embrace AI as an ally is CYPHER Learning. The company uses AI to create personalized learning experiences for schools, individuals and staff in the workplace. It places product is called Copilot, which allows educators to design and curate courses, tests and games for students. CYPHER says Copilot can do all of this in under 10 minutes and for less than $10 per course. The public school system in Qatar and Northwestern University already use CYPHER to create course work. Graham Glass is the Founder and CEO of CYPHER Learning. And he joins us now, Graham, fantastic to have you on the show. I also should admit to our viewers, I've seen this happen firsthand.

A bit of weakness though, as you can see there for technology, all this is after the release of another solid U.S. jobs report. A fed friendly let's call it that, I think as well. The U.S. is adding a stronger than expected 187,000 jobs in August. That said it was the third month of job gains below the 200,000 level with sizeable downward revisions for June and July to the unemployment rate ticking higher to 3.8 percent as well. The jobs is right now at its highest level in 18 months, but remember the bar is really low. We also saw wage growth slowing slightly too, all this data could allow the Fed to keep interest rates steady at its interest rate meeting later this month. And I start to September trading, but a rough August overall for the bulls. The blue chips taking the biggest hit down at two and a half percent monthly returns would have looked even worse without this week's gains. And of course, context is everything as we often say on this show tech still up more than 34 percent year-to-date. Now the streets of Paris are a little less cluttered today after a ban on rented electric scooters went into effect earlier this morning.

Paris is one of the early adopters of the scooters, they basically allowed 12 companies to come in and bring in thousands of scooters. And then over the years, because of the various problems that they have presented us, for example, accidents, there have been a number of actions last year, for example, more than 400 accidents. More people were injured in accidents. And there were actually three people killed by the scooters. There's also a problem of where people drop them off. Sometimes they put them in front of apartment buildings and whatnot. Sometimes they throw them into the sand. All of it was kind of not so much a problem of the scooters, but a problem of the users of the scooters who tended to be kind of young people and tourists and people who didn't understand the rule. So now after many years and changing the regulation several times, Paris is finally getting around to banning them entirely and getting rid of the private rental scooters.",

So I think that you'll probably see them coming to some cities in Europe and maybe elsewhere as the companies themselves go try to try to merchandise the service. I should say Julia; one of the problems here has been the fact the way the costing of this has been done. Basically you rent the scooters very cheap. It's a year old rented and then 25 year old cents per minute that you're using it.
