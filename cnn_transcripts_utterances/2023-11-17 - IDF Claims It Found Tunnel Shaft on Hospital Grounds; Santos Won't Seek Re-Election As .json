It is 5You are looking at video shot and handed out by the Israel defense forces. Three sources tell CNN that the U.S. has intercepted conversations that indicate Hamas has been using the hospital as a command center. CNN cannot verify IDF claims of finding an operational tunnel shaft. Hamas calls the claims, quote, baseless lies. Meanwhile, the IDF says that it has found the bodies of two Israeli hostages near the hospital, 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old IDF Corporal Noa Marciano. The IDF did not explain how or when the women were killed or if their bodies were found together. A few days ago, a Hamas video claimed Marciano was killed in an Israeli airstrike. CNN's Scott McLean has been following this story and he joins us live from Istanbul. Scott, good morning. Since we last spoke, let's go to Israel's claims about the Hamas tunnel, the United Nations human rights chief is calling on Israel to grant their team access to Gaza to investigate this. Is that something that's likely to happen and would it settle any of this back and forth in the information war?",

      "sentences": "It might. Whether either side would ultimately accept the findings of that type of an investigation, that is another discussion. The Israeli relationship with the United Nations is perhaps strained at best. Any kind of investigation also would not happen very quickly, Kasie.U.N. human rights chief says it won't go on while bombs still on the ground. And he has asked for access and he has guarantees from both sides as well that he is still wanting for a response. On top of that, Israelis also say that it could take days maybe even weeks for them to carry out their full operation on the site of the Al-Shifa hospital, they are under immense pressure to prove the allegations that they have made that there is this complicated network of tunnels underneath Al-Shifa hospital. And so, that process won't be quick either. He says, look, there is too competing narratives here. International law is very clear that you cannot use a hospital for military purposes. You also cannot go into a hospital unless you have clear evidence. And it seems likes Israeli and Palestinian narratives don't really line up on very much, even humanitarian situation in the hospital is very different. You have the medical directory of the hospital giving an interview on al Jazeera Arabic where he said that there are children who are starving because they don't have enough water to make milk or baby formula. On the other hand, you have the IDF saying that they are providing food. They're all providing water and the necessities for all of the people who are there on site. And they are also providing corridors for people to leave the hospital site and get to safer spots somewhere else -- Kasie.",

My daughter who is on her way back home from for the weekend got stuck in traffic there about two hours because the buses weren't moving.They are upset and they want to see the prime minister make a deal that will bring back their loved ones. That is taking time. There were reports early this week that maybe 100 would be released, 80 would be released, now it's down to 50 in exchange for a pause in the fighting over several days. But so far, there's been no real progress and they point their fingers at Netanyahu. I think what we also have to keep in mind is when we look at the landscape of leaders in this country, whether it's the military and security officials and political leaders, the only one who has yet to officially take responsibility who keeps saying I'll answer those questions when the war is over, that's Netanyahu. Everyone else, chief staff of the military, head of the security services, head of the intelligence, defense minister, have all said we carry personal responsibility, we should be held accountable. He won't do that. And I think that that hurts and erodes public trust because for the public to believe in its leadership in a time of war like now, they have to understand that the leadership is not doing this for self interests, it's doing it for national interests. And sadly, there is a bit of suspicion when it comes to the prime minister still. HUNT:  Indeed. Yaakov, leaflets were dropped yesterday in Gaza warning that the IDF might soon go in there after securing much of northern Gaza. What's the sense on the ground in Israel of why that's happening, the wisdom of that approach, and the kind of long term plan Netanyahu has been out there saying we're going to basically occupy Gaza indefinitely and U.S. and others are saying that's not tenable.",

You know, it's easy to go into a war, it's much more difficult, Kasie, to know how you are getting out of that war. And that will always take time and planning. And they have yet to find that end mechanism. And maybe the Palestinian Authority, although they're very weak and corrupt, they pay salaries to terrorist, that would need to come to an end for Israel to allow them to redeploy in Gaza and for even the Palestinians in Gaza to want them.But when it comes to what's happening in the south of Gaza, we have to keep in mind, Israel has been operating only in northern Gaza. It's pretty much taken control of that area. Shifa Hospital is the last compound, the last kind of stronghold of Hamas in that area. But now in the south, you have a lot of complicated realities down there. Number one, you still have three Hamas brigades that are there, thousands of fighters, likely the top Hamas leadership is somewhere in some tunnel network in the south, probably the hostages are likely in the south. And you also have 2 million people almost in the south. How do you operate in the south while minimizing civilian casualties? This is going to be the next big challenge for the IDF.",
