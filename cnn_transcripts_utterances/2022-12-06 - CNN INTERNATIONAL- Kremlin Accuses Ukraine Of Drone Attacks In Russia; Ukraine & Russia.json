We'll have a full report from the region ahead this hour.Plus, polls are open in the U.S. state of Georgia in a crucial Senate runoff race between these two men. But why does today's vote matters so much? We'll explain. And it is the final day of the round of 16 at the Qatar World Cup with big names set to take to the pitch today. We begin this hour though in Ukraine with new evidence that the country may be raising the stakes in Russia's nine-month war by demonstrating its ability to strike deep into enemy territory on Tuesday. A Russian officials said a drone attack took place at an airfield in the Kursk Region and set an oil storage tank on fire. It comes a day after the Kremlin accused Ukraine of drone strikes on to Russian military bases, one, more than 500 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility. Shortly afterwards, Moscow sent a barrage of missiles across Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy targets in civilian homes. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says many of those missiles were intercepted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): Every Russian missile shut down is concrete proof that terror can be defeated. But we still cannot give complete security to our sky. There were several hits. Unfortunately, there are victims. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we've just received word that a prisoner exchange has taken place. 60 Ukrainians coming back from Russian prisons and 60 Russians headed back home at this hour. This is the result of negotiations between the Ukrainians and the Russians that have been going on for likely quite some time. We expect to learn more details as we head to speak with some of the people who've been involved in this.These prisoner swaps have been one of the few bright spots for the families who have endured so much suffering in this unprovoked cruel war that is going on some nine months now. These family members who have been waiting desperately for worried about their missing loved ones, will be able to actually see them in the coming hours and days, and they'll be able to share their stories of what happened when they were captured and what their life was like as prisoners of war. Meanwhile, there is new concern that the situation may actually be escalating with Ukraine launching apparent drone strikes far into Russian territory even though the Ukrainians are not claiming responsibility here. Russia is blaming Ukraine for these massive explosions caused by Soviet technology, jet drones that have flown in one case just 500 miles outside of Moscow to a strategic military base. That is a situation that we continue to monitor here in northeastern Ukraine. Will Ripley, CNN, Sumy, Ukraine.",

President Xi called Jian's death an incalculable loss for the country. Jiang, he was 96-year-old -- years old, rather, died last week at a precarious moment in China just after extraordinarily rare protests erupted across the country.Some protesters angry over China's zero-COVID policy criticized President Xi's authoritarian rule and call for him to step down. He told mourners that the nation must unite more closely around the party's central leadership to rejuvenate the country. Now in Iran, another tense day after some businesses across the country closed their doors on Monday, as protesters called for a new three-day nationwide strike. Iranian state media clean businesses have resumed normal operations and the head of Iran's judiciary is warning there'll be swift punishment for anyone who threatens or harms businesses to stay open. All this comes as widespread to anti-government protests sweep the country, sparked by the death of a 22-year-old woman who died in police custody after she was apprehended for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Melissa Bell is following the latest developments for us. She joins us now live. Melissa, thanks for joining us. What do you know about the closure of businesses, for example, and actually what's going on in the country today?",

      "sentences": "While CNN has been able to geolocate some of the videos that have been popping up on social media to try and get an idea of how widely observed this three-day call for a strike on the part of protesters has been. Because if you'll watch Iranian state TV, as you say, you could be forgiven for thinking that has been entirely ignored.In fact, what we've seen is through that geolocation that has been fairly widely observed and across the country, which must, of course, be of huge concern to authorities. This comes of course, Max, nearly three months into those protests that really haven't gone away at all. In fact, there's been an escalation over the course of the last few weeks, as there have been more protests or deaths. In fact, only today the announcement by authorities that five people are to be sentenced to death for the killing of Basij, militiaman- backed, in early in September, rather. The protester died after being shot six times, that conflict led to the killing of a militiaman. Six, five people now to be sentenced. A top reason number of those sentenced to death by the Iranian judiciary, Max, since these protests began to 11. So no sign there that the government is in any mood for conceding whether the judiciary is backing off or that the repression is anywhere near its and this. Of course, as Iranians in the world outside wait to hear any more about those possible concessions that were spoken about these last few days, whether or not the hijab rule would be under review, if anything. What we've been hearing today from a spokesman of the judiciary is that there has been no announcement about whether the morality police, of course, at the start of all this would be disbanded. That would take a meeting of the judiciary, the parliament and the president's office. And only then would an announcement follow. So again, I think we have to treat very cautiously, any hint of any concessions on the part of the reigning government at all, Max.",

Morocco and Spain kick off in less than two hours and it's Portugal and Switzerland, as they battle it out a bit later on. Morocco haven't made it this far into the tournament in 36 years. Spain is trying to bounce back after this shocking loss to Japan. Later players on Portugal -- with Portugal and Switzerland are each looking at records. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo needs two goals to set the record for World Cup goals scored four Portugal, by one player which stands at nine. Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri is one goal away from matching the most goals by a Swiss player, which is six. Let's get straight to Doha. Amanda Davies is there.

He doesn't have a contract for club football after the end of this tournament. This is his fifth World Cup, as we mentioned, unlike Lionel Messi, who has suggested, has said he's going to reassess his options at the end of this tournament, particularly on the international standpoint. Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't said that. He has always maintained and a lot of his frustration with Manchester United was that he wants to be playing football at the top level, at the Champions League level week in, week out. He says he believes he's good enough that he can still do that. And he shows it in sports. So there's a lot of speculation about where he's going to next, when he put his hands up in the summer and said he wanted to leave Manchester United. You have to say there weren't a million clubs coming in offering the big bucks that he felt he deserves. But there is speculation potentially he signed a deal to Saudi Arabia but nothing at all we can confirm, Max.",

Polls are now open across the state and huge numbers of people have already had their say in early voting. So why does it matter? Take a closer look. Here's one of the front pages says it pretty well.Nation watching today's runoff. So the whole nation, and indeed the world, are watching to see what happens here. These are the two candidates. One, a reverend, a minister, a Democrat and one a former NFL player for the Republicans and it's very, very tight between Walker and Warnock. Let's have a look at the latest polling numbers. Warnock at 52 percent, Walker at 48 percent. This is why many people saying we're not going to get the results straightaway because they're going to count every single one of those votes. So why is America watching? Why does this one state race matters so much nationwide? Let's ask CNN's Chief U.S. National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny, he's live for us at a polling station in Atlanta, Georgia. And you're going to answer that question for us, Jeff, why is it so important in Washington?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, it's important because it -- the control of the Senate does not necessarily hinge on this now. It's a 50-50 split. But if Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock were to win today, that does give Democrats an outright majority in the U.S. Senate. That means a variety of things. One, they no longer would be so dependent upon each individual senator like West Virginia's Joe Manchin, or Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema. Viewers will certainly remember that they are often front and center and, you know, are more moderate than other senators in some respects. So this would give Democrats some breathing room.But the biggest importance is on committee assignments. This is a bit arcane in the weeds, but it's important, because it gives Democrats an outright majority on all of these committees. So they are no longer split 50-50. It gives them subpoena power if they would need. But the biggest thing of all, it's a security blanket, first and foremost, against the Republican controlled House. So certainly, that is something that Democrats want going into the new year, the new Congress. President Biden, the White House, you know, simply once just a bit of a majority here because it gives them extra oomph on their agenda. And certainly, there are judicial nominees and other nominees going through the U.S. Senate.",

And Max, you may be wondering why this race is still in Georgia where Georgia is only one of two U.S. states that actually has a runoff election. That means neither one of these candidates got more than 50 percent in the November election, that means it went to a runoff. So that is why they are in this.
