Pulling out. France says it will end its military presence in Niger for good by the end of the year. And out of this world, a NASA spacecraft delivers a sample collected from an asteroid.

The Writers Guild of America says it's reached a tentative agreement with major film and television studios following days of marathon negotiating sessions.The WGA called the new deal exceptional with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership. The union could authorize members to return to work as early as Tuesday, even before the agreement is officially ratified. The terms of the agreement, the details of it, not immediately known, but the use of generative artificial intelligence in production was reportedly one of the final sticking points. This could pave the way for Hollywood to restart many productions that have been halted since May the 2nd. CNN Media Critic Brian Lowry joins me now from Los Angeles. Thanks for doing so. And before we get to the details of what we know about this tentative agreement, the big question is that, what everyone wants to know, if it is ratified, when is Hollywood going to be able to get back to work? What productions will return? And what can't return, because the actors, of course, are still on strike?",

The actors will likely follow the template that the writers negotiated, but they have some issues that are unique to them. So the writers will have -- the actors will have to get their deal done. I think before you get wholesale scripted production back to work, it's going to be several weeks. And then you start to run into the holidays. So we really don't know exactly. And as we said, it would have to be approved by members. Do you think that's likely? What will they have to be convinced of to vote yes?",

But, you know, writers are not all the same. Feature writers are a little bit different from television writers and veterans show runners are different from people who are just breaking in and maybe only have one or two credits. So to their credit, the Guild managed to keep all of those various constituencies together and came away.

[00:05:03] And some of the things that were sticking points with the writers, like the number of writers employed in writer's rooms on streaming shows don't mean anything to the actors. So that won't be an issue at all.

You saw studios start to rearrange their, you know, their big movie releases to try to space them out a little better over the course of the year. You know, they put a lot of time into thinking of when's the best time to open a movie when that movie is not going to be ready and you have to move something else into that weekend, it starts sort of playing havoc with your schedule and it can start to hit your revenue streams. So the studios were, you know, obviously, they saved some money while things weren't in production, but they had some pain and we'll have some pain in this too.

I think the Guild -- one reason the Guild held together so well during this was because the feeling came to be that, look, we're going to suffer in this negotiation, but we want to get a deal where we're not going to have to go on strike in three years or six years, where the broad outlines of it will be something that we can live with for a while.",

Now, the company, of course, as long denied that. But after laying low for a few years last month, coincidentally, or maybe now, while the U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo was visiting China, the company suddenly launched this new phone model called Mate 60 Pro that many experts since have found out use a -- domestically produced advanced chip, the Kirin 9007 nanometer chip made by China's leading chipmaker SMIC. And experts also found two other chips made by the South Korean company Hynix. Now that company told CNN they have no idea how their products got into the Huawei phone because they have several business ties with the company because of the U.S. export controls.
