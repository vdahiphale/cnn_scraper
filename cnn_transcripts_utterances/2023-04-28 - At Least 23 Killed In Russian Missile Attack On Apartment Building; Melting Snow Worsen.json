Officials on the scene expect that number to climb.CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Uman. Nic, you arrived at the scene shortly after the missile struck. How were search and rescue efforts going right now? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): They're still going on, Boris. 16 hours now since the missile what the Ukrainian officials described as a stealth cruise missile, a KH-101 slammed into this building here. I'm going to step out of the way. David's going to tilt up the camera there. And look at those firefighters. 16 hours into the mission. They're right up there on the top of the building. We -- they took us up there earlier to take a look. They told us they were going to tie ropes around themselves, upsell off the side there, and clear out those upper floors. We know from -- we know from an eyewitness here that she believes that the two daughters of a friend of hers who lived on the eighth floor up there, a 13-year-old girl, a seven-year-old girl still unaccounted for. The mother survived. The father is in hospital. But friends and the family believed the two girls are up there somewhere. The firefighters searching through the rubble. They said that they would clear the lower floors first. They've done that and now they're moving on to the really hard bit high up there. But as you can see, it's dark here now. It's nighttime. It's floodlit, but this effort is going to continue. The massive flooding here of relief workers, recovery workers, rescue workers, and the police even have a DNA team here to help relatives identify family members who may be recovered from the building. There are police psychologists here as well. We've seen them counseling, some of the grieving families. This happened at 5:00 a.m. in the morning time here. People, most of them asleep in their beds. 109 people registered living in this apartment. More than half of the 46 apartments in there just blown apart, destroyed. This isn't going to stop here this evening. The recovery workers -- rescue workers say they're going to push through the night until the job's done, Boris.",

He also passed a bill protecting or rather going against conversion therapy for gays in Minnesota.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz joins me now. Governor, forgive me for that confusion. We appreciate you sharing part of your afternoon with us. You made abortion a central issue in your campaign. It helped you win reelection. Why was this a top priority? GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): Well, thanks for having me, Boris. First of all, I'm glad to see in South Carolina and Nebraska, they're trying to moderate. But it -- but it's not all that complicated. The reason we made it Central is, is that it's a basic human right that people have the right to make their own healthcare decisions. And let's be clear, abortion services are healthcare. Gender-affirming healthcare is healthcare. And the idea of trying to split the hair on this or trying to decide that government should be involved with that is simply not the way it is. And here in Minnesota, we're watching this hate and bigotry. It's all around us. It's in the Dakotas, it's in Iowa. And we've just decided we're going to be an island of decency, and we're going to trust people to make their own decisions. And it's important now more than ever, to firewall up the laws.

They agree with it on a gender-affirming care, they agree with it on abortion, they agree with it on access to these drugs, and so they absolutely should. We absolutely know.

I just reject it in its entirety, that we know who the extremists are, we know who are telling that, and the American people overwhelmingly know that night. I just think the biggest thing here is what we think here in Minnesota, calling that out going on the offensive. And look, this is not anything special. What's happened in Minnesota now is that individuals will make their own healthcare decisions based on what all of the evidence and all of the practice amongst all the major medical providers agree is the right way to go.

They will not listen to the people involved in this. And I would just say this. Of -- these are the very folk telling us that it puts children at risk. They all voted against providing meals for kids in school here in Minnesota. So, I've kind of lost patience with that, oh, this puts kids at risk.
