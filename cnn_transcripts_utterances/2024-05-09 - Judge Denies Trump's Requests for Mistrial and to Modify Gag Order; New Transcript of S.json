For the next hour, we'll take you inside the courtroom from gavel to gavel, as the historic hush money case unfolds, breaking down all of today's most important developments and looking ahead to what's next. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in The Situation Room, the Trump Trial Today. An eventful day of breaking news in the Trump trial capped by the judge's back-to-back rulings just a short while ago, denying Trump's request for a mistrial and for a modification of his gag order. Let's go right to CNN's Kara Scannell. She's outside the courthouse in New York for us. Kara, walk us through the last-minute legal wrangling following the final testimony by Stormy Daniels.",

But the judge denied that saying he needed to protect the integrity of these proceedings as well as the witnesses past and future.Now, Trump also asked for a mistrial, citing some of the details that Stormy Daniels gave in her testimony. The judge put the blame on Trump's attorney saying that he couldn't understand why they were not objecting more, especially when the prosecution asked her about the use of a condom. He said, I do not understand why Trump's lawyer didn't do that. Now, this comes after a day of combative testimony between Stormy Daniels and Trump's attorney.

Daniels responded, wow, that's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room, referring to her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.Daniels previously testified that the night of their alleged affair, she felt feint while she saw Trump posing on the bed in his T-shirt and boxers. Necheles questioned why that scene would be so upsetting since she appeared in about 150 sex films. Daniels testified it was because she was not expecting a man twice her age to be naked. Necheles argued Daniels gained publicity from her story and media appearances, like her interview on 60 Minutes.",

Because the argument they're making, and I think will make in their briefs, is that it's too broad, it's too vague. And so this request would have given the judge a chance to sort of clean up the order. And that might have given the appellate court enough confidence that they didn't need to do anything.But, clearly, Trump has a track record of not following the gag order. That's not been good for him. But at the same time, now the appellate court will look at it and say, but did the judge go too far in issuing the order in the first place?

Do you think the tough cross-examination of Stormy Daniels today benefited the defense?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: No, I don't think it benefited the defense. I think it probably benefited Trump's ego, right? I mean, I think he came in today, we'd all heard that they were going to keep her on the stand and delve into things, and delve into details, in some ways, to try to damage her credibility, but I also think to try to turn her into sort of a nasty woman, right, who would do and say anything, who didn't have any credibility, who would make things up, who was after money. But she essentially said, yes, I'm sort of all those things, and I think made the case for the prosecution that Donald Trump probably would want to shut this person up, who's very charismatic, very sort of relatable in so many ways in terms of the way she was parrying back and forth with defense attorneys. And even, I think, what she was saying there, at some point she said during the testimony, I think on Tuesday, that she blacked out, right, when she was with Donald Trump. His team wanted to go in and kind of clean that up. And she was like, yes, she was not under any duress. This wasn't a non-consensual sexual situation at all. And even that, I think what she probably really meant was that she kind of tuned it out, you know, and kind of, you know, went out of her body when she was having this dalliance with Donald Trump.",

Number two, they established that she had, or at least suggested that she had a financial interest in coming forward, that she made money and sort of was, in effect, kind of calling her a grifter, right? They did not need to go where they went today. The damage had been done yesterday. And they actually shot themselves in the foot here with a couple things. Number one, like Kara had said in the report at the top of this, they asked a question and she said, well, you're trying to make money here, and Stormy Daniels responds, yes, just like Mr. Trump. Boom, that's a devastating point that you just got mocked the defendant there in front of everybody.Another one was Susan Necheles had asked about the indictment, and Stormy Daniels said, which indictment? There's a lot of indictments. And, again, it's just, they opened the door to that, and it really worked against them.",

I mean, if they wanted to ask any question, it might have been, did you ever see or hear the former president direct anybody to falsify business records? And she's going to have to say no. And that's really all that matters in the case.So, by talking about her career as an adult film star, by talking about whether or not they ate dinner or didn't eat dinner, they spanked with this or rolled up that, whatever it was, those things are -- that has nothing to do with this case. But they've sort of taken the bait, and maybe it's because of trying to protect ego and, you know, this reputational idea, but a great strategy would have just been to say, you know, basically send the message to the jury that the prosecution is putting up stuff that doesn't even matter.

You know, I think every legal analyst who was watching this today, or at least a lot of them, certainly were talking about how some of the questioning -- the defense questioning of Stormy Daniels today seemed like it was more about appeasing Donald Trump, who was clearly very upset and agitated Tuesday by the testimony of Stormy Daniels, repeatedly kind of nudging his attorneys to object more.

But an interesting piece of information this afternoon, this uncommitted group that started in Michigan and then was also working in several states urging in Democratic primaries to vote uncommitted to express their protest of President Biden, they put out a statement this afternoon saying this marks a step forward.So, there is a sense that this is viewed very positively on the progressive side, the pro-Palestinian side, if you will, but it's not nearly far enough. And the difference here is we're talking about offensive weapons and defensive weapons. The president was very clear to Erin Burnett that he's going to still be a partner with Israel. The U.S. is going to maintain his longstanding relationship, but simply not sitting the weapons inside a big city, basically, but would still, of course, provide the funding for the Iron Dome. So, this is still catching the president in the middle here. It's not enough for some. It's too much for others. And talking to advisers, they said it's his -- he needs to be seen as a strong leader here, but that's at conflict with his own instinct for empathy. So, that is what his challenges over the next five months. So, again, it's not enough for some, and the controversy, particularly from Republicans today, showed that it's far too much for others. You know, it's interesting. A lot of Republicans are going after President Biden for his comments yesterday to Erin Burnett on Israel. And an Israeli cabinet member, Ben-Gvir, he posted this on Twitter. He's posted, Hamas hearts Biden. So, how is this playing right now?",

They are largely, as you said, Wolf, attacking Joe Biden over this. Part of that is because I think they see an opening. I know that when I talk to some Republicans, they actually acknowledge privately the predicament that Joe Biden is in.But we heard from many Republicans today. I mean, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that he hoped Biden was having a, quote, senior moment. We heard from the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House as well as the House Armed Services Committee saying that they were appalled by some of Joe Biden's comments to Erin Burnett last night on this. They're very much looking to Donald Trump and saying, you know, we heard Mike Lawler this morning on CNN in an interview. He said. We have to support Israel as much as we can, and part of that support means allowing them to root out the problem, which is Hamas, including if that means going into Rafah. So, that's kind of the position we've seen from Republicans. Of course, this isn't all Republicans, but the majority of Republicans, particularly those in office, in Congress, have been taking that kind of position.",

Mangold: Is it sent to Michael Cohen at a Trump org email address? Madeleine Westerhout: Yes. What is the subject line of this email? Wednesday meeting. Can you please read the content of the email to the jury? Madeleine Westerhout says yes. Michael, we are confirmed for 4:30 on Wednesday. What I need for you is the following: Full name as it appears on your ID, date of birth, Social Security number, U.S. citizen, yes or no? Born in the U.S., yes or no. Current city and state of residence. Thanks, Madeleine. Rebecca Mangold asked: Do you recall why you were sending this email? Mr. Cohen was coming in to meet with the president. The prosecutor asked, do you recall seeing him when he came to visit? Not specifically. But did this visit ultimately occur?

And according to you, when you saw him sitting on the bed, you became faint. The room started to spin and the blood left your hands and feet, yes? Yes. It was a shock. Surprise. The defense attorney asked, just so I can be clear on what you were saying. You've acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies, right? Stormy Daniels replied: 150-ish? Yes. And there are naked men and women having sex, including yourself in those movies, right? Yes. And -- but according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bad in a t- shirt and boxer shorts was so upsetting the you got lightheaded, blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted, right? Stormy Daniels said: Yes. When you are not expecting a man twice your age to be in their underwear? I have seen my husband naked almost every day. If I came out of the bathroom and it was not my husband and it was Mr. Trump on the bed, I would probably have the same reaction. And the defense attorney asks, and that made you feel like you were going to faint. And Stormy Daniels said, absolutely. If I came out of the bathroom and so on, older man in his underwear that I wasn't expecting seeing there. Yeah. So the jury heard that revisiting of that scene today.",
