Now Jordan will back someone else temporarily to get the government up and running after more than two weeks without a House speaker.Plus, a primetime test for Joe Biden. Tonight, the president will make a rare Oval Office address to lay out the stakes for American support for two democracies under siege, Israel and Ukraine. Plus, the kraken cracks. Sidney Powell admits that, yes, she spread lie after conspiracy after lie about the 2020 election. And that yes, she will testify at trial including against Donald Trump. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, the best laid plans scrapped. We entered today expecting a third vote. Right around this time to try once again to give Jim Jordan the gavel, that vote is no longer happening. Now we are told that Jordan will get behind plan D or E or kind of lost track of the letters at this point. But sources are telling us that Jordan will back giving more power to a speaker placeholder, Patrick McHenry. And that will happen while the Ohio Republicans tries to continue backroom dealing to get his way to the gavel over the next few months. Let's go straight to CNN's Manu Raju, who is all over this on Capitol Hill. Manu, what is the latest at this moment? Has Jim Jordan come out of this meeting? And has he formally publicly said, amen to this temporary plan?",

That's GOP leadership crisis that has paralyzed the House for more than two weeks.There are some signs that perhaps this crisis temporarily can end. Jordan has indicated that he will back a plan to keep Patrick McHenry as interim speaker, empower him till January. They will need a resolution on the floor that could be voted on as soon as this afternoon to give him that power. But the catch here is that Jordan says, he is not going to drop out of the race to be speaker. He said that he will still be the speaker designee, meaning he will try to become speaker of the House eventually is January when Patrick McHenry's powers would run out under this resolution of the House could vote on today. Now that House Republicans are badly divided over this resolution. Many of the hardliners oppose empowering Patrick McHenry have come out and said, very strong words against that idea. And some of the Republicans who oppose Jim Jordan's candidacy are strongly opposed for him staying in as a speaker designee. Several of them told me that Jordan needs to drop out altogether as they consider a new speaker candidate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON BACON, (R-NE): I hope he touch on a third vote and that he will concede, if he loses more votes. REP. MARC MOLINARO, (R-NY): I certainly will be we advocating for temporary empowerment of the Speaker pro tem, allow the conference to decompress, reorganize, but most importantly, allow us to get back to work.",

But given the divisions within the Republican ranks, Democratic votes will be absolute essential.And at this moment, House Democrats are meeting behind closed doors to figure out their strategy. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader who I asked about this multiple times over the last day, he had not yet taken a position yet, saying that we needed to discuss this with their members. Some of their members want concessions from Republicans in order to support it. Other ones said, we need to just get behind this in order to get the House moving and beyond the state of paralysis over the last couple of weeks. So, a lot of questions here about how this will play out. What this means for Republicans going forward? And also, what legislation could move under an interim speaker, Patrick McHenry? All huge issues as these fast-moving developments happen right now at this hour to try to unstick this paralyzed House.",

And one Congressman Jim Banks from Indiana who's running for the Senate, told me that this would be the biggest fu to voters.If Republican voters, if they go along with it, showing just how much Republicans are concerned about Banks went under call it, a betrayal to Republican voters and predicted a minority Republicans would vote for this on the floor of the House.

Dana, your last question to Manu, I think is so critical about this McHenry plan, and if a majority of Republicans will come on board and have Jordan's backing it, brings the majority of Republicans.Because think about the tactics that Jordan and his allies have been using, unsuccessfully to get Jim Jordan to be speaker. That whole Republican echo chamber and getting Sean Hannity and firing up the grassroots. Well, you just heard what Manu was saying about Jim Banks. So, I think we have to pay attention to, does that whole Republican echo chamber go along with what Jim Jordan wants to do here to preserve himself some time? Or do they rail against this notion of Republicans getting into bed with Democrats in some fashion to get government rolling again, because you can see if they do, Jim Jordan, just endorsing it may not be sufficient here. If the grassroots get really riled up as thinking that this is somehow giving up what is about winning the majority. Well, winning the majority is all about for them.",

He doesn't fundraise for anyone and no legislation he's ever introduces become law, which means he literally has no experience in getting people to do anything.And I think that assuming that he could somehow use the media in a moment when the media is deeply preoccupied with a war was a huge miscalculation. People are paying attention to Hamas, as terrorists are paying attention to what Biden is saying. There's lots of concerns about Iran. I think it was far harder for them to break through in this news cycle. And no one cares that much about who is speaker.

And the answer was, I know, just a small thing like helping the nation govern.The answer was that similar to what you just said, which is that just on the raw politics of it. At first, this was, ah, look, Republicans can't govern. But as this goes on for a while, it does seep into democratic territory, whether they like it or not, whether it's fair or not.

And she just kept saying, oh, no, we're open. We're just waiting for the Republicans to engage. Well, clearly Republicans are going to gauge that. Well, one thing she said to the concessions point, Jeff, this is Congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington. She said, we want bipartisan legislation to be brought to the floor under this speaker McHenry. That's what we want to see.

We are told that he expressed to his advisers in recent days, his desire to try to speak directly to the American people, not just about the situation in Israel, but the ongoing war in Ukraine as well.And that he basically believes that there is an opportunity here to not just send a message to the world about the importance of the U.S. supporting its allies as they are being attacked, but also that this can be set up as a message about the importance of U.S. national security and national security matters as well. Now, this moment, of course, is incredibly important for the White House in terms of trying to sort of shore up the public support, as we have talked about a lot. When it comes to supporting Ukraine, the public support for that has begun to wane in recent months. And while there is a majority support for the people of Israel and a lot of sympathy, there is a sort of a mixed response when it comes to the prospects of U.S. involvement. Now, we've also reported that the White House is preparing to make a supplemental national security request to the tune of some $100 billion, some $60 billion of that I'm told will go towards Ukraine, the other $40 billion or so will go to Israel and Taiwan and other matters related to the U.S. southern border.
