They are expected to receive significant snowfall, as you mentioned, perhaps the greatest snowfall in the last 30 years, at least, up to two feet.Right now, don't be deceived by what's happening. There's a lull in this storm. We've already gone through around one and then there's more snow on the way. And forecasters say, the roads will worsen as well as the weather conditions. But here, the Department of Transportation is prepared to handle it. There are more than 800 snow plow trucks throughout the state and 1,600 drivers. Since 7:30 this morning, local time, there have been about 100 crashes. So if you have to go out, please, take it slow and play safe. Jim.",

So the judge asked her not to discuss specific deliberations and she has declined to comment on the specific charging recommendations.But doing something, this could potentially impact the case, right? The Trump defense attorneys, one of the arguments that they have made about Fulton County, is that they argue this is politicized. They say the district attorney is elected, she's trying to appease constituents, which is why she is largely expected to mostly indict the former president. Now, they're also going to be able to point to the jury forewoman and be like, hey, she went on national television and said she would be quote, sad, or frustrated if nothing happens here. Now, one piece of news that I did glean from this, was she talked a little bit about former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and this is the first time it's been confirmed that he did go before they even talked. But she said that he invoked executive privilege, invoked his Fifth Amendment right, and it didn't get much out of him. So take note, Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is also trying to get answers from him. But she also said that she believes that this was not a partisan pursuit. It was her impression that the district attorney was really trying to be fair, but when you go out and do something like this in the court of public opinion, it doesn't exactly instill trust in the process.",

And there are many there are moments of levity. And so perhaps it's humorous and those moments of levity really creep in.On the other end of it, certainly you never want to point a gun at anyone. And certainly during a trial in which tensions flare in which people are in opposition, there certainly are moments where you may not like the other side. However, I will not prescribe to that view. Final thing, Kristin, and that's this, the -- not to -- you know, it's important to make note of what that witness was speaking to. And that witness was the expert for the -- for the defense, and they were asserting that the trajectory of the weapon would be suggestive of Alex Murdaugh having not shot that that gun. Why? Because the trajectory would suggest that he would have had to have it down by his kneecaps. And since he's six-four, it would not have been him, says that the defense who fired that weapon. So not to get lost in the mix of all that have occurred in terms of, you know, whether you want to call it bad humor, whether you want to call it levity. That was the essence of that expert witness's testimony, which the defense believes is very helpful to the notion of reasonable doubt.",

      "sentences": "So it's important to note a couple of things. The first thing is, is that whenever your client testifies, it doesn't become about what you did as a defense attorney, in terms of establishing reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case, it becomes about whether your client is lying or not. It becomes the believability and credibility game.And, boy, would he have a lot to answer to, that is Mr. Murdaugh, in the event that he took the stand, with respect to his inconsistencies in talking to the police about where he was, with respect to the cell phone data that contradicts where he was, with regard to the car data. So he would have a lot to say. Second point, Kristin, and that's this. I'd argue that he did testify. There have been a lot of tapes played with respect to interviews done of him. So in that regard, he has gotten before that jury, but it's always a risky proposition. It's not to suggest the defense won't take that step. But, boy, I would think two, three, four, and five times before I left it in Alex Murdaugh's hands, if he's cross examined and crumbles, there goes your case, there goes the verdict, and that would be guilty. So I think they will think twice and pause before they take such a step.",

That war continues with many thousands of dead on that eastern front in recent weeks. The death toll rising for Russian forces, also for Ukrainian forces, as they intensify.
