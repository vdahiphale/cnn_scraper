Paula, we have heard in the last day or so that Benjamin Netanyahu has apparently spoken three times to Donald Trump since the election.Bring us up to date on what was discussed and how Donald Trump's presidency could already be shaping events or influencing events in the Middle East.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christina, three conversations within several days is really quite remarkable and it really speaks to how close the relationship was between these two men during the first Trump presidency and it really shows what we can expect over the next few years.I think Benjamin Netanyahu was, if not the first, one of the first to congratulate President-elect Trump and during these phone calls he has said to the Israeli cabinet that they were very good and very important conversations. He also said that he and President-elect Trump see eye to eye when it comes to Iran, when it comes to the dangers that he believes Iran poses not just to Israel but elsewhere. And so this is really key because at this point we are still waiting for some kind of a response from Tehran after a couple of weeks ago, just last month, Israel fired upon the country in retaliation for a previous attack trying to take out some of its air defense systems. Now what we have seen in the past year or so and certainly in recent months with the U.S. President Joe Biden is an assumption that Joe Biden has had some influence on Netanyahu in trying to restrict the extent of the response against Iran. Now it's not clear going forward whether President-elect Trump would ask for these kind of restrictions or ask for Israel to hold back when it comes to dealing with Iran. For example, we know that the U.S. President was not keen, Joe Biden was not keen on Israel taking out parts of the nuclear program or when it comes to the energy supply, no oil fields. Did President Biden want to see targeted? It's very uncertain whether that will be the same case with President-elect Trump. So certainly there is going to be some concern in Tehran. They've had the official statement that really makes no difference who the President is in the U.S. because the policies don't change. But there certainly will be concern at a time when we're seeing these very direct attacks between Israel and Iran on each other's territory that there is an incoming U.S. President who appears to be very much in the pro-Israel camp. And just the fact that they've spoken three times in such a short period of time shows that there is a personal relationship there as well. So certainly Tehran will be concerned.",

This would be the position that U.K. diplomats would take, that there's a government here with a big majority that's going to be in power during the same period that Trump will be in office. They're going to play on the fact that the U.K. is really the only sort of global partner that can have the same sort of military reach and project its power. No other partner in Europe can do that. So they'll play on that and the special relationship.But I don't think Trump is very likely to look at the U.K. as having the heft of the whole of Europe. I think this is a moment where Trump can see that the policies that he wants, not only, again, is it an opportunity at home to push them through, but internationally, that there will be less opposition.",

Because if that doesn't happen, it would be virtually impossible for the Europeans to step in to the breach, particularly because they just don't have the weaponry that Ukraine needs, ammunition, etc. So it would be virtually impossible to replace the United States in that role.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And I think that's a particularly potent fear in Germany where I am right now, because of the large export sector, because of the large car industry, for example. The United States is Germany's largest trading partner overall. Still, it's its largest export market.So if the United States were to impose 20 percent tariffs on all imports, that would be a massive disaster for the Germans, where the economy is already stagnating. It was in recession last year, barely missed recession so far this year. But there's no sign of any kind of upward potential at the moment in the German economy. So these kinds of tariffs would have a debilitating effect on the German economy. I think connected with that, though, is this security question. We've seen that already come up in the past few days with comments from future Trump administration officials, including J.D. Vance, with the suggestion that if the Europeans don't do what the Trump administration wants, there could be implications for the security guarantee that the United States provides to Europe through NATO. Trump's -- Vance, rather, specifically said that the U.S. would need to rethink its NATO support if the European Union tried to regulate X -- Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, in a way that was negative to him. So this is the kind of threat that I think many people fear is going to be constantly hanging over them in Europe if we don't do Trump's bidding.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that they're going to have to kind of get religion quickly if they really want to, you know, keep the United States on their side, because Trump has made it clear that he's not kidding about this.He is transactional, but he's also made quite clear that he can follow through with his threats, which he tried to do in Germany at the end of his first term, for example, where he decided to withdraw 12,000 troops from Germany, 12,000 of about 50,000 at the time. That didn't happen because Biden reversed the decision. But Trump is very clear in that he's willing to follow through on his threats, and he seems to have, you know, particular interest in Germany, which he has constantly complained has been a freeloader. So I think that you will see these countries kind of, you know, get religion as it were and try to do more on these fronts, but they're going to have to also sell it to their domestic audiences. They're going to have to convince their populations that this is necessary and explain to them why it is necessary, in particular because of the security threat that they would face from Russia and elsewhere if the United States isn't there acting as a pillar of European security. So they really have a lot at stake here. But overall, the shift is that NATO looks like it could be shifting away from a kind of values-based alliance, which it has been since its founding 75 years ago or so, to a more transactional arrangement where if you're not paying up, you might not get the security support that you're going to need.",
