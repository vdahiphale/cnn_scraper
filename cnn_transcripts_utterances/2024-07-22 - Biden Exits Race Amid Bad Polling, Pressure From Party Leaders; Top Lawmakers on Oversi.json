We call on you to resign as director as a first step to allowing new leadership to swiftly address this crisis and rebuild the trust of a truly concerned Congress and the American people. Lawmakers were grilling Cheatle for hours today. They were demanding answers about the security lapses that led to the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. But lawmakers grew frustrated after she failed to provide specific answers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD), RANKING MEMBER, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: I don't want to add to the director's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. But I will be joining the chairman in calling for the resignation of the director just because I think that this relationship is irretrievable at this point. And I think that the director has lost the confidence of Congress at a very urgent and tender moment in the history of the country. And we need to very quickly move beyond this. REP.

And this testimony caused more harm than good.Obviously, we heard that, you know, from members of Congress that the director failed to answer, you know, particular questions resulting not only from the event, but also, you know, any type of precipitating actions that were made by the leadership of the Secret Service that could have caused, you know, some sort of systemic issue within the agency that caused this security lapse to occur. But more importantly, it also, you know, highlighted the fact that she's losing the confidence of the women and men of the United States Secret Service as we speak.

And with that type of, you know, question, there's no reason why they shouldn't have, you know, taken a tactical pause, not allowed the president to come out to the stage, just delayed it even for a minute until that matter was adjudicated and that the entire environment was safe.

On July 6, Sonya called 911 because she thought there was an intruder inside her home. Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy responded to that call. This was after midnight. They entered the home to investigate. Inside, Grayson noticed a pot of boiling water on the stove. And he allows Sonya Massey to go to the kitchen to remove it. And that is when this dispute escalated very quickly. Grayson goes from speaking calmly with her to drawing his gun, firing three times, hitting her in the face.
