Now his family's home is completely gone.Leading this hour, Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants could be arraigned in Georgia the week of September 5.

She also wants to go to trial on Monday, March 4, which happens to be the day before the first 2024 Super Tuesday primaries for the Republican presidential contest. This is also before the proposed trial dates for two other of his criminal trials. Let's get straight to CNN's Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid for us.

Six months to put on a RICO case, these are notoriously complicated, tend to be drawn out, and then you have 19 defendants, at least three of whom are expected to challenge this, try to get it removed to federal court. So, it's unlikely that this is going to be granted.But she's also competing for real estate on a very crowded calendar. I mean, let's start with January of next year. There's a request by the special counsel to do the January 6 trial the first week of January. Then you have the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, a civil trial, January 15.",

If you can get it removed to the federal jurisdiction, you have a wider, more diverse jury pool, but they could still face DA Fani Willis, she could be waved in as a U.S. attorney and prosecute this case.

However, one of the things that has happened is that Giuliani incurred a debt of $320,000 just to keep his electronic records from 2020 archived and available for lawsuits. That was something where the PAC came in, paid that bill, also gave him an extra $20,000, just a boost to get him through a little bit more there.But he was in court today, his lawyers were in court today in this Smartmatic defamation case, and they said that they are not expecting any more financial help.

The week before that vote, everybody thought it was close, that it was tight, and it ended up going down by 18 points.We saw this in 2022. The weekend before the election in 2022, the same polls, the same prognosticators, we're saying that Kevin McCarthy was going to have potentially north of 30 people as a buffer, as a lead, and it ended up only having five. There's no question that right now, Donald Trump is in the poll position of the election. But as these issues keep coming out, people are getting sick and tired with this baggage. They want people talking about articulating a vision of the future. How many conversations have you gotten in to some of these terrible policies of Joe Biden, the $6 billion given to the Iranians, and we're not even getting the Americans back on our soil. The fact that Republicans haven't been able to talk about the problems with the Biden administration is because we're consumed by Donald Trump. We need -- the GOP, if we nominate Donald Trump for president, is going to go to Joe Biden, period, full stop.

If we don't defend that international order, then that hurts us specifically on the dollars spent.It's been about 5 percent of the entire DoD budget that has been spent on the war in Ukraine. And guess what? We've gotten the dismantling of the Russian military without having to send our boys and girls or spouses to the conflict. I think that's a really good deal. The problem with this administration is they're not articulating what a vision of victory is. And to me, victory means we're pushing the Russians out of all of Ukraine to include Crimea and the Donbass. We should be making sure they have all the equipment they need in order to establish a no fly zone and even hit and attack positions inside Russia.
