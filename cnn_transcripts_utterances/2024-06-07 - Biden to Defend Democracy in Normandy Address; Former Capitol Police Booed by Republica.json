You know, launching his first presidential run in 1987 as a total opponent to Ronald Reagan and all things Ronald Reagan stood for. That was the Joe Biden then.And you are right. It is -- it is clearly intentional. You know, I think the White House, when they say the comparisons are inevitable, they want those to be the comparisons on the substance, not necessarily on the oratory or the performance because those comparisons may not perform as well, provided, obviously, Reagan was in a sort of unique tier of a messenger in those -- in that Peggy Noonan speech. She'd only started at the White House a couple of months before then. But -- but I do think Biden wants to associate himself, clearly, with Reagan's vision of America's role in the world, because it is such -- not only is it like a reach across the aisle, but it is such in complete contrast to Donald Trump, who the White House, I believe, has previewed for us, you know, is not expected to be mentioned, of course, in the president's remarks today but who will be hanging over the contrast on display.",

Who will we be in the toughest moments? And I think this election is a choice point for us right now. Will we become 80- or 90-years old, God willing that we're the age of some of these soldiers standing on the shores today? Will we be able to actually say we did stand up against tyranny? We did stand up against fascism. And I think that means not enabling a second Trump term.

And so what happens is, once you sort of enter the realm of the political arena, all of this, it's like -- and I don't blame them. They -- they have a mission that they're on, and they want to defend democracy and promote that mission. But once you enter the arena, you invite this kind of reaction, which is totally out of bounds because of what they're there to talk about: their experience on January 6 and how they did try to defend democracy that day. That seems like you should be able to separate that from just pure partisan politics. But -- but this issue of defending democracy, I mean, look at all the polling around this issue. It, like, evenly splits the country. It's like a high-priority issue for voters. Republicans and Democrats see it from two totally different vantage points.

It is completely upside- down in terms of what -- what -- the Republican Party has decided that it is going to side with the insurrectionists actively. And you're going to see a lot of signs in here, a lot rhetoric about backing the blue. And that is going to exclude people who backed the blue against insurrections. And instead, they're going to sing a national anthem to defend the people who attacked the Capitol that day. It's not just politics, like, and this goes back to the conversation were having about Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden. Right now, these people, this -- these MAGA Republicans, that movement, they don't like America. Donald Trump doesn't like America. One of the characteristics of the Republican Party that I was attracted to is that it thought America was a good place. We did things right here. We would never do something like storm our own Capitol. That's third-world banana republic stuff. And it's not what happens in the United States of America.

That's where you still have a lot of these excessive heat alerts. That includes Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, even around the Albuquerque area, looking at those heat advisories and excessive heat warnings. Now we will get a little bit of a reprieve as we go into the weekend, meaning the temperatures will come back down. But they're still going to be above average. Take, for example, Palm Springs: 107 today, down to 10 to Sunday. So coming back down, but their averages is 101. Phoenix, Las Vegas, look at that: 109 on Friday, down to 104 on Sunday. But normally, they'd still be about 97. So here's the thing. We will see those temperatures coming back down, still going to be above average. But it's also only going to be a temporary reprieve. Look at Phoenix, for example, going from 110 down to 105, but then right back up to the 110, 111 as we get get into the rest of the week. That average, again, keep in mind only about 102. Las Vegas, pretty much the same thing seeing triple digit temperatures for every single one of the next seven days, even though their average is only 97.",
