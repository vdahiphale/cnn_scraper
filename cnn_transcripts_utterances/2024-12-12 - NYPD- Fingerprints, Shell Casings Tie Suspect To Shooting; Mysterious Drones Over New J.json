Joining us now, former FBI special agent and University of South Florida professor of criminology, Dr. Bryanna Fox. Bryanna, thank you very much for being with us this morning. So Mangione is still in custody in Pennsylvania. He's continuing to fight his extradition to New York.

Now, obviously, as his defense counsel that's what he's been hired to do is to try to push back against the state and make sure that the government has all of their i's dotted and their t's crossed. And what I mean by that is that the chain of evidence was followed absolute perfect procedure. That the testing was done absolutely perfectly. It's done for their own client, but it's also done to essentially keep the balance in our criminal justice system. So we always have this presumption of innocence and that it's essentially withheld. The other big thing is that you'd want to make sure that there is sufficient evidence to charge him. There are people that may say he looks different than the person who was, let's say, on the videotape. I've seen that on the internet. Things like that.

This is called jury nullification where essentially a jury takes it a little easier on them even if there is a lot of evidence in the case.So that means there's a high bar for the state to prove. So what that means for the state is they are going to have to put together every single detail -- essentially like a movie -- showing him leaving the hostel, going to this hotel. Having him stake out the victim. Having him shoot the victim. Fleeing, leaving -- every single moment.

I think the most important thing to say is I think there's two things. First of all, there is no Iranian mothership. I think it's important just to reiterate that. But the other thing is I look at whether or not these drones appear to represent any type of threat to the people of New Jersey or New York. I tend to agree with those who have -- who have assessed they don't appear to represent a threat. It is concerning that they are flying in areas over military installations. But I think that what we're going to find here, and I would say this is within a matter of days and not weeks or months -- you know, we are going to get to the bottom of where these drones are coming from and who is flying them. Look, each of these drones -- they have to take off and they have to land. They don't appear to be doing anything that's out of the -- that's sort of supernatural or superhuman with regard to the way that they're operating in the sky. So I think that what we're going to find here is, yes, there will be some individuals who are behind this. My research found that there is a lot of access to drone technology. And the market, when it comes to the ability to get these -- to build these drones is somewhat saturated. So I know it's a nuisance and I know it's something people are concerned about, but we're going to get to the bottom of this and I think we're going to find that there are individuals right here in the U.S. who are behind this and who are going to be dealt with accordingly.",
