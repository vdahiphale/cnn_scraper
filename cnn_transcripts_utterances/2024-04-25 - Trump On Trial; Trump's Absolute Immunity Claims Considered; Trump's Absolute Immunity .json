But first, a question of presidential immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the historic case over whether Former President Donald Trump can claim immunity from his federal election interference charges. Conservative justices, including Justice Samuel Alito, aggressively questioned the attorney representing Special Counsel Jack Smith. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: If an incumbent who loses a very close, hotly contested election, knows that a real possibility after leaving office is not that the president is going to be able to go off into a peaceful retirement, but that the president may be criminally prosecuted by a bitter political opponent, will that not lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy? And we can look around the world and find countries where we have seen this process, where the loser gets thrown in jail. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The opposite, of course, is that rather than a president perhaps not wanting to be president because they're afraid of what comes afterwards and the decisions that they've had to make, a blanket immunity, perhaps in the other extreme, creates a whole host of other problems.

And in A, B, C cases, we're going to push it back to the lower court and you have to fight amongst yourselves there?

You know, the lawyerrepresenting Jack Smith, a man by the name of Michael Dreeben, kept trying to put before the justices, you know, so many of the fraud -- allegedly fraudulent Obstructive acts that Former President Trump had engaged in, the denial of the vote, all the activities that led up to the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, and these justices weren't having any of it. At least the majority was not having any of it. So, you know, the kinds of things that I think a lot of our audience, you know, rightfully, you know, preoccupied by what the accusations against the former president and the fact that he's running for re-election now, that was not foremost in the justices' mind, and they really did not -- as I said, they brushed back those kinds of facts. So, I think that, you know, looking for signals for what might happen this summer, I can tell you this, given the arguments that we heard today, I do not anticipate any ruling by the Supreme Court before the end of June. Best case scenario for the Department of Justice's case would have been a ruling that totally affirms the lower court or at least says a trial can go forward. But every signal, Julia, was a trial cannot go forward. That there are issues to iron out, you know, as you said, private versus official acts. Maybe another point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh brought up, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh tends to be a key justice at the center of this bench, you know, are there -- would a criminal statute that the president is charged under have to explicitly say that the president can be charged under this? So, a lot of questions that, frankly, as I said, at least from the chief's point of view, should have been ironed out in the lower courts. The lower court judges, though, were emphatic in sort of highlighting the accusations and the fact that Donald Trump's claim was just too broad for absolute immunity, Julia.",

And now,Trump's defense team, they're finally getting their chance to begin that cross-examination phase of David Pecker. He did go through that six hours or so questioning from prosecutors. But with the defense team and their one hour of cross-examination today, they really did two things. It's a -- who knows how successful it was. But what they tried to do was poke holes in Pecker's credibility, first of all. They mentioned one time where he didn't get the exact timing right, when he talked to prosecutors about a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015. Of course, a very minor memory lapse, but it's still what the defense will try to do to raise question in the jury's minds about Pecker's testimony overall. And secondly, the defense team really tried to elicit from Pecker that his involvement was Trump -- with Trump was something that went back decades, that he wasn't just doing this for the 2016 campaign. And again, that was trying to poke holes in the prosecution's case that this whole catch and kill scheme and the payments were only for the benefit of Trump trying to win the election. That is a crucial part of this case. So, by trying to say, look, he'd done this for Donald Trump for decades. The defense was saying, this actually wasn't for the benefit of the 2016 campaign. We'll see what sticks with the jury. Julia, Pecker is going to be back on the stand for more cross-examination tomorrow morning. It could last several more hours because, of course, we saw all of that questioning that lasted three days from the prosecutors. So, defense team will get their crack at it. And then we're also still waiting for the judge's decision on the prosecutor's request that Trump be fined up to $10,000 plus for violating that gag order. There are two different incidents here. Prosecutors in general, they've raised 14 different times. They say Trump violated the gag order with his social media posts or on TV. The judge is now considering 10 of those times. And he's actually scheduled a hearing for next week, Wednesday afternoon, to consider an additional four times that prosecutors brought up that they claim Trump violated the gag order this week. So, we're dealing with a lot of claims from prosecutors. The judge is kind of considering them in parts as to when prosecutors say they happened and when. So, there's still a lot out there. And of course, like you said, Julia, this trial only in its infancy. We're in just the first few days of what could be a four-to-six-week trial.",

We'll see what happens after El Nino goes away. But we also know that heavy rain, drought and also heat waves and coastal flooding are very likely when we talk about climate change. Now, the UAE, Dubai picked up almost 200 millimeters of rainfall. For a normal April, you're talking about nine millimeters of rainfall. So, just put it in perspective. 200 millimeters is about eight inches of rain and they saw that in about 72 hours. Down here in China, it's still raining and it's still flooding.

The U.S. has started building atemporary pier in Gaza aimed at bringing food to the enclave. The Pentagon said the goal is to deliver the equivalent of 150 trucks of aid per day. The pier is on track to start handling traffic in early May. It will bring desperately needed help for Gaza's residents who are on the brink of famine. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters he hasn't seen a recent video from Hamas, which appears to show an Israeli-American hostage. He spent some time Wednesday with Abigail Edan, a four-year-old hostage, released as part of a deal late last year. Biden said she seemed to enjoy her trip to the White House.

As you say, though, 34 percent believe that Trump is being treated just like anybody else. And 34 percent think he's being treated more harshly than anybody else. So, I think you can see that that basically breaks down on partisan lines, and it tells us what we really know already, going into these trials, that America is so polarized. Trump has been so successful in billing the narrative that he's a victim of persecution that the political impact, at least of this first criminal trial that's taking place in New York, may not be that great as we head into November's election. A lot will depend, however, on what the verdict is. We have no idea really. This poll is a snapshot in time how things would change, for example, if Trump was acquitted or if he was convicted.",

I think most of that 56 percent is probably made up of Republicans who are jaundiced against this trial from the start. There was one other interesting finding that about 24 most Republicans said that whatever the outcome of Trump's trials, they wouldn't change their support for the former president in November. But about 24 percent said they might think about it if he was convicted. Now, that's a potential warning sign for Trump, and I think it helps explain why he's taken such pains to try and delay these trials, to stop them coming to a head before the November election. And that's what this appeal in the Supreme Court is partly about. Trump is claiming massive and total immunity for presidential acts. That is a constitutional question, but the strategy is to get this so gummed up in the courts that the Supreme Court sends it back to a lower court for more litigation, and there's no chance that the trial about his interference in the 2020 election can come to fruition before the 2024 election.",

It's just difficult to know how many of them are here or are coming out and joining this protest. This is the pro-Palestinian encampment right behind me, about half a dozen or so tents that just came up a couple of hours ago just today. And I want to bring you back to a tense moment that happened just four hours ago. If we have that video that we can play. And you're going to see Boston police marching on to this lawn area where the encampment is in and they are wearing crowd control gear. They're wearing helmets with a face mask. They have zip tie handcuffs on them. I also saw and heard school administrators going around the crowds, those observing what was happening here and saying to them, you need to show your IDs. We're urging you to leave. The protesters, in response to this police presence, we saw them sitting down, linking arms, saying, who do you protect? Who do you serve and who school, our school? And after 20 tense minutes, for some reason, that it's not clear to us, those officers retreated. They withdrew from campus. We did not see any arrests happening here on campus, and those crowds cheering when the officers left. Campus police though, you can see them right over there, they still remain. They look pretty relaxed. Everything is pretty calm and quiet. Meanwhile, Northeastern tells us that this protest that you're seeing, this encampment, is unauthorized. That it is a violation of the student conduct policy, and they're saying that anyone here on campus who does not have an ID, who's not affiliated with the school, is trespassing. What became also clear throughout the day is the differences of opinions. We know that demonstrators are here urging the school, demanding, rather, that they divest from any ties to the Israeli government and also very much against the war happening in Gaza. We also spoke with Jewish students who were counter protesting just across the way here from this lawn displaying Israeli flags, just quiet. To them - - I spoke with one of them saying that he felt unsafe, saying that specifically he paid attention to the chants and had an issue with the phrasing of those chants mentioning intifada and from the river to the sea, something he says that so many Israelis view as antisemitic.
