An Idaho teenager is in custody, arrested and charged with providing material support to ISIS. 18-year-old Alexander Mercurio accused of plotting to kill churchgoers in his town in the name of ISIS. He remains in custody. He's not entered a plea. Investigators allege Mercurio was about to attack at least one church with guns, knives and flammable chemicals before he was busted.Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois. He is co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, and he also recently returned from that war-torn country. And Congressman, I definitely want to talk about your trip in just a second. But first, you served for a number of years on the House Intelligence Committee. What do you make of the news that we've had an arrest for ISIS affiliation here in the U.S., especially in the wake of that attack we saw in Russia that was attributed to ISIS-K? I realize you haven't been briefed on this specific attack, but can you help us understand what this means in context? REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): Sure. I mean, look, I served eight years on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and I guess what you learn every week is that eternal vigilance must be there. Those -- those threats, internationally inspired but domestically drawn out, are a very real threat. In July and then August, we're going to have two conventions that show that our country can't operate as a democracy. And we had to fight very hard to get the security money for that, $75 million each. Americans need to be reminded that domestic and international threats exist, and we must be vigilant.",

What did you hear from him, and how confident are you that you and your colleagues can deliver for him? QUIGLEYYou know, he has a limited amount of sources -- resources he can draw upon. They're doing all the dying here, but Putin will send infinite -- seemingly infinite number of his own people, treating them like cannon fodder. So their democracy, a democracy in Eastern Europe, is at risk here. And there's a very real risk that if we don't get this done, that we'll be in danger. I'd like to think this is certain to get done, but it's really up to Speaker Johnson. The fact is, about half the Republicans support this measure in the House and the vast majority of Democrats.

I mean, tactically, what do you think he's doing? And is it more about politics than military tactics? ESPER: Well, two things. I was surprised that they're withdrawing troops, you know, from Khan Yunis where it was, because when you conduct military operations on urban terrain, which is how we call it in the Defense Department, you always want to leave troops behind because otherwise the enemy comes in behind you and then starts conducting a counterinsurgency or attacks you from behind. We saw this a few weeks ago in Al-Shifa, where hundreds of Hamas militants made their way back up to the hospital and started attacking Israelis. So that surprised me, number one. But secondly, for Netanyahu to announce again an attack. Now, he's been saying this for four or five, six weeks now. So I think this is more of a domestic play, because on one hand, he knows he's negotiating in Cairo with Hamas. They think a deal is getting closer and closer. I'm very skeptical. And so maybe this is something to throw out to the folks on his right to say, no, no, no, we're still going in. We're going to still take out Hamas, which I think he needs to do, by the way.

So it gives you a sense of how big the momentum is, even without Caitlin Clark.Now, the question becomes, what happens when she and Aisha Tyler and others move to the WNBA? Does the momentum stick with the NCAA? I would argue, yes.
