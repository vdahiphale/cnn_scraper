Here in the U.S., two key numbers out today and just the last hour as expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to leave interest rates unchanged. So, that means borrowing costs and everything from car loans to mortgages remain at 23-year high. This comes on the heels of some welcome news earlier today, news for consumers. Inflation rather slowed unexpectedly according to the latest numbers from the federal government. CNN's Matt Egan covering the economy for us here, going to break it all down. So, Matt, lets start with these interest rates. As expected here, no change from the Fed.",

They're all going to stay high for now.The good news is the Fed is keeping the door open to lowering interest rates, later this year. Now you may recall a few months ago, the Fed was projecting three rate cuts this year, but that looks pretty unlikely even after today's inflation report. So, now, the Fed is signaling just one interest rate cut. There's only four meetings left. The last meeting before the election is September. Markets are pricing in basically a two in three chance of an interest rate cut by that September meeting. And, of course, this is going to have a huge impact on the economy, how people are feeling, also could have an impact on the election in terms of how voters are feeling about the cost of living, about the cost of borrowing. Now, Fed chair Jerome Powell, he's holding a press conference right now and he was asked about the inflation situation. He said inflation is, quote, still too high, but he did weigh in on today's better-than-expected inflation report. He said it was better than almost anybody anticipated. He said he sees it as progress and building confidence, but, Erica, this is key. He says that they don't have confidence yet to lower interest rates.",

And that was because we actually saw price drops for airfare, for gasoline, for clothes and new cars. And on the food front, we have seen some progress both for food that you buy at the grocery store and at restaurants. So that has certainly been encouraging.But you touched on it, Erica, shelter, right? The cost to rent and to maintain a home, that has been a major pain point for Americans and it's still too expensive, right? Prices are still going up on the shelter front. It's been really slow in terms of progress there. And so, listen, I think the Fed wants to see more progress before they're going to start lowering interest rates. And, you know, the good news, of course, is that the jobs market, I mean, Jerome Powell was asked about that and he said the jobs market, of course, has cooled off. He said it was too hot, right? It was overheating a year and two years ago, so he's happy that there's been some progress in terms of moving things into better balance between supply and demand because you don't want to see it overheat. That's encouraging, right? We've seen the unemployment rate remained near historic lows, hiring continues. It's just the cost of living that remains a problem. So I think big picture today represents progress. We just need to see more progress before we get relief on the borrowing front -- Erica.",

And that means if you still continue to see high pressure in prices there and in the level that that's at, it doesn't allow them to ease rates. Some other measures, see certain elements of cooling in this. And I think the danger is over-emphasis on this means that they don't bring rates down and that doesn't bring mortgage rates down.

On October 7, Andrey Kozlov was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival when he was kidnapped by Hamas forces. On Saturday, he was one of the four hostages rescued by Israeli forces. CNN's Paula Hancocks sat down with his family following their emotional reunion. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  When the Israeli military launched Saturday's rescue mission in Gaza, one of the hostages thought they had come to kill him. Andrey Kozlov shouts his name in terror to the troops. His family says the Hamas guards told them for months the signs of rule they were hearing, what Israel trying to target them has ever causing trouble for the state. His brother Dmitry tells me he didn't understand why the IDF came. He was afraid they came to kill him. It took some time to realize they had come to rescue him. Psychological abuse coupled with frequent punishments marked Kozlov's captivity, according to his family. They were trying not to leave marks, his brother says, because eventually it is their reputation, but they would still punish it this way or the other. He has told us there is some moments he will never share with us, his father says, but what he did share is that at the hottest time of the day, they would cover him in blankets, it's a difficult or deal to be dehydrated through heat. Kozlov, 27-years-old, is a Russian citizen who move to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova Music Festival on October 7th when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. His parents flew from Russia Sunday for an emotional reunion, one they hadn't dare to hope for after eight long months. This is the best scenario we could have hoped for, his father says, to see him alive, to feel his presence and to hug him. It is outstanding. His mother says, we are infinitely happy to see him. He laughs, he jokes, he enjoys communicating with all of us, with his family, with doctors, with the people who surround him. His family says, Kozlov was shocked when Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to visit him. And the three other hostages rescued while in hospital. As for those hostages still in Gaza, his father says a deal or a rescue, whatever it takes to get them out. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They will tell you they absolutely believe the justice system is certainly not in our favor. And so, if Republicans really want to make this a more mainstream targeted conversation, then let's talk about the fact that men of color in particular are sentence far harsher than our white male counterparts. I don't think the former president should make this issue about himself, it should be about the voters that he wants to vote for him this November. Now to answer the question quickly, as it pertains to the Hur tapes, we saw the transcript. I'm not necessarily certain the audio is going to make a difference. I think more than anything, this is an attempt to utilize this as a political tool for people to listen to the president and for Republicans to say, oh, you see, there's something here.

You've seen in the past couple of weeks and months, Walmart and Target lowering the cost of everyday goods. He's doing other things like lowering prescription drugs and working on, you know, cutting student loan debt to give people a little break in their pocket book. But I agree with you that unless they feel it, they're not going to necessarily understand that President Biden is working for them, and that is a hard thing to message. And so I think these are also incremental changes that need to happen and are happening, right? So maybe by an another month the employment rate still going down, inflation will still go down and people will start to feel a little bit more ease, which I do think is helpful to the Democrats.

An SDF raid earlier this year netted this video of a training session for children inside the camp. The SDF claims young teenage boys are married off to repopulate the next generation of ISIS fighters, which, they say, may explain the roughly 60 births recorded here every month. This is where some of those boys end up after they are taken, the Orkesh rehabilitation center. Conditions here are much better than the camps but there are only 150 beds and they are all full.
