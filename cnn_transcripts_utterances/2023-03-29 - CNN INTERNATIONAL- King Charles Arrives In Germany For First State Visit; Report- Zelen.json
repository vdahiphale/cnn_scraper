      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London in for Max Foster today.Just ahead, powerful blast reported in a Russian held city in Ukraine this morning. Details from the ground in a moment. Also ahead, police released body cam footage from officers responding to that horrific school shooting in Nashville. Plus, American and South Korean troops practice storming a beach with state of the art equipment. More on the military drills happenings on the Korean peninsula. Britain's new monarch is making his debut on the world stage. You are about to be looking at live pictures we have of King Charles. We understand he will be deflating any moment now, arriving in Berlin, Germany for his first official state visit as King Charles III. So we should see him any moment now. This was an expected visit. It was meant to be following a visit to France where he was going to be meeting with the French President Emmanuel Macron, but that was postponed because of the protests which are widespread over France at the moment. A slight political embarrassment for Emmanuel Macron there. This will be the start of a visit spanning several days for King Charles in Germany. Two countries where the U.K. is trying to restore relations that were somewhat damaged throughout the trials and tribulations of Brexit. We will keep following that for you and give you the latest when we get eyes on King Charles. But for now, we begin the show in Ukraine, where some residents in the Russian occupied city of the Melitopol area are in the dark today after several explosions were reported. Russian backed officials say that the power was knocked out by Ukrainian shelling and local officials say a locomotive depot in Melitopol was hit by shelling earlier today as well. Now Melitopol is a hub for Russian forces. Meanwhile, in the embattled city of Bakhmut, Ukraine says that it downed a Russian Su-24M bomber Tuesday. CNN can't independently verify those claims. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has invited Xi Jinping to visit Ukraine. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr. Zelenskyy says that he wants to engage directly with the Chinese leader who's fresh off a state visit to Moscow. Mr. Zelenskyy told the AP he had contact with Xi before the full scale war, but hasn't in more than a year. Lots of lines to get into today with CNN's Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman, who's following all of these developments live from Eastern Ukraine. Ben, perhaps if we start with these reports of shelling in Melitopol, if you could explain to our viewers the significance of that and then also what potential there might be for President Xi and Zelenskyy to make any progress here. Could Xi's aims ever complement Zelenskyy's in terms of ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine?",

      "sentences": "It's certainly having a perception in the United States. We know that because members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's right wing Cabinet, the Finance Minister, for example, Smotrich, have been to the United States and have found themselves shunned by organizations that would have normally opened their doors.So it's been made clear, if you will, to the Prime Minister Netanyahu that his Cabinet at least is not as welcome in the United States. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken was here just a couple of months ago telling Prime Minister Netanyahu to his face that the policies, that the Cabinet's policies on the Palestinians were not helpful and not taking the country in a good direction. That was the view of the United States. So this -- the relationship has been strained, is strained. The messages have been getting through to Prime Minister Netanyahu and this is, as you say, unprecedented. And that's the perception here. The strongest message yet from the White House that on the internal Israeli matters over the judicial reforms, that the White House is simply not happy. And in the past, we've heard Prime Minister Netanyahu say, look, you know, I've known President Biden for 40 years, we have a good relationship. And this is what is saying at the moment, that Israel has a strong relationship with the United States and it's endured before and this is what will endure now. But it is very clearly being interpreted here as a very clear message to the Prime Minister to not go down the full road that his right wing Cabinet want to take him down on the judicial reforms. We've heard that from protesters just yesterday. I was speaking to protesters on the street saying that the world needs to help Israel right now by not allowing Prime Minister Netanyahu to come and visit. And I was speaking to an opposition member in the Knesset just a couple of hours ago who said, look, this is a great message from the president. It's unprecedented, but not strong enough. This member of the Knesset told me, look, Biden likes Washington more than he likes Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv perceived as more liberal than Jerusalem. The Prime Minister likes Washington more than Tel Aviv, but he can live without going to Washington for another year. So is this going to be enough for a course correction for Prime Minister Netanyahu? Not clear.",

But it's very important to point out that, for the moment, Taiwan is yet to acknowledge any kind of meeting between President Tsai and Speaker McCarthy would even occur.Speaker McCarthy has made remarks suggesting that this will happen, but he hasn't said exactly when this could take place. And if you hear the discussion, a lot of care is being used to not categorize this as any kind of diplomatic visit, but rather just a meeting, because the United States and Taiwan have no formal diplomatic ties. And again, that could cause some big problems in this relationship with China. Already we have heard comments from Beijing, from several government agencies condemning a possible meeting between President Tsai as well as Speaker McCarthy. Now, it is also very important to stress the importance of this trip beyond North America. President Tsai is going to be visiting both Guatemala and Belize. This comes at a time when Taiwan is really trying to shore up diplomatic relations. It was just on Saturday that --",

That's why these hearings are so important.But they're looking at things like supervision. The warning signs that might have been missed. Is the supervision framework enough to have addressed those? The warning signs were pretty stark. I mean, there was even a downgrade of the management of Silicon Valley Bank to deficient by the Fed in the middle of 2022. So there were very clear red flags. And why weren't they acted on? So they're looking at that. They're looking at the issue of the midsized banks, banks with more than $100 billion in deposits up to $250 billion. Those are the banks that were sort of exempted when the Dodd- Frank rule was reformed in 2018 under Donald Trump. They have since then faced less stringent things like capital requirements, stress tests, things like that. So they're looking at all of that.
