Vermont's Peter Welch now the first Senate Democrat to call on Biden to step aside. He wrote this, in an op-ed, quote, I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once, and wants to do it again, but he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not for the good of the country. I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race. Welch's demand was one of three that came yesterday from Democrats, bringing the total number of defectors in Congress to ten. Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer joining the calls for Biden to drop out of the race while New York Democrat Pat Ryan who represents a swing district, writes this, quote, for the good of our country and the future of our kids and grandkids. I am asking Joe Biden to step aside in the upcoming election and deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But it was really the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who raised eyebrows and many questions when she made these comments yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. I want him to do whatever he decides to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm proud to stand with Joe Biden and I'm showing up tomorrow with brass knuckles. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  At this point, I think he has a strong campaign and a strong message to deliver. I believe he's going to move forward. I'm going to support him. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  He's going to be our nominee at the convention. He is going to be our candidate for president the fall.

And if they think they're going to lose a race, that it's going to cost them a majority, that cost them their seat and it makes it much more likely to come out and make these kinds of statements.",

That is what everyone is burning up the phone and trying to figure out where is that person like? So who is the person who's going to convince Jill Biden had changed her mind. I think what is very interesting to me, I think what people are paying attention to is that slight change of phrase of Nancy Pelosi. Remember Nancy Pelosi could still be speaker if you wanted to right now. She's in Congress. She has passed the baton to a younger generation. She pulled off this transition quite deftly and I think there are a lot of people in the caucus looking to how she says this. Now, of course, I don't think she's a person that's going to come out like George Clooney and say he should just drop out. But I think she is very much a bellwether and is actually probably a very smart political minus seeing like, okay, when does this flood swift from gradual to sudden?

So, will they be able to live up to the commitments they make.Now, that's one big question. Also, you know, a big reaction from Beijing to the statement that came out from NATO. That part of the communique, effectively calling China an enabler of Russia. In that war, which came, got a big reaction in Beijing, and a very punchy thing to say. But I think that speaks to you know, what NATO represents right now, which is the traditional Western alliance facing individual countries around the world, now grouping together as an alternative, not necessarily to NATO, but certainly to that axis of power.",

And we were talking yesterday about how Trump in the past has basically tried to hold other NATO countries accountable for what he calls their fair share, which in fairness, the agreements that have been made for people to spend a certain amount of money on defense contribute to the alliance. But political reported this yesterday the headline is Trump considering cutting back intelligence sharing with Europe officials warn, and they say that Trump advisers have told allied countries that reducing intel sharing would be part of a broader plan to scale back U.S. support and cooperation with the 32-nation alliance.

There really firmly established major sharing excises, particularly what we call the Five Eyes, which is the U.S., U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and that was formed during World War II, but, you know, full sharing effectively certainly on behalf of the U.S. partners with the U.S. which is hugely beneficial to the U.S. They have all of these extra agencies can effectively work through, but also between all of the allies in Europe, that gives America eyes across the world with Japan as well, so across large parts of Asia, if you combined Australia with that.So, it would be an extraordinary move and you wonder why Trump would do that, because it would weaken Americans security but he's got his own theories about why he would do that. Of course it does. Also affect the security of Europe because we would have less informed, less well-resourced intelligence, but it's so ingrained in our institutions and security systems.
