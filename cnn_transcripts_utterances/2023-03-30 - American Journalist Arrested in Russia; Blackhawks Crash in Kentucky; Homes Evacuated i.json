      "sentences": "Yes, well, I mean, some quite worrying developments actually, Jim, because it seems that Evan Gershkovich, this reporter for \"\"The Wall Street Journal\",\" has now appeared already at a court in a sort of closed hearing in Moscow, Lefortovo Detention Center. And that court has basically remanded him into custody until -- I'm looking at it here, until May the 29th. So, one month and 29 days he's been remanded in custody by that court pending the trial for espionage. The court has formally arrested him, as they call it here. They've basically levied charges of espionage against him.And it's also been revealed by the press service of the Lefortovo court that the case has been marked top secret, and that's because they say that Gershkovich denies guilt. He's saying he's not guilty of these espionage charges. And so that's sort of interesting developments come to us in the past few minutes. Just to remind us -- remind your viewers, our viewers, you know, what -- what this is all about. Well, this happened yesterday. The FSB, the old KGB, of course, arresting Evan Gershkovich in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, where they say he had been trying to get sort of secret information on aspects of Russia's military industrial complex. Yekaterinburg is a big city. It's got a lot of factories there. There's a lot of people there that can talk about how the military operation in Ukraine is going and, you know, sort of things like that. It's not clear exactly what he was reporting on. But the FSB say he was in the process of receiving important information, highly secretive information about that Russian military industrial complex. The Russian foreign ministry have reiterated that saying that they believe that -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- basically whatever he was doing there was nothing to do with journalism. And the Kremlin have said, when challenged on this, that they understanding is -- their understanding is that Evan Gershkovich was caught red handed engaging in espionage. And so the Russians are clearly standing by these charges against this 32-year-old \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter. And as you indicated, we're expecting to get a formal statement soon from the White House, from the State Department as well.",

Jeremy, \"\"The Wall Street Journal\"\" released a statement pushing back on this very hard. It says, \"\"The Wall Street Journal\"\" is deeply concerned for the safety of Mr. Gershkovich. Let's state a fact here. Russia's track record on these kinds of allegations is lousy, does not inspire confidence. They often Trump up charges or manufacturer charges like this. How are U.S. officials responding to this now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Jim. We don't yet have an official reaction from the White House or the State Department. We'll bring you that statement as soon as we get it.But what I can tell you is that White House officials and State Department officials are currently working to get all kinds of information about this situation. In fact, two U.S. officials told our colleague, Kylie Atwood, that State Department officials began tracking this case yesterday before news of Evan's arrest actually became public. And we do know that this is, obviously, something that's going to become a top priority for the White House to secure Evan Gershkovich's release. We have seen in the past how the White House has worked to secure the release of other Americans, most recently, of course, Brittney Griner in Russia back in December of 2022. And the administration also has some new powers to impose sanctions as a consequence of wrongful detentions of Americans as a result of the Levinson Act, which was passed back in 2020. President Biden signs an executive order this past summer directing how his administration would handle these types of situations. What would come next, of course, would be a formal designation of whether or not the U.S. considers Evan Gershkovich to be wrongfully detained. That would take some weeks before that actually happens. But in the meantime, you can be sure that U.S. officials, diplomatic officials in Moscow are going to be working to get information on this case and then to see what they can do to try and secure his release. But, of course, the fact that Russia has now moved to not only formally arrest him, but also that the Kremlin itself is defending this arrest, alleging that they caught this reporter red handed, does not speak very favorably to the chance of some kind of de-escalation here. Instead, it would appear that perhaps Russia is looking for some kind of a prisoner swap once again. Early to say that, of course, now, but we do know that that is the track record and the way in which Russia has proceeded with these kinds of situations in the past.",

And that includes ethanol, which was released and led to that fire that we have seen burning now for hours. That according to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.Now, ethanol is a highly flammable chemical. Exposure can lead to coughing, dizziness, burning, burning eyes, drowsiness. So there were a lot of concerns for the people in Raymond. It's one of the reasons that we have seen those evacuations this morning. Now, to be clear, according to the fire department and the sheriff's office, there are no injuries at this point at the scene. But we do know that BNSF train derailed around 1:00 a.m. local time, Central Time. The cause of the derailment is still under investigation. But you can see it there, several cars ignited. It forced that small town, population of less than 1,000 in Raymond to evacuate. And it comes nearly two months after that really frightening derailment in East Palestine, which also caused a large fire and evacuation. And, of course, there have been a lot of environmental and health concerns in Ohio since that derailment. Now, Secretary Buttigieg says crews and investigators are now at this scene in Raymond. They are looking into what happened and what sort of clean-up needs to happen now. We expect more updates on just how volatile this scene is later this morning. And we know that Minnesota's governor is expected to visit Raymond, or at least that area, in the next couple hours. Jim. Jessica.",

Here just behind me, there's five windows on the top floor up there with the shutters down. Those are the rooms where pope stays when he comes to the Gemelli Hospital here in Rome.The pope, of course, has been here before for 10 days in 2021 for surgery on his intestine.
