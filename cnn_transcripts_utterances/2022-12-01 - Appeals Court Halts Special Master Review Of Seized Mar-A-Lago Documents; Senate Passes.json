Stand by for the details on that ruling and what it means for the broader investigations of former President Donald Trump.Also tonight, the Senate passing a bill to avert a nationwide rail strike that would be crippling for the U.S. economy, President Joe Biden defending the deal, and he is poised to sign it. And the president is hosting his first state visit, standing with France's Emmanuel Macron and reaffirming their commitment to Ukraine. President Biden now signaling he's open to meeting with President Vladimir Putin under very specific conditions. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the ruling revealed just moments ago, halting the special master's review of documents that the FBI seized from former President Donald Trump's Florida home.

They felt they should be able to access all of these documents during their investigation and that a special master never should have been named in this case. And now, an appeals court, three GOP-appointed judges have agreed with the government. They have halted the special master. And they had some pretty choice words. They're essentially saying that the subject of a search warrant, in this case, that was former President Donald Trump, should not be able to stand in the way of blocking these government investigations.At one point in their opinion, they write, this appeal requires us to consider whether the district court had jurisdiction to block the United States from using lawfully seized records in a criminal investigation. The answer is no. They also are clearly weighing how this would set a precedent, this putting in place a special master, for other people who are in a similar position who are not former presidents of the United States. They write, in considering these arguments, we are faced with a choice, apply our usual test, drastically expand the availability of equitable jurisdiction for every subject of a search warrant or carve out an unprecedented exception in our law for former presidents. We choose the first option. So, the case must be dismissed. Again, a big lost for Donald Trump and also a rebuke for Judge Aileen Cannon, who put the special master in place in Florida.",

Well, Alex, other than the rebuke of Judge Cannon where they say, this is just no place for the courts to be involved in a government investigation, they have very strong words in this opinion about how they feel about what Donald Trump here specifically was arguing.So, remember, Trump went into court in Florida to ask for this special master. That's where the search had taken place, where they had seized documents out of Mar-a-Lago for the FBI and for the Justice Department to be looking at as part of their investigation. But, really, this case was an investigation happening and continues to happen in the District of Columbia. And the two things that these judges, these three GOP appointees, two appointed by Trump, are saying now is that one, there should not be special treatment for a former president. The courts just are not going to be able to do that. People who are under criminal investigation have searches executed like this. It's not enough for them to get involved just because he is a former president. And the second thing is that they reject an argument that Trump's team has continued to try and make, that the threat and the stigma of a possible criminal prosecution of the former president is so much that there really should be a pumping of the brakes by the judiciary on this sort of proceeding, on this criminal investigation that's ongoing. And that too is something that this panel says no, we're going to reject that. The threat and stigma, the argument there that you could be prosecuted, that you may be under investigation, that's not enough for us either to get involved.",

So, what they're saying is the core idea of America, the same law for everyone, no person is above the law and Donald Trump does not get special rules as a former president.",

You know, they already have access to the documents that were marked classified. It was already decided that those would not be covered under the special master.But part of building the case against potentially Donald Trump in this case, against people around him, is to show how these documents were sort of handled in such a willy-nilly fashion. They were thrown on in boxes, they were mixed with other things, they were not treated with the care that you would expect for documents marked classified. In order to do that, you need to be able to access these other documents that were all mixed in with the documents marked classified. And so that is what has been holding back part of the government's case. They also couldn't take this stuff and show to it people in their interviews that they're doing, right? They couldn't take this stuff and put it before a grand jury because they didn't have access to these documents. So, if you want to go to a grand jury and say, here is this mess of stuff we found in the former president's office, the former president's office, we found these documents marked classified and next to it were passports and next to it were some magazine covers, you need to be able to access those documents in order to that.

But I think the point that the court is making here is that none of those things change the application of the law to this particular situation. And that's really at the crux of a lot of this. The argument that if you look back at all of the things that the Trump legal team has said in their legal filings, it really suggests that they do believe he should be treated differently because he is a former president. They do suggest that, you know, he has extraordinary powers to hold on to things that he doesn't have the power to hold on to.And I think that the court, in dealing with this part of the issue, is also speaking more broadly about that way that the former president's lawyers have positioned themselves in saying that's not how any of this works. And I think that that will have implications not just for this case but for a lot of other legal cases that he's involved in, in which he is in some ways often seeking to cloak himself in the presidency when he no longer has that position.",

Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this evening. First, I want to get your reaction to this news that the federal appeals court put a stop to this special master review of those Mar-a- Lago documents. What do you think this message is for former president Donald Trump? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Well, thanks for having me, Alex. I mean, I think two things. Number one, Donald Trump's approach any time he is being investigated for anything is to try to delay and to use the courts as a mechanism to delay. And for him, it works, because he is a former president, right? We're all tangled up in questions about can you prosecute or indict somebody who is running for president, it sort of works for him. It doesn't work in the courts. He loses in court almost all the time with the exception, of course, of the ruling of Judge Cannon, which has now been overturned by an appeals court. And I think that's really, really important. Because guys like me, and hopefully the American public worries that his appointees could be, quote/unquote, Trump judges. And the record is not one that lends a lot of credence to that idea. Plenty of his appointees, of course, have ruled against him. But in this case, Cannon issued a ruling that was enormously controversial that was in his favor. Well, the appeals court just took care of that worry.",

That failed. Then they voted on a Bernie Sanders amendment that would have add paid sick leave to the deal. That also failed. And then, finally, they voted on the rail deal itself. That passed, although 15 lawmakers did vote against it, ten Republicans and five Democrats. And just as a reminder what is in this deal, it includes a 24 percent pay raise, it includes better health care premiums and benefits and it also includes thousand dollars bonuses every year. But it does not include additional paid sick leave. Right now, workers only get about one day. And so that is something that the unions were pushing for. That is why progressives were trying to fight for this. They say unions are some of our strongest allies. We should fight for this issue. It's an important issue. It's paid sick leave.

That is, of course, the Senate runoff in Georgia, putting incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock against Republican challenger Herschel Walker.Now, Obama's rally with Warnock begins soon.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, you can probably see behind me, they're still setting up for the Herschel Walker event tonight where Senator Lindsey Graham is going to be the headlining surrogate on this final early voting day eve. Now, look, Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was supposed to attend this event. The campaign, though, says that he had a family emergency and will not be here.There is a host of other Republican surrogates who are likely going to be giving the same message here in Woodstock tonight, as former President Barack Obama is willing to be giving to voters in Atlanta in just a few moments, essentially telling the crowds of people that look, you've got to get out and vote tomorrow, the final day of early voting, or make a plan to vote on Tuesday, Election Day. Now, look, Senator Raphael Warnock brought President Obama here to campaign for him before the general election as well. He is sort of the not so secret weapon of the Democrats. And part of this is because of those daily record-breaking numbers we've seen for this abbreviated period of early voting. More than 1.1 million people voted through Wednesday, more than a million of those early in-person. There are some campaigns that worry though that could be deceiving because those are such large numbers and it is still just a short amount of time. So, they still feel there are plenty of voters out there that they can motivate to get to the polls, either on Friday or on Tuesday. And ways they're doing that, of course, is spending a lot of money. We're talking about $77 million put into this four-week runoff period in television ads. And the Democrats have a 2-1 advantage there in how much they're spending. We're talking 52.9 million from Democrats to just 24.2 million for Republicans. And, Alex, to crystallize just how much more money Democrats are putting into this race than Republicans, Senator Raphael Warnock, the candidate, has put more money, $24.8 million, into ads than all of the Republican spending combined. MARQUARDT:  Just an extraordinary amount of political funds pouring into that state. Dianne Gallagher, thank you very much, a busy few days ahead of you now. Let's get more now with CNN's Chief National Affairs Analyst Kasie Hunt and CNN Senior Political Analyst Nia-Malika Henderson. Thank you both for joining me this evening. Nia, I want to start with you. We have President Obama heading down to campaign for Senator Raphael Warnock. How much of an impact can he have at this late stage in the race? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  You know, at this point it's all about enthusiasm and it's all about turnout. These kinds of rallies that are going to be likely huge, because it's Barack Obama, and people haven't seen him in this way in a little while, I mean, he was obviously there for the campaign before, but he still generates a lot of excitement. He generates excitement among African- American voters, among young voters, among suburban voters, among Latino voters, among Asian-American voters. Those are the demographics that Raphael Warnock are going to really need to show out and show out early, right? It's the last day of early voting tomorrow. He wants to get those folks out as they really want to build up lead because they know that, on Tuesday, that's when the Walker voters will show up.",

It's something other people have speculated if perhaps she wanted to run for anything, president of the United States, she could do it. She is not interested in it. But this -- the dynamics of this race I think are such that she is a particularly effective person for Democrats to be able to deploy, and frankly cutting a robo call takes a lot effort than what her husband is out there doing and potentially has very high reward, especially for the types of voters that she is trying to reach, people that use like more traditional methods of communication, perhaps older voters, rural black voters perhaps in Georgia that she might be able to speak to.",

It's really important that you pull the lever for the party, even if perhaps you've got some problems with some of the things that have been exposed about Walker's past, whether it's abortion or violence towards women or whatever your problem with him is.
