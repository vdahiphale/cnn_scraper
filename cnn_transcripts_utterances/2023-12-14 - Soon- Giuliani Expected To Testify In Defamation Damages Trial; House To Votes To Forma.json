They describe how Giuliani's life spun a flood of racist messages and even death threats that forced them to leave their jobs and homes, cost them some friends and made them feel so unsafe. They were too afraid to even use their own names. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is live outside the courthouse in Washington today. Katelyn, we heard Giuliani earlier in the week spewing lies again outside the court. What can we expect today in court?",

He's saying that he intends to take the stand and testify. His lawyer even told me as he was exiting court yesterday, that that is the plan Giuliani is planning on testifying.What is happening here in court though is this is a trial of emotional appeal and a lot of emotional weight. And so if Giuliani is taking the stand, it is about him convincing the jury that they shouldn't saddle him with millions of dollars in payments to owe to these women for the emotional distress, the reputational damage that they felt. But yesterday Ruby Freeman, one of the Georgia election workers, the mother of Shaye Moss, a volunteer after the election counting absentee ballots in Georgia, she created a scene in the courtroom that was so intense, you could hear a pin drop. It was so emotional. She was wailing at times about how she had lost her name. She was afraid to introduce herself to people. She was afraid to use her name, her I.D. This is about defamation and the reputational damage of her name. And she also spoke about how deeply disturbing it was to get taunting racist voicemails over and over again, so much she had to go to the police in person and then multiple times calling the police to help her after the election because of the harassment that she felt having to leave her home. That is something that the jury witnessed her speak about from the witness box, just feet away from them with Giuliani in the courtroom as well. And so now, the plaintiff side they're done with their case, the jury comes in at 10:00 a.m. So in just about an hour, and that's when Rudy Giuliani's lawyer will stand up before the judge and tell the jury whether or not the former mayor of New York, the former lawyer for Donald Trump and his campaign is going to be testifying as well.",

And so for the Fed essentially, they're signaling they could be done with rate hikes, possibility of three next year. But Jerome Powell always saying the work is not done yet.Inflation is still too high. Prices are still too high for Americans. So nothing is off the table. But in terms of rate cuts next year, this is encouraging for Americans because when you cut rates, that means that mortgages become more affordable. We just heard from Redfin this morning that says that the daily mortgage rate average dropped below 7 percent. We had been between seven and eight. So now we're below seven. Also, it makes it more affordable. If you have student loans paying interest on student loans, car loans, credit cards, we know that Americans are putting a lot of money on credit cards right now. But the big question is, does this track, does -- do these encouraging signs track with how Americans feel? Because we have seen that people still don't feel great about the economy. In a CNN poll from November, we saw that Americans, most Americans are still really worried about the economy. And the big question is, is will this news translate to how people feel. You can't capture that in data. You have to do surveys and polling. And of course, President Biden ultimately is not going to want to see those numbers. He's going to want to see better numbers.
