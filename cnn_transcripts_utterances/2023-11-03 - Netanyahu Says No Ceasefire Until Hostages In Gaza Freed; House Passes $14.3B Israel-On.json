Now what the new speaker has done is he passed a bill that as a policy writer would partially defund the IRS, which is a nonstarter. It's not going to become law. Politically, it makes sense for him to placate his right wing but, practically, it's very dangerous for the Israelis and for the Ukrainians, who are waiting in line behind the Israelis for another bill we haven't even seen yet. This is going to take weeks to go back and forth between the House and Senate before they come up with some scheme that makes everybody equally unhappy. And it's Israelis and Ukrainians who are paying that deadly price. This is when our dysfunction results in our enemies benefitting and our allies twisting in the wind.

Let's discuss now with Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer from New Jersey. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. On the question of a pause in the war, the White House also supports the idea to get hostages out of Gaza. But you said you do not believe that Hamas would abide by a ceasefire. I'm wondering if you've spoken to the administration about this or some of your fellow Democrats calling for one? REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): Well, you can't have a full ceasefire when Gaza and Hamas is still firing rockets into Israel. And of course, we've got American hostages there and other hostages. We've got to get the hostages out. We've got to crush Hamas and the terrorists who continue to do harm. So we must do that. I agree with what the White House said yesterday. And I support the fact that we have to make sure we do everything we can to get humanitarian aid in. That's critically important, especially as we see all of -- we see Hamas using Palestinians, innocent Palestinians, as shields. So we've got to make sure we get the humanitarian aid in. But we have to get those hostages out. We have to crush the terrorists and stop Hamas from bombing Israel.",

We've got -- American forces I should say. We need to do everything we can to get the hostages out and make sure that whatever the approach is, as you White House has said, we cover our goals.
