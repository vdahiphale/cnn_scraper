We'll ask what that really means. Also ahead, more bloodshed in the West Bank is prompting real fears of a new front in the conflict. I'll speak to a Palestinian politician about what could happen next. Plus, footballer Luis Diaz's father who was kidnapped in Colombia has been freed. We have more on that remarkable story from Bogota this hour. But first this evening, the White House downplaying concerns that the Israeli prime minister is not listening to the U.S., even though Benjamin Netanyahu who insisted again hours ago, there won't be a ceasefire without the release of hostages held by Hamas. Washington is now touting what it calls a step in the right direction. It says Israel will begin carrying out four-hour pauses in military operations daily in parts of northern Gaza. And here's what Israel's chief military spokesperson said in the last hour. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HAGARI, SPOKESPERSON, IDF (through translator):  There's no ceasefire, there's no ceasefire. We have no ceasefire. We are fighting Hamas. We have pauses, tactical pauses that are limited in time, humanitarian, to enable the citizens between 10:00 and 2:00 to move. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But humanitariangroups have been -- have long warned, of course, that the mass movement poses real problems regarding international law, with more than 2 millions civilians facing shortages of food, fuel, drinking water, as well as medicine. Meanwhile, Israeli forces say they've captured a Hamas-stronghold in northern Gaza, as the pitched battle in Gaza city rages on. And the U.N. Human Rights chief says both Hamas as well as Israel have committed war crimes over the last month, also calling for a ceasefire. And then there's violence in the West Bank spiking today, adding to fears of a wider conflict, we'll get to that in just a moment. First though, let's get the very latest from our Nic Robertson, who is in the Israeli city, Sderot, close to Gaza's northern border. And Nic, I wonder if you can add some clarity here on what we've heard from the White House. Are these four-hour pauses similar to the pauses that we have been seeing already? Or are these little pauses that Netanyahu was talking about earlier this week?",

It was interesting that PresidentBiden said that his request for these pauses had been going a little slower than he had hoped. Indeed, he said as well that he was thinking in terms of three-day pauses, even more than three-day pauses. So, these tactical pauses, these humanitarian pauses, they're very small, they're localized. And this is what the IDF is saying here? As you said there, the humanitarian corridor to allow civilians to move from north to south, and allow some medical convoys to get from the south to the north, to the hospitals in the north, they've had this window through the day, it's been -- it started off as a couple of hours, and now, it's grown into what is expected tomorrow to be a six-hour window. But it is defined as being on that main thoroughfare, from the south to the north of Gaza. And it is for that purpose of civilians to flee, and some medical aid to move north.

The IDF have also been detaining some young men, handcuffing them, appears for questioning. So precisely, what is the IDF saying it's not doing, and is going to do, isn't clear. The intent here is, look, Israel was under huge pressure, the prime minister under huge pressure to allow some kind of relief for the civilian populations. It was very clear they didn't know how to get to safety. And this seems to be addressing that concern. But as we heard from the prime minister, I think it was just yesterday saying that they're working on the diplomatic front to keep -- to allow the IDF to keep doing their  work on the ground. I think these humanitarian pauses are in essence the diplomatic offering from Israel, if you will, to diplomats, and this is it, an action on the ground.",

You know, that's -- the question I think is going to be whether or not that number is going to be sufficient for Israeli political leadership who have up until now been very clear in signaling that they are not going to embrace a pause in the fighting for, you know, twos and threes, as small numbers of hostages being left out. They want to put a significant number of hostages to be released. I think one of the really interesting pieces here is that our understanding from our sources is that, one of the things also under discussion here is a -- is the possibility of Hamas producing some kind of a list of the hostages that it is still holding. This is, I think particularly significant for both Israeli officials, but also for intelligence officials both here in the United States and in Israel, kind of trying to track the hostage question. Because we don't really have a great sense, the United States doesn't really have a great sense where all of these individuals are being held. We know they're not all being held in the same place. The U.S. and Israel, I think also both are keenly aware that it's possible that not all of these hostages are actually being held by Hamas, but may -- some of them maybe being held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, PIJ, another militant group in Gaza. And so, I think there is an almost a fact-finding mission that is -- that is sort of possible here.",

U.S. Senate Democrat Joe Manchin says he will not run for reelection next year,a big blow to his party and potentially the White House.

In a post on social media, he said, quote, \"I will not seek reelection, I will fight to unite the middle.\" Manchin has been openly flirting with a third party presidential campaign. We'll bring you more on this, as it develops. In an update for you on the story that we have been following on the show, the father of football star Luis Diaz is now free after kidnappers released him a short time ago, in Colombia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SOARES (voice-over):  This is video, showing Luis Manuel Diaz with representatives on the United Nations and the Catholic Church. He was kidnapped, if you remember, two weeks ago by a Colombian guerrilla group at a gas station in the family's hometown. The younger Diaz, who played for Liverpool FC, had been pleading for his father's release. On Sunday, he scored a goal, in Liverpool's match and showed off his T- shirt with the message, \"Freedom for papa.\" I want to bring in journalist Stefano Pozzebon from Bogota, Colombia, with the very latest. Stefano, can you bring us up to date on how this came about? How was his release and critically, how is he doing?",

He was first detained by the ELN, kidnapped by the ELN, which is one of the Colombia's oldest and largest military left-wing guerrilla groups back in October 28th. And after 13 days and thanks to the mediation of the Catholic Church and the United Nations, he was allowed to walk free and handed over to these authorities in an area on the border between Colombia and Venezuela, an area where Colombian authorities don't go, don't exercise control. I think it's interesting, here, Isa, to point out that this positive news story is perhaps a red herring, because while we have seen a successful return for him to the family, 79 people have been kidnapped in Colombia this year. And it's a sign of a deteriorating security situation here in the country.",
