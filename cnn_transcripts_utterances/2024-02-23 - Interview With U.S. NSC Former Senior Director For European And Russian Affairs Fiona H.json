I'm Christiane Amanpour in Dnipro, which is southeast of Kyiv. Early this morning, an apartment building here was struck by Russia's Shahed drones. Two people were killed. Kharkiv and Odessa were also hit. You can see on this map how much closer to the front lines this place is than Kyiv. And that makes Dnipro's hospital a lifesaving stop for the wounded Ukrainian soldiers. from the front. Even though Ukraine does not officially release casualty figures, today, we got a rare look inside as the war enters its third brutal year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voice-over):  The parking lot at Dnipro's Mechnikov Hospital is jammed with ambulances. These patients are the lucky ones. Fully stabilized here after their wounds have been treated, they are being evacuated to hospitals in 10 other Ukrainian cities. It's a bloody carousel because they're making room for the next wave of casualties. In the resuscitation ward, director Serhly Ryzhenko tells us in the two years of Russia's full-scale invasion, 28,000 frontline soldiers have been brought to this hospital alone.",

Putin announced today thatRussia is producing new hypersonic missiles and developing A.I. assisted warfare. Joining me now is Russia expert Fiona Hill, who once served on the U.S. National Security Council, and she's met President Putin on several occasions. Fiona Hill, welcome to the program. We've got a bit of a delay here. So, let me ask you what you make of the sanctions. Just, do you think they're going to make a difference? FIONA HILL, FORMER SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AND RUSSIAN AFFAIRS, U.S. NSC:  Well, the thing with sanctions, Christiane, is they always make something of a difference over a longer period of time in terms of constraining the options for countries like Russia, you know, to acquire various technology and to, you know, keep on renewing their economy. In the short to medium term, it's sometimes harder to see the impact of what we did have actually a pretty immediate impact on Russia's ability to conduct the war early on. But, you know, we also have the problem that Russia was able to adapt and learn. They actually are still able to acquire technology from other countries or via other countries, even including from the United States. We've had a lot of reports about this. So, in addition to actually announcing sanctions, we have to really try to find new ways of enforcing them and to stop other countries from actually providing Russia with equipment. You mentioned at the very beginning of your opening segment about a building being hit by a Russian Shahed drone, you said. The Shahed drones have been provided by Iran, and this is also an example of some of the problems that we're facing, that countries like Iran and North Korea are actually providing Russia with ammunition and with other equipment, and we're going to have to find a way of addressing that as well.",

I said it because I said Russia's Shaheds, because you're right, they are getting all their -- or a lot of their main ammunition nowfrom elsewhere and their main weapons systems. And they've also ramped up their own domestic weapons production system. When you look at the battlefield right now and you see the loss of Avdiivka over the weekend, you see more pressure towards -- basically towards Kharkiv, what are you thinking as you look at the map?",

They -- and you heard that young man say that they're just still just throwing meat at us, in his words, just rushing across the fields at us. There doesn't seem to be any restraint or limit on what the Russians are willing to do and how many they're willing to lose.",

I mean, we know, you know, up till now that the Russianshave, on their side, got about 315,000 casualties. That includes severely maimed, like the young man that we just saw in hospital, as well as killed and taken out of action. There have been Russian military bloggers. One has just recently committed suicide because they've actually revealed that thousands of Russian servicemen have died just in the assault of Avdiivka over the last several months. Putin is banking on the fact, however, that he can keep on throwing more men and ammunition at this battlefield over this next year to basically instill a sense of defeat in us. So again, the critical point is we know, as you've pointed out very eloquently here, Christiane, that, you know, Russia's modus operandi is literally to destroy everything and to sacrifice as many people as possible on their own side. Putin is very well willing to fight to the last Ukrainian and presumes that he'll get to that before the last Russian. But if we show some resolve here and show that we're actually willing to help support Ukraine as it digs in and keeps funding the Russian off -- the Russians off, that might make some -- I'd say, create some prospect for a turning point in the year ahead. This is a critical year in 2024 and I think the main point is that we mustn't basically blink, that we shouldn't step back here, but that's exactly what Putin's trying to do, get us to blink, including with all of these announcements about hypersonic missiles, satellite missiles and space, you name it, he's trying to get us intimidated and to step back.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are a number of different messages there. I mean, one is that he sees this as a kind of almost an eternal battle. I think much toTucker Carlson's surprise, he kept taking everything back to the 9th century. He's basically trying to convey that Ukraine doesn't exist as a country. It's an eternal part of Russia and that not just right is on his side and might on his side but even, you know, perhaps the -- a whole history of the kind of the European space here. He also made it very clear that he had no intention of dropping his maximalist aims, and that's something that, you know, we have to contend with. There's so much of a debate going on, you know, in Europe right now about is it possible for Ukraine or on a broader scale, for Europeans in the United States to negotiate with Putin and Russia. And there was no sign in that interview with Tucker Carlson that Putin's ready to do that. I mean, again, he sees himself as prevailing here and he also sees himself as something of a czar, of a Russian king, of a tyrant in a historic sense. So, there was no sign there of any movement on Putin's part at all and none of his recent statements suggest that. And of course, he has his own election to go through in this next month in March and he's looking to have himself anointed and, you know, cemented in place so that he can keep on pursuing the track that he's on already.",

This is obviously an incredibly brave family, and they do pose something of a danger to Putinand his whole narrative about everything, and to his cynicism. And you're also seeing even Russian Orthodox priests coming out and saying, look, this isn't a Christian thing to do. You know, how are we really then a Christian Orthodox nation if we're denying the mother the right, the legal rights, and the religious rights to bury her son in an appropriate fashion? You can see some momentum emerging around this. And, you know, the longer the Russian government keeps this standoff with her, you know, actually, the more risky it may become for them. I think that Alexei Navalny's mother is an incredibly brave person, and for that reason, I do actually worry about her, because the Kremlin has shown that it really wants to clamp down. And in previous iterations of wars in Afghanistan, for example, and also Chechnya, you've mentioned Grozny, the capital of Chechnya multiple times, it was soldiers' mothers, the mothers of the victims, the casualties of these wars, that actually did push back against the Russian State. And here, you have the mother of someone, Alexei Navalny, who has frankly become a martyr in a political sense, pushing back and trying, you know, to hold the Kremlin to account.

The war is not over. Well, unfortunately, this is true because this is Putin's decision. Yet, the brave men and women from Ukraine have liberated 50 percent of what Putin had conquered in the first place. Putin wanted to take over the whole country. Wanted to expel 40 million people or even kill them. Without our military support, he would have won that war in a couple of weeks. But he didn't. And this is why it's so crucial for us that we continue our support, that we continue the people's support, that they can liberate their towns. That's what they've done also in the Black Sea. They have fought back. Now, we have grain coming out of Odessa again. We have the Ukraine on the pathway to the European Union. The best thing we could do for Putin would be to give in and do not support Ukraine anymore. This is not an option for us in Europe. This is why we not only increased our military support, we have done things we would have never thought of before. We passed 50 billion package from E.U., 30 billion from Germany for military support because we know and we have learned, unfortunately, over the last two years, this is not only a war against Ukraine, it's a war against the European peace order, it's a war against the charter of the United Nations. So, Ukrainians are fighting this war for us, to stand up for the worldwide freedom. So, it's in our common security interest. And yes, this is why it's so highly needed that we also have the continued support from the U.S. I was speaking to many senators and governors at the Munich Security Conference from both parties, and many of them agreed with me.

We need the security that the 7th of October will never happen again. We need the security from the Arab world. And on the other hand, we need the security that also Palestinians can live in dignity and peace as we are all living. And for that, it needs a humanitarian pause now. Now is the moment where we need a humanitarian pause to free all the hostages from Hamas and to bring in the humanitarian aid which is so heavily needed by thousands of Palestinians. I mean, 17,000 children without fathers and mothers. This cannot go on like that. And on that pathway, coming then from a humanitarian pause after the hostages have been released, after humanitarian aid is in, to a sustainable ceasefire, and then really, not only this war, but ending the conflict for future generations. This is a pathway we want to go with many partners, like the Americans, the Brits. We are working with Arab partners on this pathway all together, because only a two-state solution brings peace for everybody in the region. On the settlers in the West Bank you were mentioning, I was also very clear when I was in Israel, in the region, the last five times since the 7th of October. International law is clear that the settlements are illegal and this is why the extremist settlers pushing out Palestinians from their own homes. I've visited some of these farmers and there was a drone over my own head because we crossed a line which radical settlers have set, but which is totally illegal. That this is being sanctioned. So, this is very important, because we are standing all together for international law. It is very hard. I mean, we are working on that day by day, but we cannot give up.

He says, without the aid, the Ukrainians are facing losses for the first time in a long time, and warns what could happen if this continues, not just to Ukraine, but also to the West. It is a warning echoed by our next guest, Penny Pritzker, the former commerce secretary who last year took on the role of U.S. special representative for Ukraine's economic recovery. And she joins Michel Martin now to discuss what continued U.S. support means for the future of this country and how to rebuild this nation's economy in the middle of war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The other thing is steel. Ukraine has an enormous reservoir of recyclable steel that can be turned into new products. And in fact, one thinks of recyclable steel and modern steelmaking as a raw material, and they have the largest inventory in the world. It's important they get their steel out to the rest of the world as well. So, Ukraine -- and that's -- and another factor is Ukraine is also integrated its energy system with Europe.

And I want to focus on something that I think is really important. Right now, as we speak, the situation in Ukraine is desperate. We are foot dragging on our military and economic aid. We are helping Putin right now by not arming and not supporting Ukraine. The Europeans have passed economic support, but they don't have the military equipment to send or the munitions to send to Ukraine. We do. And the fact that we're not doing, it makes no sense to me. One can argue on the -- you know, this is about our own security. That makes no sense. We should be defending Ukraine because we don't want to end up with NATO in a war with Putin, which will bring, you know, Article 5 into play. But what also doesn't make sense to me is the money that is spent on military equipment being sent to Ukraine is actually being spent in the United States. We send our older versions of equipment and munitions to the Ukrainians. They upgrade them. And we produce new equipment. New HIMARS, new Bradley's, new howitzers made in Minnesota, made in Alabama, made in New Jersey. Though that production gets -- that inventory gets replenished and that production occurs here in the United States. So, I do not understand why we're dragging our feet.

As I've talked about, there's enormous demand for tech and the individuals and that capability. And then, of course, there's logistics and transportation. The other part of our work is really focused on what I call foundational issues. There are things that need to be true besides security in order for recovery to occur and also to minimize the time from when there's the end of the war and the economy is hitting its full velocity, if you will. And those are things like insurance. Those are things like you know, the ability. What is the world going to do about seized Russian sovereign assets?
