The rate now. That's our national polling, shows the Quinnipiac poll. So 52 to 41 percent. \"The New York Times\" op-ed -- of course, liberal op-ed -- goes on to write about how they view this would play politically. They say, \"The move to protect undocumented spouses is politically savvy.\" They call it \"a family-oriented policy that makes a priority of the needs of American citizens, unlike those of his policies that allowed nearly 2 million asylum seekers into the country in recent years. Despite get the fever dream of conspiracy theories, they can't cast a ballot to thank him.\" So is this good politics for Joe Biden when he's underwater on immigration? BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: Listen, he's underwater with immigration, and he's losing a lot of ground with Latinos. So it's a hail Mary to try to bring them back. Because the last three years, his economic activities, his economic messages, economic deliveries have been a failure to Latino communities, specifically working-class Latinos and middle-class Latinos. So he needs something. He needs -- he needs a hail Mary, and this is it. I don't think it's going to be enough, because I think Latinos have passed judgment on Joe Biden with respect to how he helps them economically. And he doesn't. He's failed them for -- for nearly 36 months in tackling inflation. So he doesn't help them there. We'll see if it works. I don't think it's going to work. I don't think offering amnesty to anybody at this particular moment is going to work, especially when the public views Joe Biden as someone who started this immigration fire by reversing 94 executive orders that President Trump put in order. So you know, you can't have the guy who started the fire come up with a solution to put out the fire.

We've had this concern for the last 20 years of somebody -- somebody coming across the border to create these types of attacks. There have been movies about it. So it should be -- come as no surprise that, if you liberalize the border policies, that people across the country are going to see this as an opportunity to come in. And they have. And we've seen that the FBI has talked about, I think, there's been raids and arrests related to people crossing the border who are part of terrorist organizations. This should not be a surprise.

This executive order is only going -- it's only going to -- only goes into effect for those who have already lived in the country for ten years or longer. The fact that they've been here, they're part of the community. There's a way to bring them in and to give them a pathway to citizenship. That is not a controversial position with most of the American public. Most of the American public looks at these two executive orders that the president has signed. One, tightening controls at the border. Two, showing some compassion for families and those who have been here for a long time. And most Americans say, well, those two things sound reasonable, hand in hand. And so I think the president has an opportunity. Contrast that with the former president, who shut down the one shot we have had at bipartisan immigration or border control in recent memory.

That's not the same thing as strong language in the treaty from 1961: \"shall come to the defense, shall defend.\" It says \"assistance.\" And then Kim Jong-un, for his part, were trying to see if this agreement has codified an alliance between the two countries. Kim saying, \"Relations between our two countries had released -- reached\" -- excuse me -- \"a new high level of allied ties.\" So we're working through this, Manu, to try to figure out what exactly this means for the rapport and the relationship between the two countries and what that means for us in the United States, Manu.",
