So, the target letter, we haven't seen it yet, but we would really love to see it because whenever the Justice Department sends this to someone, a target letter does tend to indicate exactly what the person may be charged with. The charges that the Justice Department has been investigating and is considering bringing against that person.And reporting from a number of different news outlets, including \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning, says that there are these three charges that the Justice Department has been looking at related to Donald Trump that he could be charged with. Conspiracy to defraud the United States, that is a charge that basically means that the Justice Department has evidence that two people would have agreed to somehow carry forward something that they believe is illegal. So, Trump and a -- potentially another person, not necessarily another person would be charged there, but it does mean two people. And then another piece of it, that witness tampering possible charge. That actually may be obstructing Congress because witness tampering, that charge, it means a couple different things depending how you put it on the books. But the Justice Department has already indicated they were looking at obstructing the congressional proceeding on January 6th as one of the things they were investigating in this investigation of top administration officials during the Trump-era. We also know that they have used that charge against many different January 6th rioters. And then the third piece that is out there is this deprivation of rights charge. A civil rights charge that would be fairly interesting to see how the Justice Department structures that. And also, just to see them try it in court.

Whenever you look back at the timing of the previous indictment that the special counsel's office brought, they notified Donald Trump a few days before they notified his co-defendant Walt Nauta. that Walt Nauta, too, would be facing very likely charges in that case. They, obviously, were both charged together a couple weeks after that. And so, there's a question there.But then there's also a part of this that is hanging out there that we haven't -- we don't -- still don't really understand and that the investigation is clearly continuing. Donald Trump's getting this target letter but we know of at least one person, a close aide of his, who is going to the grand jury, has an appointment tomorrow to testify with them. A man named Will Russell, who was with Trump both at the White House, on his advance team, and then worked with him with afterwards after he left the White House. There are others we've heard about who are getting inquiries rather -- whether they're grand jury inquiries or inquiries for interviews. And, you know, Kaitlan Collins last night just had another lawyer in this circle, Tim Parlatore on TV, and he was saying that one of his clients, Bernie Kerik, a man really close to Rudy Giuliani. He was working on a lot of the election fraud efforts, had been getting inquiries from the special counsel's office, too, and that's not even scheduled yet. So, where this investigation still goes and how an indictment would factor into that, now that a target letter has been sent to the former president, there's really a lot of different ways this could play out.",

I think the best theory here is the civil rights of all of us, to cast our ballots and to have a full and free election.The second listed charges, conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. Now, conspiracy is an important word because you have to have two or more agreeing to commit a conspiracy. That does not necessarily mean there will be a second person on the indictment with Donald Trump. We could see separate indictments. We could see an unindicted co-conspirator. But that's a very broad stroke here and it tells me Jack Smith is taking a world view on this. And finally, there is this statute that covers tampering with a witness. Important to note though, there is a very broad federal statute that covers witness tampering, but also obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. [08:10:00] So, we don't know which prong of that statute DOJ is referring to. But that gives us a sense if there is an indictment, which seems likely now, what could be in it.",

We know he was literally by Donald Trump's side throughout the lead-up to January 6th. I think his testimony is going to be crucial. Part of the reason we know how important Mark Meadows was, was because almost exactly a year ago now, Cassidy Hutchinson, one of Meadows aides, she testified publicly in the January 6th Committee. We know DOJ has spoken to Cassidy Hutchinson.We also know that they've gotten into Donald Trump's inner circle, his family members, his closest White House advisers, Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Dan Scavino. And we know that DOJ has also talked to secret service agents. I mean, who's going to be closer, physically closer, to the president -- the former president than the secret service? And DOJ has really not hesitated to go to the top rungs of power. They also have spoken with Mike Pence, of course, a crucial witness here because he was the subject of a pressure campaign from Donald Trump. Finally, we know they've spoken with some, but not all, of the lawyers. The lawyers are really important part of this. We know they've spoken with Rudy Giuliani who was really a driving force behind this effort. As far as we know, they've not spoken with Sidney Powell and John Eastman. That might actually worry me if I represented them because typically you would not speak with somebody who is a target.

I want to start with you -- kind of alluded to this last night, when you're talking to Kaitlan.

Which is not something you would generally want to do in such a politically charged case, because it is susceptible toward power attack.But that would actually open up a significant amount of discovery, in my opinion. Because if they are going to charge that as Elie, mentioned a few minutes ago, with the rights of the voters. They potentially open it up to where he can get discovery and look into just about everything. All of the claims of election fraud that they raised back then, can all be relitigated here. So, I kind of wonder, that was not something I was expecting them to try and get into that much depth on. So, I don't know if that one is something that they will actually include. You know, certainly conspiracy to defraud is something that we had looked at. You know, when I was on the team, and then that the obstruction or witness tampering or whatever section they are going to use that's also consistent with what I kind of was looking at the time.",

The other thing I think that he said that it's really interesting is, as we've sort of talked about, it looks like Donald Trump is going to make some version of what we call an advice of counsel defense.
