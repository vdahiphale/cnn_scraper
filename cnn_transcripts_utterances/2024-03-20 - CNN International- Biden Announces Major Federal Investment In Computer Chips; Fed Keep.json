The Biden administration is awarding Intel, the chipmaker, $8.5 billion, plus up to $11 billion in loans to expand manufacturing here in the U.S. The president marking that announcement by touring an Intel plant in Maricopa County. It is one of the largest federal investments ever in high-tech manufacturing, crucial step towards competing with China, that the White House says could create tens of thousands of jobs here in the U.S. For more on the news, I want to bring in CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak. Kevin, of course, the Biden administration has been doing its best to tout the strength of the overall jobs market. This is the case of the government juicing the market in effect. Tell us what the intent is here and how long this will play out over.",

And he's really trying to take credit for some of these key accomplishments when it comes to the economy and particularly in a battleground state like Arizona, which will prove critical in November's election, President Biden really does want to emphasize some of these steps that he says are building on this record of boosting manufacturing, bringing jobs back to the United States.And when it comes to chips specifically, he's also trying to make that national security argument as well, trying to say that if we can separate these critical components for many factoring in China, our own national security will be strengthened. And so, that's part of what you'll see him do today. One of the problems that President Biden is confronting is that a lot of these steps have just taken a very long time to come into effect. The Chips Act, which is where this money is coming from past in 2022, but some of these grants are just coming into effect now. And you have heard from some of these chipmakers including Intel, where he's here, where he'll speak today, saying that it is taking too long for some of this money to come to fruition. But certainly, today, he will want to tout those billions and billions of dollars that he is providing to this company that he says will bring 30,000 jobs to Arizona. There are also a number of other states that Intel says that its building plants in Ohio, New Mexico, Oregon. And so, certainly, President Biden very much wanting to take credit as he is on this major swing through battleground states -- Jim.",

Also, for projects under the infrastructure bill to start being built.And I think as we get closer and closer to the election, that argument is going to become more and more critical for President Biden to make because, you know, it's true many Americans, even though the general economy in the country, all indicators say that it's getting better, a lot of Americans at their own kitchen table say that they don't necessarily feel it yet. So this is sort of the number one imperative for President Biden, as he's touting his record, is to show people that he is doing things that have made their own lives better. But that's sometimes a hard argument to make. You know, it's a balance that he has to strike. He doesn't necessarily want to be seen as telling people that the economy is better than they think it is.

And so, in that way, the message continuous, because that's sort of where we've been in this sort of waiting, holding pattern for the first rate cut of 2024.It's the fifth meeting in a row, Jim, where the Fed has kept rates steady, have -- has held rate steady. We've been at this range since July of last year. A few things we learned this meeting, Jim, a few things. So, on unemployment, the Fed actually revised lower its expectation for the year. So keeping it at that 4 percent range, very low, we'd been there for years. On GDP, on economic growth, it actually so you revise those numbers higher. So expecting a stronger U.S. economy in 2024, then even just a few months ago, they had projected. And then on their federal funds, the target rate, the rate that we're talking about right now, they expect they continue to expect those rate cuts about three rate cuts in 2024. So, again, on a lot of ways, Jim, this was sort of a copy and paste from the last meeting were really in this holding period in terms of when is the right time to start cutting rates, you put it all together though, and you have an economy that's certainly not at least according to these projections showing signs of a recession, and you have an outlook that remains the same in the sense of interest rate cuts. It's a message that Wall Street certainly liked. But, but what about Main Street? You were just talking to Kevin about how Americans really feel. And Jay Powell was just asked a short time ago, sort of what is the timeline for the first rate cut? What are you looking for? And, Jim, here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I don't think a lot of people are worried about losing their job. They're just worried that what they're making it their job isn't enough to keep their head above water.That feeling persists and so, I think if you're the Republican Party and you're challenging an incumbent president, your real message, Jim, is just this guy and his party brought your record inflation. They've got no plan to really do anything about it. They may do it to you again in the future. That's the nature of being a challenger in a political campaign. SCIUTTO: No question, Basil. So what -- what's your answer to that? I mean, the overall economic numbers are strong. Even the market is strong That said, the most tactile way that people experienced the economy beyond their job. And that piece seems to be strong and wages are rising is what they pay for stuff, right? So, what's -- what's the president's answer to that?

I want to talk about another issue because this is becomes central to this race. Not only President Biden's framing of it, but President Trump's.

I think this whole issue for him is a limiting issue and it's going -- it's going to be a difficult thing for some voters to get over.

Moreno is going to have a really good chance.Running against a well-funded incumbent in this country right now, whether they're Democrat or Republican is a difficult proposition. Most incumbents are winning in the Senate for governors races. So I think while that Senate race is going to be at the top of the board for Republicans, it's not a slam dunk and Moreno's got his work cut out for him. I think he's got a great chance and I wish them well, and I certainly hope Republicans take the Senate. But it's not a layup.

I've had Israelis, you know, as I'm in the field, talk -- talk to me repeatedly about how much they appreciated his support, but there's also no question that Israelis, both in governments and those outside of governments are increasingly feeling the pressure from the United States and feeling like the -- like President Biden is forgetting how this war started. That is the Israeli sentiment. Now, in terms of what this pressure is actually amounting to the Israeli prime minister has agreed to now send this delegation of Israeli officials, two of his closest advisers to Washington, likely early next week to discuss what Americans, what the American administration would like to present as alternatives to this major ground offensive in Rafah. But even as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is willing to show that he's able to listen that he's going to listen to what the Americans are presenting. On the other hand, he's also making very clear that he intends to very soon approve plans to move into Rafah, indicating that there's nothing really that can change his mind in terms of his view that only a ground offensive can eliminate what he has described as Hamas's last bastion in Rafah.

There were also cancer patients who came here for treatment before October 7 and they have been here since.Now, these patients, the Israeli government now wants to send them back to Gaza, saying that they have completed their treatments. We were able to bring this to light in our report yesterday. And following that, several Israeli human rights organizations filed a petition with the Israeli Supreme Court today, asking the Israeli government to stop these, what are effectively deportations back to Gaza. The Israeli Supreme Court says that the Israeli government must respond to these petitions by tomorrow. And in the meantime, it is issuing a temporary injunction preventing the government from sending these Gazan some two dozen Gazans back to Rafah where they would face a very, very uncertain future.

It's lasted for years, and it requires security, but also focused on humanitarian issues.Humanitarian issues have been on the back burner in this country.

That law would give state officials and law enforcement the power to arrest and detain people they suspect of crossing the border illegallyImmigration, typically, a job for the federal government. CNN senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, she joins me now to make sense of this all.

A district court judge, who has been the only judge to actually take a look at this in a serious way, put it on hold, saying it was unconstitutional. It's effectively nullified federal law.But the Fifth Circuit -- which will be the topic of our conversation here -- Fifth Circuit said that that law actually could take effect while all the appeals were pending. Yesterday, the Supreme Court, just about 24 hours ago, Jim, it essentially endorsed that and said the law could take effect. But it was based -- based on kind of what the Fifth Circuit had done to that point. And last night, the Appeals Court essentially lifted the original order that opened the door for it and just said, wait a second. So, right now, the law is it is not in effect, but we already had this green light from the Supreme Court raising the stakes and I just want to read a comment from Justice Sotomayor, who was one of three justices of the nine who dissented yesterday. It was very heavily weighted conservative majority that sided with Texas here. But this is what Justice Sotomayor said: Today, the court invites further chaos and crisis in immigration enforcement. Texas passed a law that directly regulates the entry and removal of noncitizens and explicitly instructs its state courts to disregard any ongoing federal immigration proceedings. That law upends the federal-state balance of power that has existed for over a century. And the only reason I want to stress that is so the people understand the legal stakes here. They've seen all the great very compelling pictures of what's happening at the border. But this is -- this is what the issue is and what that three-judge panel heard today were arguments on just a very early slice of the case, and that involves which side would be more harmed if the law were to take effect. And Texas is saying the law should take effect because if it doesn't, while appeals play out, it would be harmed. Obviously, the federal government and immigration rights advocates say the opposite.",

I think the fact that the majority of the appellate panel that we've been talking about, the Fifth Circuit oversees Texas, that a majority of the appellate panel last night negated in an original decision there and said the law should be blocked. It was a two-to-one vote. And the one Trump appointee on the bench said, no, that law should go into effect.But I think that was an early signal, Jim, that we could get a permanent order just keeping the status quo, keeping the law on hold while the constitutional challenge plays out. So I would say that could happen. If that doesn't, then were just going to have lots more turmoil. But even if it does, Texas might come right back to the Supreme Court and say to the Supreme Court justices, no, let that law to take effect while the merits play out. And then your other larger question, Jim, on the merits of this, if the Supreme Court rules on its -- based on its own precedent and federal law over decades and decades, it would strike down this law.",
