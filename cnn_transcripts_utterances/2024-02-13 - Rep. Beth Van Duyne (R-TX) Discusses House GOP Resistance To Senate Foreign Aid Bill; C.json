That is his goal, completely opposed to Trumps goal, which is to try to delay, delay, delay until after the 2024 election in the hope that he can get reelected and make all of this ad Jack Smith's appointment of special counsel go away. So what Trump is asking the Supreme Court to do right now is put on hold that scathing unanimous appeals court decision last week that found that he does not have presidential immunity that can protect him from this case while he exercises all of his other potential appeal options. Again, it's all a delay strategy. But Smith is likely going to ask the Supreme Court to just weigh in, decide this once and for all, send this back down to the trial court so that we can get going. But as you said, this is just as much about timing as it is about this constitutional question.",

You have Republicans who believe there is a double-standard, don't understand why there were not charges here. And then Democrats and the White House, who are furious with the way that he characterized President Bidens cognitive ability. So this could be a highly contentious hearing.

You've got the Republicans going after him for recommending that Joe Biden not be charged. And you've got the Democrats going after him for having mischaracterized various aspects in speculating about part his ability to memory -- to remember certain facts. So I think this is going to be a little bit different in the sense that you're going to have not only Democrats going after him, but also the Republicans.",

JOE WALSH, (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN FROM ILLINOIS: Brianna, our only guide is everything that my former colleagues, Republican colleagues have done in the House since they took control of the House is political and has been protecting Trump and trying to exact revenge for Donald Trump. I mean, that's been their agenda. There's no policy agenda at all. So I would expect that to be the same motivation here. They want to get this special counsel in and they want to solely focus on what they consider to be the big political damage in this report, which is what the council said about Bidens age and memory. I expect them to just go hog wild on that in an attempt to again, run interference for Trump. And in essence campaign for Trump.",

No question in my mind about that.But should Merrick Garland have weighed in on that? No. Anything he would have done would have just politically been disastrous. If he didn't issue the entire report, it would have looked as if he had started reporting on the report, just like Bill Barr did for Trump in the Russian investigation, that would have looked bad. I think he did what he only could do, which was to issue the report. And if you look at the report itself, there's so many contradictions in it that it almost defeats itself. He says he wasn't willful then he says he was willful. On -- and it goes back and forth. And there's a lot of speculation about what Joe Biden remembered. He faults them for not remembering things in an interview conducted with a ghostwriter in 2017. And then for not remembering the same things, six or seven years later. I mean, that itself is kind of bizarre. So there's a number of just internal inconsistencies riddled throughout that report. And if I were on that committee, I'd be cross-examining Mr. Hur on all of those inconsistencies and bringing those out so the public can see that he really didn't do a very good job in terms of writing up a report.

Look, I know we live in a fact -- almost a fact-free, truth free world right now. But if Hur gets in front of Congress, its incumbent upon the Democrats to show the American people the differences between the way Biden and Trump handled these classified documents.

I just don't see that the Supreme Court has anything to add to this opinion, on the opinion.The 57 pages by the D.C. circuit was extremely specific, well- reasoned, very analytical, took head-on all of the issues raised by Donald Trump. Basically obliterated them. I think the Supreme Court, at this point, is going to sit back and say, were not going to look at this issue until after and if Donald Trump is convicted in this case. Now at that point, you've got to totally separate situation. You've got --right now, you just have allegations that are set forth in the indictment without evidence put forth, without a jury verdict, without any kind of factual finding. Once there's a jury verdict and Donald Trump is convicted, the proof will be in, the evidence will be in, and before the Supreme Court. And at that point, it would make sense for them to revisit this issue of presidential immunity. But at this point, given the juncture of the case, given the fact that they have to also deal with the 2024 election in light of the 14th Amendment, I don't think the Supreme Court wants anything to do with this.",

So they pointed out the apartment that Eboni Pouncy was in. So police go to that apartment, that second apartment. Again, as you mentioned, they saw that there was broken glass. They saw that the screen was gone. They saw that the window blinds were up. They knock on the door and then it -- within just a few moments, you see what happens with this gunfire. Right now, Eboni Pouncy is in stable condition. Police administered lifesaving efforts as soon as they were able to get inside that apartment. They did find a firearm when they went inside that apartment. Still many more questions to ask. As you point out, this video is edited. So there are many people who are calling for the full release of the video, the full raw release.

And this is one of the tricky parts of a story like this, which is the way the law will look at this is, what was the officer's perception when she opened fire? Did she say I saw a gun? I said drop the gun and the gun was suddenly pointed at me instead, and so I opened fire. Does her partner say, when she opened fire, I couldn't tell whether the gunfire was coming from inside the apartment or from outside? That is the kind of thing that they're going to be able to establish when they sit these two officers down and conduct those interviews. And perception is going to be important. But there are obviously clear inherent questions about the shooting itself, which is the sheer number of shots. going through an entire 15 round magazine, dropping that magazine, reloading and emptying another magazine. The curtain is down. It's not clear from the body camera. And a body camera is not a human eye. It's a one-dimensional view from a different angle. But from the body camera, it's hard to see that they could even see what they were shooting at with the curtain down from the angle they were firing. So these are all the questions of that investigation. And as we reported earlier today, likely a grand jury will have to sort through in this case.",
