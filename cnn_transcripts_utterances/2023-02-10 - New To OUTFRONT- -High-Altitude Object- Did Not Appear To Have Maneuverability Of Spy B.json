The Military, right now, recovering a high-flying object, shot down, today, as we're getting new information, about what the Biden administration does, and does not, know, about the object.Plus, Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, cracking down on election crimes. But is there really an election crime problem? Guess what? We've got the numbers, and you will come to your own conclusion, I hope. And Congressman George Santos, accused of paying for puppies, with bad checks, worth more than $15,000. Seems like he may have gotten the puppies, they didn't get the money. I'm going to talk to a reporter, who spoke to the Amish puppy breeders, who say they were scammed. He went and met them. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I am Erin Burnett. Tonight, President Biden giving the go-ahead, for the U.S. Military, to take down another object, hovering high above the U.S., this time over Alaska. That object, said to be about the size of a car, they said it was a threat, to commercial aviation passenger jets. And tonight, our Phil Mattingly is reporting that one of the main reasons that President Biden decided to shoot the object down was well, it came less than a week, after the Chinese spy balloon was shot down. We're now learning the U.S. Military is in the process of recovering that mysterious object. So, let's get to Phil Mattingly. Because, Phil, I know you've got some new reporting, from the White House. You've been talking to your sources there.",

      "sentences": "Erin, I think, in talking to officials, over the course of the last several hours, there are two very striking elements here.The first is just how many unanswered questions remain, officials very candid about the fact that they still don't know what the object is. They can't identify it, affirmatively. They don't know what its capabilities are. They don't know its origin, whether it was state-owned or private- owned, although one official told me they haven't been given any indication, it was a state-owned object, like that Chinese spy balloon. And they also don't know why it was over U.S. airspace, to begin with. The other element here is just how quickly the decision was made, to shoot the object down, especially when compared to what we saw, with the Chinese spy balloon, which traversed across the United States, over a period of several days. And the reason here, the driving reason, according to officials, I've spoken to, is where this balloon, or where this object, was actually flying, where it was floating, however it was traversing, and that is at about 40,000 feet. That is at the top end of where commercial airliners usually fly. And while this is a sparsely-populated area, when it comes to airliners, that in the minds of U.S. officials, who had no concept of what this actually was, created a risk, an unacceptable risk, one official told me, when it came to how the Pentagon was viewing things, and what their recommendations were--",

They sent two separate efforts up, of fighter jets, to get a better look at what this actually was, to try and identify the object itself. Neither was conclusive. The recommendation to the President was to shoot the object down. The President made that order, earlier this morning. And it was shot down shortly before 2 PM. Another key element here, President -- the Canadian leader, Justin Trudeau, said he was briefed on the issue. He supported the decision to shoot it down. This was in the Alaska, in Canada border region. And so, you could see how this process kind of worked through and worked through very quickly. I would also note, my sources, on Capitol Hill, saying they have been informed, throughout this process, about this object. And so, it appears both in the timing how quickly decisions were made here--",

Major Lyons, let me just start with you, though. It's amazing, from Phil's reporting. What he's saying is that they don't know what it was, and they don't know what it wasn't. And they're not sure what it could do. And they're not sure who controlled it.

You'd need to pay a person money to do that. So, the question is, is there a job? Is there something for this person to do? So, here's the numbers. In Florida, 262 fraud complaints were filed, from the more than 11 million votes, cast in Florida, in 2020, which makes up, we'll do the math for you, 0.0024 percent of the total vote. Now, of those complaints, 75 of them were referred to law enforcement. So, that gets you down to point 0.0007 percent of the total vote. And ultimately, that led to 20 arrests. Let me get my glasses on. You read this, Scott? 0.0002 percent of the total vote. And then, one of those cases was dismissed by a judge, and I can't do the math there, but it's even smaller than point 0.0002 percent. OK. So, it's not just me giving you the numbers. Actually, DeSantis himself knows these numbers, because the day after the 2020 election, he bragged about how incredible the elections are in Florida. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

So, you can see this from the surveillance camera. Like I said, it's pretty hard to look at that. Then, here he is, in another video, you'll see Saakashvili there, in pain, falling out of his bed. Then, nurses in that facility rush in. He literally sort of disappears, before our eyes, in that video. And then, on the left, I'll show you something else. Saakashvili, this week, appearing, in a court hearing. It was virtual. Just through the screen, you can see his ribs and how thin he is. And that's on the other side of the screen how he looked in 2020, just before he was arrested. His lawyers say he's lost about 100 pounds. They've reported repeated abuse. And they have done DNA tests that they say show that he's been poisoned with mercury and arsenic. Those DNA tests have been done, by doctors, in the United States. The differences in these two pictures are very jarring and disturbing. It's important to see them though, because this is happening, right now, right? This is a person who, right now, tonight, is going through this. And it comes just days after the Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, said that Saakashvili is being slowly killed. He urged the world to come together to secure his release. Saakashvili's lawyers say this all comes back to one man and one man alone. And that man is Vladimir Putin. They say Saakashvili was arrested, and convicted, on trumped-up charges, of abuse of power, and that the pro-Putin Georgian Government is doing Putin's bidding. Saakashvili, of course, was a loud champion, for Georgia, on the world stage, and fought against Putin, when Putin invaded Georgia, spent the years, warning the world about him, including, right here on the show.
