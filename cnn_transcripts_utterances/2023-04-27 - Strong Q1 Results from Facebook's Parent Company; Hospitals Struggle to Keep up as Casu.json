I want to begin today's show with justreleased economic data out in the U.S. new numbers show the American economy growing at 1.1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter that is below the expectations of about 2 percent. And the slowest pace of growth since last spring. The report shows consumer spending is still strong but businesses are pulling back on spending as investors pour over the new data. U.S. Futures let's take a look here still pointing to a higher open after Wednesday's mixed session. Tech in the lead after strong earnings from Facebook Parent Company Meta, Europe mostly higher as banking giant Deutch Bank and Barclays post market friendly results higher close in Asia too investors looking ahead to tomorrow's highly important Japanese central bank policy statement its first policy pronouncement under its new chairman. Also in Asia Samsung shares finishing Thursday session slightly higher as well the South Korean tech giant promising a stronger second half after suffering a 95 percent first quarter profit drop due to the ongoing chip supply glut so much to get through today. Let's begin with the latest on the U.S. economy the world's largest economy is growing at a much slower pace. U.S. GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, missing expectations of 2 percent. Rahel Solomon joins us live now. So it certainly represents a slowdown here Rahel that is for sure. But it still shows just how resilient the American consumer really is, despite all of the price increases they're experiencing?",

      "sentences": "Well Zain, I think that's the absolutely most interesting point of this report, right that we're seeing a slowdown,and we can show you how this 1.1 annualized rate compares to the last few quarters. And make no mistake about it. This is a slowdown, but to your point Zain it's where we're seeing the slowdown, right? So we saw actually still positive contributions in terms of consumer spending, which I should point out powers about two thirds of the U.S. economy. So consumer spending is the backbone of U.S. GDP. And that was still a positive contribution. We saw exports increase, we saw federal government spending. Now on the opposite side where we saw a really meaningful deceleration it was things like a private inventory investment, you think about, for example, business investment, business inventory investment, non-residential fixed income that would include things like manufacturing plants, equipment and software. And so it's interesting that we're seeing a pretty market slowdown in terms of businesses in terms of business spending investment, but in terms of the U.S. consumer, we are still seeing in spite of, as you pointed out, the higher interest rates in spite of the high inflation, which is cooling, but still very high, consumers are still spending. So that really helped on the upside. But businesses on the other side are really pulling back as they prepare for what could be potentially a recession here in the U.S.",

One scenario is that actually, maybe itcontinues to coast along and its share price languishes is one financial portfolio manager told me yesterday, that is certainly a possibility. Because when you actually look under the hood of the report, which they were -- which they released earlier this week, profitability is a challenge for the bank. And that's what you're seeing reflected with its stock price. But deposits have stabilized. Customers have remained with the bank, although they have minimized they have lowered how much deposits they have within the bank. So this is really a concern about profitability for the bank, the spread between what they borrow and what they can earn, that is shrinking. And so that's what you're seeing reflected in the stock price. So they could languish here for quite some time they could potentially be put under the umbrella of a larger bank, which it has been before it's been under Bank of America before it's been under Merrill Lynch before that as a potential, perhaps another rescue package. There are so many scenarios being discussed right now. And it has a similar profile in many ways to SVB so that is really speaking clearly Investors and speaking as it had depositors Zain.",

And what shareholders really seem to be sort of tapping into here is that sales grew 3 percent in the first quarter of the year. It's the first time Meta sales have grown in nearly a year. And Meta's family of apps also posted 3.8 billion users up 5 percent year- over-year. And so I think you're starting to see Meta sort of come into this recovery process. Meta also lowered its expectations for expenses for the full year. And it said it expects revenue to grow again in the current quarter.

In Central Florida where Disney has its theme parks it has for the last 60 years operated essentially its own government there. It runs the water, the utilities, the streets, the sewers; everything is sort of under their purview. And that is sort of the covenant that that Disney in Florida came to 60 years ago when they first wanted to open this theme park here. Well, DeSantis in retribution for Disney speaking out that against the \"don't say gay law\" they actually took away some of those powers and said we're going to be in charge of this district. Well, Disney said, I don't think so let's take back some of those powers to the last minute. DeSantis found that out, and then they nullify those agreements.

And it is just across the river from Kherson where Russians say that they've been receiving some small attacks from the Ukrainians. Ukrainians say they've been having some successes, and striking just across the Dnipro River from Kherson. But the Mykolayiv strike two, rather four S 300 surface and this sales hitting at about 1 am in the morning, as you say one person killed 23 injured one of those injured a child. Again, this does appear to be Russia, potentially targeting those areas where it thinks Ukraine potentially could be building up forces for this re offensive operation that Russia believes Ukraine is preparing. And we've seen other indications. Again, not far from Kherson in the North of Crimea, which is sort of potentially one of those areas, the Russians could expect Ukrainian forces maybe to advance from the Kherson region across the Dnipro River along the coastline towards your North of Crimea and in the North of Crimea satellite images show that Russia appears to have pulled out its military hardware from a base. Satellite images were showing that that hardware artillery tanks as late as January and February this year, but a few weeks ago, satellite images showed that all that military hardware had gone. It's not clear why Russia has pulled that back? But it does seem to indicate that potentially, they think that Ukraine could advance along the coastline there near the North of Crimea and perhaps threaten that particular storage facility. Why Russia chooses to strike Mykolaiv again, when Kherson was being contested, going back to November last year, Mykolaiv was getting a lot of fire from the Russians. Are we seeing a sort of repeat of that? Not clear but at the moment -- at the moment those Russian strikes still very deadly.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): China has launched a diplomatic charm offensive with Latin America in recent months. In September, then Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Argentine counterpart at the U.N. General Assembly. Two months later, he sat down with Mexico's Foreign Minister at the G20 Leaders' Summit. And in January, President Xi himself delivered a video address a Latin American and Caribbean forum. China's influence in the region has grown so much and so fast that Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen felt compelled to visit Guatemala and Belize a week after Honduras severed ties with Taipei. A move Taiwan called very regrettable as the Honduran Foreign Minister traveled to Beijing to establish formal diplomatic ties. ROMO (on camera): Now only 13 countries in the world diplomatically recognize Taipei over Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, despite never having ruled it. Beijing refuses to maintain diplomatic ties with any country that recognizes Taiwan, among them Guatemala and Belize and in South America, Paraguay.

But there hasn't been enough discussion about working together and coming up with common standards, a common goals and even trying to open up coordination across countries. So that the countries that can address climate change most efficiently can bear a higher burden. And that can only be achieved by some sort of carbon pricing mechanism, where countries are seeing a similar price signal for what the cause and benefits are of climate change mitigation.",

Obviously, China's still healing or the region rather is still healing from the pandemic and China's zero COVID policy. Obviously, there are inflationary pressures on top of that. I mean, how do you ensure that Asian economies remain resilient, as resilient as possible in the face of all of those headwinds?",

And we are actually predicting pretty resilient growth of4.8 percent this year and 4.8 percent next year in developing Asia compared to 4.2 percent last year. Now, that's not quite as high as the even higher rates of growth that were being posted by the region before the pandemic, but it's pretty resilient cover recovery. At the same time, you're right there, there are major global headwinds, a lot of the risks are still related to the Western Central Bank's efforts to control inflation. They're still of course concern that the Fed could become hawkish if they're really tried to bring inflation down to low target levels like 2 percent. And there's also been recent banking turmoil we've seen most recently with another likely failed bank in the United States, which puts pressure on the overall financial system because it makes credit conditions much tighter. And this could have negative effects as well on the region.",

Thatreflects the very sharp shift away from the zero COVID policy. And this has important spillovers to other countries in the region, because China is becoming an increasingly important part of supply chain relationships. Chinese tourists also have not been traveling to other regions in Asia; we estimate that about 18 percent of tourists that go to Asian countries before the pandemic are coming from China. And so the Chinese tourists coming back on the scene will provide a boost to the region but especially economies that rely more on tourism like Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines for example.",

So of course, this was an eventful visit, I mean, everything from the Americans rather promising a much greater demonstration of military might in the Indo-Pacific sort of deterred North Korea, on top of that, to South Korea, promising not to develop their own nuclear weapons. But I have to ask you about that really sort of touching moment of President Yoon singing American Pie. What a charming moment?",
