So, they want to make sure that they get all those people out and get them back together with their loved ones, or are taking people off campus and taking them to the convention center, where they can reunite with the people that they have there. But when you listen to some of the accounts of what was going on, they -- students that we have seen, saying that they were -- knowing that this was not a drill, that the indications came to them very clearly that they were to run, hide and fight -- that is what they were tweeting to the students and messaging to the students from UNLV, to let them know that they needed to do that. Some students were hearing glass shattering. Some hearing gunfire. Many of them locking themselves in the classrooms just trying to stay safe as best they could and move to the other side of the classroom. All of that going on while it was unclear. We do know that they started about 11:45 in the morning local time. Then, by about 45 minutes later is when we heard from local authorities telling us that they were, in fact, done with an actual threat and that they were just processing the scene. But now, getting this word now that there are three dead, and one in critical condition at a local hospital. That's where things stand right now, Erin.",

Columbine was the lesson to run. The students -- most of the students were put into the cafeteria, or the library, and that's where most of them died. If you can get out, you run.

You have a whole city essentially under lockdown. You've got the strip closed down. The airport stopped flights. And so, you have everyone reacting. And so, I understand that they may not know everything. But I think the American public, and certainly these communities, are mature enough, and can understand saying things like we have at least this many, or we are not concerned about this, but we are concerned about this. Look, the police came out and said that there was no threat anymore. So, we have to assume that they knew that this was a single gunman or gunwoman, who perpetrated this. They don't know the motive.

Republicans say they will not accept any watered down approach with dealing with immigration, an intractable issue, and one that Republicans and Democrats have failed to agree on for decades. So, the fear is that given the Republican insistence that something needs to be done on the border, that a Democratic resistance to going anywhere near where the Republicans are going, that -- this ultimately will lead to the collapse of Ukraine aid. And complicating matters, too, is that there is just staunch demands among the new speaker of the House to ensure that there is no watered down version of the immigration policy included as part of this deal. And Johnson himself has called for each of these pieces in the emergency aid packages to Israel and Ukraine to be approved individually. Democrats and the White House wanted all to be tied together. But first, they need to agree on the policy and they are nowhere near getting a deal on the policy, Erin. So the concern is that congress may leave for the holidays without aiding Ukraine, and even as the White House warns that it is needed now, otherwise, it will be kneecapped in its war against Russia -- Erin.",
