But right now the world is on edge as we await President Biden to speak. He is in Hanoi, Vietnam. And we have been waiting for some time for him to come out and take questions from reporters in a press conference that was originally scheduled for an hour and a half ago.But we are still waiting with baited breath for President Biden to talk about his trip. Let me bring in the panel to discuss some of the things that we're expecting to hear from him. Beth Sanner, what did you think President Biden's -- we hear in his re-election campaign how he has united the Western world to take on the threat of Russia. And to an extent, it is accurate to say that NATO is more united than ever before. In fact, it has new members. I think Putin is probably at least as responsible for that as President Biden. But President Biden does get good marks for his leadership of NATO. But it's also true, I think it's fair to say, that China is a much greater threat to the United States than Russia, don't you think?",

So I think that these kinds of things, that these alliances and this trip to Vietnam is absolutely essential to dealing with China as Representative McCaul said. So this -- I think that you have to give a lot of credit honestly tothe Biden administration. There were no alliances of any consequence during the Trump administration. So, I hope that no matter what happens in our election, that we don't squander these alliances. These alliances are absolutely crucial to countering China and they need to be nurtured and built.",

I've spent more time than many other world leader has sum total over the last 12 years, and so I hope I get to see him again soon. But, no, look, for example, one of the things we did in India, we provided for a new path that's going to save everybody money, increase the third world -- the global south capacity to grow by sending -- we're going to have a new railroad from India all the way across to the Mediterranean shipping lanes and pipelines across the Mediterranean, through Europe up into Great Britain and beyond.That's all about economic growth. That's nothing to do with hurting China or helping China. It has to do with dealing with everything from climate change to making sure that these countries can succeed economically and grow. Look, my thesis has been from the beginning, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy, invest in your people. Invest in the people. Give them a chance. Everything is better off when people -- I know it's going to sound trite, if everybody in the world had a job, they get up in the morning, they wanted to go to, and they could put three squares on the table for their family no matter where they live, the whole world would be better off. We'd be a lot better. That is the notion here behind this. For example, you know, one of the things that we're doing in terms of -- I proposed a long time ago at the G7, now it's going to come to fruition in the G20, is making sure that we build a railroad all the way across the African continent. Think about it. There is no way to cross the African continent by road -- by rail. And there's not even direct highway across. Now let's assume for the sake of decision, we talk about food shortages. Assume there was one country in that vast continent that had an excess of food stuffs and resources, how would they get to where they're going to go? How are they going to do it? That's why we're also going to invest billions of dollars in solar facilities in Angola, to have the largest -- the largest solar facility in the world, or one of the largest. That helps Angola. But it also helps the whole region. So I think we think too much in terms of cold war terms. It is not about that. It is about generating economic growth and stability in all parts of the world.

We are into the second hour because of President Biden's press conference. And I am here with the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas. Chairman McCaul, first, I want to get your reaction to the fact that the G20 communique is weaker this year than last year when it comes to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Obviously, Russia is a member of the G20 and blocked it. Last year, the diplomatic situation was different so that Russia just disagreed with that part of the communique. Ukraine responded today by saying that the G20 has nothing to be proud of because this communique specifically does not condemn what Russia is doing in Ukraine. What is your response? What do you think? REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R), CHAIRMAN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: I agree with Ukraine. Yes, last year at the G20, they basically said that, you know, there is a path forward for Ukraine to join NATO after security agreements, after the war is over. This year they're saying, there is no Russian aggression, a major departure from last year, and a real slap in the face to Zelenskyy, as they're conducting the counteroffensive.

And the only way we can stop that is through deterrence. Deterrence in diplomacy and deterrence in weapon systems that we have yet to put into the country that I signed off on. So, if you have a lack of military deterrence, a lack of diplomatic deterrence and you're economically saying, we want to work with you, what deterrence does Chairman Xi have in his mind that would prevent him from making that bold move to take and invade Taiwan, put a blockade in, cut the sea cable and then take over TSMC, by the way, that is 90 percent of the advanced semiconductor chip manufacturing for the world? This is a wrong message to send. It was not one of deterrence. And, once again, like with Afghanistan, he's projecting weakness which will draw aggression. TAPPER: I want to get to Afghanistan in a second.

There are, you know, $7 billion of weapons and I can show you the tapes of the weapons and the cache that were left behind. Ned Price, you know, the State Department, making rosy comments. And we need to -- you know, we sent letters to they have them testify, all giving a rosy picture while at the same time what was happening on ground was very different. I don't know where this is going to end, Jake, but as a former federal prosecutor, I'm going to follow all the facts. I'm not out to take -- you know, I have great respect for General McKenzie and General Milley, by the way. I don't know if any of this actually went up to their level. But I do know that an air strike was denied that could have taken out the suicide bombing team of ISIS-K. That was led out of Bagram, by the way.",

These are majors and lieutenant colonels and colonels and admirals and generals in the Senate because he opposes to a Pentagon travel reimbursement policy having to do with abortion.

Well, there was a heavy emphasis, Jake, on foreign policy here and in particular on China as the president has been making a series of moves in the region intended to try and counterbalance China's influence in the region, no less than here in Vietnam, where the president upgraded that relationship with Vietnam to the highest level of diplomatic relations in this country.And what the president tried to say very clearly was that he is not trying to contain China. And throughout this news conference the president really tried to send that message to China. To say that even as he is shoring up and strengthening these partnerships in the region, not only in Vietnam but also in India, as it relates to the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, really a whole of region effort by the president, he wanted to make clear, I am not looking to hurt China, he said. And he even said that he wants China to do well. He believes the world does better when China does well. And it was as if the president who we've seen dispatch his top cabinet officials over these last several months to Beijing, to try and normalize relations, to re-establish military to military communications unsuccessfully so far. It was as if the president was trying to coach Xi Jinping back into a more productive relationship. But so far that effort has not succeeded in large part because China really rejects the world order as it currently stands and doesn't want to play by the same rules of the game. Nonetheless, the president seems eager to continue to push on that front even as he strengthens those relationships. Now, there's no question that the White House was carefully selecting the questions here today and there was a heavy emphasize on foreign policy. We didn't get a chance to hear the president talk. He got a question on the war in Ukraine. He did not actually answer it. And we did not get a chance to ask the president more politically pointed questions related to his reelection. As you know, Jake, this has been a significant moment in the president's reelection campaign over the last couple of weeks as we've seen his poll numbers, really low approval ratings, about six in 10 Americans disapproving of his job as president. And the question is, does today's performance, does this trip at all help move the needle for the president? We heard him repeatedly talk about all of the travel that he's doing, trying to show that vitality. But at the end, Jake, he also ended the news conference by saying, I'm going to bed. Look, no question, these are exhausting, exhausting trips but I don't know that that's necessarily the message that the White House wanted to send to close out this news conference.",

It is a positive message for the global south and for these fence-sitting countries and even for many of our allies like South Korea and Japan that don't want us to try to contain China.And so, that positive message of, you know, he wants China to succeed is -- it is not exactly music to the ears of the Republicans here in the states. But, you know, if you're sitting in that region and most of your trade is with China and China generates over 30 percent of the global GDP, it is a fact that it is important. But at the same time, I think, it is a little unfair of Representative McCaul to say that, you know, talking about not wanting to contain China, it isn't a good thing to say. I mean, frankly, the Chinese believe and all of the statements coming out, even after the Raimondo trip, is about how the United States is containing China. So, maybe Biden's -- TAPPER: Beth, we're still having problems with your connection there. Tim Naftali, how much does foreign policy matter when it comes to the United States elections?",
