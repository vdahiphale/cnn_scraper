I'm Bianca Nobilo, and if you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel back to the Middle East this week, and it comes as talks about freeing the remaining hostages held in Gaza are underway. And about 400 prisoners of war are headed home after a major prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine. Around 200 troops from each side were released on Wednesday. President Zelenskyy says about half of the released Ukrainians took part in the battle for the city of Mariupol in the early days of the war. And the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a $78 billion bipartisan tax package. The bill would temporarily expand the child tax credit and restore several business tax benefits. This measure now moves to the Senate. And the FBI director has issued an ominous warning to U.S. lawmakers, and that's that Chinese hackers are getting ready to, quote, wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to the United States by targeting essential infrastructure. Details from CNN's Brian Todd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The FBI director was blunt and dire with his warnings. Americans have paid far too little attention, Christopher Wray says, to what he calls a multi-pronged assault on U.S. national and economic security by Chinese hackers.",

That's what the Chinese are doing.TODD (voice-over): U.S. officials have been on to the Chinese hackers and have been trying to head them off. CNN reporting that the FBI and the Justice Department, using a court order, have taken steps to protect hundreds of devices in the U.S., devices connected to infrastructure that are being targeted by Beijing's hackers. Steps including removing malicious code from those devices. But the Chinese hackers are still believed to be deeply entrenched in U.S. infrastructure, and security officials say that's partly America's fault. JEN EASTERLY, DIRECTOR, U.S. CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY: The truth is the Chinese cyber actors have taken advantage of very basic flaws in our technology. We've made it easy on them. TODD (voice-over): How have Chinese hackers been let in the door to America's plants, pipelines, and servers?",

TODD (voice-over): What U.S. officials now fear, that if China invades Taiwan and the U.S. tries to respond militarily, the Chinese hacking efforts could hinder that response.",

One person posted, quote: Resisting the urge to tell Elmo that I am kind of sad. While another wrote: I'm at my lowest, thanks for asking.

Earlier on in the show, we were talking about social media and its impact on children and teenagers in particular. And I've read a lot of studies that have talked about how even though these platforms are meant to connect us to other people, that obviously they don't have that actual impact on our brain and our physical health. Is it true that we are living in a more perilous and difficult time for people's mental health because of technology in the modern world? Or is it just that everybody tends to think that their time is the toughest in some ways?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, yeah, it's a great question and one we're wrestling with. And certainly, we know that if online spaces are safer and there's less toxic, hateful or abusive behavior, that's a safer place to be. And I think what Elmo shows us is that actually, technology is neutral. It depends on us how we use it, what kind of purpose it serves in our lives.Social media, for the first time in human history, can connect us to people outside the 150 people that are in our immediate orbit. And that does have a positive part to play in terms of reminding us that our personal experiences, maybe we're not the only ones living through that or thinking that or feeling that. So, the power of solidarity is one of the positive things that social media can provide. And I think we've said for a long time that social media can be a put force for good, but it also needs to be used safely, proportionally, and it can also have a negative impact on our mental health, like many things.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, that's excellent.So, when I think about people responding to posts, or for example, Elmo asking people how they are, is it a function of modern society and how healthy is it that people do feel perhaps that it's easier to respond to that through typing or posting a comment that it might be to sit down with a best friend or a colleague and say, actually, I'm struggling?",

    {
      "timeStamp": "04:45:05",

      "sentences": "Right, and so we often talk about, you know, helping people to understand, if you imagine your mental health is like a glass of water, how high is that water and what could you do? And when we experience poor mental health, it's when that water floods out. So, part of the conversation is how to reduce the distress and how to cope with the difficult feelings.But part of it is how do you make that glass bigger, collectively and individually, and so that we can contain what we feel. And I think a really significant part of that is naming the good things. But when you're struggling, it's really difficult to also have a conversation about what should I be grateful for? And that's often something that you feel guilty about. And I think sometimes we just need a space to own the difficult and negative and someone to hear that and name it before we move on to the positive. And so, I think what Elmo showed was that there's not enough space to just be real about our inner experiences. And so, we do need space for that.",

    {
      "timeStamp": "04:45:05",
      "speaker": "ROWLAND",
      "sentences": "Yes, that's a great point. Probably the first thing is that we need to feel safe in order to have good mental health. And so ways in which you can help offer safety or provide safety to yourself is really important.And spotting, we're not always good at spotting, actually we're safer than we think. And I think reminding our brains that we've got more support. And so the second thing is like reaching out to people, who are you going to connect with and who are you going to offer that connection to is something that will always strengthen. And then identifying shame in our lives and not allowing shame to prevent us from being able to share what we experience. And shame is such a big driver of the suppression of what we feel. So, I would say get safe, connect and don't let shame dominate your life or be in the driving seat.",
