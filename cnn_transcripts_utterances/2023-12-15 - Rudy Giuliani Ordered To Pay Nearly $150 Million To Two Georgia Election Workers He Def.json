How an operation in Gaza went so tragically wrong? Also, the autopsy results just in from Matthew Perry, what authorities say ketamine had to do with the Friends actor's death. Doctor Sanjay Gupta is here to break it down. I'm Kaitlan Collins, and this is THE SOURCE. An already hash strapped Rudy Giuliani is now in ruins for trying to destroy the lives of 2 Americans in Georgia who simply were doing their patriotic duty in November of 2020. A federal jury has now ordered Giuliani to pay Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss a $148 million for defaming them, for their emotional distress and also for punitive damages. The amount was so astonishing that there was an audible gasp in the courtroom today as it was read. The jury having none of it from Donald Trump's one time lawyer for wrongfully, repeatedly, and viciously accusing an innocent mother and her daughter of tampering with votes in 2020. Almost just as breathtaking, he is still doing so to this very day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's a lot of creditors, here's a lot of people who Rudy Giuliani owes money to, and there will be more because there's civil suits outstanding against him from the voting technology, from Dominion, from Smartmatic.

The man who graced the cover of Time Magazine as a, \"Tower of strength.\" He was once one of the most popular politicians in this country. At one point the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. But these days, of course, you can now see it as a mere illusion of what he once was. Rudy Giuliani not the same. An illusion of a once celebrated legal mind who marked the opening scene of Trump's post 2020 election spiral, the infamous press conference outside the Four Seasons. No, not the luxury hotel, the local landscaping company. The connection between his reputation and the fate of the former president became so intertwined, that Giuliani stood in front of the soon to be mob on Capitol Hill on the ellipse on January 6, repeating election lie after election lie for a man who would later, and still at this moment, refuse to help pay his legal bills. Giuliani is now left paying that price all alone today. It got a lot higher. I want to bring in Andrew Kirtzman who has covered Rudy Giuliani extensively for three decades and is the author of a very timely book, \"Giuliani: The Rise and Tragic Fall of America's Mayor.\" Andrew, I mean, it's just hard to kind of put into perspective, just how far of a fall from grace we are truly witnessing. Do you think Giuliani, based on how you saw him coming out of court today, has any grasp of that? ANDREW KIRTZMAN, AUTHOR, \"GIULIANI: THE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF AMERICA'S MAYOR\": You know, if Giuliani were an introspective person, which he is not, he would be asking himself tonight about some of the choices he made. The choices he made, beginning with his extraordinary fame after September 11, when he was more popular than the Pope, according to polls, when he was making astonishing amounts of money, cashing in on his fame, when he ran for president and it was the front runner for an entire year before that race happened. What was the choice he made after he lost that race, after he had to lead that race in humiliation, having just accumulated just one delegate? His choice was to align himself with Donald Trump. Every humiliation he's had since then, every disaster that Rudy Giuliani has had since then -- the fact that he is now headed for bankruptcy, the fact that he is a national laughingstock, the fact that he's headed for -- towards a criminal trial that can lead him to jail. It's all traceable, to choices Rudy Giuliani made. And particularly the choice he made to align himself with Donald Trump.

These three hostages, Alon Shimriz, Yotam Haim were kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Samer Talalka was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Am on October 7th. Israel says, it believes that they there had escaped their captors or they had been left behind, because the fighting that was happening in Northern Gaza when this happened.I'm joined now by retired U.S. Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. General, it is hard to overstate how devastating and gut wrenching this news is for these families who have just been in constant pain since October 7th. I think the question everyone has tonight is how does this even happen? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the first thing you have to realize is that combat like this is not a video game. Lives are at stake. There's immense chaos, smoke, rubble, and Israeli forces and Hamas are firing each other, engaging as a matter of routine. So it's like conducting a gunfight in an elevator. Tragedies like this occur and it's frankly not surprising. You have rules of engagement, you have collateral damage, estimates that are -- that take place as a part of the planning process. And there are limits their boundaries in terms of go, no go criteria; shoot, no shoot criteria. But when you're in this type of close quarters, these tragedies will occur.",

This is close combat that's taking place. And the identification of friend or foe in this environment is the number one priority. It's the number one challenge that has to be met as a matter of routine. Again, decisions are made in split seconds. You have the right as a force, for self-protection, force protection. You want to return with your soldiers with your comrades. And you engage in a fight like this, these kinds of mistaken identities, this positive identification challenge is what remains paramount. It is -- Kaitlan it is -- I can't overstate how difficult this fight is. And what you've really done -- and to your credit, is you put the human face of combat that we're seeing right now. Again, these are not antiseptic engagements. These are human beings that were uniform. They're trying to conduct an operation for purposes clearly stated.

The Los Angeles Medical Examiner's Office says he died as a result of an acute effect of ketamine, along with other contributing factors, including drowning.CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta has taken a look at this autopsy and is here now. Sanjay, just -- can you just as a doctor, walk us through what stood out to you in this autopsy and whether this was an overdose of ketamine or what they found from this? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I mean, it's a 30 page report. So there's a lot in there that's mostly talking about what did not happen, what did not contribute to his death. What they really focused in on, as you mentioned, was the fact that he had ketamine, in his body. They found elements of ketamine in his stomach. And they said that that was sort of the one of the primary causes along with the fact that he was in a pool and had drowned. Those are the things that really stood out to me. We looked at specifically the dose of ketamine that he had in his in his blood. And it was pretty high. It was -- you know, you can see the numbers, they're in the 3,000 range. And to give you some context for what that means, ketamine can be used as an anesthetic, Kaitlan, and the range can be from 1,000 to 6,000. But here's the important thing is that, ketamine in and of itself is very rarely associated with someone overdosing and dying, unlike opioids, for example, which suppress your ability to breathe on your own. That's not ketamine does. It dissociate you from your environment and from your own body. So it's not really that associated with someone dying. But in his case, he was in a swimming pool. So someone becomes dissociated, they become -- can lapse into unconsciousness. And if they're in a pool, they can they can drown, which is -- I think that's really what jumped out at me. So high doses, elements found in his stomach, which meant that he -- you know, you can inject this, you can snort it, you can swallow it. Sounds like he swallowed it. Takes usually a half an hour to an hour to take effect. He got into the pool at some point after taking this ketamine, and sounds like that that's what caused him to drown.",

And it's actually even though it's a synthetic opioid, is used typically to help people get off stronger opioids. It sort of binds to the same receptors as opioids, but it's a lower sort of power drug, so it can actually help people sort of wean off the more powerful opioids.We don't know if this was part of his addiction treatment, because as you as you mentioned, he's been very open about his addiction. And sometimes that can be used to treat addiction. It can also be used recreationally to sort of dampen the effects -- the hallucinogenic effects of ketamine. People who use these drugs recreationally will sometimes use it for that. But I think the really important point -- the salient point here is, if you look at these medications, it doesn't seem like the buprenorphine really contributed to it. I'd looked at the levels, they were more in the therapeutic range, as you say, as opposed to sort of a lethal or more toxic range.",

To this day, no one has been able to find this binder, which was considered so sensitive. It was kept in a locked safe at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia were the only those with top secret security clearance could actually see it.But sources tell CNN that in Trump's final days in office, the former President ordered that that binder be brought to the White House. He wanted to declassify what was known as the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into his 2016 campaign and Russia connections. Trump believing that it would prove his claims it was all a hoax. His order set off a flurry of activity in those final two days of his time in the White House, aides scrambling to redact the intelligence. That made multiple copies of the redacted portions. While the original, unredacted 10-inch thick binder, which could potentially reveal critical sources and methods of collecting that intelligence, inexplicably disappeared.
