You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.New figures just out show violent crime is on the decline across the United States, what might be the biggest annual decline ever. The FBI reports violent crime from January to March, dropped more than 15 percent compared to the same period last year. Murders down more than 26 percent, rapes decreased more than 25 percent. The U.S. murder rate has been dropping since 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic brought a surge in homicides 30 percent across the country. Criminal justice experts say it's surprising where only now starting to see the level of gun violence returning to pre-pandemic levels. To China now where four academic staff members with Iowa's Cornell College have been stabbed in broad daylight. The attack happened in a public park in Jilin in China's northeast. Let's get the latest details down from CNN's Kristie Lu Stout live in Hong Kong. Here's the thing, there are a lot of expats working in the education sector in China, about a third of expats work in the education sector. That 400,000 that's since 2017. So what do we know about this attack and how terrifying must it be for those who're actually working in the education sector? Do we know anything about a motive? Were they targeted? What are the details?",

      "sentences": "Yes. No news on motive just yet, very terrifying incident. And also we should point out that such violent crimes against foreigners, let alone foreign educators, are extremely rare in China.[01:34:43] STOUT: Now this is what we know. Four educators from Iowa's Cornell College. They are wounded after a stabbing took place. They were visiting a park in Jilin City in the country's northeast. And we have video of the aftermath. Let's bring it up for you. In this video, its been circulating on social media. You see three wounded people lying on the ground. This is in Beishan Park, a public park in Jilin City. They are covered in blood and they're waiting for first responders and one of them, the man in the blue shirt is pressing his hand on the back of his waist. The three are conscious, they're awake and they're using their smartphones to reach out to others. Now, we've also learned that the brother of one of the wounded Americans David Zabner, says that his brother is quote, \"doing well\". Now, the condition of the other three this hour is unknown. And again, there were no reports of a motive. Now, the president of Cornell College said that the foreign China's part of a partnership with a local university Beishan University and in a statement to CNN, this is what the president said. Jonathan Brand saying this quote, \"We have been in contact with all four instructors and we are assisting them during this time.\" Brand says that they were with a faculty member of the partner university Beishan University when the stabbing took place, and there were no students taking part in this program. Now, we also heard from an Iowa Representative Ashley Hinson, who on social media, so that the four were quote, \"brutally stabbed\". On the social platform X, she said this -- let's bring up the post for you. She said she's horrified that multiple Cornell College faculty members were brutally stabbed in China. Our team has been communication with Cornell College and will do everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely. Join me in praying for their health and safety,\" unquote. The U.S. State Department meanwhile, is aware of the reports of the stabbing incident and is monitoring the situation. Now, China has low rates of violent crime, violent crimes against foreigners are rare. Guns are strictly controlled and out of reach for most in China so knives when used, have become the most common weapon used in mass assault. And this incident, the stabbing incident in Jilin City also comes at a very delicate time for U.S.-China relations. These two countries are seeking to strengthen what they call people to people exchanges, including student exchanges at a time of deep tension. It was earlier, it was September of last year during the APEC summit when we heard from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and he announced plans to invite 50,000 young Americans to go to China in the next five years. And although no American students were targeted in Beishan Park in this stabbing incident, this is indeed casting a chill and could discourage students from -- especially students from America, from going to China.

According to the Mexican government, almost 90 percent of the country is facing some form of drought conditions. In the north, thousands of dead fish were found in a lagoon where water levels are now dangerously low. And as the U.S. braces for what's expected to be a very active hurricane season, the country's disaster relief agency could be out of money before its even over. A new report suggests FEMA is facing a budget shortfall of more than $1.3 billion.

That additional four brings our total so far this year up to $11 billion disasters.Comparing during that to the previous year, we ended up with 28 total for the entire 12-month timeline. But we are currently on pace to make it very close, if not possibly being higher than that number from last year. One of the biggest drivers of these disasters was a lot of the severe weather that took place not only in May but also in April. In fact, the stretch of April through May, we ended up with 801 tornado reports. That is the second most since 1950. When you look at tornadoes specifically, the reports just since January 1st, we've had over 1,100. Yes, this is a busy time of year, but even with that said, the average would only be right around the 800 mark. So it's definitely a busier year than normal. In fact, even compared to a lot of the other years, so far, we are just behind 2011 coming in second place. Now, one thing to note is that May traditionally is when you end up seeing the most of those tornadoes followed by June and April, respectively. So this time of year is when we normally would see it. It's just a little bit higher than usual. The big concern is going forward over the next few months because there is a concern whether or not FEMA will run out of money for these natural disasters because hurricane season specifically is now upon us and its expected to be an incredibly busy one. Looking at the numbers, the official forecast from NOAA calling for 17 to 25 named storms, the average is only 14; 8 to 13 of those are expected to be hurricanes. In an average year, you would only have 7. Another concern in the coming months is heat. Thanks to climate change, it's been a big driver in a lot of these increased heat waves and for some of these areas we're already starting to see a very early start to that heat. Take, for example, Phoenix and also Las Vegas, both of which have already had 12 consecutive days of triple-digit temperatures. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is what you saw from ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft and Meta the past few years.

The consumer of 2025 is going to essentially want an A.I. phone, a phone that could do things on behalf of the user. So they set to work on re-architecting the very foundation of its core operating systems for the phone, the iPad, and the Mac to really leverage A.I. and a big part of that is what they announced today. That's Apple intelligence. It's a suite of A.I. features that essentially add A.I. and generative A.I. features to all of the different parts of your iPhone from the voice memos app to the phone app, to messages to your notifications.
