I think one of the things we're trying to figure out right now is, what actually happens to Prigozhin's forces, to the Wagner group that has been so critical for Russia's efforts up to this point? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED): Yes, all we know that they -- they were here, Rostov-on-Don. Where they started their insurgency, where their mutiny got to a certain spot up - up along the road and threatened Moscow. But now we really don't know what's going to make of them, that they have great equipment, they've got great tanks, they have planes, they have - they have to be fed, they have to be watered. So, we're not really sure what happens. I don't see them joining the regular Russian forces in Ukraine, or in -- on those front lines there. These are not those kind of troops. They're not interested in getting anymore into the fight. They've been out of Bakhmut, this area here, they've been out of there for about six to eight weeks right now.

There's significant bands of defensive operations there with mines, with trenches, all the things. We - they're going to need likely more equipment, things to help them clear there. But they've got to find out where those weak spots are and make sure that they can exploit them because they don't have air superiority.They're doing a counteroffensive very much hamstrung. They need -- and then the second - the second thing is, bring in more of those western tanks and that equipment that's going to help their troops survive. Survivability of their forces right now is number one. They don't want to do it, make the mistake Russia did by putting their troops in harm's way unnecessarily.",

And in this new data that we're seeing from a diabetes conference over the weekend, they're actually yielding the same amount of weight loss as Wegovy, about 15 percent.
