      "sentences": "Good evening.We begin tonight, Keeping Them Honest, the Biden administration is sending 1,500 more active duty troops to the border with Mexico. The move is aimed at freeing up resources so Customs and Border Patrol officers can cope with the expected surge of migrants when a Trump-era policy expires next week. The policy is called Title 42 and it allows authorities to quickly expel certain migrants using the COVID pandemic as a reason. The new troops will join 2,500 others who were sent to the border last fall, because clearly there is a problem. But there isn't not now and not for decades is a comprehensive solution, at least not one that enough people in both parties can get behind. The administration tried sending a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress on day one, January 20, 2021. That went nowhere. So instead, like so many others before him, President Biden has taken a series of far smaller steps while trying to paint those limited measures in the best possible light. which raises a question, when does selling a policy veer into overselling it? Case in point this exchange yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is going to continue to do that. In the meantime, he has put forth some -- he has tools that he has used to make sure that we do this, we actually deal with the immigration system in a humane way, in a way that is -- that actually deals with what we're seeing at the border and that's why you've seen the parolee program be so successful.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEAN-PIERRE: So I was speaking to the parolee program, as you know, the president put in place a parolee program to deal with to deal with certain countries, on ways that we can limit illegal migration.

And as you can see by the blue line on the chart, it has substantially reduced the number of migrants from those countries stopped on the southwest border while here unlawfully.But Keeping Them Honest, that 90 percent drop she mentioned only referred to one of those four countries, Venezuela. When it comes to all nationalities not just the four border encounters, the four border encounters as you can see, again, represented by the blue line, though, take a sharp dip earlier this year are now running roughly on par with the same time a year ago, more than 1.2 million from last October through March, and that's not a story the administration wants to highlight. We should note, we invited the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre to come on the program tonight, she declined. CNN's Phil Mattingly joins us now with some new reporting about what's been happening behind the scenes at the White House.

They plan to put their own expansive immigration legislation on the floor next week.Now, it's immigration legislation that Democrats have already panned and said they will not support. Even Republicans have had a tough time coalescing in the House around the legislation, but it is legislation that would include sharper restrictions on the asylum program, it would restart the building of the border wall, significant funding for technology and personnel. I think the question right now is, each side has always had their own proposals dealing with some of their intra party issues as they put them together, what they've never been able to do is actually reconcile those proposals. And there just is no sign right now given how hot this is, as a political issue, given the reality of what's been happening on the border throughout the course of President Biden's two plus years in office, that there is any resolution anytime soon. Now, there was at the end of last year, some hope that perhaps a bipartisan compromise could come together. There was one that was put on the table, that didn't actually make it across the finish line and there is no sign at this point in time, particularly with Republicans that control the House that is going to happen anytime soon.",

There is no other way to get around it, Anderson. Without a legislative solution, this is the reality. There are tweaks, there are rule changes that can be made. Many of those rule changes that the President and his team have made have upset Democratic allies, including Senator Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was extremely critical of the decision today to send US troops down there. But this is the system that they're working within and when you put the political constraints with those policy issues, and all you have are problems -- Anderson.",

Well, here's the answer. FEMA money only allows the city of El Paso to help individuals who have turned themselves into border authorities and have been processed in some sort of way. The problem, Anderson, is that a lot of the individuals here got frustrated in Mexico and crossed into the country illegally, and the city really can't help them.",

I talked to one resident today who put it this way. He said, you know, they're really tired of Governor Abbott spending billions of taxpayer dollars to send troops to the border, to send more police officers to the border. They are also tired with the Biden administration, because they say that there really is and has been no solution. And the reason why I want to point this out, here, where I'm at is because this resident told me, look, the American people, the American taxpayer is paying billions of dollars, the Texas taxpayers are paying billions of dollars to secure the border and what are you looking at around me? Hundreds of migrants who are still crossing the border, and that's their point. Sending troops, sending more police officers, those are Band-Aids.

Here's what she sounded like. Here's how I interpreted it. What was interesting is Birnbach said she told Carroll at the time that what she was hearing about was clearly a rape, but she said at the time, Carroll, she didn't want to see it in those terms. She still saw it as a fight or as a tussle, but her account is definitely something that can bolster Carroll's case. But defense attorneys on cross-examination tried to highlight her dislike of Trump. Pointing to posts that she's made -- that make it clear that politically, she's not a fan of Trump. Now, as you know, that the jury also heard from Jessica Leeds, who alleges that she was assaulted on a plane in the 1970s by Trump. She said that she was upgraded to first class, seated next to Trump, and that he allegedly tried to kiss her and grope her. Now, Trump has denied those allegations, but her testimony is part of an effort by Carroll's attorneys to establish that her allegations are part of a pattern, of alleged behavior by Former President Trump.",

In a moment, I'll speak with John Walsh, who knows a lot about manhunts like these, he's the former host of America's Most Wanted.First, CNN's Josh Campbell joins us. What have you learned? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Anderson, the big breaking news now, after this days long manhood for the suspect that was accused of killing five people, including a nine-year-old boy there in Cleveland, Texas, three law enforcement sources tell me that he is now in custody. Francisco Oropeza, 38 years old, a Mexican national who had been on the run for several days and being hunted by hundreds of law enforcement officers here in the United States, as well as in Mexico, one source telling me, was arrested in the area with a town called Cut and Shoot Texas, which is about 17 miles from the area of Cleveland where this brutal murder occurred. Again, authorities had been fanning out across that area trying to find this suspect. The reward that was announced by the FBI as well as a host of other federal and local law enforcement agencies, was up to some $80,000. But the big breaking news now which will come as a great relief to many members there of the South Texas community is that this suspect is now in custody. Of course, the questions that come afterwards is how was he able to go on the run for so long? There was a question, Anderson, about whether he would flee into Mexico. We know that sources had told me that border patrol officers on both sides of the border had been on alert just in case he tried to flee back into Mexico. He had been back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico at least five times. But it looks as though he didn't get that far as we've seen in so many of these manhunts where suspects will, you know, stay relatively close to the area where they are. Again, after this dayslong manhunt found some 17 miles away from the area of Cleveland, the suspect now in custody, Anderson.",

I -- my guess was he was trying to make it to the border because as you know, on the Mexican side, there are no border agents or, you know, customs or immigration. I guess maybe he didn't hook up with a cartel or get somebody to drive him across the border. But we've chased guys for years. You and I have been talking about this. I've caught, I think, 47 guys in Mexico where Mexican people themselves would do the right thing and make the call. But he's dangerous.
