Right now, homeowners just beginning to clean up after the severe storms ripped across parts of the central U.S. overnight tearing up homes and businesses. At least nine tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma and Kansas, while wind gusts equivalent to a category 3 hurricane, about 120 miles an hour, battered Texas. Police in Norman, Oklahoma, say that at least 12 people were injured. We are going to take you there for the latest in a moment. Plus, the U.S. is warning China that it is going to face stiff consequences if Beijing goes ahead and gives weapons, including drones and ammunition, to Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. This as at least two Ukrainian worker were killed amid a fresh wave of Russian drone attacks. Those weapons, they have consequences there. We do begin this hour with the latest on the storms overnight, at least seven tornadoes touching down not just in Oklahoma. CNN Senior National Correspondent Ed Lavandera, he is in Norman, that's just south of Oklahoma City. You've been doing a good job this morning showing people just what it looks like in the wake of one these. Tell us what you are seeing now?",

But you can see the magnitude of the destruction. Look at this car flipped over on top of other ones, part of this house ripped apart by the storm. We have seen this throughout this particular neighborhood where we are in Norman, Oklahoma.The good news is that it is very isolated. So, once you kind of get maybe a half mile or so away from this, everything kind of gets back to normal. But it really kind of speaks to the sporadic nature and the unpredictability of where these tornadoes are going to land. And that is obviously very troublesome especially when the systems come in the middle of the night, in the darkness, where you really can't see and kind of get a gauge of what is happening. So, many people are shaken by what happened here. Just a while ago, Jim, we met a woman named Tabitha Heaton, she is a tenth grade math teacher at a high school in Oklahoma City. She talked to us. We met her while she was cleaning up her driveway. She is trying to get everything cleaned up so she can get her car out of her garage and continue on with the day. But she described what it was like to endure this tornado late last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan making that threat here on CNN saying that in close door talks with Beijing, the U.S. is laying out both the stakes and the consequences. Sources have told CNN that Washington has new intelligence China is considering at least providing Russia specifically with drones and ammunition. CNN National Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood, she is at the State Department with more. Kylie, does the U.S. have a sense, and it's interesting because this is a part of a strategy we've seen previously where they make public intelligence, it seems, to influence China before it makes such a decision, do we know, does the U.S. know how close China is to going forward?",

Of course, Jim, the concern here is that any additional lethal assistance to China -- excuse me -- to Russia that could be used in this war would prolong the war. And that is exactly what the United States wants to prevent from happening. And, of course, the backdrop is that the U.S./China relationship is in this really tense moment right now. We had that Chinese spy balloon. Now we have them considering providing this lethal assistance. So, it is a very precarious moment.

You know, it did not go as planned certainly for Putin, and yet on the other hand, China does not have a world of allies, and so anything that can help Russia and also they have a common enemy. So, there're clearly some advantages.But when Jake Sullivan says that the United States is going to impose real costs on China, I wonder what those real costs are. After all, China is not Russia with an economy which is smaller than Italy's. I mean, we do half a trillion of dollars of -- we import half a trillion dollars of imports from China and we export $150 million to them. So, this is a kind of rather different kind of situation. I mean, you could imagine the United States imposing sanctions on the individual Chinese military companies perhaps, but that is not the sort of a slap on the wrist.",

I mean, what is fascinating, as you indicated you're your discussion with Kylie, is the extent to which we are sort of publicly putting out intelligence that previously and other previous.And I think that is a very important point to make, which is secrecy is not a policy. Secrecy serves policy. And so if secret information is useful to achieve certain policy, and it should be used, and I think the Biden administration, by and large, has done this very adeptly, however, but there is a trap here, which we are about to memorialize the 20th anniversary of U.S. invasion of Iraq, and there was a lot of intelligence put out there publicly about the case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and, of course, a lot of it was wrong.

That's the 1,700-acre property just about 30 minutes or so from the courthouse. That's where the murders took place. The defense did make that request. The state was opposed to it because they were telling the judge that the property has changed quite a bit, including the trees that are on the property between the kennels where the murders took place and the main house, which they felt was a big deal. But the defense also pointing out, Jim, that dozens of tourists and people came by the feed room where Paul Murdaugh was killed to take selfies of themselves over the weekend. People going there and they're having a look for themselves, and Alex Murdaugh's brother, John Marvin Murdaugh, had to actually call the sheriff to have those people removed. But Murdaugh, as you mentioned, he did finally admit after 20 months of lying to investigators that he was at the kennels around the time of the murders. He is still insisting he did not kill his wife and son. But the prosecutor is certainly not buying that it was somebody random. Listen to this exchange from Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If it was somebody that tall, he said they would have had to have held the gun at their knee, he predicted it was somebody who was about 5'2 or 5'4.

And some of the biggest hole have to do with one, they have never identified or have been able to find the murder weapon. They never have been able produce the bloody clothing that would have resulted had someone or had Alex shot his wife and son at close range, as we know these individuals were shot at. So, you would have had this massive amount of blood splatter on the clothing. You don't have an eyewitness. So, whenever a case is built on the circumstantial evidence, I think, in some ways, the defense does have a slight advantage.Now, in this case, you have this massive lie, this lie that Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement at the night of the murders and that he continued to tell for 20 months. So, to the extent the jurors, I think, have concerns about at the lack of the murder weapon, the lack of the bloody clothes, they also have to weigh that against the lie that Alex has admitted telling. SCIUTTO:  Big question here, too, is how the prosecution gets over a circumstantial case, right? They made the point, even going back to opening arguments knowing this, the prosecutors did, that, listen, as far as law is concerned, the circumstantial evidence is just as good as direct evidence. Is it though in a jury trial in your experience?",

That is what the law says, but then you have the reality of human experiences. And I think one of the big problems in this case continues to be this thought that someone like Alex Murdaugh, who was so close to his wife and his son, would kill them in such a heinous way, and then you had that witness testimony from Buster, Buster, the older son, the remaining son of Alex, saying his father was distraught on that night. I think that was a very powerful testimony. You would not typically see a son testifying on behalf of his father if he really believed the father had killed his mother and his younger brother.So, I think the jurors are going to have to grapple with this fact, yes, he told a lie, and, yes, there are holes in his story about what he was doing that night, but with this man, even in the financial problems that he was in, would he do something so horrific to his wife and his son? And I think that is going bother a lot of jurors. They're going to have a hard time believing that a liar and a drug addict then becomes a murderer, particularly murdering his wife and son.",

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think that in the end, they potentially will be valuable to the former president simply because this is an area where in the past, he was able to neutralize a lot of the Republicans when he participated in the debates in 2016.
