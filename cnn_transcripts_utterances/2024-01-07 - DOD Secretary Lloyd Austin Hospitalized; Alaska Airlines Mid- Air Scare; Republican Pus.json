New details about U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's secretive days' long hospitalization. The storm around his hospital stay is growing, as more top White House officials are now saying they had no idea Austin was incapacitated. Defense officials tell CNN the deputy Defense Secretary was not informed about why she began assuming some of Austin's duties last week, the day after Austin was admitted to Walter Reed Medical Center for complications from an elective surgery. Austin's staff did not reveal the hospitalization to her, White House staff, or even President Biden for another two days. And now many Republicans are criticizing the Defense Secretary, calling his lack of transparency shocking and totally unacceptable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Apparently the National Security Council didn't know it, the White House didn't know it, Congress didn't know it. We're at a time of a lot of turmoil internationally.

Things are still pretty tight lipped for exactly why the Pentagon waited so long to disclose the fact that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had been hospitalized since New Year's day.Now, the White House has said President Biden maintains confidence in Austin's ability to serve. But so many questions still remain about why they delayed -- the Pentagon delayed the disclosure of that hospitalization. As you noted, deputy Defense secretary Kathleen Hicks started assuming some of the duties of the Defense secretary on Tuesday, one day after Austin had been admitted into Walter Reed Hospital. So she was even unaware that the reason she was doing so was because he was hospitalized. It was not until Thursday afternoon that she learned that was the case. That is the same day that national security advisor Jake Sullivan learned about the hospitalization and then informed the president for the very first time. Now, there has been a wave of criticism, as you heard in the introduction right there. The highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, said that the fact they waited so long to disclose this was unacceptable. He said that it also erodes public confidence in the Biden administration. But Austin has had his defenders, including Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina this morning, who said that the Defense Secretary should also be afforded the same access to patient privacy laws as other people in the country. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): He does have a duty to keep the public informed. and I don't know whether it was him or somebody inside the military establishment that decided to do it this way.

This is what's convened by the president in the event of an emergency. So that has to be very, very clear to all the other members because you don't know when that emergency is going to come. And for this routine surgery, you know, everybody was informed. The press was informed the morning of the surgery. the authority was transferred to Gordon Eklund. And when Secretary Rumsfeld came out of the anesthesia, he resumed his duties. This shouldn't be complicated.

Investigators are now asking for the public's help to recover the large piece of the plane that fell off when they may have been between 10,000 and 16,000 feet.

In fact some of the seat assemblies themselves, she says, were twisted. The investigation now going to focus on a few things. The pilots, they will be interviewed by the NTSB by the end of the day today. The maintenance records are on board, Homendy says. She also says that she's aware that there were some pressurization issues with the plane prior. Still unclear if that's a factor in all of this. Big question now, what maintenance was done to fix that and what maintenance was done on the door plug? That is the part of the plane that flew off on Friday. Homendy says she thinks it is very lucky that this happened at 16,000 feet, not 33,000 feet, and this happened only ten minutes from the airport and the crew was able to get this plane back on the ground very quickly and very safely.

      "sentences": "Behind the scenes, House Republicans are planning a aggressive push to potentially impeach Alejandro Mayorkas sometime in the next several weeks, potentially in the first quarter of this year. This is according to new reporting from my colleagues Melanie Zanona, Annie Grayer and myself.We are hearing that House Republicans are growing increasingly confident that they can have the votes to actually impeach Mayorkas. This is a shift from some time ago when there were a lot of Republicans who essentially did not know what they believe were essentially a policy dispute with the Biden administration rises up to that very high bar in the constitution of high crimes or misdemeanors, a charge that has not been levelled against a cabinet secretary since 1876, only one other time in history. That was the secretary of war, William Belknap back then. Alejandro Mayorkas could be the second because of how House Republicans are going after what's considered a crisis at the southern border, this uptick in migrants crossing the southern border and what Republicans believe is Mayorkas' failure to deal with it. Now what has shifted here is a view among some of the swing district Republicans. We talked to several of them, saying that they are open to the idea of impeaching Mayorkas. Some of them said they are fully on board like Congressman Anthony D'Esposito of New York, a freshman Republican who told me he absolutely should be impeached. But there is still a very narrow margin for Speaker Johnson to get this through. Johnson will have to contend with a very narrow majority that's getting even slimmer, with the resignations upcoming as well as with his deputy Steve Scalise who's going to be out for health reasons for the next month. So he has to limit his defections but actually it's only one vote if it comes down to it. And one Republican, we are told, Ken Buck of Colorado, told us that he believes that going down this path could be a dangerous precedent. He's not opposed to impeaching Mayorkas. But vote counting will be central here. Now the Homeland Security Department is pushing back on this, saying the House Majority is wasting, quote, valuable time in going after Mayorkas. They point to what he has done at the border and they say that impeaching him, charging him with a high crime, is simply out of bounds and simply does not line up with what is actually happening on the border. But the House GOP controls the majority and immigration has become a defining issue in 2024, one issue that is unifying Republicans, which is why many of them believe it is more likely now that Mayorkas would get impeached than Joe Biden, where a lot of Republicans simply say they have not seen evidence yet to suggest that Joe Biden committed a crime while in office. And so that issue is beginning to play out the investigation into Biden but Mark Green, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee tells us that he expects a handful of hearings not to go on and on and on about the Mayorkas impeachment and then potentially an impeachment vote in his committee bypassing the House Judiciary Committee. That is the plan at the moment, taking it straight to the floor. But will they have the votes to get there? That remains the question. So this remains a big focus for House Republicans as they return to Washington. Manu Raju, CNN -- Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He knows black voters. And part of what he is picking up on is not necessarily an emphasis on Black people leaving the Democratic Party or Black voters moving over to the Republican camp, although that's certainly a possibility. It's more so about the apathy towards the American political presidential election. Black people are feeling pain.They are feeling something -- they're not feeling, essentially, any of the wins the Biden campaign has been talking about over the last several years. They're not seeing it. They're not feeling it in their day-to-day lives. So, he is trying to push, I think, the campaign back on track. And I would even go a step further. Part of what Clyburn is picking up on, he says, I have no problem with the Biden administration's policies. But part of what he is trying to gently nudge the campaign towards is acknowledging that the warmth that traditionally has defined the relationship between African Americans and the Democratic Party has been fading in the last couple of years. So, the highest of any demonstrator graphic and any group and black voters are still the most loyal constituency. However, those numbers have declined since 2020. And that means the Biden administration has to find some way to break through to Black voters. This is the start of that.",

I think part of what they're tapping into is not necessarily just the messaging but also the policy.There are very specific things that progressive, liberal, Black voters have been asking for for the last four years in fact, they've been very clear on the types of policies they want to see enacted and that they want to be able to feel. And I think part of what the Obama -- what former president Obama is trying to do is say, not only do you have to have the messaging right about that and change your strategy, but you have to put policies in place, whether it be through Congress, and if Congress is stonewalled, then through executive order or executive action. There has to be something tangible people can tap into, and then you can wrap your message around it. And that's what will cut through the noise and the chaos of this election season.",

Republicans have said we need a policy on immigration and all the surge of migrants at the border, laws and utilize lots of different things they want. That is moving, at the moment, on a separate track. They want a deal on that. And in order to get a deal like they, Republicans say, on the border, they can agree to more funding for Ukraine and Israel.Then there's that the separate track which is simply to keep the lights on for the federal government. That is the January 19th and February 2nd deadline that they are facing and that is agreement that Chuck Schumer and mike Johnson have reached right now. How much money should the government spend as a whole on that issue. It's just a past legislation to essentially implement that spending level, and get agreement, make sure that members are okay with it, can vote for it, get enough votes in both chambers and get it signed into law in time. It's still an open question how that plays out, and that's why the border security fight could eventually play out on the funding level, on the issue of funding the government if some of those members want to use that fight over government funding to enact their priorities about border security and about immigration policy. That's a question that will have to play out. At the moment right now, they're moving on separate tracks, keeping the government open on one track, funding Ukraine and Israel, which is tied to changes to immigration and border policies, on another track. Right now, that is still tied up in negotiations, uncertain whether they can get a deal on immigration and border policy. But now, they seem to be moving forward and trying to avert a government shutdown. As I said, a major hurdle still looms and uncertainty about how this will ultimately play out -- Fred.",
