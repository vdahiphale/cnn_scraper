I mean, Vladimir Putin needs chips, he needs ammo and he needs all the tools that he can get to try to help his struggling ground forces to turn the tide, and China, and Putin specifically, who just got an unprecedented presidential third term, has the power and the resources to do that. And these two have said they have a no limits partnership.Kremlin is saying that they are going to be talking about strategic cooperation and important -- signing important bilateral documents. And so even though China publicly stating that this trip is all about urging peace and promoting talks and that China has an objective and impartial position and is engaging in diplomacy, putting out this 12- point document, not calling the invasion an invasion, not condemning Russia for it, and, in fact, basically suggesting that Ukraine should just give up some of the territory in order to stop the fighting that it did not start. So, it's hard to see China as impartial here. The big concern by U.S. and NATO and others is that China's public neutral stance could actually shift to direct lethal support for Russia's war in Ukraine. Perhaps some analysts say then suggesting that China would expect that same support from Russia at some point in the future if it decided to make a move on this island that it coveted so much, it has for so many decades, Taiwan.",

Now this bankruptcy filing does not include Silicon Valley Bank itself, which has been taken over by regulators. And this was largely expected but still just another significant step in what has been the unwinding of this business. Now, we should look at how markets are performing. U.S. markets opening modestly lower, sort of giving back some of yesterday's big gains. There was a lot of enthusiasm over this industry-led rescue of First Republic Bank. But what is very interesting is after regional banks, they skyrocketed yesterday, they're actually all down sharply this morning, including First Republic Bank, which is, as you can see on the screen, down 17 percent, giving back yesterday's gains. PacWest Bancorp, that's another California regional lender, Western Alliance , all down on the day. Fixed ratings just came out this morning saying that they could still go ahead and downgrade First Republic's credit rating despite this $30 billion rescue. And we should just note how remarkable this rescue is from the industry. You have 11 of the nation's biggest banks teaming up to inject $30 billion.",

This is the first decline for consumer sentiment in four months. What is interesting, though, is that this is not Silicon Valley Bank. This is actually not the bank stress. University of Michigan says 85 percent of their interviews for this survey were done before Silicon Valley Bank become this major bank failure.Instead, University of Michigan is blaming the other big problem that we'd be dealing with for the last year and a half, which is high inflation. So, you have to wonder how these numbers actually may come down further when it reflects the fact that people have become more concerned about the banking system. One point, though, that you're making about two regional banks. So, it is definitely right to say that these stocks are down because people are worried about how much money they're making. That is the primary concern. And we should just note that FDIC insurance still protects people up to $250,000. So, we can see the bank stocks come down but the money in the bank up to $250,000 is safe.",

Well, I think one of the major determining factors is that we now have Nikki Haley, who has officially joined the race, making the race competitive.
