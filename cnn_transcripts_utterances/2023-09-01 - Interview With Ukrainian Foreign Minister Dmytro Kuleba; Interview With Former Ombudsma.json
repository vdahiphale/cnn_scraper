I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. Drones have defined this week of war here in Ukraine and in Russia, which says that it intercepted another one heading towards Moscow this morning. This comes as the Ukrainian chief of military intelligence says the drone attack which hit a Russian airbase on Tuesday was launched within Russian territory. Meantime, on the ground, Ukraine says its forces are making progress on their southern front, claiming to have penetrated the first line of Russian defenses in the Zaporizhzhia region. But Kyiv feels these efforts are unrecognized by some in the West. And the foreign minister lashed out on what he calls unfair second guessing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Are they criticizing the pace as well? D. KULEBA:  That's -- this is the most ridiculous part of it. Our partners who are helping us, including the United States, they understand that things are moving in the right direction and they understand that there is no tragedy or no kind of slowdown. It's just happening because it's tough. It's a tough fight. But those people who want the United States to cut their support, to get disappointed, to get wary of Ukraine, they raise their voices.

Your planes are coming to you too late, the F-16s, for this counteroffensive. What if you told, again, you know, your backers who are, say, they want you to win, about when you should get the equipment and what more you need and when? D. KULEBA:  I wish some things happened and arrived in Ukraine some time ago. But things happen as they happen. Countries need time to go through their reflection process, decision-making process. And we're not criticizing anyone for being too slow in providing weapons because we understand that there's a certainly reality. So, please, again, governments, do not criticize our counteroffensive for being slow. But then I ask experts and commentators also to respect that we are fighting with what we have against an enemy who is strong. But the most important, of course, decision of recent months is the agreement reached between President Zelenskyy, President Biden, prime minister of Netherlands, Denmark and Norway on providing Ukraine with F-16s and we are deeply grateful to the United States for giving greenlight for these deliveries.",

And we saw an attack inside Russia, very far inside Russia this week, the first such attack. Took out their troop-carrying planes and damaged an air field. And attacks on Moscow and the like. Now, I know you never normally talk about this stuff, but actually, one of your generals did and did confirm it, and did confirm that those planes were deliberately targeted. I don't know what you can say about that, but what are your allies saying about you attacking inside Russia? First of all, can you confirm that for us? D. KULEBA:  Well, when I'm asked this question, my answer is always the same. I -- as foreign minister, I do commend what happens in other countries.

KULEBA:  Back in February, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution written along the lines of the peace formula. It did not mention peace formula directly, but basically, the content of that resolution is the reflection of the peace formula. And 141 states voted in favor. And this is the threshold that we would be happy to repeat with the summit. If we don't, then, of course, we the threshold or the criteria of success will be the presence of such big players, as China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, many, many other countries from all over the world.

I don't know how successful Russian ministry of defense will be in replacing Wagner. It remains to be seen. And the second argument is the strongest one, it's the sentiment of African countries towards the Soviet Union. And they take Russia as the thinking nation of the Soviet Union. If I look at the list of investments, the top rate -- rate list of investors in Africa or top list of providers of technical assistance, Russia is not neither on the top nor in middle. It's very, very low in -- at the bottom. So, we want Africans to realize the reality, the real partnership, the real benefit does not come with Russia. And frankly, behind the closed doors, they smile to Putin. They go to summits with him. But when you sit with them behind the closed doors, you know, they have different feelings, but they are afraid of Russia's punishment if they support Ukraine too openly.

And this is why we -- and because we do want to win the war as soon as possible, we are bringing together defense industries from all over the world, ministers of defense, ministers of foreign affairs in Kyiv to ramp up production and co-production of armaments.
