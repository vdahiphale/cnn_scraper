So this is a very extreme situation at the moment. Our 911 lines are also down. Any resident that needs 911 can text 911 in the city of Palm Springs or they can call a non-emergency number.

The prosecutor said he made more than $43 million by making trades on inside information about Dean Foods. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but he still maintained his innocence. Now, in 2021, former President Trump commuted Walters' sentence.In his book, Walters suggests that Mickelson was to blame for the prison sentence. He writes, \"Phil Mickelson refused to tell a simple truth -- that I never told him I had inside information about stocks, and he knows it. All Phil had to do was publicly say it.\" Now, we reached out to Michelson's representatives. They pointed to a statement his lawyer gave to The Wall Street Journal that, quote, \"...any testimony wouldn't have made any difference in whether Walters was convicted. The lawyer noted that Walters was convicted on multiple counts and none of those pertained to his relationship with Mickelson.\" Joining us now is Billy Walters, author of \"Gambler: Secrets from a Life at Risk.\" Thank you for being in.

Not one of the men that I interviewed wanted to go back to prison, but they were all concerned they were going to go back because they had no job skillset at all -- none -- zero. Look, a lot of them didn't even know -- didn't even know how to use a cell phone. And I could see these people going out in society. They've got no job skillset at all and the likelihood of them coming back to prison was very high. So when I got out, Harry Reid was a really good friend of mine -- Sen. Harry Reid. I came back. He and I were working on putting vocational schools in the federal prisons. I offered to put up the first million dollars. Unfortunately, Sen. Reid passed away from pancreatic cancer. And then I got introduced to an organization in Las Vegas called Hope for Prisoners. And the former sheriff there, Bill Young, had introduced me to it.
