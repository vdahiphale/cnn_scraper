And here's what we have ahead of you in the CNN Newsroom.In the U.S. More than 60 million people are under a threat from a massive winter storm set to unleash a barrage of heavy snow, treacherous ice and rain. Also, saying farewell to President Jimmy Carter. Mourners pay their respects to the Americas 39th president as he's honored in his home State of Georgia. And Donald Trump's risky plan to advance his political agenda. We begin, though, with that powerful winter storm creating miserable conditions across a wide swath of the United States. In Colorado, travelers were dealing with blizzard like conditions. You see that on your screen there. The storm is expected to bring heavy snow, hazardous ice, rain, and severe thunderstorms stretching more than 1,300 miles across the country. That's around 2,000 kilometers for our international viewers. Icy roads like here in Kansas made for dangerous travel. Even tractor trailers were slipping along the interstate. The Kansas City International Airport closed for a number of hours Saturday because of icy runways and taxiways. Officials say travel in the area will be hazardous as Kansas City and St. Louis will be hardest hit. This morning, more than 550 flights in the U.S. have already been canceled for today, the bulk of those in Kansas City, St. Louis, and the Windy City Chicago. More than 60 million people are under threat. And while snow and ice have been largely limited to northern states so far this winter, the storm could bring treacherous conditions from the plains all the way to the East Coast, including areas less prone to winter weather. Our own meteorologist Elisa Raffa brings it all down for us now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We're talking about difficulty to nearly impossible travel, heavy and blowing snow, significant ice that could cause sporadic or even long- lasting severe power outages.The snow and the ice will continue to blow up as we go through the day today in the Central Plains. Some of that snow could be heavy at times. That ice could be significant. It continues to move east as we go through the afternoon. By Monday morning, we're waking up to a messy morning commute from D.C., we'll have some showers down to Atlanta, even stretching down to the Gulf Coast. Some of the snow could be heavy. It also will be blowing around that could cause some blizzard conditions across parts of Kansas. Some totals of six to 12 inches possible. Some locations, those totals could top a foot, mostly in the Central Plains where you don't have the heavy snow, you have the heavy ice. That warm air comes in, tries to melt off some of that snow and you get that fleet and that freezing rain. That freezing rain could be significant for parts of Missouri and Southern Illinois where we could be looking at up to a half to three quarters of an inch of ice. That would really weigh down tree limbs, power lines, and cause some problems as we go through with the rest of the weekend. And we've got the snow and the ice on the winter part, but we also have some warm air really feeding some severe storms too across parts of the south. Some of those storms could organize into a line and bring you some damaging winds and several tornadoes as we go through the day on Sunday. So, truly a multi-hazard, multi-threat storm as we go through the rest of the weekend. On the backside of this Arctic air spill south and will bring us some of the coldest temperatures that we've had so far this season. Really frigid air, making it all the way down to the Gulf Coast. More than 70 percent of the lower 48 will find temperatures below freezing over the next seven days, which means any snow and ice that falls will hang around for a while. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It now appears Trump expects some of his biggest campaign promises on tax policy and the border to pass through Congress in a single, very large bill.Sources say the U.S. House Speaker told Republican lawmakers of the plan in a closed-door meeting on Saturday. After the spending bill debacle and a narrow Speaker's race, Trump seems to believe there will be very little room to maneuver separate bills. But legislation of this size will still be a massive challenge for the GOP and will take far more time to negotiate. CNN spoke with Republican Congressman Rich McCormick, who was at that meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RICH MCCORMICK (R-GA): It's going to be very difficult, but everybody has the idea that we want to get something done historically. Because a lot of times, quite frankly, when the Republicans take over and we have both the -- when we have the trifecta, we don't get things across the finish line because they're not working well together. I think this is the first time in a very long time that the speaker and the Senate leader both are going to be working hand in hand to get this across the finish line along with the president's guidance and make sure we deliver on the things that we ran on.

Natasha, there's so much to unpack here, but I do want to begin with that visit by Giorgia Meloni to Mar-a-Lago, because it certainly seems as though a lot of European leaders are trying to create ties with Donald Trump, but at the same time, it also seems as though he's meeting with European leaders who are similar inclined as himself.

And there are huge challenges ahead with what is going to happen with Ukraine.So, let's just say Trump does manage to engineer some sort of deal that ends or pauses the war in Ukraine, the idea behind that would be much of the reconstruction would be paid for by Europe. And if there isn't some sort of deal, Trump has already signaled that the U.S. isn't going to be supporting Ukraine in the same way it has in the past, militarily, financially, and so forth. And so, that means that European leaders are going to have very tough choices about how much money they can continue to give to Ukraine. So, that's just one big issue. And there are others, you know, in terms of, you know, what is Trump going to do to NATO? Is he going to limit a U.S. military spending? And that will offer more burden for European NATO countries to pay more for their own military. And we've seen Emmanuel Macron already talking about this that Europe needs to be more independent.

I know the thinking behind it is that if they were to break it down into all these different separate bills then that would also pose huge challenges as well, because they'd have to negotiate in each bill with the Democrats. And with such a razor thin majority in the House was only really one defection that they can handle. This is a really different environment than when Trump entered the White House in 2017 when the Republicans had something like a 47-seat lead in the House. It's going to be very, very difficult to get anything passed without some cooperation of the Democrats.So, at the very least, putting everything into one bill means this is going to take a very long time. It's going to be a lot of negotiation. And I think part of the problem is that they want huge spending cuts. They want a huge tax cut. And so, in 2017, they were able to engineer a massive tax cut, but that led to a ballooning of the budget deficit by 4 trillion. And then they also, at the same time, want to spend all this money on immigration, on border security, and on this deportation plan.

SUAREZ (voice-over): According to the report, Mexico is the second most dangerous country for civilians with attacks targeting political candidates, although analysts say the issue runs deeper, FRANCISCO RIVAS, NATIONAL CITIZEN OBSERVATORY, MEXICO (through translator): I think, beyond whether it's second or third, Mexico is a country where citizens face high risks due to the presence of these criminal groups and the state's inability to restore peace. SUAREZ (voice-over): Unlike other countries in the report, violence in Mexico is shaped by organized crime and internal political conflicts. The report places Mexico seventh in the number of deadliest events, fourth in conflict fragmentation, and 17th in the most diffuse conflicts. RODRIGUEZ (through translator): This doesn't surprise us. It simply provides more insight into the local levels of violence happening in the country. SUAREZ (voice-over): The Mexican government has not responded to CNN's request for comment on the report. President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the security in the country will improve, pointing to a drop in homicides in December. RIVAS (through translator): But we are still far from achieving conditions that would allow Mexico to recover peace. SUAREZ (voice-over): This data highlight persistent violence in Mexico, with forecasts pointing to a more violent 2025 driven by judicial elections and the fragmentation of criminal groups. Karol Suarez, CNN Mexico City. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That pro-Russia party has been locked out of talks, despite winning the biggest chair of the national vote in September. Nehammer withdrew from negotiations on Saturday, blaming what he calls destructive forces.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARL NEHAMMER, AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): My election campaign and my political activities were and are characterized by being the force of the political center in order to build a bulwark against the radicals. It is my deep conviction that radicals do not offer a solution to any problem, but only live by describing problems. That is bad for Austria, and it is bad for the people in our country.
