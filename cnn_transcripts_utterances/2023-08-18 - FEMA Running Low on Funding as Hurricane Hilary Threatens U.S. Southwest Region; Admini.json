It will weaken as it approaching the southwestern U.S., but this is going to be a significant rainmaker. So flash floods, landslides, and mudslides all on the table this weekend into early next week. A very rare level four of four from the Weather Prediction Center. This is a high risk of excessive flash flooding.And to put this into some context, why you at home should care, let's go back a year, 2022 in Death Valley, California, we received 1.46 inches of rain in a 24-hour period. Their average annual rainfall, just over two inches. And what we are forecasting for this particular location, three to four inches of rain. And you can see the devastation in the image I showed you just a moment ago, what happened in Death Valley. So we need to pay attention to this. The rainfall will be the major concern with the flash flooding. But what about the winds? This storm is going to encounter cooler waters, so that's going to help weaken it as it approaches southern California. If it stays offshore, more coastal impacts. It moves inland, it gets shredded apart and we focus in on the flash flooding for the interior southwest. So many components here, Poppy and Phil. We will keep on track of it.",

And some of the stuff is, I think, at this point undercutting him because if he says the very lines they've outlined, how he should attack Chris Christie, how he should attack Vivek Ramaswamy, and he should not, in fact, attack Donald Trump, it puts him in a box.

There are many nations that are really, coming together and unifying around this common set of threats and challenges. I'll let the leaders of South Korea and Japan speak for themselves, but I clearly, at least in terms of our perspective, we all recognize in a trilateral format like today, we all recognize that there's more we need to be doing to stand up to that kind of coercion and that kind of intimidation. And it's not just the threats posed by the PRC, it's the threat posed by North Korea. Obviously, that's a real key concern for our South Korean allies, but it has of late become an even more significant concern to our Japanese allies as well.",

Do you view Travis King in a similar regard, given the fact he went over there himself? Are sanctions a possibility? Is a prisoner trade a possibility given how he went there?",

We want to get him back to his family. We don't really know the motivations that led him to walk across the border there, the DMZ. We just don't really know. We haven't had a chance to talk to him. And so, we're trying very hard to get some knowledge here about where he is, how he is, and what conditions is he being held. And we have communicated again through various channels to North Korea that we want to know more about him, but we just as critically want him back. So, we are working that as hard as we can. It's a little bit more difficult dealing with North Korea than it is with some other nations in which there are wrongfully detained Americans that we can negotiate and we have diplomatic relations with, such as Russia. We just don't have that facility there in Pyongyang to be able to do that.",

And even if we had made any significant progress, it would be difficult for me to talk about it publicly because that could maybe could torpedo the negotiations. But we are working on it very hard. Secretary Blinken was grateful for the opportunity to talk to Paul. We have a line of communication with him that we can take advantage of, and that's a good thing.
