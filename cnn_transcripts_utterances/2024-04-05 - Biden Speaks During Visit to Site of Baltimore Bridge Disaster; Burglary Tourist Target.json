      "sentences": "... the same exact thing. Commit to stay. And to the customers who use this port, we're coming back. We're coming back soon.Folks, finally, we're going to move heaven and earth to rebuild this bridge as rapidly as humanly possible. And we're going to do so with union labor and American steel. For simple reasons, they're the best workers in the world, and that's not hyperbole. Every day, over 30,000 vehicles traveled across this bridge. And I was one of those people. I commuted every day from Delaware for 36 years to Washington, D.C., back and forth, and about one-fourth of that time by automobile. I've been to every part of this port. Folks, we now face a question no American should ever have to ask. How will I get to work? How will I go to school? How will I get to a hospital? Response and response, everyone, including Congress, should be asking only one question, and they're going to be asked a question by your delegation. How can we help? How can we solve that problem? My administration is committed, absolutely committed, to ensuring that the parties responsible for this strategy pay to repair the damage and be held accountable to the fullest extent the law will allow. But I also want to be clear, we will support Maryland and Baltimore every step of the way to help you rebuild and maintain all the business and commerce that's here now. As the governor can tell you, within hours, at the Maryland request, we approved $60 million in emergency federal funding. I fully intend, I fully intend, as the governor knows, to have the federal government cover the cost of rebuilding this entire bridge. All of it. All of it. As we've done in other parts of the country in similar circumstances. While I stand here, I call on Congress to authorize this effort as soon as possible. Let me close with this. This port is over 300 years old. As a matter of fact, as I said, my great-great-grandfather worked here as a waterman in this bay. This port is older than our republic, and it's been through tough, tough times before. During the War of 1812, a young Marylander named Francis Scott Key, to whom the bridge is named after, sat in a boat in this very harbor, and he watched -- he watched the British troops launch an attack after attack on American forces. But as the dawn broke, we saw the American flag still flying. Baltimore was still standing, and our nation, as he wrote in the Star- Spangled Banner, had made it through a perilous fight. Folks, this is going to take time. But Governor Moore, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen, Congresswoman Mfume, Mayor Scott, County Executive Johnny O., and others are going to rebuild this bridge as rapidly as possible. And, folks, we're determined to come back even stronger. We're the only nation that's gone through every crisis that we've had. We've come out stronger than we went in, and we're going to do it here as well. And once more, to make this perilous challenge. This perilous challenge. You know, because we're the United States of America, there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Think about that. Remember who we are. We're the United States of America. Nothing is beyond our capacity. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops, our first responders, and all those who gave their soul. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

The President started by noting a message that was sent by one of the construction workers on the bridge to a girlfriend shortly before it collapsed. The President connecting that grief and loss that families are feeling to loss that he has had in his own personal life, saying, I've been there, the profound deaths of loss.But he repeated a refrain that we've heard from the President before when he's had to connect with folks who are grieving, saying that a day will come when a smile will come to your mouth before tears come to your eyes. The President also thanked officials on the ground there and said he'd look forward to the entire channel being reopened by the end of May.",

And next, you mentioned the family members and those who died. [15:35:00] The President is going to be meeting with the families of those loved ones who passed away when the bridge collapsed.

It's remarkable.You know, if you had a psychic or a tarot card reader or somebody who could make predictions with this kind of accuracy, I would presume that she or he would be rich, but that is not the case. But astronomers understand the movement of the earth and sun with such precision that we can determine the path of totality within a hundredth of a second. Recently, that was decided that some of the calculations on the diameter of the sun were off a little, little, little bit. And so if you're on the very edge of the path of totality, be sure to get all the way in, be sure to get all the way in those calculations. If the map you're looking at turns out to be off by a kilometer, a couple thousand feet, then that's how accurately they can determine it. You know, between you and a freeway exit, they can determine how dark it's going to be. It's really something.",

But I will say two things to everybody about this.First of all, getting into totality is worth it. If you have to drive an hour or two, you know, most of us live in the Eastern time zone. And so this will go right through the Eastern time zone. If you can get in the path totality, it's worth it. The other thing, human nature being what it is, we just want to stare at the sun, even if it's cloudy, you just want to stare up there. So be sure to have these glasses. Now, these are eclipse glasses. You can look straight at the sum of them, even though they're paper and mylar plastic, they are about 100,000 times darker than sunglasses. Sunglasses will not do it, but it's not the thing. You got to have the real deal. These are available from our website at planetary.org. Of course, everyone watching is a member. Of course you all are, planetary.org/eclipse. And also, I was in a hardware store yesterday and they were selling them in a hardware store.",
