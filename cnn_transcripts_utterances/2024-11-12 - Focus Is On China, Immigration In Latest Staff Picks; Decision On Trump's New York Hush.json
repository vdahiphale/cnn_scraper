      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD.Well, any minute now we expect to hear from the Israeli and American presidents. Isaac Herzog is at the White House right now. The meeting comes the same day as the U.S. deadline for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza. Aid groups say more aid has not arrived. Sources tell CNN no policy change or announcement is expected. We will bring you their remarks when they happen. But, first, China and immigration. Donald Trump's early picks for the top positions in his government reflects his concerns about both of those issues. First, the China picks. Sources say Trump is likely to tap Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state. Rubio has been one of the loudest voices in the U.S. Senate speaking out against China and raising questions about TikTok and Chinese electric cars. China issued sanctions against Rubio in 2020 for his comments on China's role over Hong Kong. Trump has also asked Congressman Mike Waltz to serve as his national security advisor. Waltz is another vocal China hawk in Congress. He has deep military history with multiple tours of duty in Afghanistan and in the Middle East. Now, as for the immigration focus picks, Trump has tapped South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem for the powerful position of Homeland Security Secretary. Noem often spoke about her concerns about immigration while appearing alongside Trump on the campaign trail. At Homeland Security, she will likely be tasked with working on plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Our Steve Contorno is tracking the formation of this new team. And as we discussed yesterday, Steve, the president-elect is making clear that his cabinet picks and those around him will be announced and selected quite quickly. And we are seeing that come to fruition now.",

This is a much swifter process than we saw back in 2016 when he was first elected and was sort of the dog thataccidentally caught the car and his team was not prepared for a transition in 2016. And it really showed in how they rolled out their cabinet and who would be filling these key jobs at that time. And here we have just total 180 and how this process has gone, where we have several key appointments filled, really demonstrating where Donald Trump's priorities are. He has picked a group of three people, Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, and Tom Homan, to be the faces of his immigration policies. No surprise that Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan are involved. Miller was the architect of his immigration policies in 2016 to 2020. And Tom Homan, in many ways, was the enforcer. Kristi Noem is someone who doesn't necessarily have a lot of experience with Homeland Security Departments. In fact, it's hard to find a state further from the border, the southern border at least, than South Dakota. But she has been a close ally of Donald Trump. She's very close to Corey Lewandowski, who is another top adviser to Trump. And so it's not necessarily surprising that she has found herself with a cabinet position. And then obviously with a pick of Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Mike Waltz to lead his national security team just shows how much Donald Trump is going to be engaged with foreign policy right out of the gate. And these are the people who are going to be in charge of pitching and tracking Trump's tariff policies to the world and trying to convince our adversaries in some of -- some hostile countries in Latin America to take on the thousands, maybe millions of people that his administration plans to deport. So very clearly, these are his focuses. They were a focus on the campaign trail. And these picks signify just how much these are going to be a priority for him going into the early days of his administration.",

Well, the New York judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money case has agreed to push back a deadline originally set for today until next week. Judge Juan Merchan was scheduled to issue a decision on whether the case should be tossed out due to the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling. Now in May, Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to cover up a sex scandal. That prosecutor said was an attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. CNN's Kara Scannell joins me now live from New York. So Judge Merchan delaying this till next week.

Ultimately, he said that he would agree to delay anything from happening for a week. That's to give the prosecution time to come back to him with what they think should happen going forward. Today was the day for this immunity decision. Two weeks from today is when Donald Trump was scheduled to be sentenced in this case if the conviction stood. So prosecutors acknowledged that this is an unprecedented time, unprecedented circumstances. Trump's lawyers are still trying to get this case dismissed, and they're saying that the judge should still do that because Trump is now a president-elect, he's a federal official, he will be in January, and that this is a state judge overseeing a state case where there's federal supremacy. So that's one of the arguments that they're making. Now, prosecutors, though, have not said what they are going to propose as we look at this going forward. It's possible they could just say they agree with Trump's team to just keep all of this on hold, that they don't want the judge to issue a ruling on immunity. That would allow their conviction to stand unchallenged. But if they say that they think that the judge should move forward with the ruling, then we'll see what this judge ultimately decides to do. And, you know, the clock gets closer to Inauguration Day. That leaves less room for Donald Trump to be sentenced if this conviction stands. And, of course, we do expect Trump's attorneys to appeal this every step of the way. Bianna.",

Early in the day, a kindergarten teacher, of a kindergarten of special needs, children with special needs, rescued bravely and wisely the toddlers in the kindergarten from a drone attack. A drone exploded in the kindergarten. This is what we're going through from Lebanon, Mr. President. And you know it all too well. We are fighting hard. We are defending our people, our brave soldiers and pilots. And I know that you're working very hard to make sure that this war will end and that there will be, first and foremost, security for the people of Israel, as well as for the people of Lebanon.

I do think it'snotable that Herzog, you know, really wanted to take a moment to thank President Biden for his support for Israel, as he said, in its darkest hour. That is obviously a sentiment that is still felt here very much in Israel as it relates to President Biden, even as Biden and Netanyahu's relationship has certainly grown much, much frostier as the U.S. has brought some pressure to bear on Israel for the conduct of its military in Gaza, for the numbers of civilian casualties. And another topic of conversation that they will certainly engage in, and that is ultimately a key reason why this meeting is happening today, is on that issue of humanitarian aid that we were talking about just moments ago, because even as Israeli officials are clearly trying to show the United States that they are taking this seriously, there is also a key recognition among U.S. officials and also among those eight humanitarian organizations who put out a statement today that Israel simply has not done enough on the humanitarian aid front in the month since the United States issued that letter on behalf of the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the secretary of state, demanding that Israel do more on humanitarian aid. Israel is nowhere close to the 350 trucks per day that the U.S. called for. Instead, they are at something like 75 trucks per day this month of November. And a lot of roadblocks still remain. But those conversations are very much still ongoing. We saw Ron Dermer meeting with the secretary of state yesterday. Dermer is a key adviser to Netanyahu and the minister of strategic affairs. And today, Herzog meeting with President Biden. So even as that deadline has now hit, we aren't expecting the U.S. to announce any of those any potential policy changes. And we also know that those conversations between U.S. and Israeli officials on humanitarian aid are very much still ongoing and that the U.S. is going to continue to urge Israel to do more.",

So in addition to the United States not changing its policy with regard to Israel and perhaps withholding aid, given this deadline today to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza, there's also, I know, concern within the Israeli government about what the Biden administration may or may not do in this lame duck period as it relates to its involvement at the United Nations and perhaps failing to veto any sort of anti-Israel legislation.

But that doesn't mean that it can't make any changes next week, given the dire situation in the Gaza Strip. And then when it comes to the U.N., of course, there's precedent for this. As the Obama administration was going out the door, it abstained from an anti-Israel resolution within the U.N. Security Council. And Israel really does rely on the United States to veto these types of resolutions. The record of the United States vetoing these resolutions is very, very long. And in this situation, as we come down to the end of the Biden administration, I think the Israelis only have themselves to blame for this. There really is, over the recent weeks and months, less and less reason for the Israelis to be conducting major military operations in the Gaza Strip and basically starving people.",

And what isreally notable is that many experts believe if one or two are going to end, it would likely be the war in Lebanon that could be resolved sooner at this rate than the war in Gaza. And Mike Waltz, who we now know is going to be Trump's pick for national security adviser, wrote an op-ed in \"The Economist\" just a few months ago. And he said that the next president should act urgently to bring the conflict in the Middle East to an end and reiterating what candidate Trump, at the time, said and that is, let Israel finish the job and get it over with fast against Hamas. It appears from how politics are playing out domestically in Israel, one of the factors in the firing of Defense Minister Gallant is disagreements between the defense establishment and the Netanyahu government about the war in Gaza, many in the defense establishment saying the war there could end right now and there could be a ceasefire hostage deal. There doesn't seem to be any appetite for Netanyahu to end this war soon. How do you see things resolving between Netanyahu and Trump on this issue?",

Trump has also called on Netanyahu to end the war by Inauguration Day. But Netanyahu, of course, has coalition partners who have threatened the stability of the coalition if he were to agree to ending the war before the destruction of Hamas, however, they define it. So there may be an early tension between the Israeli government and the new Trump administration over conflicting timelines. The stunning irony here is that the war in the Gaza Strip can come to an end. And for months now, the Israeli government has been saying that major military operations will be coming to an end and it was time to turn the page and focus on the fight against Hezbollah. Yet, they seem more interested in bringing the fight with Hezbollah to an end diplomatically than finally ending the suffering in Gaza.",

If the Israelis were to annex that territory, it would put the Abraham Accords in significant jeopardy. If you remember back to 2020, the Emiratis said, you can have normalization or annexation, but you cannot have both.

So, what are you hearing about how these selections and decisions are being made in Florida? And who is there advising the president along this process? Because a lot of focus has been on one name, and that is Elon Musk.",

      "sentences": "I'm hearing the very good things from here on Capitol Hill. People are very pleased with the process as it isunfolding. I think they are to be commended for their discipline and methodical approach with which they are moving forward on these -- on these picks. You know, you're really a focus on the homeland security, the border czar, and that's really, I'd say, coming from the campaign. The number two issue in this country was the border and getting it under control, and that's why we've seen a focus with Homeland Security border czar, and National Security Advisor. Yes. Elon Musk is there and I think that's a great pick. And the criticism of Elon Musk, in my opinion, are coming from the folks here in Washington who fear him the most, the entrenched bureaucrats and the elites who don't like the idea that he wants to come in and streamline government and make it easier to get things done. And I'm guessing if you go out into America and say, hey, what do you think about the idea of streamlining government and making things easier for taxpayers? It's probably a 90 percent issue out there.",

And I think, you know, Donald Trump is somebody who welcomes a broad swath of ideas. That's how he operates. That's how he's operated as president. That's how he operated on his campaign. And again, I think he's to be commended for his approach, a disciplined approach that he's taking here in this -- in this transition process and by hearing from all sides. And I think you look at that list of folks who he has announced so far. They are quality, they are competent, they are people who have service to this country and will do a good job.",

We don't yet know at state officially. Mike Waltz, a combat veteran, as his national security advisor, and obviously you have Elise Stefanik at the United Nations. What they all share is they all appear to be fiercely pro-Israel, fiercely anti-Iran, tough on China, and skeptical on Ukraine. Lay out for us how you envision his foreign policy agenda to look like and as it's implemented with some of these names as his top advisors.",

Vance in an interview just a few weeks ago saying that the U.S. does not seek war with Iran. The U.S. does not seek regime change in Iran. We've seen more open options from other, more hawkish people. And those that even Marco Rubio in the past has really pointed the finger at Iran in wanting to tackle the issue there head on. Where do you see that landing? Do you think the president should be open to U.S. involvement in the region?",

I will note that over the course of the last four years, we have seen anundoing of the sanctions against Iran, which have poured billions and billions of dollars back into their country, which has funded terrorism throughout the world and right there in the Middle East. So, yes, I expect there to be a tough stance on Iran and looking at getting many of those sanctions back into place so we can cut off this spigot of money that is funding terrorism throughout the region and around the world.",

I mean, an early sign of this came over theweekend when he demanded for recess appointments. This is obviously a GOP-controlled Senate taking away, perhaps, it appears from his language, their duty, their constitutional duty in appointing nominees for the cabinet and confirming them. One GOP Senate aide told \"POLITICO,\" I would encourage him to work within the norms of the Senate as frustrating as it can be. Do you agree with that assessment?",

And, you know, he's a business guy. This is a guy who doesn't like the slow bureaucratic movements of Washington speak. So my guess is he will -- he has a GOP Senate. He has their friends and allies on his side. My guess is they will work together to find a way forward to ensure that his nominees get in and on the job and moving quickly.",
