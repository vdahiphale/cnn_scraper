ANDRE CARSON (D-IN): Well, I think there were a series of events leading up to this. Of course, I condemn the acts that happened on October 7th. But the antagonistic stratagem that came from the Israeli government throughout this, the expansion of settlements, the mistreatment of Palestinians in the ground, in the West Bank, in Gaza, have certainly created an atmosphere of hostility and now we're seeing what happens when folks aren't listened to. We're seeing what happens when we get foreign aid without accountability. Yes, Israel has been a strategic partner in the region, but I think we have to reassess our relationship with Israel given our taxpayer dollars with no accountability.",

The FBI is investigating a car explosion at the U.S.-Canadian border near Niagara Falls. Two people in the car died. This happened just a few hours ago at the Rainbow Bridge connecting New York and Canada. According to law enforcement sources, the car for some reason accelerated on the U.S. side then went airborne and crash landed, exploding near a checkpoint. In response, authorities quickly shut down all four land border crossings between the U.S. and Canada near Niagara Falls. Let's begin our coverage with CNN's Brynn Gingras. Brynn, law enforcement officials from Canada and the U.S. are now looking into this. What more are we learning?",

It's surveillance video showing the point of impact when this explosion occurred. And I do want to warn you, you that you may find this video disturbing as we play it for you.But what we have learned from sources telling our John Miller that what they know right now, again, a lot of questions still being answered at this point, is that a vehicle was crossing from the U.S. side at the border and at some point had a high acceleration of speed, hitting a curb, causing the vehicle to go airborne and then crashing into a checkpoint area of this crossing, causing that giant explosion. And as you look at the video right now, you could see all of this smoke, all of the flames, this is at what point that investigators are sort of working with as they try to figure out exactly what happened here and what was the intention here. Was it something sinister? Was it something else? That's the answers they're trying to get. We know that two people were inside of that vehicle and sources are telling us that those two people have died. As you mentioned, Bianna, four of the border crossings are now shut down. A number of security precautions are now in place in that area. But also in this part of the country, in that area, we know that the airports have heightened security to the point that they are now doing extra checks on passengers in the airports on this busy travel day. There are bomb-sniffing dogs checking cars. There are a number of other checkpoints happening. And we also know there is increased security in other major cities. We learned that is happening in D.C. We also learned that NYPD is sending resources to that area to help with this investigation. So a lot of the answers still need -- a lot of questions still need to be answered but investigators federally and locally and in the state on the ground trying to get those answers, Bianna.",

Human remains were found in one location and another location which spurred the theory that there may have been two passengers.

It is a video that you'll see soon where you could see the vehicle kind of in the upper left -- upper right-hand side of the scene traveling at a high rate of speed and going over the wall and then you see the explosion afterwards.But that is on a local road, on the U.S. side of the border. And it is a road where if you're on that road, you're not committed to crossing in Canada. But once he flies over the divider, he ends up at a secondary screening location where you would have been directed if you were coming from Canada into the United States. Some of the confusion about whether he was headed to Canada or headed to the United States was borne out of the fact that the side of the road that the car landed on would have been the direction coming here when actually there is no indication he ever left the United States.",

They had 5,000 flights last month, 2 million passengers a year.We're also hearing this from the authority that oversees that airport. They say their screening cars in addition to passengers that are coming into the airport and they're trying to get the word out on this huge holiday travel day for passengers to factor in some extra time into their trips, flights domestically are still arriving and departing there, but the TSA says it is in a heightened state of security posture, something that it has been in due to the situation in Israel.

Once they do that, it's -- we bring in the evidence response teams and they know how to basically disassemble everything that's taken place there, document what we have for evidence and really maximize this significant investigation of that stuff on site. At the same time, you have teams of analysts and other agents who are working back in the Buffalo field office and they are trying to exploit every piece of information that we could get from this vehicle. So we know who the vehicle was registered to. We tried to identify those people, to identify their family members and associates. And then we have agents out in the field contacting those individuals to try to help us identify who was in this car and what might have motivated them, what they might have been doing that day and or what might have led to this either horrible accident or intentional act that could have caused loss of life and a lot of damage. And then, of course, there is a very robust exchange going on with our Canadian colleagues.

It is not consistent with the way that terrorists or operatives work. If you had a vehicle that was rigged up to explode, you wouldn't draw that sort of attention. You wouldn't have to attack the place before you detonated the device.So those -- those two things didn't seem to be consistent. It certainly still looks like an intentional act. But it could have been one that could have been a mistake, now that we know they were on a separate road and actually landed where they did because they crossed the barrier in air. That introduces all sorts of questions as to exactly where was this vehicle going, what were they trying to accomplish before they ended up on fire and upside down on the border. So I think it's -- as we've gotten deeper and been able to put more facts around what's happened, I think that the question of why and what was the motivation and the intent here has gotten muddier and less likely to be an act of terrorism.",
