A growing number of U.S. lawmakers raisenational security concerns about TikTok's ties to China. Just last week a sale or ban decree was announced by the by the Biden White House which fears TikTok could be used as a secret disinformation tool by Beijing. Vanessa Yurkevich is in New York and Marc Stewart is standing by in Tokyo. Vanessa, this is going to be an important test, so many questions about transparency, where users' data goes. What are we expecting in terms of the line of questioning and whether we will get the answers?",

That is going to be an uphill battle for him because many lawmakers that you see right there on your screen, they have their minds made up already. Many of them are supporting legislation that would severely restrict TikTok. Many of them are supporting a total ban of TikTok in the U.S. And this really stems around security concerns, national security concerns that these lawmakers have. This is because TikTok is owned by ByteDance; that is a Chinese founded company and a lot of these lawmakers are asking questions. How much influence does the Chinese government have on TikTok? Could they collect U.S. user data, what would they do that, could they spy on Americans? Now here in the U.S., TikTok is already banned on federal devices and about half the states in the U.S. have banned it on state owned devices. TikTok for their part, has said that, as of June 2022, they have moved all U.S. privacy data onto U.S. servers. But there was an incident last year in December where several ByteDance employees as part of an internal audit was able to get access to U.S. journalists' data who were covering TikTok. (CROSSTALK)",

Really interesting and gives you a snapshot of the anxiety that exists within lawmakers, what they are thinking about and their major concerns about 150 million Americans having access to this platform. I want to bring in Vanessa Yurkevich in New York. We've also got Marc Stewart standing by in Tokyo. This testimony starting out with some really tough questions coming through from House Republican Kathy Rodgers. We also heard from House Democrat Frank Pallone. And as I said, Vanessa, really just fascinating to hear some of their concerns. And they really are far ranging right from what we see on the data front but also in terms of their financials. What kind of access Shou Chew has to the ByteDance CEO and what this means in terms of ownership for the company and how that translates into how perhaps government has access to data.

It has a lot of value for these private companies but governments also realize that there is value behind these data collection points. And as we have seen in recent months, the Chinese government in particular has made efforts to try to restrict that sale of that technology to foreign companies. So despite what the CEO of TikTok may want to do and despite perhaps these different plans or solutions proposed by the U.S. government, the Chinese government could perhaps exert some muscle and put a stop to all of this. It's just a possibility. I also think it is important to point out that, even before the hearing began, just days ago, we did hear from a spokesperson in Beijing, talking about all of this discussion about TikTok. And this person said that the United States government is basically using this idea of national security to hobble and plunder foreign companies in the United States. what we hear about tension between the U.S. and China, yes, it is about economics, about politics. But all of these technological discussions are a big part of that broader umbrella. Marc Stewart, thank you so much. We will be hearing from you again as this testimony continues. I'd like to bring in my next guest, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.

And other social media platforms collect a ton of information about Americans.

Those are the arguments the government has relied to justify a ban. So I am not sure how relevant all this stuff is about kids to this particular question.

Reports about departure, now been delayed. Netanyahu will give in the words of the government press office and the pm's office that will make an important statement to the media at 8 pm local time. So in just about three hours time. We don't know precisely what he is going to say. There are reports that the defense minister and also a fellow member of Netanyahu's Likud Party in the Knesset is reported to be planning a speech in which he will call on the government pause its judicial overhaul plans. Now if this happens and this may very well be related to what Netanyahu is planning to say. If this happens, then we will have some serious news relating to this judicial overhaul. It could be a game changer. I don't want to speculate too much be we do have this important announcements. According to Prime Minister's office at least, together with these reports that the defense minister, such an important position to Israel's government, reportedly planning to come out to call for a halt to this judicial overhaul. Those two things at this stage unlikely to be coincidental and that  could have a very big impact on what we are seeing on the streets. What we have been seeing on the streets for the past three months, mass protests, tens of hundreds of thousands of people coming out against this judicial overhaul. The two key points of which would enable the government to effectively stack the supreme court with its allies and also enable the Knesset to ignore decisions by the high court, preventing them from striking down laws passed by the parliament, effectively removing all checks and balances on the government. That is what these people are out on the streets for. There have been dozens of arrests today. Police have used water cannon against protesters to unblock highways and the protesters continuing in Tel Aviv and have been taking place across the country. And before we got this news about -- we don't know what it is exactly -- we learned that Netanyahu is planning a speech, before these reports came out about defense minister planning to call for a halt to this judicial overhaul, these protesters were emboldened by the passage of this law in the wee hours of the morning, which would -- which would prevent Benjamin Netanyahu being removed from office, except with 75 out of the Knesset's 120 members of the Knesset. And only then in the case of mental or physical incapacity. So effectively make it almost impossible for Netanyahu leave office unless by his own volition, so that might embolden the protesters today. Protests have been going on midweek every week for the last 10 weeks, every weekend for the last 12-13 weeks and what we may hear from Netanyahu could bring this impasse to a close.",
