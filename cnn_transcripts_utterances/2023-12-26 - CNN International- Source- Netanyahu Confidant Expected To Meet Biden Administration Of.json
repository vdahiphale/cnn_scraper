I am Bianna Golodryga in New York.Just ahead, one of Benjamin Netanyahu's closest confidants is expected in Washington today, as the U.S. urges Israel to lower the intensity of the war. Ukraine strikes a Russian vessel off of Crimea. The Military is claiming to have destroyed the ship. At least one person was killed. And thousands of migrants join a caravan headed to the United States. We will take you to the Texas border to see how local officials are coping. As the IDF intensifying military operations inside of Gaza, a source tells CNN a close confidant of the Israeli Prime Minister is expected to meet with Biden administration officials in the coming hours. Ron Dermer is reportedly holding in-person talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan this afternoon. Now, it comes one day after Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a long fight ahead in Israel's war with Hamas, after one of the deadliest 24 hours in the Palestinian enclave since the start of the conflict. Earlier, the Prime Minister's Senior Advisor said Israeli troops were making progress in Gaza, but their campaign isn't over yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're seeing more and more Hamas terrorists voluntarily surrender to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces. We are seeing Israeli control over the ground there. And I think it's only a matter of time before we have victory there in the north. In the south, we started later, as you know, only in November. That will take a touch longer. But, we will see victory there too. And it must be understood that destroying Hamas is a prerequisite for a better future both for Israelis and Palestinians.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is also a member of the war cabinet. And this meeting in Washington, D.C. comes just a couple of days after President Biden had a lengthy conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, where notably the word \"ceasefire\", it is reported, was not urged by the United States President just yet. What are we expecting to hear from this meeting today?NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Well, Bianna, we just got confirmation from the White House National Security Council that Dermer will be meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan later this afternoon. And what we're expecting is a conversation about the next phase of the war in Gaza. The Israelis have made clear to the U.S. that they want to continue their operation in Gaza until Hamas is eliminated. However, the U.S. is urging the Israelis to more clearly define their goals and to move to a lower intensity phase of this war so that the civilians in Gaza, of course, can be spared. More than 20,000 civilians -- Palestinians, including civilians, have been killed over the last two months, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The U.S. has been urging the Israelis to move to a lower intensity phase of this conflict, one that is more targeted in its approach, one that is less reliant on heavy bombardment with airstrikes, for example. And they hope that they can urge the Israelis to move to that phase by January. That is what U.S. officials told CNN earlier this month. It's unclear, however, if the Israelis are prepared to do that. Last week, the Israelis said that they are going to continue to prosecute the war until Hamas is degraded to the extent, of course, that they can never carry out an attack again, like the one they carried out on October 7. So, that is really expected to be the focus of the discussions today. But, of course, the U.S. has been urging them to scale back their operations, and that is something that -- there are no red lines or -- on the weapons and the equipment that these -- the U.S. is giving them, but still saying that they're losing the moral high ground. They're losing international support as this war continues in the kind of intensity that it has been.",

      "sentences": "Well, the U.S. ordered these airstrikes, President Biden did yesterday, in response to a rocket attack by -- or a drone attack, I should say, by Kataib Hezbollah, which is an Iran- backed Shia militant group in Iraq, on Erbil air base in Iraq where three U.S. service members were injured, including one critically. That is really an escalation, because while there have been over 100 such attacks by these Iran-backed groups on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria over the last several months, most, if not all, of the injuries that have resulted from those strikes have been pretty minor in nature. And so, the fact that one service member is now in critical condition clearly led the U.S. to decide that it needed to respond very forcefully. So, they launched these attacks on these three facilities that they say are being used by this Iran-backed group in Iraq.According to Central Command, several of the militants are believed to have been killed. They say that at this time, they don't know of any casualties, civilian casualties that resulted from these strikes. But, this is not the first time the U.S. has launched these airstrikes against these groups in Iraq and Syria. And so far, Bianna, it has not deterred them.",

Natasha Bertrand, thank you.Well, the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza says the death toll since the war broke out is approaching 21,000, with nearly 55,000 injured. The World Health Organization has been touring Gaza's overcrowded barely functioning hospitals over the past few days. The WHO director warns that many of the injured will not survive the wait for treatment. Will Ripley joins me now from Tel Aviv. Will, just picking up from our conversation yesterday where for the first time it appeared that the IDF had given a specific figure to the number of Hamas fighters that they believe they have killed in Gaza since the war began, and that is nearly 8,000, you square that with the 20,000 plus that the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza says have been killed in total, this is a significant number. And according to the Prime Minister himself, the scale of the fighting is not going to end anytime soon. Talk to us about the reaction in both Israel and in Gaza.",

Will Ripley in Tel Aviv for us, thank you.Well, Iran and its armed proxies are vowing to retaliate against Israel over the killing of a senior member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Iranian state media says Sayyed Razi Mousavi, seen here on the left, was assassinated Monday in an Israeli airstrike in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces wouldn't comment, but Israel has for years targeted what it calls Iran-linked positions in Syria. To Ukraine now where President Zelenskyy is praising the attack on a Russian warship in Crimea. Russia's Defense Ministry says the Navy ship was damaged in an airstrike. Guided missiles from Ukraine's Air Force hit the town of Feodosia, where you can see the explosion light up the night sky. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea says one person was killed and several others were injured. Nada Bashir is following the developments for -- from London for us. And Nada, at a time when the counteroffensive was fair to say disappointing on the Ukrainian side, their offensive in Crimea continued to be a bright spot for the country.

Nada Bashir in London, thank you.Well, jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is in good spirits after a 20-day grueling prison transfer. That's according to a spokeswoman who spoke to CNN earlier today. She adds that his health is not worse than it was before the trip. In a social media post, Navalny said he is relieved to be in the new prison. His comments come after his arrival in a prison called Polar Wolf. It sits north of the Arctic Circle. Conditions there are harsh and there is no standardized mail service. Alexei Navalny is serving a 30-year sentence on a number of charges, including extremism. His supporters say the charges are trumped up. Well, still to come for us, a new caravan of migrants is headed to an already overwhelmed U.S.-Mexico border.

U.S. authorities reported a seven-day average of more than 9,600 migrant encounters along the border in December, among the highest ever recorded. And now, a new caravan of thousands of migrants is on its way to the border from southern Mexico. The surge is stretching resources for already overwhelmed U.S. agencies, and has become a political vulnerability for President Joe Biden.For more on this, let's turn to CNN's Rosa Flores who is an Eagle Pass, Texas, for us. Rosa, good to see you. So, the timing of this caravan coinciding with Secretary of State Blinken's meeting with the Mexican President, I would imagine, is not a coincidence.

And from talking to a CBP official, they tell us that a lot of these groups from Western Africa have been targeted, and they were funneled through the Arizona desert. And they're being dropped off in very large groups, about 500 to 1,000 individuals, which makes the job of the U.S. Border Patrol very difficult, because imagine, this is the rural areas of the desert. Sometimes, Border Patrol agents have to use all-terrain vehicles to get to those areas, to get to these large groups, and then figure out a way to transport them for immigration processing.And so, it really creates a nightmare for Border Patrol agents, who then have to figure out how to maximize those limited resources that they have to deal with the ongoing surge.
