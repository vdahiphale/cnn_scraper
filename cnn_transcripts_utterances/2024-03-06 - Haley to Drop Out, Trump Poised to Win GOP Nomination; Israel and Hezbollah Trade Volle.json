And next hour, we will hear from Nikki Haley, the Former South Carolina Governor and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. set to announce she is dropping out of the U.S. Presidential race. Sources say she is not however planning on endorsing Donald Trump today. Haley lost all but 1 of the 15 states where Republicans voted on Super Tuesday to the Former President setting up Trump for a November rematch with Joe Biden. The incumbent face no meaningful competition on Tuesday then swept to victory on the Democratic side. Despite several states with a notable percentage of no preference votes as they are known. CNN's Kylie Atwood is in Charleston, South Carolina, where Haley will speak at 10 am Eastern Time, she explains why Haley is not going to endorse Donald Trump, at least not for now.",

      "sentences": "What she's going to say is that there needs to be a conversation, she is going to say that Trump needs to earnthe support of her voters. And that's not altogether surprising, because we have heard from Nikki Haley over the course of the last few months saying that Trump cannot win a general election if he is losing the faction of the party that is voting for her. So she is now daring him to engage in a conversation with those voters. She has said that those voters don't want to be ignored, that they see a different vision for the future of the country. The question is how does Trump engage with them? How does he engage with her? We'll have to watch and see how that plays out. Now, one interesting thing on this conversation topic of endorsing the nominee of the Republican Party, Nikki Haley did commit to endorsing that nominee back last summer that she had to do that in order to get on the debate stage. But she has given indications in the last week or so that she was leaning in this direction, because she laid out a few reasons for why she no longer felt bound to endorse the eventual nominees saying that the Republican Party is different now than it was when she made that commitment, also noting that Former President Trump never made that commitment. So why does she have to uphold that commitment, she is bowing out today, but she is putting herself into a position of power. It is a very deft political move for Nikki Haley. And we should note that even though she didn't get enough support to keep her campaign alive, there were some states where she had a significant faction of the voters voting for her. And so her campaign is trying to use that to their advantage today, as she continues to engage in this conversation surrounding the future of the Republican Party.",

And then you saw that vitriol continue on the campaign trail, whether it was when Former President Trump attacked Nikki Haley's husband for serving the military, whether it's some of the nicknames, you certainly saw Ambassador Haley, ratchet up the rhetoric against Donald Trump, especially as she went to South Carolina on Super Tuesday. And so I do believe she will end up endorsing President Trump. I think it's going to take a little time to mend some of those wounds. And as far as her supporters go, they really are. They're not monolithic. You've got a number of Democrats who voted for her and states for the head, open primaries are no party registration, folks who have never voted for Donald Trump. You've got some independents that are looking for a Trump alternative. And you also do have a number of Republicans who when you actually go into focus groups, or you pull them, they say, we love the Trump policies give us the tax cuts, the energy regulation.

He continued to U.S. most controversial policies, the biggest policy fights when he was in office were around the issue of immigration. He's well defined on the issue and a time right now, when you have not just conservative media, not just conservative thinkers. But really those involved large, saying that immigration is the key issue that this administration has to tackle, Donald Trump has seen the political windfall of having been talking about this issue well before many others did, and not only talk about it, but receive a lot of incoming political attacks from his political adversaries over the course of the last eight years.

So what it meansis that some days you do a deal with someone some days you do deal with someone else or maybe on the opposite end of the negotiating table. This one is definitely more personal. I would be highly suspect that he would offer a position and even more so I'd be suspect that Ambassador Haley would accept any position from President Trump other than maybe the Vice Presidential nomination in order to go serve. You know having served as U.N. Ambassador, the there's only a few jobs that she might even consider. One would, of course, be Secretary of State, or maybe Vice President. I think it is unlikely President Trump would offer that position to her especially because if you look at the areas of policy where they disagrees the most. It was on National Security and Foreign Policy, Ambassador Haley was vocal in her support for additional funding for Ukraine. She was vocal in her steadfast support, not just for Israel, but also for Bibi Netanyahu. You had heard Former President Trump actually offer some critiques of Bibi Netanyahu over time. And so you do see that those are some of the biggest schisms between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. So I don't think you're going to see her as Secretary of State. And unless Donald Trump truly believed he needed her support, and he needed her as Vice President to win, which most would say there's other options for him.

Hamas said Tuesday that no prisoner exchange will happen until there is a permanent ceasefire.

I'm Becky Anderson, in AbuDhabi and you are watching \"Connect the World\". Well, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said there's no rush to cut interest rates. That means more pain for Americans who have already faced almost two years of elevated borrowing costs on everything from car loans to mortgages. His written comments come amid concerns from some on Wall Street that inflation's descent might be stalling. And the U.S. woke up to big election news this morning, Nikki Haley dropping out of the Republican nomination race after big losses in yesterday's Super Tuesday Primaries.

The Egyptian pound hit a record low today weakening more than 35 percent after the country's Central Bank hiked interest rates and said it would let the currency trade freely. Following the move, Reuters reports the IMF has just approved a long awaited $8 billion loan to Egypt in response. Now look, Egypt has been struggling with a chronic shortage of foreign currency and persistent inflation which has reached unprecedented levels in recent months. Well to break this down for us, joining us to discuss this is Timothy Kaldas. He's Deputy Director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. Put this in simple terms for us if you will.

They actually devalued and continued to manage it which led to a number of problems. If it's truly a float it's going to result in at least a period of some instability as the currency arrives at some balance and equilibrium in the market. There are potential inflationary consequences, but a lot of the goods in the Egyptian market are already priced at the black market rate, which was significantly higher than even what the official rate is trading at now. It reached at one point as much as 70 Egyptian pounds to the dollar whereas to the official rate is currently at 50. So it still remains to be seen. In the long term it really depends again, on what the government does if it actually reforms in the ways that it's pledged to and reining in the military's companies, reducing the large number of unaffordable and poorly planned mega projects, these sorts of things. Maybe it could be a sign that you know they're moving in a more sustainable direction.

There's no doubt that the IMF approving increasing the size of Egypt's loan that was originally agreed to in 2022, is indirect response to the flotation of the pound. However, if the pound proves not to be floating, they might not disperse that money. That's already the case with the loan from 2022. Where because the pound wasn't floating and other forms weren't implemented, the IMF never actually dispersed most of that $3 billion dollars that was originally agreed to. So it remains to be seen that the loan will actually be dispersed in the tranches in the years to come.

And just once again, though, we have to hope that this money is used prudently unlike the last decade, frankly. And additionally, I would say that Egyptians, I mean, I have mixed feelings about this deal. Because for the last couple of years, it's felt like the Egyptian government has been selling public assets, public companies more or less under duress due to the extraordinary financial strain that Egyptian state is under.

And if you look at the opinion polling that was conducted by \"The New York Times\", over the weekend, you can see a lot of these people are Democrats or Independents who behave like Democrats, or are Republicans, but Republicans who have effectively left the party in the era of Trump. So it's not like a bunch of Trump voters switched to Nikki Haley. And now we'll be going back. Largely these people weren't with Trump to begin with. So what is the block? I mean, look, Trump's got issues, college educated suburban voters, there's no doubt he's got issues with those people. But a lot of the folks in that group that went with Haley, they were already against Trump anyway, they were against Trump in 2020. And I don't anticipate them coming back.",

Any moment now we are going to hear from Nikki Haley, theformer South Carolina Governor, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations set to announce that she is dropping out of the U.S. Presidential Race after the Super Tuesday primaries. Haley lost all but one of the 15 states where Republicans voted yesterday to former President Donald Trump. Of note sources say Haley will not endorse Trump, at least not today. He will face Joe Biden in a November rematch. We'll bring you Haley's remarks as soon as she starts speaking. And Erica Hill is in New York as we wait for Haley to take to the stage. Let's just discuss what we expect to hear, just import, how important -- hello, Erica, just how important is this moment in the election season to American voters? Let's start there. ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR AND U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So for a lot of American voters, Becky, this is really the inevitable solidifying. There has been so much talk both in the U.S. and abroad about how this was expected to in fact, be a rematch of 2020 between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. And Donald Trump, as you have seen, and as you just pointed out, even on Super Tuesday, taking 14 of those 15 contests. He has done very well with voters thus far in the primaries and caucuses in the United States. So it is an important moment because it solidifies this race moving forward. So for the next eight plus months, it will now clearly be this rematch of 2020.",

And I guess it was you know, clearly, she'd been speaking to donors recently, the big donorsand -- said Super Tuesday, you know, is where it's all at this point. And clearly the math doesn't add up to her gaining the candidacy at this point. But she could have waited until conference season, couldn't she? By that stage, she could have banked on the fact as far as her -- will be concerned that Donald Trump might be convicted by then.",
