We're live in Dubai and we start withbreaking news of Russia's President ordering a temporary ceasefire to the war in Ukraine for Orthodox Christmas. The Kremlin announcing the ceasefire last hour, it follows an appeal for a 36 hour truce by Patriarch Kirill the Head of the Orthodox Church in Moscow to allow Orthodox Christians to attend services Friday and Saturday. It is notable that Kirill has been a vocal supporter of Russia's war and is feuding over that starts with Pope Francis who calls it Russian expansionism and imperialism. Scott McLean is back with us this hour from Kyiv. And we've also got International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, in London for us. Scott, I want to start with you. Patriarch Kirill spoke about this ceasefire earlier for Orthodox Christmas. Putin the Kremlin now agreeing to it, we still haven't heard from the Ukrainians.",

The Kremlin agreeing to what Patriarch Kirill the Head of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow had called for which is the ceasefire beginning noon, tomorrow Christmas Eve in the Orthodox faith through the rest of Christmas day as well. The Russians put out a statement essentially saying look the ball is in your court Ukraine and we're just getting the first response here. This is from an Advisor to President Zelenskyy. His name is Mykhailo Podolyak he is commonly outspoken on many issues. And he said the Russian Orthodox Church is not an authority for global orthodoxy and acts as a war propagandist. The Russian Orthodox Church called for the genocide of Ukrainians incited mass murder and insists on even greater militarization of the Russian Federation. So not exactly a direct response, not exactly a confirmation that the Ukrainians plan to go along with this but clearly, a lot of cynicism coming from the Ukrainian side on this. You can imagine how Ukrainian troops are feeling out there on the front lines having been told things that the Russians were going to do in the past, and then the Russians not keeping their word. The Russians even before this war began, said they had no plans to invade Ukraine and look where we are right now. And so I think the Ukrainians are probably feeling pretty cynical about this offer, and that it's not a genuine offer, or that it won't be a genuine ceasefire. So it's hard to imagine that the Ukrainians won't be on guard, even if they're not necessarily launching missiles across the other side of the front line. But again, we're waiting to hear something a little bit more direct, a little bit more firm Eleni.",

First Ukraine doesn't attack foreign territory and doesn't kill civilians, as Russian Federation does. Ukraine destroyed only members of the occupation army on its territory. Second Russian Federation must leave the occupied territories, only then will it have a temporary truce, excuse me keep hypocrisy to you. So, Mykhailo Podolyak, I should point out has been involved in the early peace talks in the early days of the war between the Russians and the Ukrainians, the ones that were held, just inside the Belarus border. And so this is a very high ranking official. He also commonly comments on some of the explosions inside of Russia, the ones that Ukraine has not taken official responsibility for. And so we'll see what President Zelenskyy says, but it seems like this is the most official thing that we've heard. And that seems that the Ukrainians have no interest in going along with this ceasefire, because they simply do not trust the Russians. I should also point out that, you know, Ukraine is also trying to or since its independence has really tried to distance itself from the Russian Orthodox Church. And even there have been plenty of questions about Patriarch Kirill since this war began since he's been openly supportive of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even in a recent sermon; he said that military service will wash away all sins.

And one of the things about the mass that took place is that while Pope Francis was presiding over it. He was sitting for most of the time; most of the service was actually carried out by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. However, Pope Francis did get up at various times we saw it there in Delia's report. And he praised a Pope Benedict XVI, obviously, for his life's work but also, of course, for all the things and the importance that he had in the Catholic Church. And I think it's something I really can't say often enough is that Pope Benedict XVI won his papacy was not very long. It was a little under eight years. He certainly was a towering figure here in the Vatican, really, over the past four decades really important in setting the course of the Vatican setting course of the Catholic Church, in his capacity there and so definitely an era coming to an end here in the Vatican in the Catholic Church with a major thinker and theologian being laid to rest today. And you know Delia was talking about the mood here on the St. Peter's Square. And it's true; there really weren't very many dignitaries here. That's exactly what Pope Francis would have wanted. That's what Pope Benedict would have wanted. I'm sorry. He said that he wanted his funeral to be more of a humble affair. But I do think that many people showed supports that were very important to Pope Benedict XVI. Obviously, a very large German delegation was here. I think that's something was very attached to his homeland. And then also a very large Bavarian delegation was here as well. And you could see those chants of Santo Subito that Delia was talking about in her report; those very much seem to us to be coming from that faction coming from Bavaria, obviously a towering figure there. And I think that the folks in that part of Germany have always seen Pope Benedict, Cardinal Ratzinger, as he was before as being one of their own and someone who they always felt remained true to the roots of where he came from, Eleni.",

One, for example, was with him in the Pope mobile, as he proceeded up the mile on what was effectively a state visit of the Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church, to the United Kingdom. And I never ever dreamt that I would see the day when the people flag and the Union Jack, were there side by side right up the whole of the mound as it approaches Buckingham Palace. And that was a very remarkable occasion. And that actually was on journey to Hyde Park in the center of London, where there was a vigil of prior to the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman. And as we went up the mile, I said to Pope Benedict, we're now going to Hyde Park. And we're going to use the stage that the BBC has kindly left there for our use this weekend. Because last weekend, it was used for proms in the park, I said last weekend it was the music this weekend is the prayer. And he turned to smile to me and he said, oh, don't forget that music is always prayer, too.

Now, when we do our task of drawing a judgment or a balance sheet, it is important that we pay attention to the facts and not just to impressions. So it is a fact that, during his time in charge of the Doctrinal Commission. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Pope Benedict laicized, over 400 priests. He changed the laws of the church. He urged them to be changed when he was Pope did make those changes so that the scandal in the terrible actions of the abuse of children could be tackled more head on. If there is anybody who created and put into practice what we now like to talk of as a policy of zero tolerance, then it was Pope Benedict.

The question is whether or not he can peel back any of the 20 members who have so far denied him the 218 votes, he needs to be elected speaker. And until there is a speaker, this body is paralyzed that can't even swear in members that can't legislate, that cant's organize committees and must elect a speaker. And right now, Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes to become the speaker. Even if some of these members do accept these concessions, which essentially would give them more power over the speakership more power to dictate the terms of the legislation on the floor. Even if some of those members accept those terms, that is not enough to win over enough Republicans who are asking for other issues as McCarthy goes behind closed doors and tries to alleviate concerns member my member in order to get the magic number of 2018. Another concern, there are four members who are almost certain he will never get to vote for him, and he can only afford to lose, four votes for Republican votes. That means he cannot lose any additional votes in order to get there. Now, McCarthy still believes he will get there, they believe they can find some sort of deal.

Paul Ryan was seen as a consensus that person does not exist in this Republican conference. So even if they find a plan B, who is even potentially Steve Scalise often, mentioned he's the number two Republican right now, could he just emerge as a speaker nominee? That would be difficult because there are some members who won't vote for him, there are some members who want similar demands from him that there are making of Kevin McCarthy.

We're now learning that a player's mother is the one who reported Gregg Berhalter for kicking his then girlfriend who is now his wife during an argument in 1991. Berhalter has said he regrets the incident. Brynn Gingras is following the story for us. Multiple angles playing out here, what is the latest? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes Eleni, you know at first it was like why is this coming up this soccer this incident with the coach was back in 1991 why is it coming to light now? Well it does seem like this all generates from the classic you know habit in sports. That's the worst habit and that's about parents being annoyed about how much playing time their kids get. And it's all playing out very publicly between two soccer family dynasties who also happen to be friends at least they were. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GINGRAS (voice over): After leading the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team in the 2022 Qatar World Cup. CINDY PARLOW CONE, PRESIDENT, U.S. SOCCER: On December 11 we initiated an investigation into an allegation of past misconduct against Gregg Berhalter. GINGRAS (voice over): U.S. Soccer is investigating men's national team Head Coach Gregg Berhalter over a 1991 domestic violence altercation between him and his wife, Rosalynn, while they were in college.",

Now,again, there is an investigation that is still going on. And it's important to note when U.S. Soccer released information about the investigation. They did say that there was other potential inappropriate behavior toward members of staff and organization that are also being investigated, not just this incident with the head coach. So we'll wait to see how that wraps up what we learn more, but in the meantime, that head coach is going through contract negotiations. And for now the assistant coach Anthony Hudson is going to be leading the team for its next steps in the meantime, Eleni?",

It just seemed very strange, who was blackmailing and the fact that it's, you know, the family of one of the own players. Certainly more has to come out about this because you almost feel bad for the 20 year old who's the center of this and then his parents are feuding with the coach. I mean, it's, it's just really sad on all levels, but certainly we're waiting to see what more comes out once that investigation wraps up.",

His teammate says our boy is doing better, awake and showing signs of improvement. And his agent is also telling CNN that he is awake and he has been holding the hands of his family members inside of the hospital, all of this after what the world witnessed on Monday night during that football game. Following a tackle Damar Hamlin stood up briefly for about two seconds and then he fell down backward, he collapse. We learned from doctors that he suffered a cardiac arrest. And within seconds medics were at his side, performing CPR for nearly nine minutes before transporting him here to this hospital where he has been ever since in the intensive care unit fighting for his life. That fight still continues as the doctors treating him say he is still critically ill. But this is progress. And it is a sign of hope.

On Wednesday, Rio de Janeiro renamed the street that leads to the city's famous Maracana Stadium King Pele Avenue; it was originally going to just be Pele Avenue. But fans flooded the Rio met his Twitter feed with demands that the word King be added. In 2021, there was a push to rename Maracana Stadium off to Pele, but it was met with some opposition and was abandoned. Pele played most of his career in other stadiums, though he did score some memorable goals at the Maracana. A rare winter heat wave is spreading throughout Europe while many are welcoming the unusually warm temperatures. Some climatologist say there's reason for concern. Here is CNN Isa Soares with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The New Year may have only just begun, but temperatures are already heating up across much of Europe. At least eight countries smashed their winter weather record having recorded their warmest day ever in January. As the world rang in New Year celebrations this week, climatologists were busy tracking extreme temperatures and found countries including Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein and Belarus all reached alarmingly warm temperatures on January the first. Meteorologists say it's too early to attribute the extreme heat to climate change. But do say the driving force is a warm air mass from Africa's west coast, moving across Europe. It may look warm in the Spanish city of Bilbao, but locals are noticeably wearing winter coats basking in the winter sun.",
