In the past there have been plane crashes in which he's been on the passenger manifest and then he's emerged a few days later saying, you know, I'm not dead.So now we have confirmation from the authorities that genetic testing has revealed that everybody on that passenger manifest, including Yevgeny Prigozhin, has been confirmed as killed. So, that's something. But what we don't know is why that plane, which was flying from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Wednesday, plunged in a - in a fireball into the earth. The Kremlin have categorically denied any - any link with it, saying that allegation that they were involved are absolute lies. But that denial hasn't done much to quell speculation both in Russia and outside of Russia this could have been some kind of state involvement and revenge to the uprising that Yevgeny Prigozhin staged back in June with Wagner fighters, with them - him at the head, sort of marching towards the Russian capital and demanding the overflow or the departure of Russia's senior military leadership. Again, the Kremlin categorically denied that but, you know, and they say that an investigation is underway now to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. And when those results are ready, they say, they'll make them public. But, yes, no one's holding their breath for that, Rahel.",

They funded it through Russian government funds to give them basically a deniable military capability in the Middle East and across Africa. And more recently used in Ukraine, as you point out. So, it's a valuable asset. I don't think they want to destroy it. They may rebrand it.But I think Putin wanted to be sure, as sure as he could be, that he would have control over key parts of the Wagner group if Prigozhin suddenly met his maker. And I suspect he believes he has that now and he wants to focus everybody's attention, regular military and Wagner group, on not losing any more ground in Ukraine.",

If Putin said, look, this war has gone on long enough, let's have a ceasefire in place, let's negotiate immediately, what would Emmanuel Macron of France do? He might well jump in to be the peacemaker. Germany's position here is shaky. And, let's face it, the White House has not aided the Ukrainians in the most effective way. They're about to go into a very shaky general election for President Biden. Maybe he wants to be a peacemaker.",

But I think a jury verdict of guilty is something very different. I think even a lot of MAGA Trumpers really don't want to elect a convicted felon president.
