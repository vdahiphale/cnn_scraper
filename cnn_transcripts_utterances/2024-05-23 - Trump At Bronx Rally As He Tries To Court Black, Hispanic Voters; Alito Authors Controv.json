And later, a heartwarming reunion between retired Lt. Gen. Russell Honore and twin boys he famously helped in the difficult days after Hurricane Katrina. Good evening. Right now, the former president is at a rally in the South Bronx, home to 27 world championships, the birthplace of hip-hop and a population much different from the usual crowd of Trump supporters, where black and Latino people vastly outnumber whites. He lost the Bronx to President Biden by about 68 points in 2020. Days ahead of the closing arguments in his criminal hush money trial, the former president laid into President Biden and touted his New York roots, a far different tone from the man who once took out full-page ads pushing for the death penalty for five black youths known as The Central Park Five, who were falsely accused and convicted in a 1989 attack on a 28-year-old female jogger. They were later exonerated. Trump has never apologized. He famously made headlines pushing the lie that Barack Obama, America's first African-American president, was not born in the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I wasn't sure what to expect. I've gone to a lot of these rallies across the country and there are often people who travel hundreds of miles to see Donald Trump and they're not necessarily part of the community. However, one of the things that I found was that there were a lot of people here that were actually from the Bronx before we even came into the rallies. That, of course, once we were in, it was all people supporting him. Before we actually even came in, we talked to a number of people outside in the community and the reaction to him being here was really mixed. You had people saying he doesn't belong here. He should get out. But you also had a number of people voters who told me that they had supported Biden in 2020.

We lost that race, and the RNC at the time published the Growth and Opportunity Project. I remember my dear friend Elise Stefanik, now congresswoman, reached out and said, hey, I'd love to get your assessment on strategy in terms of what the party should do in regards to outreach. The party wasn't successful, Anderson. And fast forward, out of all people, Donald Trump appears, at least, to be attempting to make some efforts. And I wouldn't ignore these things.
