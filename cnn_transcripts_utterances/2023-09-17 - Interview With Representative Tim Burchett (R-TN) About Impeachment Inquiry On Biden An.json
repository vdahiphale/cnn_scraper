Good evening.Right now President Biden is on his way to New York where he's slated to meet with world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The stakes could not be higher for the Ukrainian leader as his country faces an uphill battle in its counteroffensive against Russian forces. He's expected to seek more support from the U.S. and its allies. But as the president prepares for another moment on the world stage, he's facing major political headaches back here in Washington. House Republicans are moving forward with an impeachment inquiry against him. And when asked about it at the White House earlier this afternoon, he laughed and told reporters his response to McCarthy is, quote, \"lots of luck.\" And that's just one fight up on Capitol Hill. A government shutdown is also looming as the deadline to get a spending bill passed in Congress inches closer. Let's discuss that and more with Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. Congressman, we've got a lot of ground to cover. Thanks so much for being with us. Let me ask you this. Starting on the impeachment inquiry, as you know, one of your Republican colleagues in the House, Ken Buck, is making some headlines for condemning the Republican impeachment effort against President Biden. He says the GOP is relying on what he calls an imagined history. What do you think? Do you agree? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Ken is a former prosecutor. He's an honorable guy and he's a dear friend. As a matter of fact, we were sitting side by side on January 6th when all that went down. So I would -- I listen to what he says. He doesn't speak often, but when he does, he does it with a great deal of class and intellect. So I take everything he says seriously, Jim, honestly. I wouldn't brush it off because he makes some valid points. He's stated how does that tie -- you know, when he was vice president, all this criminal activity, how does that, you know, forward into being president? And there's a gap there. And so I think that's what -- you know, honestly, I think that's what part of the inquiry -- I'm not an attorney, but I think that's what the inquiry will do, will allow for more of that activity. I just wish we could -- (CROSSTALK)",

We've sent basically $114 billion unchecked to Ukraine. We spent -- you know, I think the conservatives and frankly some of the moderates are concerned about the border situation, the fentanyl.I mean, you've seen the numbers. It's ridiculous. And there's no other reason to do that other than to say we've made a mistake at the border. And that mistake is multi-presidential, and it continues on into the Biden administration exponentially.

How should the media approach these interviews with the former president? You know, Oliver, one of the thoughts that I had is that going into the next sit-down interview with the former president, if you're going to do it taped and so on, why not have a fact-checker, typically the correspondent or anchor has a producer with him or her.Why not have a fact-checker in there as well?

But I think the key thing is you don't interview him as if he's a normal politician. This is someone who tried to subvert democracy in the 2020 election. And so the interview should be focused on holding him to account, not trying to make, you know, news as a lot of other people do.It has to be about holding power to account and focusing on the damaging lies that he has told about the election and the damaging actions he took in the aftermath of the election that led to an insurrection on the U.S. Capitol.",

Had Donald Trump just accepted the fact that he lost the election, you know, there would have been no January 6th. There would not have been an insurrection at the Capitol.So to blame this on anybody but himself is just not dealing with reality. And I do want to say I worked with Kristen Welker at the White House, when she was with NBC and I was with CNN, covering the White House, and I just thought she was a fantastic reporter over there. So I'm sure they're going to go back and look at what took place and try to smooth things out for the future. But let me ask you this, Oliver. Let's switch gears, talk about the writers' strike. Today Drew Barrymore backtracked on the decision to bring back her daytime talk show. This stunned a lot of people late last week when they said, OK, no, we're going back on the air.

We really try to find a way to move forward and I truly hope for a resolution for the entire industry very soon.And she also said that she's not going to be returning back to the air until this writers' strike concludes. The other talk show, \"The Talk,\" also pausing coming back. And so what's interesting as you saw last week, all these shows announced basically that they were going to move forward with their season premieres despite the writers' strike. Now that they're facing some backlash, you know, he writers were picketing outside of these sets. Now that they're facing some backlash they're pausing and reversing those decisions.",

And that's about as high as it ever was during the initial surges in 2020, and we're getting close to what it was at the peaks of Delta and Omicron.So there's a tremendous amount of COVID in the community. Hospitalizations have been up every week for the last eight weeks. Hospitalizations are up in the last week about 10 percent. Deaths are up about 5 percent.",

We've managed to politicize health in the United States. If you -- and to the detriment of many people.If you look, the best way to look at this is look what happened to the United States after vaccines became available to everyone, to all adults, which was the spring of 2021. Before that, in every state and by party, basically mortality was the same. But after the spring of 2021 when vaccines were rolled out en masse, you started to see this differential split. And if you looked at House districts that voted for GOP candidates, the mortality for COVID was higher. And the answer to why is simple. Vaccine uptake amongst GOP voting folks in this country was much lower than for people who voted Democrat in the United States.",
