All right, for the second time in a matter of weeks, a stowaway without a plane ticket managed to get through TSA and on to a Delta flight. This time it happened at Seattle Tacoma International Airport. The flight was headed to Honolulu and taxiing out for takeoff when the stowaway was discovered. This all comes weeks after this woman that you're seeing there traveled all the way to Paris after sneaking on to a Delta flight in New York. CNN's Carlos Suarez is at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Carlos, what can you tell us about this latest incident?

And so this passenger, it appears, was able to spend some time at the terminal before boarding this Delta flight on Christmas Eve without a ticket.And so, as you noted, the flight was about to depart. It was taxiing out from the gate when the crew members on board the flight realized that they had a passenger without a ticket, and so they were able to get back to the gate. However, this passenger was able to get off the plane before authorities arrived at the gate, although, we're told that they were able to take the passenger into custody at a bathroom at Seattle's airport there. Delta did put out a statement that said, in part, that they of course, nothing is more important to them than safety and security. And so Delta people, according to them, followed the procedures to have this un-ticketed passenger removed from the flight and then apprehended. The passenger's identity has not been released, though were told that the passenger was charged with trespassing. Sara?",

So problem spots across the south because of that, the pacific northwest has continued to be a problem spot from Seattle to Portland and San Francisco because of an atmospheric river. Rain, snow, gusty winds have really just been nonstop, and that continues through the weekend as well.The severe storm threat across the south is not too terrible today, but really ramps up going into tomorrow. We have a level three out of five enhanced risk from eastern Louisiana across parts of Mississippi. That's where we can find damaging winds, large hail, and strong tornadoes likely. We're talking EF-two or greater. And then this risk starts to shift east as we go through the rest of the weekend. Now, you're mentioning December tornadoes. Again, not that not that common. If you get them, they would be along the Gulf Coast. Thats where we could find them this time of year. We already had some yesterday, but overall December is our least likely month to get tornadoes, averaging only about 40 in the entire month, much less than about the 200 that we get in March and April. So again, very rare, not impossible. And it's already been a pretty active year for tornadoes, more than 1,700 tornadoes reported already this year, way above the average. So staying pretty active. So again, the storms will continue to blow up across the south today. The rain stretching up the east coast. But they get even more severe going into tomorrow, an intense line of storms capable of those tornadoes. Even if you don't find too many major airports in the way here, any planes would have to fly around all of this. You cannot fly through a storm that is capable of creating a tornado. That thunderstorm would be tall and packed with a lot of lightning. So flights would need to detour around all of those storms around the south. So as we go towards tomorrow, you can see where some moderate delays are possible because of all of those storms even stretching towards Atlanta. And then as we get towards Sunday, it stretches up the east coast, Washington, D.C., New York, where all that rain is possible. And then again, notice the pacific northwest just continuing with these problems through the weekend. Kate?",

Authorities also say that there was a conspiracy of sorts, that this officer, this deputy had with other deputies to essentially alter the police report. Other deputies coaching him to leave out the fact that this all started because the victim here flipped him off. In fact, with the deputy, ended up writing, is that he pulled over this individual because of an air freshener that was hanging from his rearview mirror. He's also been accused of lying to the FBI. We also hear in this plea agreement, just some really troubling details. It appears some of these deputies actually texted each other saying, hey, let's delete all these messages before this federal probe. So, a lot of concerning behavior there.

And I think it's very difficult to come up with another scenario -- the tail section of the aircraft -- so, I do think, you know, some of the things to consider here is if there was an active military activity in that area, why wasn't the airspace closed down? And on the airline's part, that's part of their responsibility as well before you dispatch an airliner. One of the issues that the dispatchers should consider is the security in the area.

And what is the responsibility of the airline with regard to that? Where is the line there?O'BRIEN: There's responsibility on both sides here. Russia didn't close down the airspace to civilian activity. I could speculate and presume that Russia didn't want to, you know, cause any -- attract attention to the fact that it is in the case maybe on its back heel in that ongoing conflict in that region. That's possible. As for the airline, um, you know, it might have been a situation where they've been flying so long in that context of an ongoing conflict that they assumed it would be okay. I will say this, that generally speaking, the way that surface to air missile batteries avoid civilian airliners is making sure they know the schedule and the flight corridors. In this case, the aircraft had what we call a missed approach, which means it would have had a deviation from the norm. And so, the aircraft would have been in a place that they would not have expected it. And in a hair trigger environment that could have led to what you saw.",
