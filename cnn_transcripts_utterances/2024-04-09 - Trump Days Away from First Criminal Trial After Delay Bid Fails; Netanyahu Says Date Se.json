Sara is out today. This is CNN News Central. All right, barring any final Hail Mary or additional legal long shot, which, of course, can happen, but just stick with me, this morning, Donald Trump is six days away from becoming the first former president to go on criminal trial. Overnight, a New York appeals court just rejected his latest bid to delay or relocate the hush money, that he's facing 34 charges, which means the trial will start Monday, which means the 2024 presidential race now heads back into a courtroom. Starting next week, Donald Trump will be forced to sit in court four days a week. As prosecutors try to convince a jury, he broke the law when he allegedly falsified business records to cover up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. The first big question, who will be on the jury for this historic trial? CNN has obtained the jury questionnaire. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has much more on this for us. So, Katelyn, what is the potential jury pool going to be asked?",

They're going to be asked questions if they have some sort of real bias for or against him.Here're some of the questions that the jurors, potential jurors in New York County are going to be asked. Do you currently follow Donald Trump on any social media site, or have you done so in the past? That's one of the questions. Do you have anyone in your family, any close friends, or have you yourself worked for or volunteered for his presidential campaign, his administration? And then, crucially, do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump or the fact that he is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be fair and impartial as a juror? That is the question that if someone answers, yes, the judge says he doesn't even want to ask them more questions about that, that's going to remove people from the jury pool, this self-reporting of jurors saying, I can't be fair and impartial about Donald Trump. There are also going to be questions about whether people have any affiliation or have subscribed at some point to the QAnon movement or any of the fringe -- more fringe, right or left wing political extremist groups, the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, even Antifa on the left. Those are the things that jurors will be asked to weed them out. They only need 12, though, ultimately, and a couple more as alternates for this jury, for this trial to take place. There's going to be a flurry of activity over the next couple of days, Kate. Yesterday we saw that, where Donald Trump tried to put a pause on things and get the trial moved out of New York City, and that didn't fly. The appeals court handled it within about two hours and said, no, we're not moving and we're not putting a pause on things. We're going to try and seat a jury.",

So we're going to start with a pool of Manhattanites, New York County only, no Bronx, no Staten Island only, Manhattanites. The first thing after they fill out the questionnaire, the judge will dismiss some of them who are simply unable to serve. Maybe there's a physical limitation, maybe they have a job, doctor or teacher, that just doesn't allow them to be out for six weeks.Then we're going to get into, based on in part on those jury questionnaires, what we call for cause removals. Meaning if someone answers that question we just saw from Katelyn Polantz, yes, I do have such strong feelings about Donald Trump that I could not possibly judge him fairly, either way, they're out, and that's on the judge. Then you're going to narrow down your pool of what we call qualified jurors. But it's not over at that point, this is where the strategy really kicks in. Because each side, Donald Trump's team and the D.A., get ten what we call peremptory strikes, meaning you can remove up to ten jurors for almost any reason. Not for racially discriminatory reasons or other constitutionally barred reasons, but I don't like the vibe of that person. I don't think that person is good for us.

Meaning 80-some percent do not like him or do not like him enough to vote for him. On the other hand, if you're Donald Trump's team, all you need is one. You get one juror through there who really likes Donald Trump, who's sympathetic to him. That can result -- that will result in a hung jury. Remember, you need all 12 to convict. 11 to 1 is a hung jury. It's a mistrial and that's a terrible outcome --",

The question that the attorneys have to answer here, as prescribed by the Supreme Court, and we can put the graphic of this up, is whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office, emphasis added by me, alleged to involve official acts.

And, second of all, does Donald Trump fall within the scope of the job. And one thing that Jack Smith is clearly concerned about having read that brief last night, he wants to avoid a scenario where the Supreme Court sends the case back down to the trial court and says, you have to hold the hearing. You have to tell us was he within the scope or not because that would be a scheduling disaster. And you can see Smith even in the brief at one point, he says, well, if that's the question you should let the trial court judge determine that during trial, which, to me, isn't really workable.

That's because yesterday, as Israeli troops carried out, a major withdrawal from Southern Gaza, including from Khan Younis, where Israeli forces have been engaged in combat over the last several weeks, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, a right wing member of Netanyahu's governing coalition, as well as Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, both of them expressing outrage at that withdrawal, and Ben-Gvir explicitly saying that Netanyahu will lose his mandate to govern, effectively threatening to bolt from that governing coalition if a Rafah offensive is not carried out before the end of the war. And so, following suit, several hours later, the Israeli prime minister, in a video statement, saying that Rafah will happen and claiming that a date has even been set. Now, we do know that Israeli troops that withdrew from southern Gaza did so, according to Israel's defense minister, to kind of rest and refit and prepare for the coming battles, whether that will be in the north, a potential escalation of the conflict with Hezbollah has been on the horizon for some time, but also, of course, potentially for that major offensive in Rafah.

But Hamas, in a statement early this morning, rejecting the latest Israeli counterproposal, saying that the latest proposal does not meet their demands. We know that one of the key sticking points beyond the numbers of Palestinian prisoners who would be released in exchange for some 40 Israeli hostages, where we know that Israel has been offering more and more numbers of Palestinian prisoners, but beyond that, the real sticking points really relate to two key issues, and that is the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, which Hamas has been pushing for a full and total withdrawal, leading to a permanent ceasefire, but also the return of Palestinians who are in Southern Gaza, who want to return to Northern Gaza. Hamas has been insisting on full and unfettered access to Northern Gaza during the period of this truce. The Israeli government initially rejected this notion all together. Then it began talking about numbers of Palestinians per day, security checks along a corridor separating Northern and Southern Gaza, but that isn't enough, it seems, so far for Hamas to be to accept. Now, the last piece of information today, the Israeli security cabinet is set to meet, Kate, and they will be discussing these negotiations to see if there is a path forward.",
