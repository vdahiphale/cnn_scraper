The sticking points, though, as we still understand, have been the hostages. How many Palestinian prisoners would Hamas -- would Israel release from jails for the hostages that Hamas would release? And then, Hamas' demands for a permanent ceasefire, a complete pullout of Israeli troops, and the return of people displaced to the south of Gaza return back to the north. These have been the sticking points.What we know at the moment is that the meetings went late into the night, Sunday night. CIA chief, Bill Burns, we understand, is headed back to Washington. The Egyptians are saying that they think that the talks could resume in a couple of days and they're creating an impression that there is a slight shift in the dynamic, but no details at the moment, which also in itself can be indicative that perhaps there is a sense, more optimism behind the scenes, because oftentimes if the two sides feel they've got nothing out of it, they walk away and say nothing has changed, the other side sticking. We're not hearing that right now. But, it's too soon to know, for sure.",

He is perhaps at a level of many of the other Hezbollah commanders who we've seen Israel target recently without forcing or without triggering Hezbollah into an escalation. The magnitude of what the United States says was Israel's strike on the consulate, the Iranian consulate in Damascus, and the death of a very senior, at least, one very, very senior IRGC commander in place, and Iran is giving the impression and certainly what I'm hearing from sources in the region is that Iran will make the response for what happened in Damascus, and it won't come from Hezbollah.So, this may not trigger a bigger confrontation with Hezbollah at the moment. It's certainly not going to dampen the current tit-for-tat strikes we're seeing in of itself. I don't think it's going to lead to an escalation. While the talks are going on in Cairo, if something can be achieved in Cairo with Hamas, then that opens the door for more effective U.S. diplomacy to tamp things down between Israel and Hezbollah. The dynamic is fluid. But, I don't think this particular strike on this particular Hezbollah commander triggers a massive escalation. I don't think that will happen.",

Millions of people will be able to see the total solar eclipse across North America. 10 U.S. states will see the moon completely cover the Sun. In all 49 states, people will see at least a partial eclipse. It has been seven years since the last total eclipse was visible from the United States. The next won't be visible in the U.S. until 2044. So, the question is, who will have clear skies to view the eclipse, and where will the weather be a spoiler?

If you can put your finger through the glasses, they're not good. They're not the real ones. They need to meet the international standard. So, yes, these are the real ones. And right at the center of this third eye is very important information. You see that it says eclipse times two. Well, that's because Kerrville is actually a really special place to be for this eclipse. We have a map from NASA and I want you to look at this, because there is an x of two paths of totality. And right in the middle, that is Kerrville. So, there was an annual eclipse in October and then there is the eclipse that is happening today. And that's why people think that this particular spot is so special because it is going to experience two eclipses in a matter of six months. Now, I talked to the mayor of this town. She said that they're expecting about 100,000 people from all over the world. She is preparing. They're preparing for traffic contraflow to make sure that people can exit after maximum totality.

We are hoping for hoping for a clear day, so we can enjoy this eclipse.Another -- the reason people are coming to Torreon is not only because the eclipse is obviously going over, but NASA is utilizing two telescopes that are here permanently, and they are going to be following the eclipse. There are tens of scientists from all over the world. And we have seen tourists come from as far as England, Barcelona that have made the trip to see what happens here in Mexico. And what I'm hearing from most of them is, well, this is real Mexico. A lot of them say, well, we've been to Cancun. We've been to Cabo. Those are the tourist destinations. This is real Mexico. So, it's also giving people a chance to know other parts of the country. Also, science is going to be a big part of this event. You can hear, we were mentioning the animals. Here in this forest, it's a natural habitat for a lot of birds. You can hear them right now. And we have noticed over the morning, as the Sun has risen, how different birds have been making different sounds. And right now, they're actually more quiet than when we started about an hour ago. So, those are the kinds of things that scientists are going to be listening to starting out. So -- and people are going to be able to enjoy. The city is excited, not only the city, the whole country, Mexico is going to be the first country to experience the eclipse. It is going to start in Mazatlan, Mexico, right on the Pacific Coast. They run out of hotels. I was told a year ago they're expecting an extra half million people in that city. Here, they are expecting over 750,000 people to be in the different points. Torreon has a little hill where they have a statue of Christ, the second largest in the world after Rio de Janeiro. So, that's another destination. And farther north is, there is a desert, Desierto de Cuatrocienegas, where they expect that if they're lucky enough to have the total darkness, it is total darkness because there is no cities around. There is no artificial light. So, it's going to be a really nice show to watch before it gets into Texas.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The world at a historic turning point, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tells me ahead of a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden this week. The longtime partners will upgrade their defense relationship to the next level in the backdrop of mounting international security challenges. FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (Interpreted): In our neighborhood, there are countries that are developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, and others that are building up their defense capabilities in an opaque way. Also, there is a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in both the East China Sea and South China Sea. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Kishida says soaring geopolitical tensions forced Japan, long a pacifist country, to change its defense posture, moves not seen since World War Two. Under his leadership, Japan plans to boost its defense spending to two percent of its GDP by 2027, and purchase weapons, including U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, acquiring counterstrike capabilities for the first time in decades.",

It could come against Israeli targets.Remember, administration and intelligence officials have said for months since this war began after the October 7 attacks, that Iran has no interest in getting involved directly. They're happy to have their proxies in Yemen, in Iraq, Syria, in Lebanon, to carry out strikes against U.S. and Israeli interest, but they themselves did not want to get involved directly and expand that war. That may be changing now, Amara, because of that Israeli strike that took place last week, very dramatically against the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed senior level Revolutionary Guard commanders, seven IRGC officials that U.S. officials now believe Iran will retaliate for. The U.S. has made clear that they were not involved. They have said that this was Israel's attack, that the U.S. had no advanced knowledge and no participation.

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, this is an important document that the Vatican has produced. It's been in the works for five years, and focuses on the whole question of human dignity, particularly with relation to those topics you said on surrogacy, on gender identity, and on gender-affirming surgery, reiterating what the Pope has consistently said on these topics, saying that gender ideology is a dangerous thing. He has been very clear on that. It also talks about things such as the death penalty, the plight of migrants, poverty, trying to set the whole question of human dignity in a broader context.Now, there are some in the church who would like the Vatican and the Pope to focus on one issue such as abortion. But, Pope Francis and the Vatican are very clear that this issue has to be looked at in the round that the defense of human life in the womb, as the Vatican has said, is not something that is done by fanaticism but is part of a seamless garment approach. Now, we should also state that Pope Francis has shown a pastoral welcome to those who are transgender Catholics to LGBTQ community more broadly. And also in the document is a strong condemnation of the criminalization of homosexuality, and that was something that was emphasized today at the Vatican by Cardinal Fernandez repeatedly. He said he was very surprised and shocked that some Catholics supported these laws. So, what we're seeing is, I think, a clear defining of where the Catholic Church's position is on these topics, these contested topics, but also a desire to be pastoral and open, a difficult balancing act, Amara.",

There'll be others, I think, who will be welcoming the document because they're concerned about these trends. I think we'll see a mixed response. But, I think what was interesting was the Cardinal today was emphasizing that even though Catholics may disagree, everyone is welcome in the church. And so, it's this balance between the pastoral response and the concern about what it sees as -- what the church sees violations of human dignity.It is also coming soon after a Vatican document at the end of last year that sent shockwaves through the church because it allowed for blessings of same-sex couples. So, there has been pressure on the Pope and the Vatican over whether it really is maintaining church teaching. I think today it was saying that, no, the Pope and the Vatican, under his leadership, are keeping to Catholic tradition and the church's teaching, but trying to do so in a pastoral way.",

Along this path, the Moon will completely block the Sun for about three and a half to four minutes. If you're not in the path, however, you may still get a show. 49 U.S. states will be able to view at least a partial eclipse.Let's bring in Hillary Olson from the Rochester Museum and Science Center, which has been preparing for this eclipse for many years now. Hi there, Hillary. Thank you so much for joining us on this really exciting day. Tell us about your preparations and how the Science Center will celebrate this event today. HILLARY OLSON, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ROCHESTER MUSEUM &amp; SCIENCE CENTER: Sure. So, we've been preparing for this for five years, and really trying to convince everyone in Rochester, Hey, a lot of tourists are going to come. We're going to have a great deal of opportunity to engage people in who the city is and what the city does. And we couldn't be more thrilled. We have a lot of people coming into town and they're all experiencing science here at the RMSE (Rochester Museum and Science Center). So, we have a lot going on. We have a science festival happening, an eclipse festival. And then, the main event today is at 3:20 when the total solar eclipse starts. But, the entire experience of the eclipse is four hours long, and we will have celebrations and music and all kinds of speakers, and it's going to be a lot of fun.",

Millions of people are expected to travel to get the best possible view. And if there is extra traffic, of course, there is always the risk of more accidents. Another possible hazard is that some eclipse viewers will fail to protect their eyes, although it's well known that staring at the eclipse without protection can damage your vision. Your eyeballs can get damaged. Let's bring in CNN's Meg Tirrell. I mean, again, we can this enough, do not look directly at the Sun if you don't have protective glasses.

These hospitals say that they've been working on this, in some cases, for more than a year, especially hospitals in smaller communities that are preparing in the path of totality for a huge influx of people, maybe double or even triple their populations coming to that community. So, there is a lot of concern about traffic, being able to get patients to care where they need to get.Waco, Texas, AirLift Texas says that they're going to have an additional medical helicopter stationed there for three days around the eclipse for that purpose. At Ozarks Healthcare in central Missouri, serving also northern Arkansas, they're extending walk-in clinic hours. They're encouraging folks to use the walk-in clinics for things that are non-life threatening and to save the emergency department for actual emergencies. Reet Health in Indiana says they could see up to 150,000 additional people coming to their community. They are actually closing some of their routine or more specialty clinics this afternoon so that they're not going to have as many places open, but they will have those urgent cares open. OhioHealth in Ohio actually says they're going to be sending some folks through mobile clinics to provide first aid at eclipse viewing events at a fairground for example. And up in Vermont, Northwestern Medical Center, they're particularly concerned about traffic patterns. So, they're asking folks not to come to their campus unless they need care, and they say that they are going to be sort of restricting some of the traffic patterns around where they are, just to make sure that people can get in if they need to. Overall, hospitals across the path of totality are increasing staffing and their emergency departments also increasing. They've stocked up on supplies to make sure that they're prepared. We know from 2017 that there were, unfortunately, an increase in traffic fatalities around that eclipse that was sort of similar to the holiday weekend just because so many more people are on the road. We also know that there is an uptick in sort of more minor accidents that might take people to emergency departments, minor injuries, heat-related injuries. Gastrointestinal illnesses were something that were also recorded, a small uptick in a community in Kentucky that did a study. And of course, those eye injuries that you mentioned. But, it's not all serious. We have heard from some hospitals, in particular, they're making eclipse onesies, Cleveland Clinic, but posted on social media that they've made eclipse onesies for the babies in their NICU, and that is something pretty adorable, and a keepsake that they can remember.

In a video posted to social media, Trump says abortion should be left up to the states, dashing conservative hopes that he might back a national abortion ban of some type. Now, Trump said he is in favor of allowing abortions for women who have been raped or where the life of the mother is in danger. He also took credit for the landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade.Now, for months, one of the stories of the 2024 race for the White House has been a big financial advantage for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. But, Trump did have one really good night. His campaign says it raised more than $50 million on Saturday from a glitzy event for super rich donors. It cost a quarter of a million dollars just to get in. Trump told the audience of billionaires he would make sure nothing happens to the valuable tax cuts they got under his last administration, and also, a Melania Trump sighting, we should mention. Our Alayna Treene is covering both of these stories for us. Hi there, Alayna. OK. So, tell us more about what Trump had to say, because he is obviously trying to neutralize Democratic attacks by taking a leave it up to the states stance. Right?",
