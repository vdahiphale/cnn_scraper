Director Alexis Bloom and Oscar winning producer Alex Gibney join me. Plus, the Supreme Court and contempt for expertise, according to journalist Masha Gessen who talks with Michel Martin about care for transgender minors. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Is there renewed hope and momentum for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza? Both outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations want that to happen before January's transfer of power on Inauguration Day. Since last month's ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Israeli foreign minister says we can be more optimistic than before, but we're not there yet. The families of the 100 hostages still inside Gaza have had to bear the loss and the constant cycle of dashed hopes since the last and only negotiated deal brought the first batch home last year. While inside Gaza, the appalling and consistent bombings, shootings, starvation, and evacuations and forced displacements of civilians, as well as militants, has caused even a former Israeli defense minister to label them war crimes. More evidence pours in every day. Here, a father holding and mourning his dead child. And these images. A few of more than 44,000 people who have now been killed in Gaza since the October Hamas massacre inside Israel. Qatar has played the central mediator role throughout. And this weekend in Doha, regional leaders gathered to discuss an end to this war, even as the Assad dictatorship was falling. I spoke to foreign ministers Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani from Qatar, Espen Barth Eide from Norway, and Subrahmanyam Jaishankar from India. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And for it I have to -- I want to commend the excellentwork of Sheikh Mohammed himself and his deputies and wonderful diplomats in working towards ceasefire. And this comes back to what to do with Gaza afterwards. And it must be the moment to really move towards a Palestinian State. We need a two-state solution, but not the three-state solution. We want an integrated Palestine compromising, you know, the West Bank and Gaza, relevant parts of Jerusalem, you know, as was envisaged in the Oslo Accords. And the drama, the horror is so deep now that we cannot go back to 6th of October last year. That was not a stable lasting situation. It was like a minefield. People might have not stepped on the mine, but you know, it was about to explode. It did explode. And here comes to your question about the incoming U.S. administration, because Trump -- President-Elect Trump was very vested in the Abraham Accords. I think the message now from this region is that is perfectly doable. There might actually be a major deal, but it has to happen with Palestine. And I think as long -- and this is also what the group that -- so the Arab, Qatar, Norway, the European Union, others are forming now is a very collective message that this is the time to think big, to think political solution, to think that peace for Israel, peace for Palestine, regional peace is connected because all these different conflicts, they are not the same, it's not one conflict, but there is a root conflict that connects to all of them, which is the absence of a solution to the Palestinian question. And that has been the driver of Norway's and my own foreign policy over this last year to really see that today. It cannot be just a western country or two to come in to fix it. It has to be embedded seriously in this region, and we have to make sure that also Israel becomes a country not only in the region, but off the region -- you know, region connected to its neighbors in peace, and that can only happen with the Palestinian State. And honestly, it might sound naive, but I think it's actually hard politics. There is no alternative. So, we have to move forward. We must dare to think outside the box.",

It is said that certainly we know Prime Minister Modi had a very close relationship with President Trump in his first term.

Failed to bring about the permanent solution to the crisis that really affects this whole region, and so much of the world. And I just want to ask you, because, again, the incoming Trump administration appointee is, let's say, Mike Huckabee, who's being appointed as the ambassador has said this week that, of course, it's possible that the U.S. would back the Israeli government were it to try to annex the occupied West Bank. I'm sure all of you have ideas about that, but where do you think that would lead and do you think that's really something that the U.S. would accept? Does Europe agree?

But I did say, and I will maintain that, you know, we will not be able to start solving the intricate set of problems in this region without dealing with solution to Palestine, and the solution is not to perpetuate the occupation and make it into annexation. And this has also been very firmly put out by the International Court of Justice, which is everybody's court. It is the highest U.N. court and very clear on the status of occupation as illegal. And I think we have to take that as a starting point as we move forward. And I do also think, as I said earlier, that there are some opportunities in working on the Abraham Accords approach given the solid message that that can happen, but Palestine is part of it. Norway has a long tradition of peace mediation and dialogue facilitation, and we also very much share that vision that in order to get things done, you need to speak to the people that matters. Even if those are people with blood on their hands and people you don't necessarily approve of, and speaking is not approving, speaking is not endorsement, speaking is necessary in order to facilitate the dialogue with the people that can actually change things. I think that's necessary. And I think when a new administration is in place and looks at the whole picture in its totality, I think they will form a more holistic policy on this, and I very much look forward that we all can engage with them when they are there. I see opportunities. I see challenges, but I also see opportunities. And I think that there are an opportunity here for what actually could become the deal of the century.

Now, to be honest with you, that's not always been the most popular thing, at least in some parts of the world. And -- but I do think today the general sort of the needle is moving more towards the reality of a negotiation than the continuation of the war. Now, we are really putting, in a way, our aircraft, our legs, where our mouth is. We are actually doing, you know, going to Moscow, talking to President Putin, going to Kyiv, engaging President Zelenskyy, meeting them in other places, trying to see if we can encourage -- you know, find common threads, which can be picked up at some point of time when the circumstances are right for it to be developed. We're not attempting a peace plan. We don't -- we're not doing a mediation in that sense. We are doing multiple conversations and very transparent about telling each party saying, look, at the end of the conversation, this is what we're going to tell the other party. We think that, at this point of time, the most useful thing that any country wanting to see an end to that conflict can do diplomatically. We also believe in this that we articulate the sentiments and the interests of the Global South, 125 other countries, who have found their fuel cost, their food cost, their inflation, their fertilizer costs impacted by this, the war. So, there is a constituency out there, which says please do this, please, you know, carry on with this.

So, they sued on due process grounds, basically that means that they were arguing that it's the parents and the doctors who should be making the decisions and not the state. And they sued on equal protection grounds, claiming that that the ban constituted sex discrimination, because depending on whether you're assigned male or female at birth, you have different access to different medications. They won in district court, they -- then it was reversed on appeal in the appeals court, they appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, but only on equal protection grounds.

And so, this anxiety that has really permeated the culture in the last few years and, you know, we've seen Trump talk about this a lot and to great effect. Your child will go to school, they will perform surgery, they come back without parental consent, they left a girl, they came back a boy, or the other way around, right? I mean, these are completely fantastical scenarios, right? It doesn't work like that. But it reflects the fear, right? It reflects what every parent's worst nightmare. And then, of course, the barrage of Trump ads before the election, that Kamala is we're for you, Kamala is for they, them, that idea that this is the stranger, this is the other, this is the other that's encroaching on your family, on your community, on your politics.

And yet, sometimes they're total strangers to me. And I think that's everybody's experience. But I think the fear that you will not speak the same language as your child, that you will not exist in the same culture as your child, that you will not be able to help your child through the most difficult or challenging moments in life, that fear is real, like that is a universal parental fear, but that's not what this case is about. This case is about the state deciding and overriding parental decisions. And, you know, I think it's actually -- the tragedy of this particular case is that the Supreme Court refused to hear this part of the argument. So, in effect, the Supreme Court said, we're not going to allow you to question whether the state has the right to override parental and medical decisions. We're granting the state that right. We're just going to ask whether the state is exercising that right in a discriminatory manner.

So, we're just left to deal with this fact, the fact that the Supreme Court let stand the appeals court decision that rejects the due process argument. So, the Supreme Court -- and you're absolutely right, parental rights have been the banner under which conservatives have marched in this country. But what is actually happening in the case of Tennessee is that state legislators, most of whom, possibly none of whom, are medical professionals or know anything about trans care, have decided that this particular kind of medical treatment should not be available to people under 18 regardless of what their parents and doctors think. And the Supreme Court already let that stand.",

But in this particular case, we have the state overriding doctors and parents, and we have justices basically saying that, you know, medical expertise doesn't matter, right? And these are two things that I think are incredibly dangerous. I'm going to use the word precedent not in the judicial sense, but in the sort of vernacular sense. It sets a horrible precedent for establishing contempt for expertise as our baseline. It doesn't matter what the doctors say, the justices know better because they have lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court, which does not make them doctors and does not make them understand trans rights. The other argument that I've been making about the battle against trans rights in general is that it is largely a question of reproductive rights. Because if you really listen to the arguments that the proponents of these bans on trans care make, one of their strongest arguments -- one of their leading arguments, rather, is that children, teenagers assigned female at birth should not be able to make decisions that might later render them infertile. And this is -- it probably doesn't render them infertile, but even if it did, we're talking -- the fact that this is the absolute biggest point that they make should really make all women and all supporters of abortion rights sit up and pay attention. Because this is men who are deciding whether and when people reproduce. And this is part of a much larger sort of framework of thought and framework of law at this point.",

I know that these bans onmedical treatment for children will proliferate and will probably turn into bans for adults or at least greater and greater restrictions for adults. So, I'm obviously concerned about being able to access care. And this is -- you know, this is care -- it's not for somebody my age, and with my medical history, it's not just gender-affirming care, it's actually healthcare that I need to survive. And, intellectually, I felt diminished. There's something that has happened in the Supreme Court that I don't think we have really talked about enough, because there's such a strong tendency to normalize anything that has actually become normal, right? There are three Trump appointees on the Supreme Court. Two of them really much less qualified, much less intellectually rigorous than the standard had been in the Supreme Court, and I think we're seeing that. I think that's not the only reason we're seeing what we're seeing, but I think that we're seeing a kind of moral and intellectual diminishment. I think the only moment of real searching that I observed in the court was when Justice Jackson was trying to figure out whether the parallels that she was seeing between this case and Loving Dear Virginia, which is the interracial marriage case, whether those perils helped. And you could see that she was struggling sort of intellectually and morally with the arguments that she was hearing on both sides. You didn't see that through the rest of the proceedings, right? It's like, you know, whatever, three hours of arguments and questions.
