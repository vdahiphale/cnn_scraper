President Biden, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly isolated. Isolated, for one, for a medical reason for a couple of days because he got Covid, but also increasingly isolated politically. More Democrats, publicly and privately, telling him that they think he no longer can defeat Donald Trump. And the turmoil really splintering Biden's party around him. Joining us right now, Tim Hogan, Democratic consultant, former spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, and former Trump State Department official, Matt Mowers. It's great to see you guys.",

We are not a party that has sacred cows. We are not a party that is based on a cult of personality. We're a party that cares about winning and improving people's lives. And wherever this conversation goes, that has been the impetus for the conversation that we're having. And I would say, that is the one functional political party that we have right now.

Sarah, post the RNC, what will this message be?

I think that it showed us that he is beatable. And so, if I'm a Democrat, then I'm thinking, hey, why aren't we nominating someone who's younger, more energetic, who could run circles around that rambling old man. But, obviously, it seems like President Biden is digging his heels in. And so, if he stays in the race, and it is going to be much more difficult for Democrats to defeat him.
