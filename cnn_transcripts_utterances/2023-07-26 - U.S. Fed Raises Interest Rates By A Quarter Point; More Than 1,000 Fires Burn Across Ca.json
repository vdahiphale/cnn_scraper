Tonight, we begin in the United States because any moment now, theU.S. Federal Reserve is set to hand down its decision on interest rates. Investors expecting 25 basis point hike. I want to go straight to Matt Egan in New York. And Matt, we -- I'm sure you're keeping a close eye on the decision. What are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, the Federal Reserve is resuming its fight against inflation. The Fed just announced a quarter of a pointinterest rate hike. Now, this move from the Fed lifts interest rates to the highest levels in 22 years. The Fed has now raised interest rates 11 times since this fight against inflation began back in March of 2022. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates every single meeting except for the last one. Now, this move from the Fed was widely expected, officials had telegraphed this pretty clearly. So investors should not be surprised here. The real drama though comes in just about 25 minutes as Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes questions from reporters. Investors are hoping that Powell drops some clues on what the Fed will do next, because we know inflation has cooled off. The question is whether it has cooled enough in the eyes of Powell and his colleagues at the Fed to justify the Fed stopping its interest rate hikes. Maybe this is the last interest rate hike, that's what investors have been pricing in. The question is whether or not Fed officials are satisfied with the progress so far. Isa?",

I don't think the situation has changed dramatically, Fed officials have said the reason why they wanted to pause was to basically buy time. Because this war on inflation has featured a lot of interest rate hikes. I mean, they haven't seen anything like this in 40-plus years from the Fed. And we know that it hits the economy with a lot. So, the risk all along has been that they would go too far, they would slow the economy so much that it would cause a recession and which they don't want to do. So the thinking was pause in June, get some more incoming data to get a better sense for what's happening in the economy, and then decide what to do in July, and they have decided to go ahead and raise interest rates. You know, as far as what Powell will say at this press conference, you know, if I were Jerome Powell, which I'm not, of course, but if I were, I wouldn't want to get boxed in here, right? I mean, I don't think that he should really over-extend himself in terms of committing one way or another into raising interest rates again or stopping altogether. Because we know this economy has been so unpredictable, in particular, commodity prices, energy prices are rising here in the United States and around the world, agriculture commodities are ticking higher, that's going to play a role here in what the Fed does next.

But also to support those who have been impacted. Now, Giorgia Meloni; prime minister hasn't announced just yet, but it is still under consideration. So we are waiting to see whether that decision is taken later today. But now, of course, in Italy, we are learning from civil protection agency, there are still ten wildfires across the southern regions, that the authorities, the emergency services are still battling, particularly in the areas of Sicily and Palermo, we saw those dramatic images of people attempting to flee the island and trying to head to Palermo airport yesterday. That airport itself was brought to a standstill with the flames edging dangerously close to the tarmac. So, of course, this is a huge concern, we've seen thousands of people across Italy already evacuate. However, authorities are saying now that the vast majority of them have been told they can return home. And we're in Rome here, this is the city which has seen extreme heat over the last couple of weeks. Although, the temperatures are a lot milder now, you can see behind me that people are taking advantage of that mild weather. But of course, across the Mediterranean, we are seeing this dramatic images of devastation, not least in Greece where there continues to be wildfires across the country. In fact, we are seeing new wildfires. The authorities there say, they have reported 61 new fires in just the last day, they bring the total number of wildfires there recorded to 90 now. And the authorities there are battling the blazes across the country. They have support from teens from overseas who have been helping with that effort. But of course, authorities have called for further evacuations in other areas in parts, in central parts of the country, particularly in agriculture areas as a precaution. They say it's a huge concern, of course. However, temperatures are expected to improve from tomorrow. So that will give some much-needed rest, in fact, to a country that really has been feeling the worst of this extreme heat. And the message that we are hearing from experts is that this extreme heat that we're seeing across the Mediterranean is only going to become more frequent and more severe. Isa?",

The law now in effect weakens the Supreme Court's oversight of government decisions, stripping its ability to block those it deems unreasonable. The court will hear petitions to overturn that law in September, essentially ruling on its own powers. But it declined to freeze the legislation until that time. The government's broader effort to push through a package of judicial overhaul bills has deeply divided Israel -- as we're showing you here on the show triggering months of mass protests that are certain to continue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the legislation is needed to correct judicial overreach. I want to bring in Fred Pleitgen who is at the heart of some of those protests that we have seen this week, and he joins me now from Jerusalem.

They want to push the government and the country much further than just the present legislation. They basically are determined to push Israel to annex all the territories of the West Bank, and get rid of all the Arabs living there, and to make Israel into an apartheid country. Now, this is not something that the majority of Israelis would tolerate, will accept, or will    acquiesce with. So, right now, this is narrowed down to the issue of reasonableness of the government decisions, but as an almost inevitable outcome of this legislation, the government can tomorrow fire the attorney general without any overriding authority of the Supreme Court about the legality of this. And then they can appoint all the key position in the administration, in the bureaucracy of the state of Israel, members of the central committee of Likud, and basically change the democratic nature of the state of Israel, and then using the powers that they have accumulated, in order to change the policies which they are already now declaring in order to settle more in the territories in order to continue the harassment of Palestinians living in the territories, lynching their villages, as the Minister of Finance officially said that the government ought to do. I mean, this is something that is entirely outlined to the nature, to the values, to the principles that we have lived with from the creation of the state of Israel. We will not tolerate it, so at some point, it can reach the point of confrontations in the streets.",

So, this is not just, you know, some kind of fear of suspicion that they may want to do. They say that they want to do it. They say that this must be done. One of the senior minister says the attorney general is the most dangerous person in the state of Israel. I mean, I don't want to think what may be the possible outcome in terms of the personal security of the attorney general when a senior minister says that she's the most dangerous person to the security, to the well-being of the state of Israel. Now, to answer specifically your question, I don't want -- I trust the legal system in Israel, presently, of course, considering all the circumstances, and I don't want to pass any opinion about the legal case because we are in the middle of a legal case, and we have to wait and see what will be the outcome of this case. But if the attorney general will be fired, then one can rightly, I mean, assume that the reason for wanting to fire the attorney general is perhaps to somehow affect the legal case. So it remains to be seen. I think that if the attorney general of Israel will be fired, you will see millions of Israelis in the streets, this will bring about the collapse of this government. And then, let me be very clear about it, because you know, I reached a point where I think we, in Israel, need to spell it out in the most accurate way. Our aim now is to bring down this government, now, of course, in a democratic manner. In a democratic manner. But within the framework of democracy, we are allowed to demonstrate, we are allowed to go to the streets. We can manifest civil disobedience if necessary. We'll do everything within the confinement of law, without violence, that will help bring down this government because this government has declared war on the people of Israel. This government has declared war on the state of Israel. And I take this opportunity and appeal to President Biden, whom I personally know, I've worked with for many years. And I think that he's a great friend of the state of Israel and the Jewish people, has always been for Israel. I say to President Biden now, if you love Israel, you'll have to be against this government, and the Israelis will thank you for it, and the Jewish people will thank you for it because they know that this is possibly one of the ways in which to stop this government from exercising policies which may destroy the moral fabric of what Israel was and needs to be.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sinead O'Connor obliterated the image of a female music star in the late 1980s with a shaved head, stirring performances and a mouthful of controversial opinions. O'Connor topped the music charts in 1990 with her version of \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" written by Prince. She won MTV's Video of the Year award. \"Rolling Stone\" named her Artist of the Year in 1991. She earned four Grammy nominations for the song and the album it was. On but accolades and awards seemed to be nothing compared to O'Connor's drive to provoke thought. SINEAD O'CONNOR, SINGER: Fight the real. Enemy ELAM (voice-over): When O'Connor ripped up this photo of pope John Paul II on national television, backlash reverberated around the globe. Weeks later, a New York crowd booed the singer loudly and incessantly when she took her turn on stage at a Bob Dylan tribute. O'Connor repeatedly defended herself, calling herself Catholic and spiritual. And in 1999 she became the first priestess of a dissident Roman Catholic, group. When the Catholic priest sex abuse scandal exploded, she called for the pope to tell the truth. O'CONNOR: We have the documents and we have the. Proof that tell us that we were being lied, to and we are being lied to by people who are supposed to represent Jesus. Christ ELAM (voice-over): O'Connor lashed out at other, celebrities once called YouTube's music, bombastic, started a war of words with Miley Cyrus, when O'Connor publicly urged the young performer not to, quote, \"let the music business make a prostitute of you,\" and accused Arsenio Hall of being a drug supplier for Prince. After the superstar's death. O'Connor's personal life was tabloid fodder. Divorce, custody, battles the singer married four times, was mother to four children. Tormented, talented, O'Connor attempted suicide in the late 1990s. In early 2022, she checked into a hospital while grieving the death of her third son, Shane. At 51, O'Connor converted to Islam, covering her trademark shaved head with a hijab. But she continued performing her music, reflecting upon a lifetime of struggle. (MUSIC PLAYING) (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is worth remembering that, up until quite recently, the Wagner Group was fully understood in terms of its connections to the Kremlin and to Vladimir Putin. We have seen those connections firmed up in a big way. And of course the current fallout between Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner, and Putin after that attempted insurrection in Russia. But it is a scathing report. Isa.",

That, of, course does not look at the fact that the overall wheat process surged since that grain deal collapsed. And that does affect African countries. So it will be on the topic of conversation at this meeting, 17 African leaders, according to multiple sources, are going to the St. Petersburg conference. That is far less than in 2019, at the first Russia-Africa, summit the Kremlin blames this in part on propaganda they say is coming from the U.S. and European diplomats. Brazen attempts at smearing the conference, they call it. But it is still significant that, after the start of the invasion and after being indicted by the International Criminal Court, Putin will be able to stand on the stage with multiple leaders, on the world, stage to show he's not entirely isolated, even though as the war drags, on he certainly is.",

A panel ofthe House Oversight Committee is holding a public hearing today on identified anomalous phenomena. Military veterans testified on what they call a very real national security threat and whether UFOs come from Earth or somewhere else. There are bipartisan calls for the government to share more about what it knows. For the latest, CNN's Tom Foreman is live in Washington. Tom, it's been going for several hours.

One because an awful lot of things have come out. Testimony about things that have been seen by these witnesses, who were former military men while they were flying, craft were performing tricks that they say no thing on Earth can. Do flying straight up into the, air flying straight back down, accelerating in a hurricane-force wind. Past the speed of sound, with no effort at all, no sense of propulsion, one story after another like. That beyond, that beyond that, they went even further to say that some of them have been told, have been told, they haven't seen themselves, that there have been craft like this captured by the U.S. government and being kept somewhere, along with the bodies of non human pilots who were aboard. But again, (INAUDIBLE) was told, as I haven't actually, seen it I believe to be there. So again, for conspiracy theorists, it's all they could ever want. For the more skeptical members of the committee, it was, yes, a lot of talk about the fact that there are some things that we don't have explanations for. Maybe they're advanced weapon systems, maybe there's something the government is testing, maybe something another government is testing. But all, around people are saying we should have more transparency about what is going on.",
