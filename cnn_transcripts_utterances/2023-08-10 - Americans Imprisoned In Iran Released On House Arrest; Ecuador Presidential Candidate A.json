Tonight, a group of Americans who were wrongfullydetained in Iran for years now have been released from prison, and are under house arrest. The latest on that coming up. Then shock and sadness in Ecuador as presidential candidates Fernando Villavicencio is assassinated. I'll be speaking to former vice president and current presidential candidate Otto Sonnenholzner to get his reaction. Plus, a tropical paradise that's now a living hell. We are live in Hawaii's deadly wildfires ripped across the island of Maui. But first, this evening, details are trickling in on a deal between the U.S. and Iran, which could lead to the release of several Americans who were wrongfully detained. We now know a total of five U.S. citizens are under house arrest in Iran. Four of them were just moved out of their prison cells in Tehran. And they include Siamak Namazi, an American citizen who has been imprisoned in Tehran for more than seven years. In March, he spoke exclusively to our Christian Amanpour from inside the notorious Evin Prison, to beg the Biden administration to bring him home. Our chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour explains what we know about these American prisoners, and the long campaign, crucially, for their release. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over):  It was a heartfelt plea heard around the world. SIAMAK NAMAZI, IMPRISONED IN IRAN (via telephone):  Honestly, the other hostages and I desperately need President Biden to finally hear us out, to finally hear our cry for help and bring us home. And I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures. So, this is a desperate measure -- I am clearly nervous.",

And they say, \"as part of a humanitarian cooperation agreement mediated by a third party government, Iran and the United States have agreed to reciprocally release and pardon five prisoners. The transfer of these prisoners out of prison marks a significant initial step in the implementation of this agreement.\" So, the word pardon is very important, because no matter that they all said that they were falsely charged, falsely imprisoned, the fact that they are going to be now pardoned means that the Iranians are now on the record saying that. We understand certainly from this statement that Iran expects in the upcoming days, maybe weeks for five Iranians who are held in the United States to also be released back to Iran. And then as we've reported in many different occasions, certainly we try to figure out what the bigger deal is, and we understand that the parameters of that include Iranian funds throughout the -- Iranian funds that are frozen in South Korea, because South Korea bought about $6 billion to $7 billion worth of energy from Iran and actually never paid them, never delivered the funds. So, that is something that is going to be -- we understand, unfrozen. But will not go directly to the Iranian government, but apparently, and again this all has to be confirmed, but this is what sources have told me weeks ago, going to a Qatar government arranged account. To be spent on only goods that are humanitarian and unsanctioned goods for the good of the Iranian people who are suffering.",

But according to Iran, that is part of the deal that has been agreed to. We're also learning, according to a source familiar with these negotiations, that there have been conversations surrounding $6 billion of Iranian fans that are currently in a restricted account in South Korea, to move them to a separate account where they can be more easily accessible by Iran. They would still have limitations on what Iran could use those funds for, for humanitarian purposes, for non-sanctionable trade. But there's conversations about moving those funds as well. Those are two elements that are part of what we expect to see over the course of the next few weeks. As there is a sequence of events that will be carried out, with the end goal for the U.S. being getting these five Americans who have been imprisoned in Iran back home. We don't know exactly when that will happen. But a source who's been briefed on the negotiations gave a timeframe of some time in September. It's significant to note that these Americans, many of them have been wrongfully detained in Iran for years now. Siamak Namazi has been wrongfully detained. He was arrested in 2015, going on almost eight years behind bars in Iran. And the two other Americans whose identities we actually know, Emad Sharghi and Morad Tahbaz, were detained in 2018 in separate instances. So they've been there for years.

Your interview with the deputy minister wasextremely important and certainly shows some of those concerns, that the Poles have and they're acting on very quickly. They believe that it's definitely in their interest and not just in Poland's interest but in NATO interest as well. That border between Poland and Belarus has been a flashpoint, not just between those two countries but for several years now. If you look back to 2021, there were waves of migrants that were lured essentially into Belarus and then sent to the border, helped across by Belarusian border guards. The Poles put a stop to. That even back then you had skirmishes going on between the Poles and Belarusians. It's really since Russia has played a larger role in Belarus that we've seen some of this taking place. All that has escalated with the war in Ukraine. One of the interesting things that the minister was saying there was also that the Poles are extremely concerned about the security situation in general. With some airspace violations that they've been talking about, with Belarusian helicopters apparently violating Polish airspace, that's not a small feat. That's a country violating NATO's airspace. Even though the Belarusians are saying that that's not true. But it leads to a very, very tense situation. And, of course, the sort of 800-pound gorilla in the room, if you will, is Wagner. Right now from the latest that we're hearing is that Wagner is training the Belarusian security forces on the other side of the border. But some of that training is taking place very close to NATO territory, very close to Polish territory. We can see the Poles definitely trying to show that they're not willing to deal with this, that they are going to take a tough stance on this, moving 10,000 troops, 4,000 of which will be directly on the border, 6,000 in reserve. Then, of course, you have the Russians, who, in the past, when the Poles have been beefing up their border, have called it an aggressive moves, pouring oil on the fire as well. It's a very tense situation. But the Poles trying to project strength on their eastern border.",

So my understanding here from people we've been speaking to is that this is a sign to the Niger military junta, that the military option isn't out of the question. But they still want to explore diplomacy. President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria, who's the chair of the ECOWAS commission, said they're still considering balance as a last resort, that they'll be looking at these talks to convince the men in Niger who took over power to restore the government of president Mohamed Bazoum.
