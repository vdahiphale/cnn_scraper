Officials say at least eight people were killed, 13 others wounded in several villages southeast of the capital Belgrade on Thursday. Hundreds of police and special forces are now searching for the suspect who fled the scene.Serbia's public broadcaster says he was in a vehicle with two other people before he got out and shot victims with an automatic weapon. Local media report a police officer and his sister were among those killed. All of this happening as Serbia is still reeling from Wednesday's horrific school shooting which left nine people dead. Scott McLean is near the scene of the second shooting. SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): The Serbs today are waking up to a headline that seems quite unbelievable. In less than 48 hours, a second mass shooting has taken place. Authorities say that this one happened in this field, in this rural area between two very small villages, about 50, 60 kilometers south of Belgrade. So, there's a soccer pitch there. Locals say there's also a barbecue area where young people like to hang out. There's also a vehicle there where the windows have apparently been shot out. And this is where this shooting is alleged to have taken place. Authorities say it happened with an automatic weapon, something that is banned in this country, generally. There are illegal weapons still circulating in the country, leftover from conflict in the 1990s, but automatic weapons are heavily restricted for civilians and even getting a semi-automatic weapon in this country requires jumping through a lot of checks and a lot of hoops. There is now a massive manhunt taking place across a very wide swath of this country, a very rural area, as well. There's fields, there's orchards here, and there are some 600 police officers who are looking for this suspect, a 21-year-old man. They are identifying as Uros B (ph). He may well still be heavily armed. And on the way here, we actually saw heavily armed police combing an area on the side of the highway about 20 miles from here, which gives you a sense of just how big the search area may be at this point. Now, Serbs in light of the school shooting that took place on Wednesday were already doing some soul searching about what happened in that case and how they can prevent it in the future. There have been discussions about mental health, about violent video games and the impact of social media and of course about guns. Lawmakers have now proposed to put a two-year moratorium on the issuing of new gun permits. Scott McLean, CNN in rural Serbia.",

Nada Bashir is live this hour in London Forest with the latest on that drone strike on the Kremlin. Nada, the blame game just continues. Bring us up to date. NADA BASHIR, CNN LONDON BUREAU REPORTER (on-camera): Yeah, absolutely. The blame game is continuing and also Moscow is really dialing up its rhetoric when it comes to the U.S. government's engagement in the war in Ukraine. As you mentioned there, we've heard from the Russian deputy defense minister there claiming the U.S. had direct involvement in this alleged attack on the Kremlin, a drone strike on the Kremlin. Of course, we heard from the deputy defense minister saying that both parties, the U.S. and Russia are likely on the verge of an open armed conflict. These are strong words coming from the Kremlin. They claim that the U.S. government has long been a direct party to the war in Ukraine. And of course, these have come despite the vehement denial from both Ukraine and the United States, as you mentioned there.

BASHIR (on-camera): Now, the Kremlin maintains that this was an attempted terrorist attack, a plot to assassinate Vladimir Putin, that this was an attack executed by Kyiv, but a plan devised in Washington, D.C. And, of course, these are claims that Ukraine and the U.S. government vehemently deny. And despite this, we have heard from Moscow saying that they are maintaining talks with the U.S. government.

Clashes also reported north of Khartoum and warplanes were seen flying over the city.Now, that's despite the RSF saying it would extend a ceasefire for 72 hours, starting this morning local time. This also comes after the rival Sudanese Armed Forces announced that it had agreed to a 7-day ceasefire with the paramilitary group, although there was no response from the group at that time. Previous ceasefires, of course, have not stopped the fighting, as evinced by columns of dark smoke over the capital on Thursday.

CNN's Stephanie Busari with that. STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA (on-camera): A Sudanese actress has been killed in a crossfire of fighting near Khartoum, a family member tells CNN. Eighty-year-old Asia Abdel-Majid, known as the country's first professional state actress, died after shells hit her home in Bari, north of the capital. It is unclear which side of the conflict fired the shot that killed the actress. The fighting between the rapid support forces and the Sudanese army shows no signs of letting up despite a 7-day ceasefire that was supposed to start early Thursday. Both sides have not kept to negotiate the ceasefires since the start of the conflict and they blame each other for breaking the truce. Meanwhile, foreign countries continue to evacuate their citizens. Hundreds of Nigerians could come in the latest to return home from Sudan late Wednesday as the country spirals into a looming humanitarian crisis. The Norwegian Refugee Council has warned that people trapped in the battlefields in Sudan are running out of food and water.

Now, Trump's attorneys also rested their case outside the presence of the jury. But in an unexpected twist.The judge said he will give Trump until 5:00 p.m. on Sunday to change his mind about testifying. The judge cautioned that he might not allow it but he was providing the window for Trump to possibly reopen his case since Trump publicly stated while on a trip to Ireland that he was returning to the U.S. over a false accusation. The judge said he has a right to testify which has been waived, but if he has second thoughts, I'll at least consider it. Trump's attorney Joe Tacopina said he spoke with Trump Thursday morning, and he had no intention of testifying. He indicated a change in strategy was unlikely. Trump's lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defense, choosing to try to make their case through cross- examination of Carroll's witnesses. Earlier Thursday, the jury watched the video deposition Trump gave in October. During the 30 minutes of testimony, Trump agreed that he made the allegedly defamatory statements that he didn't know, Carroll, that she wasn't his type, and that she made up the story. He said he stood by the comments. The jury also heard from another friend of Carroll's who said Carol told her about the alleged rape at the time. On cross-examination, Trump's attorneys presented the friend with text messages and e-mails she sent speaking negatively of Trump, in an effort to suggest her testimony was politically motivated. Carroll's lawyers also called a marketing professor who testified that it would cost as much as $2.7 million to repair Carroll's reputation from the alleged damage caused by Trump's statement.

Now, a law enforcement source told CNN that Neely had been arrested over 40 times for things including jumping a turnstile, theft, but also in at least a few cases, assault. That said, it's unlikely anyone on this train car knew any of that, as this was unfolding. As for the man who did the chokehold, we reached out to who we believe is him. And when he answered the phone and I identified myself as a reporter, he said he wasn't interested in answering any of my questions before hanging up. However, a law enforcement source told CNN that he did speak to police before being released. Omar Jimenez, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
