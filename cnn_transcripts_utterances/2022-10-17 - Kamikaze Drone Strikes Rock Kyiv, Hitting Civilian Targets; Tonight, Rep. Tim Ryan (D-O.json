Our top story this hour, the Ukrainian capital under siege once again. Explosions heard across Kyiv amid reports of kamikaze drone strikes throughout the city. At least three people were killed in the strikes, including a six-month pregnant woman. Those attacks part of a wider assault involving drones and cruise missiles that Ukrainian officials said, once again, targeted critical infrastructure. Meantime, as Russia's escalation continues, both Russia and NATO are set to hold separate long planned exercises of nuclear forces. We are covering all of the angles this is morning. Let's begin with CNN's Clarissa Ward live in Kyiv. Clarissa, I know you spoke with the mayor of Kyiv earlier this morning. What is the latest on the ground there and what did he tell you?",

      "sentences": "So, Bianna, unfortunately, the death toll here in the capital has now risen to at least four people dead. 19 were successfully rescued from a residential building that was hit. We revisited the scene of that building earlier. We spoke to the mayor. He said it is quite clear that Russia is targeting civilians and also crucially civilian infrastructure, heating, electricity, power, these all being very much the focus of Russia's attacks as Ukraine braces itself for a chilly winter that will be expected to come soon.Now, we don't know exactly how many people were injured in those attacks. We do know that there were many more drones fired at the city than actually struck, though. According to Ukrainian authorities, Bianna, at least 15 were intercepted on their way into the city. And now you're hearing once again from the Ukraine's leaders basically a full throated appeal to the international community to provide better, more sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry that would help them repel these kinds of attacks and also a full throated cry for sanctions against Iran, Ukraine coming out accusing Iran of supplying weaponry that is being used with deadly effect here on the ground in Ukraine. Of course, Iran has already responded by saying that that is simply not the case. We did actually see part of one of the sort of the tail fins, if you will, of one of those Shahed drones, and written on it was za (ph) Belgorod, for Belgorod, apparently implying that this was some kind of a revenge for attacks that have happened on the Russian side of the border, attacks, I should emphasize, though, Bianna, that Ukraine has not taken responsibility for officially.",

They will not move nuclear weapons around but there will be some 60 aircrafts for the next several days flying in various locations in Europe, 600 miles at least from the Russian border, also testing and training NATO and U.S. nuclear deterrent capabilities in Europe.

It is perfectly reasonable for the west to respond and say, look, you have to remember there is consequences to everything. And, of course, that is a really fine line between reminding somebody who has nuclear weapons and is somewhat unpredictable with your own nuclear capabilities. So, it is all part of this dance to try to ensure that both sides know what they're talking about and that is going to be very important for the Russians to do that messaging.",

But the fact that the Russians have turned to what is believed to be Iranian drones, the latest I read was as many as 28 drones were fired at Kyiv. These are not very sophisticated drones but they're effective.And the question is now what to be done about them. There is a debate in the E.U. today about whether Iran should be sanctioned. We know that Ukraine is asking for sanctions now. What should the U.S. be doing and why haven't sanctions been leveled yet.",

      "sentences": "I think there's a couple of really interesting angles to this question, Bianna. First, it is striking to me that Russia, which always touts itself, is having -- or touted previous to the current war that their involved in, touted themselves as a significant military, as a world leader in military operations and, of course, that has proven not to be true, to the extent that they actually have to reach out to some friends of theirs, the Iranians, for help. There has also been reporting that they've been doing this with the North Koreans. So, to me, that is striking in the sense that they have to go outside and ask somebody for assistance.The other thing that is interesting is, of course,, this is part of the sort of missile lobbing that the Russians military is doing. They can't really attack directly in places like Kyiv and some of the other major population areas in Ukraine. So, they're just lobbing missiles at them while they continue to try to fight in the east and the south. That is very typical for Russian operations. But these drones are being used primarily, I think, for psychological and terror effects in places like Kyiv these days.",

And if you watch the first one, it was pretty contentious at times. Of course, they hit on the major issues like abortion, law enforcement, the economy and more. But at times, they were talking right at each other, moderators trying to jump in at points. Tim Ryan tried to use J.D. Vance kissing up to Trump against Vance saying that Ohio needs an ass kicker, not an ass kisser, that is a quote from Ryan, especially, when it comes to President Trump.Here is another one of their exchanges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH):  This is the crowd that J.D. is running around with, the election deniers, the extremists. He's running with an extreme element here that is very, very dangerous. SEN. CANDIDATE J.D. VANCE (R-OH):  I find it interesting how preoccupied you are with this at a time when people can't afford groceries, people can't afford to walk down the street safely. Let's focus on the significant issues right now, Tim. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Tim Ryan also saying he doesn't believe President Biden should be running again and wants a generational change on both sides of the political aisle.But as I mentioned, we're about three weeks to Election Day. This is a state that President Trump carried by eight points twice, but polls up to this point in this race show that there is really no clear leader. And one of the interesting points is that this Ohio and specifically Tim Ryan is one of the eight most competitive Senate races where Democrats have outraised Republicans when it comes from July through the end of September. But the interesting part about that is that in this race, national Republicans have spent a whole lot of money helping with J.D. Vance to the point where we haven't seen that same amount of spending from national Democrats on Tim Ryan. So, even though Tim Ryan outraised J.D. Vance $17 million to around $7 million this past quarter, looking ahead, it looks like J.D. Vance will be spending over $20 million while J.D. Vance will be under $10 billion. So, we'll see if that factor makes a difference in the end or if the second debate ends up moving the needle.",

And in that challenge, what do you make of that strategy and who do you think it benefits more, Warnock for not dealing with it or focusing on it as much as Abrams' is or does she have the right political strategy going into the midterms?",

Those are allegations that he's been facing that have a lot of Georgians have been talking about. But Warnock has decided not to hammer Walker on it, not to initiate the attacks but simply to say that he's focused on health care for women.And that is striking simply because since the Dobbs decision, so many Democrats that are running in these very difficult races have been trying to amplify abortion rights in their races because of the fact that numbers show that women are increasingly registering to vote since the Dobbs decision, since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and that it potentially helped Democrats in a lot of special elections. Now, whether or not it ends up -- it is why Abrams is able to potentially close the gap, we see that she's starting to narrow that gap between her and Governor Kemp. But, again, as you noted, there is a lot of time between now and Election Day, so we won't know whose strategy is the most effective.",

Vance was not always the candidate that a lot of Republicans wanted. I mean, he is an election denier, even though he has said that he would concede and accept the election results. And he's repeated Trump's lies about the 2020 election. And I think that we may see Representative Tim Ryan try to really hammer that point continually, as well as distance himself though from President Biden. He doesn't support the president's student loan debt forgiveness program. He, as Omar mentioned, has said that he thinks that President Biden should not run for re-election, and this follows the Tim Ryan's history. He has been someone who has pushed back against party leadership, has notably multiple times tried to see Nancy Pelosi removed from speakership.
