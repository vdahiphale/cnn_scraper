      "sentences": "Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Alex Marquardt.We are now just 24 days away from the November presidential election, and brand-new polling out today in two key battleground states is giving us a glimpse of where this high stakes race stands as we near Election Day on November 5th. A just released \"New York Times\"-Sienna College poll shows a bit of a tossup race in two key swing states. The new polling has Vice President Kamala Harris with that slight lead in Pennsylvania, while former President Donald Trump takes on a similar size lead in Arizona. Both candidates on the campaign trail today traveling to battleground states on opposite sides of the country. Trump is campaigning out west. Next couple of hours we'll be seeing him holding a roundtable campaign event near Las Vegas. That's of course in battleground Nevada. Later tonight he's heading to deep blue California for a rare campaign rally in that state where he lost by nearly 30 points back in 2020. CNN's Kristen Holmes who covers the Trump campaign joining us now from California where that rally is going to be held tonight. So Kristen, what is this strategy by the Trump campaign to hold this rally in very blue California where he lost by 5 million votes four years ago?",

We know that they've been teasing this Madison Square Garden rally, which obviously New York, very deep blue. He also has an event coming up this week in Chicago, Illinois, another blue city in a blue state.Now, what they say is that, yes, they are doing these kinds of blue rallies, but that they are still going to swing states. In terms of why they are using this final sprint, particularly when you see those polls that are so narrow in those battleground states, why they're using this time to go to a blue state, they kind of go into an explanation that it doesn't really matter where he is. Senior advisors saying that the voters that they're really trying to reach in this final sprint, yes, they are in swing states, many of them, but a lot of them are low propensity voters, people who don't often go to the polls, people who don't often engage in your typical media landscape when it comes to politics. And they say an event like this, one, will be covered by national media, two, will still get the reach, whether it be on social media cutting clips, whether those air on podcasts or part of YouTube streamers' channels. These are all ways they're trying to reach those voters, and they argue that they could actually reach more voters from an event like today than just doing a traditional rally in a swing state. Obviously, there's a lot of risk in this strategy, not something we have seen before, and we'll see on November if that pays off. And just one thing I want to mention, we talked a little bit about this earlier, was that rally in Colorado yesterday, one of the things we heard Donald Trump do there was doubled down on this dark rhetoric around immigration. We'll listen for that today. But talking to people around him, they believe that that rhetoric is going to help propel him to the White House. And you look at those poll margins, they say they think that kind of fear based rhetoric around immigration or the economy is working for the former president.",

Kristen Holmes in Coachella, California, thank you very much.In the next couple hours, Vice President Harris will be heading to battleground and storm-battered North Carolina. She's spending the weekend there in that critical battleground state before heading on to Pennsylvania, yet another battleground state on Monday. Earlier today, the vice president released her medical information. Her doctor detailing the 59-year-old vice president's medical history with a health report. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joining us now live in Washington. So Priscilla, what more can you tell us about this medical report and the campaigns plans for this weekend?",

Priscilla Alvarez covering the Harris campaign, thank you very much.Joining me now to discuss the vice president's medical report is Dr. Lipi Roy. She's a physician at Greenwich House in New York. Dr. Roy, thank you very much for joining us. You heard Priscilla there ticking off some of the highlights of that medical report. What are your takeaways? DR. LIPI ROY, INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: Good to see you, Alex. This is such an important discussion. I think transparency is key, a key aspect of leadership. The health and well-being of any elected official, particularly that of the leader of the western world, is relevant to the public. Let me first disclose that I have not personally evaluated either presidential candidate, but I did review the medical report. And as a doctor, I found it very reassuring. The report stated that Vice President Harris is a healthy 59-year-old female whose medical history is really notable for seasonal allergies, hives, or urticaria, which are hives, a benign skin condition, and nearsightedness for which she uses corrective lenses. She also has no history of chronic conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, neurologic disorders, diabetes. Her physical exam -- as a former primary care doctor, Alex, her blood pressures probably better than mine. So all of that for me, it was very reassuring. I mean, I think the only aspect of the report that was missing was a mental status exam. But really there's no compelling reason to perform a full mental status exam on an otherwise healthy individual of the V.P.'s age who appears articulate and cognitively intact. So from that standpoint, I found it a pretty reassuring report, Alex.",

So that in itself is actually not that concerning. This is coming from somebody who has her own family history, also on my maternal side of both of my grandparents dying of colon cancer. So this is a topic I take very seriously. If you also read the report, she's also getting her routine preventive screening, including colonoscopies. So as long as she's getting those routinely and there's no -- really should be no cause for concern.I will just say that based on years of just going back to, like, mental status and judgment, based on years of observing V.P. Harris in interviews and public appearances, I feel that she's somebody who is clearly mentally and cognitively stable. And as a physician and a public citizen who is, by the way, going to be a first-time voter. I just got my citizenship last year, I want a leader who is physically and mentally strong, who displays empathy and good judgment, especially during a crisis such as COVID. I was in New York City, New York state, which was the global epicenter for COVID. You want a leader who is making sound judgments that are rooted in science and empathy.

And no doubt, those forces will have been on high alert tonight and in the past nights as well, waiting to see whether or not the Israelis strike.But you're absolutely right. A source with knowledge of the discussions here inside Iran has said that the Iranians have said that they will retaliate against any attack coming from Israel and that they have communicated that not just to countries here in the region, but to the United States as well, of course, that meaning through intermediaries, since the two countries do not have any sort of direct relations. And at the same time, you have had that diplomacy going on. You've had the foreign minister, for instance, traveling around the region to Saudi Arabia, saying there that all of this can only be solved through more cooperation between the countries of the region, at the same time, of course, trying to bring countries like Saudi Arabia or to the course that Iran has as well. And then today, you had the speaker of Iranian parliament, he was sent to Beirut in Lebanon with a message from Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that Iran will continue to not only support Lebanon, but specifically support Hezbollah as well, Alex.",

It continues to grow with ferocity and it expands. The IDF today announcing another 24 villages, 19 of them new villages, giving them evacuation orders inside of Lebanon. And this is telling them they need to move 30 miles north of the border.South of the border, we just heard from the IDF in the last few minutes actually expanding their closed military zones along the, along the Lebanese border, which means there's another part of that border as of tonight that can become, and I know this area because we were up there last week, that wasn't active military IDF there and thereabouts now becomes a closed military zone, which implies active military operations will begin there. So there's at least four of these zones across the northern border. This one more towards the west. So the tempo is up. The incoming rockets today, 90 plus according to the IDF, three people injured by shrapnel in the north of the country. But over the Yom Kippur, 6:00 p.m. Friday, 6:00 p.m. today local times, more than 320 missiles incoming from Hezbollah. Hezbollah saying that it's targeting collections of troops inside of Israel. If they are the IDF, if they've been successful, the IDF hasn't admitted it, and what we see is mostly than falling in open areas or being intercepted. One last night, though, hitting just about six or seven miles up the road here from Tel Aviv, hitting a nursing home there, a drone, a Hezbollah drone causing limited damage. But obviously people in that building, a nursing home for old people, they had to go take shelter in the shelter rooms.",

The issue with the current trajectory is that the Israeli occupation that may happen, but even just the Israeli invasion that is about the happen, is taking the risk of leading to either a breakdown of the state in Lebanon that is already week, or a full-blown situation of civil strife or even civil war in the worst-case scenario in Lebanon.And if that happens, that will create a situation to the north of Israel that most probably he will render the security of the citizens of Israel in the north much harder to keep in place. And so this is the question that I think in the U.S. government, but also in the Israeli government, no one really has an answer. The risk that is being taken right now in the pretext of weakening Hezbollah while the Lebanese state is still so week, while the Lebanese military is still unable, because it doesn't have neither the means nor, right now, the political cover to take over the south and push Hezbollah off the border. If that happens while the Lebanese state hasn't been weakened -- hasn't been strengthened, then we are looking at a very big risk of a breakdown of whatever remains of the Lebanese state.",

I think it's important to understand that while 70 percent, more or less, of the Lebanese population doesn't support Hezbollah's actions or policies, they also aren't glad to be seeing Israel attacking their country and leading to this much turmoil and this much destruction. And so for most of the Lebanese, it's neither Hezbollah nor Israel. That is the first thing.Second, the way that Netanyahu message landed among the Lebanese is with a lot of concern. The Lebanese today, whether they're in Beirut or in the south, are enduring daily drones above their heads 24/7. That's a kind of psychological warfare. They're also enduring daily, very heavy bombing that is leading to a lot of civilian casualties. But more importantly massive displacement that is pressuring a lot of the infrastructure that is already under strain. And the way Netanyahu formulated it sounded to the Lebanese as either a choice between civil war amongst themselves, so for them to take up arms against Hezbollah while they don't necessarily have the means right now, or face a devastating war by Israel. And they've been down this road before. In 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon, got all the way to west Beirut while saying that it was going to be a limited operation. It ended up being an 18-year-long occupation of southern Lebanon with the creation of Hezbollah. And we see what Hezbollah has become today.

Authorities saying that those 12 people that were injured showed up to local hospitals. We do not have identities. We do not have the condition of these victims or the ages, and we are, of course, asking those questions. Authorities saying they still have a lot of questions, which is why they're going through all of that evidence. They're also saying that the community is safe because what police say is that this was a contained incident. They said it's isolated. And so again, a lot of work to be done here by authorities. But so far, no arrests have been announced, Alex.",

Camila Bernal, thank you very much for that report.When we come back, we will take you to the streets of Springfield, Ohio to see firsthand the impact of the Haitian migrant surge in the city. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:49:20] MARQUARDT: Since 2020, roughly 12,000 Haitian immigrants have moved to Springfield, Ohio, a city that was once struggling to find workers. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, has spent a large portion of their campaign targeting these legal immigrants, but spreading disinformation and threatening to deport them if elected. In this week's \"The Whole Story\", CNN's Omar Jimenez takes viewers inside this city. Community members reveal how Haitian immigrants have revitalized the local economy. Here's a preview.",

And we did have history in game five. Yu Darvish and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, first time two Japanese pitchers started a playoff game.Dodgers got to Darvish early, though. Kike Hernandez blasting a solo homerun in the second, giving L.A. the lead. But then Darvish started dealing. He held all three of L.A.'s former MVPs, Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Mookie Betts to just one hit combined. He retires 14 straight. But then in the seventh Teoscar Hernandez says see you later, another solo homer for L.A. Darvish was stellar, except for dudes named Hernandez. L.A. wins to nothing. They're back in the National League Championship series for the sixth time in nine years. They'll face the Mets. Here's part of manager Dave Roberts locker room speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
