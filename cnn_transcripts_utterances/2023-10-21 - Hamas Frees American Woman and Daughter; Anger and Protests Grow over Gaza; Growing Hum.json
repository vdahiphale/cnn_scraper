There's a statement from Qatar, which talks about -- it seemed very upbeat about ongoing negotiations to try to free the hostages and, to use their words, \"deescalate tensions.\" So the external leadership is based on Doha. The Qataris have been funding Hamas to the tune of anywhere from $3 million to $10 million a month, subsidizing them in Gaza, on the assumption that Hamas was primarily interested in governing and stabilizing the situation in Gaza. That's what we're preparing for but it's certainly not what we saw on October 7th. But it's also propaganda. I mean, it's cruel manipulation, dribbling out the hostages. And as you'll know, they released two Americans.

This is the fourth known phone call between the two leaders since the deadly Hamas attacks on October 7. They met face to face in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Meanwhile, U.S. House Republicans have no clear path forward after Jim Jordan failed to get enough Republican votes to win the House speakership on his third floor vote. Several Republicans jumped into the race after the party rejected Jordan. But it's unclear if any can get the 217 votes needed to win. One Jordan ally trying to blame the chaos on Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): Clearly, there is yet another void. We are going to have a couple more days of chaos as we try to get a sense of what's next. To me, it reminds me how incredibly irresponsible it was for 208 Democrats and 8 Republicans to put this House into absolute chaos without any kind of a plan for how we were going to move forward.

But the ongoing chaos and confusion has been played out in public display for the most part. Congress is closed for business. Emotions are running high. Jim Jordan kept on losing support rather than gaining support over time. By the third ballot, his support collapsed faster than a third grade science project. And so what we are seeing is utter chaos. The question is, is chaos the intent? Is that the goal? It doesn't appear that way. Donald Trump is a chaos maker. But in the House, they need someone who can bring people together. Blaming the Democrats, as your previous clip showed, is silly, because Democrats are sitting back and saying, why should we help you when you are the ones who are going to go against us and legislate?

He warned the Israeli leadership that you need to be deliberative. You need to ask hard questions. You need to be clearheaded and you can't let, as we did after 9/11, you can't let primal feelings dictate policy. That was sage advice.
