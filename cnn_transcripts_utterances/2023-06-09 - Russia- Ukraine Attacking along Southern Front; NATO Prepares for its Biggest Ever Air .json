      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", great to have you with us this Friday. You are watching special CNNcoverage of the indictment of Former U.S. President Donald Trump on seven federal charges tied to classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. CNN will continue to follow this developing story during the show and throughout the coming hours. In the meantime, much more coming up this hour too, including a conversation with the Spanish Vice President and Nadia Calvino will discuss the government's decision to call snap elections, what it means for economic policy in particular this year, and why she sees voters should trust them for another term? Spain also managing to outperform the Euro zone, both in terms of growth and in terms of tackling inflation. The question is, of course, what next? For now, though, we'll begin with the latest developments in Ukraine. And Ukraine has launched attacks on Russian forces in the south of the country, with officials in Russian held territory describing \"fierce fighting\" in the Zaporizhzhia region. All this comes as floodwaters in Kherson start to recede following the collapse of a crucial dam on Tuesday. Although, President Zelenskyy says Russian forces are still shelling evacuation points. Let's get straight to Sam Kiley, who's in Central Ukraine for us now, Sam, good to have you with us. I think this week is firmly established that we've moved into a more intense phase now in the fighting after months of effective stalemate. What's your read on what we're hearing both from the Ukrainians and the Russians at this moment?",

And I think that's why when I say, you know, why is it important for the U.S. and all of us to support what's going on in Ukraine? It's because we're defending the rules that we spent a long time building over the past half century and we need to send a strong signal of deterrence to aggressors everywhere, that that kind of aggression is not going to go unchecked.",

You know, there are many topics on which, you know, it's right to engage with China, whether it's global public health, macro-economic stability, climate change. These are big global issues that aren't going to get resolved without China, engaging when those discussions have been part of the solution. So whilst I think it's absolutely right to recognize the challenge that it poses, take the steps necessary to protect ourselves work with allies to do that. You're where it makes sense to engage on these global issues with China where obviously they do play an important role. I think that is entirely right and reasonable too. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Last week, we broke the bombshell report that prosecutors have an audiorecording of the former president not only claiming to have classified information, but also acknowledging the limits of his ability to declassify it. And this undercut the public statements from former President Trump from his allies, and even from his own lawyers. Now I want to read you some portions of this transcript. He's talking about General Mark Milley there and then an article that upset the former president. He was talking about Mark Milley. And he says well with Milley, let me see. I'll show you an example. And he says that he has a big pile of papers. This just came up. Look, this was him. They presented me this. This is off the record. But they presented me this. This was him. This was in the Defense Department and him. We look at some this was him. This wasn't done by me. This was him. Now I'm sure you're not able to count while I talk. But at least four times he says this was him. He's trying to rebut what Milley allegedly said about the former president's plans for Iran. I'm going to go on. He says again, he's speaking to a group of people at his Bedminster golf club, none of whom have security clearances. He says all sorts of stuff, pages long look, wait a minute. Let's see here. I just found isn't this amazing? This totally wins my case, you know, except it's like highly confidential secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this. So I want to pause for a second. Secret and confidential are two levels of classification. Here in the U.S. he seems a little bit confused about which one it is. But he's also appearing to want to show this to the other people in the room. We know in the room are two people working on an autobiography of his former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and then two of his aides. And he knew he was being recorded, because he was in the habit of having his age record conversations with journalists. Perhaps the most damning quote is that, he asks, can we declassify this? And then he answers himself saying, as president, I could have declassified. But now I can't, which, of course, undercuts his public defense, which is that he was able to declassify all of this, with his mind. And incredibly damning piece of evidence in the hands of prosecutors, it's unclear, though, whether this will be included or quoted in the indictment.",

Inflation rate is already around 3 percent. And the downward trend will continue. We will have launched a massive investment and reform program which is actually kick starting a structural modernization of the Spanish economy, which is already showing. And the results are also already visible in terms of strong employment, better quality improvement, employment. Green and digital economy is booming as foreign accounts current account surplus that is also pulling the economy up. So all these are positive indicators, the economy is doing very well. And that's why actually the opposition is trying to focus the debate on other issues, values, and fake news and all sorts of arguments so as not to talk about the economy.

And that's something that Spain alone can't control the European Central Bank government does. Vice President, how do you plan to bring the debt levels down?

But as soon as the, we resumed the strong growth path, we have started to go down. And so we reduced the debt to GDP level last year, by five percentage points, we have outperformed our targets. And our fiscal path has been validated by the European Commission a couple of weeks ago. So we are on track to absorb as fast as possible, the extra cost derived from the pandemic, and all these in a context of strong growth and job creation should, you know provide us with confidence when we look to the future.",

But this is awarded for responsible internationalism and educating citizens about foreign affairs and understanding I think Spain in your case is placed in the world. For those that criticize and it is something that I see as perhaps a dividing line between your party and the opposition.

Spain is playing an important role leading important debates within the EU, and also having a better relation with larger nations. And you know, recently we had President Sanchez coming to talk to President Biden, and they discussed the important issues for the present and the future, for example, so AI regulation, now with my digital health. So this shows that Spain is now I think, occupying the place that should correspond to the fourth European economy, which was maybe not the case in the past. And I regret very much, you know, that the opposition parties are actually not taking these very seriously, they do not have a strong representation in international Fora. They do not speak other languages, they do not. And they portray these as irrelevant, which frankly, it isn't, I am very honored to have got this prize. And I think what it signals is that now more than ever, in this current geopolitical context, we need to work together and find ways to address global common challenges in a constructive manner, reinforcing our multilateral framework, and moving away from confrontation and tensions which are not contributing to prosperity, and peace throughout the world.",
