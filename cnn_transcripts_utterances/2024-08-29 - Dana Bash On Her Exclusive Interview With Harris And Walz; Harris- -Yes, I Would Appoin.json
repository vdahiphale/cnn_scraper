Obviously, that includes not just her party, not just potentially swing voters who vote for her, but Republicans who don't vote for her.

That pledge that Harris made to have a Republican in her cabinet, talking about the diversity of opinion that is necessary, do you see this as another example of Harris trying to reach out to many of those disaffected Republican voters? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think that's exactly what it is, to reach out to those voters that voted for Nikki Haley in the primaries, even after she dropped out. And I was actually just talking to one such voter in Arizona, and I asked them what they thought about that -- those comments that Harris made, this was a two time Trump voter, a voter that no longer says that she's going to vote for Trump, she's a suburban woman in Arizona, and she said that she liked that Harris said that. That she thought that she wants to see Harris talk to moderate Republicans and make policy with moderate Republicans and show that she'll work in a bipartisan way with Republicans.

Now she feels very confident that she has the base the Democratic Party, and polling shows very much the same, that Democrats are energized, that she's unified the Democratic Party. Well, if the Democratic Party is unified, especially because she's going against Donald Trump, then the next step then is to try to pick people that aren't part of the Democratic base, that are Republicans, that are basically people that maybe were like fine with the Trump presidency, but do not like him, do not think he's a good person, and don't want to see him as president again, and don't want to just frankly argue about him for another four years.",

I mean, we saw they featured a number of Republicans from Congress -- former Congressman Adam Kinzinger to Stephanie Grisham, the former spokesperson in the Trump administration. And it's her trying to say that, yes, her values are ultimately still the same, but that she is also moving in a way that is required of legislators.

Hold up for a second. Hold up for a second. Let me just say something. Let me just say something. We are fighting for a democracy. Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard. I am speaking now, but on the subject, I will say this, the president and I are working around the clock. We've got to get a hostage deal done and get a cease fire done now. So back to this election and Donald Trump. So, in addition to the fight on the fundamental freedom to make decisions about one's own body, I have been traveling our country and the people of Georgia know what I know, there is a full on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights, including the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence. And an attack on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And we will fight against all of that, including the freedom to live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. Here's the thing. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, Savannah, the baton is in our hands. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks and red flag law. So much is on the line in this election. So much is on the line. And understand this is not 2016 or 2020, things are different. A lot is the same when we think about the issues and then there is significant differences. The stakes in 2024 even higher, because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that going forward he will be effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House. Now just imagine, well, the courts are going to take care of that. We're going to get them out of -- we're going to elect ourselves and everybody here in November. But I mentioned the Supreme Court ruling because understand what this means. Just imagine before there was at least the threat of consequence, understand what it now means, and imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. (CHANTING)",

So coming here to Wisconsin, first visit, as you mentioned, since the RNC, to cement himself, if he hasn't already, among the supporters that we've seen come from all over this portion of the Midwest.For perspective, we're essentially on the border of Wisconsin and Minnesota right now, so not everybody is coming from Wisconsin to this particular rally, and this area, this county, is one that Joe Biden took by a sizable margin. Regardless, a lot of people have showed up to see what the President has to say and what we expect to take place in a town hall type of format moderated by Tulsi Gabbard, obviously, she ran for president as a Democrat years back, now identifies as an Independent and has already endorsed the former president as well. So we'll see how that actually plans out. We see the stage already behind us set up for, clearly, a conversation between two people and potentially others being brought in as well. When I spoke to one Trump voter outside of the rally, prior to coming in here, he said that he drove in from Southern Illinois and has been trying to go to as many events as possible.

Here is a part of the statement here. Participants in the August 26th ceremony and subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities. An Arlington National Cemetery employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the armed forces and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with dignity and respect. The statement went on to point out that there are some 3,000 public ceremonies each year at Arlington National Cemeteries, and those are carried out without incident. Obviously this an exception to that rule, because of the altercation that the statement addresses. And then the army also pointing out that conducting political activities at Arlington National Cemetery, specifically in Section 60, where fallen service members from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, that is prohibited and a violation of federal law. Now the army does go on to say they consider this matter closed because the employee in this case has decided not to press charges. The Trump campaign has, however, doubled down.
