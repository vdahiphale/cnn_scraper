Yale history professor, Beverley Gage, explains why the former FBI chief is targetedeveryone, from Martin Luther King Jr. to the Ku Klux Klan. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Can he get the votes? That is the big question today on Capitol Hill as Kevin McCarthy tries again to rebound after hemorrhaging support in his bid to become House speaker. The deadlock has ground the gears of government to a halt. But President Biden wants to show that government can actually work. And today, he is in Kentucky, touting last year's massive infrastructure bill. Alongside, the Senate Republican Leader, Mitch McConnell. Now, it is that kind of bipartisanship that's necessary to support another democracy, that's the one in Ukraine. Its foreign minister said today that preparations are underway to receive America's Patriot air defense system. This, after Washington pledged another $45 billion in emergency assistance over the holidays. And every day, that aid becomes more critical as President Zelenskyy says that Russia is digging in for the long haul. Including the bombing of cities and crucial infrastructure. My first guest tonight is deeply familiar with the dynamics at play. For almost three years, John Sullivan served as U.S. ambassador to Russia. He was there when Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. And he's now joining me from Washington. Ambassador Sullivan, welcome back to our program. Can I ask you first and foremost, you were in Washington where this chaos is erupting in Congress as we speak. I guess I want to ask you, does this threaten America's standing abroad, particularly, what message does it gave when, you know, U.S. is trying to project strength in its support of Ukraine and against, you know, Russia. JOHN SULLIVAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA:  Well, it's great to be with you, Christiane. Thank you very much. And it's a very important question and one I'd struggled with when I was the ambassador in Moscow. For example, the events on January 6th were like catnip for the Russian propaganda's inside and outside the Kremlin. They pay very close attention to what was happening in Washington. They used the George Floyd protest to their advantage, January 6th. I'm not sure that the votes for speaker rise to that level. But it's certainly something that the Russians play very close attention to when their propagandists use against us at every opportunity.",

The only question in my mind is whether, given all of these significant losses they've suffered, and the inability of their military and security services to launch the type of military campaign that they sought, whether they can do it.

Officials who were reading from their low notes, sort of, looking down at their shoes as we were, you know, reviewing the bidding of what we thought they were going to do in the Ukraine. So, as convinced as I am of Putin's ambition for Ukraine, I'm equally convinced that there are senior people in the Russian government today, both from before the invasion and probably more significantly after the invasion.

So, the president has been cautious. Putin himself has been cautious. Putin has signaled, threatened the use of weapons of mass destruction, he hasn't. He hasn't attacked areas outside of Ukraine to the West. Putin himself has showed restrained. Biden -- President Biden has drawn some red lines, too. As is President Xi. You know, the Russian and the Chinese always talk about their, you know, their unlimited partnership and how they're -- that, you know, the sky is the limit on Russia and China. Well, not so.

What -- again, anexample of the strategic failure of Putin's aggressive war. He is driven 44 million Ukrainians into a corner. And I read quotes and I speak to -- and I read quotes in the media and speak to Ukrainians all the time. Russian speakers who have relatives in Russia, who should be well disposed to their Slavic sisters and brothers who hate Russia now. And that's what Putin has done. He has created an implacable enemy of the Ukrainian people. Even if President Biden, even if the United States, even if NATO put pressure on Ukraine to capitulate or to make concessions, geographic concessions, sure, it would be extremely difficult for them to continue the military campaign. But Ukraine would be a festering sore on the continent of Europe on a much larger scale, Christiane, than for example, Belfast has been, was four decades in late 20th century with violence, the troubles. What would happen -- what's happening in Ukraine, if arms stopped going to the Ukrainian military from the west, would make the troubles in Northern Ireland look like child's play. So, I don't -- I'm very pessimistic about the path forward, at least in the short term, even this calendar year for negotiations. What would drive negotiations is if Putin were in a place, where as I said before, he simply did not have the wherewithal to continue his military campaign. I'm asked frequently, you know, what's the off ramp for Putin? And I said this to Secretary Blinken, it's the first time I said, it was last summer, we were talking about the question that he and I - he as secretary and I as ambassador get all the time. What's the off ramp? And I said -- my response is, he doesn't want an off ramp. He won't take one if offered. But if we want to use a turnpike or highway analogy, he'll take a rest. You know, like on the New Jersey Turnpike, he'd like the Vladimir Vladimirovich rest area to regroup and reequip. Reequip is forces that may take a while. But he has ultimately got in his heart. This ambition, this imperial ambition to bring Ukraine, to regather this Russian land. And he can't tolerate an independent globally admired president of Ukraine like Zelenskyy in Kyiv.

Now she's learning to be a dressmaker. We're feeling very bad, she tells us. Girls are not able to go to school, staying home, doing nothing. We hope that this will change our life, so we can be self-sufficient, have a profession, learn, earn money to support ourselves and our families. Neda wanted to be a professional soccer player. AMANPOUR (on camera):  You're 17. You have never known the Taliban government. Did you ever imagine that this would happen to you, that you would be prevented from going to school? AMANPOUR (voiceover):  No, never. We tried our best for our future. But it's a dark one now, because we're kept away from our schools.

All of these things that we tend to associate with are kind of liberal or progressive faith in the federal government and federal power. And on the other hand, he was this devout and extremely outspoken etiological conservative his whole like on race, on religion, on anti-communism, on law and order. And so, that was just a really fascinating combination to me because we don't see those things put together all that often in our own time and day.

And 1917 is the year of the Bolshevik Revolution. And so, from his first moment that he enters the Justice Department, he's interested in these issues. As a very young man.

And it is -- it wasoutrageous and disheartening to read about it. And as you say, to get some of the new details that are now available. For instance, that anonymous letter that they sent this kind of faked up letter that went with real recordings they had made in King's hotel room of his extramarital sex life. You know, when I was doing research in the archives, I came across the first unredacted version of that letter, and it really was, you know, just kind of shocking and in many ways, quite horrifying to read in its totality. But, you know, I think for Hoover, King came to represent a whole constellation of things that he had long despised, had a lot of animosity towards. I mean, he had always been conducting surveillance of black leaders, civil rights leaders. He believed that King, I think rightly and wrongly, had a couple of very close advisers who had been close to the communist party. So, that was another strike against him. King criticized the FBI, which was just about the worst thing you could do to J. Edgar Hoover. And then finally, as you say, as this surveillance, the wiretaps, the bugs expanded, he got really deeply interested and almost obsessed with the King's sex life. In part because, you know, he felt King was presenting himself as this great moral figure, a Baptist minister, but had this whole secret life that no one was talking about. Put those things together and Hoover put this massive security bureaucracy really at work to destroy King in pretty explicit ways.",

And he was shaped by that process. And then, the other thing that really came to fascinate to me was his college fraternity, which was a fraternity called Kappa Alpha, which was an explicitly southern, explicitly segregationist fraternity that had some of the countries sort of most famous segregationists among its alums. Thomas Dickson who wrote the novels that became the basis for the \"Birth of a Nation\" was one of the most famous Kappa Alphas, and he was sort of in Hoover's orbit, a lot of Southern Democrats.

He really did genuinely think that you could not do this, in particular, to American citizens. That it was unconstitutional. It wasn't going to stand up in court in particular. And then, he also had a certain amount of self- interest in the whole thing because the FBI have launched its own much more limited interment program that was aimed, in part, at very particular Japanese people that the FBI had determined to be disloyal or dangerous right by their own standards.

Four of them were Republicans. Four of them were Democrats. And that alone seems unthinkable in our own moment. But I think there were a combination of things that produced that. One was, it was kind of a luck at the moment. He happened to be there on the ground floor when suddenly the federal government began to expand so dramatically in the '30s and '40s and there just weren't a lot of safeguards or mechanisms of accountability in place. You know, there were no congressional intelligence committees. There were no limits on the FBI director's tenure. These things that we now have, the clause of Hoover, none of those were in place. And then, he was just an incredibly good bureaucrat. I mean, you had to do favors for powerful people. He knew how to kind of build his own political constituency. He knew how to maintain an image that was nonpartisan enough that he could make these transitions. And particularly, as you got into the later years, he also was just lucky because the last two presidents happen to be pretty good friends of his by the time they became president, that was Johnson and Nixon.
