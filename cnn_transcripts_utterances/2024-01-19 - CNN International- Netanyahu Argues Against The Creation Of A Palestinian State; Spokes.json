On the other side, Joycelyn Wade is saying in -- through her lawyers and a statement that we received at CNN that this is a personal matter, and Fani Willis is using a public platform here. Take that at, what you will.POPPY HARLOW, HOST, \"CNN THIS MORNING\": Thank you very much. CNN This Morning continues now. BIANCA NOBILO, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello. You're watching CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London. Just ahead, we begin in Israel where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argues against the idea of creating a Palestinian state. How would that impact Israel's relations with its allies and regional neighbors? Then, growing concerns over U.S. aid to Ukraine as President Biden continues to push lawmakers to approve his $60 billion funding request. Plus, Japan might be hours away from landing a spacecraft on the moon for the first time. What it means for the region and the international space race, next. Benjamin Netanyahu is offering his view of an eventual Palestinian state. He doesn't want one. The Israeli Prime Minister has publicly come out against the idea despite U.S. efforts to get him on board. He gave this reason. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Any agreement, with or without agreement, the State of Israel must control security between the Jordan River to the sea. The Prime Minister of Israel should have the ability to say no, even to our greatest friends, when he has to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And a Palestinian spokesman says there can be no stability in the region without a two-state solution, which would mean an independent Palestinian state next to Israel. We're also watching the border between Israel and Lebanon. You'relooking at footage right now as smoke rising over that border today as tensions between the two countries remain high. Keep in mind, this is the week the UN Chief declared to CNN \"We cannot have in Lebanon another Gaza.\" Our Nic Robertson is standing by for us in Tel Aviv. Nic, can we return to those comments by Benjamin Netanyahu about his rejection of a potential Palestinian state? What was your reaction, and to what extent could this drive a further wedge between Israel and the U.S.?",

Nada, it'd be great if you could give us the latest on what is happening in the -- on the Lebanese-Israeli border. But, I'd also like your reaction, because recently you spent quite a lot of time in the region, to what Nic was talking about, and this idea -- this rejection of a Palestinian state by Prime Minister Netanyahu, all the while President Isaac Herzog was even saying yesterday that they expect the normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia and other regional partners to continue. It just sounds so out of touch with reality. How do you think this would be going down in the region?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And look, we have been hearing vocal support for the Palestinian people, and particularly people of Gaza, from regional leaders. And there has long been that support, that call for a viable independent Palestinian state across the board within the region. We have seen that over recent weeks translating, of course, into hostilities when it comes to the situation in Gaza.As you mentioned, we have seen that crossfire between Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon on Lebanon's southern border and the Israeli Military. The Lebanese government now saying as well that there cannot be any discussion around a possible ceasefire until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. That has been echoed by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. They say that their attacks on the Red Sea will continue so long as Israel's attacks on Gaza continue. But, the idea of an independent viable political suit solution which would see an independent Palestinian state, it's something that is held at the core of many foreign policies across the Middle East. And of course, as Nic was mentioning, that this certainly puts Israel now at odds not only with some of its closest allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden, but also at odds with many leaders in the European Union, and of course, crucially, in the Middle East. Now, of course, important to underscore that when we are talking about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Israel seeks to establish total security controls over all territories west of Jordan, we have to remember, of course, that we have seen the erosion of security controls, the erosion of any source of autonomy, really, for the Palestinians over the last couple of years. When we talk about the situation in Gaza, of course, Israeli authorities -- Israeli officials have said they do not seek to re-occupy Gaza, but important to remember that Gaza has been under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade since 2007. And of course, the situation in the occupied West Bank has also raised concern. Of course, while technically under the political administration of the Palestinian Authority, there is a pervasive overarching security oversight by the Israeli authorities. And of course, there is the issue of settlements as well. The UN says that there are now hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, living across more than 250 settlements considered to be illegal by many in the international community. That has gone a long way towards eroding, in practical terms, the viability of any past iteration of a two-state solution which would see an independent Palestinian state. So, clearly, this messaging that we are now hearing from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will certainly raise concern around continued calls from many in the international community for a political solution to be focused on as opposed to this cycle of military action and violence that we have seen in the region. And as we heard from the President of the Palestinian Authority, any idea, any erosion of the idea of a viable independent Palestinian state will not only increase tensions, increase hostilities between the Israelis and Palestinians, but also deepen insecurity more broadly in the region.",

Demonstrators are holding signs against the airstrikes and carrying Palestinian flags. Yemen's Houthi rebels are vowing to keep attacking vessels in the Red Sea, in particular those linked to Israel. On Thursday, the Iran-backed group fired to ant-ship missiles at yet another U.S.-owned commercial ship. The U.S. has launched at least five attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen since the Red Sea attacks began. Despite that, President Joe Biden says it hasn't seemed to slow them down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the President's comments really speak to the challenges he is facing in this moment as the U.S. and allies like the UK have been trying to take these steps to deter the Houthi rebels from launching these types of attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. The United States, along with allies, in some instances, has so far launched five strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The goal they say is to degrade the Houthis' ability to further launch any types of attacks or strikes on commercial ships that are going through the Red Sea. But, so far, as the President himself has said, this has not stoppedthe Houthis from being able to do that. And so, there is a big question about what more the administration could do in this moment. Of course, President Biden deliberated for quite some time about whether to even launch the strikes in Yemen. There were concerns about whether this conflicts could spread into a more wider regional issue as this war between Israel and Hamas has been playing out over the course of the past few months. Ultimately, the U.S. believe that they did need to take some type of actions to try to degrade the Houthis' ability to launch these types of attacks. We also this week heard from the U.S., saying that they were going to label the Houthi rebels as a specially designated global terrorist group. That will include issuing some sanctions on them, which they also feel could potentially limit some of their abilities. But, as the President said, that so far, this hasn't stopped the Houthi rebels. He did vow that the U.S. would continue to take these strikes. And just yesterday, National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby said that the U.S. has additional steps that they could also take to try to stop these types of attacks. He would not detail what exactly that would be. But, as you noted, this issue relating to the conflict in Israel, between Israel and Hamas, also if you think about the wars in Ukraine, foreign policy is expected to loom over the 2024 race. I think one thing that's unclear at this time is how much of voters will take these issues of foreign policy into account as they are making their decisions. Of course, you have already seen some discontent within the Democratic Party as many Arab Americans in this country have expressed frustration with the U.S. support for Israel, as they continue their campaign in Gaza, leading to the death of thousands of Palestinians. That is something that President Biden has said he will need to grapple with in trying to make his case to the Arab American community going forward. But, I think the bottom line here is even as foreign policy is dominating so much of the President's mind and agenda here at the White House today, it's just unclear how much voters will be voting on these issues heading into November.",

That warning from one of America's leading nuclear scientists, one of two longtime North Korea observers, who say Kim Jong Un is sending signals in state media, he may be prepared to take advantage of global chaos to exploit what he sees as weakness and vulnerability between the U.S. and close allies South Korea and Japan.

RIPLEY (voice-over): For years, former Los Alamos Director Siegfried Hecker had unparalleled access to North Korea's highly secretive nuclear program, seeing more than almost any American. What he is seeing now, he says, reminiscent of the lead up to the catastrophic Korean War more than 70 years ago, a chilling shift in leader Kim Jong Un's strategy, far more than the usual saber rattling.",
