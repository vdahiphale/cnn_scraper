It was a campaign promise from Biden. He wanted to give sort of breathing room after COVID to sort of stave off delinquencies and debts. But it was immediately challenged. And, basically, the states challenging, they said, look, President Biden does not have this kind of authority. If you're going to act in a way that is going to erase billions of dollars of debt, you have got to do it through Congress, and the majority today agreed that Congress had to act. Here is what Chief Justice John Roberts said. He said: \"The secretary asserts that the HEROES Act grants him the authority to cancel $430 billion of student loan principal. It does not.\" He said: \"The question here is not whether something should be done. It is who has the authority to do it,\" a real blow to Biden. And Justice Elena Kagan, as she did last term, she basically accused the majority here of once again ignoring Congress, ignoring the will of Congress. Here's what she said in a pretty fierce dissent. She said: \"The court acts as though it is an arbiter of political and policy disputes, rather than of cases and controversies.\" The majority said they were skeptical of the so-called administrative state, of these agencies acting beyond their authority today in this case.",

She said that that goes against her religious beliefs. Once again, we had a 6-3 court here ruling in her favor. Under the First Amendment, Neil Gorsuch basically said, Colorado in its public accommodations law, it can't force someone to create a product with a message that goes against her religious beliefs. Here's what he said: \"The First Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the government demands.\" So you can imagine, again, you had the liberals in dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who actually read this dissent from the bench for a long time, she really wanted to point out the implications. She said: \"Today, the court for the first time in history grants a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of a protected class.\" She called it a sad day. And she expressed concern that this decision, which had to do with this Web site designer, could spread to other areas, such as people who had racial objections. And that was key. She expressed it today. She expressed it to -- or at oral arguments. And all along, this Web site designer, she had always argued free speech. She said that the government couldn't force her to make these Web sites, sell them, when they had a message for same-sex marriage that violated her religious beliefs.",

Think of this as a very basic way of saying, if you have a sign on your front door of a business, and it says, open, open to the public. I'm not talking about the hours you're actually keeping, but open to the public. The question is, does that mean you have the right to exclude people, for whatever reason, that you would otherwise have to provide services for that are generally open to the public? Is it open to the public, except you and this person and this person? Is it open, except this person and that person or this religion or otherwise? That's the parameters of what this conversation is. It's going to come down to, and they already said, what is the type of expression? What is the art, so to speak? Is it me compelling you to simply provide a benign sort of noncreative expression or compelling you to use your artistry against your own beliefs?

But when they graduate college, they still face discrimination in the workplace when it comes to hiring practices. When we recognize some of the most educated people in America today are black women, they have a disproportionate amount of student debt that shows that it is expensive to be an educated black woman in America.

Oftentimes, when we think about what happens when black people graduate from college, they have to continue to work in that work force, figure out ways to pay off that student debt as well support their family. Oftentimes, we see with our white peers they get the support from their family necessary to start buying homes, starting businesses and enter into this economy. And so, when we recognize the disproportionate impacts that happen when folks have to take out student debt, we recognize that this is a difficult situation for black America.
