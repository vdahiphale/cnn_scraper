President Biden says the amount of aid going into Gaza is not nearly enough. We're now learning that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is due to meet with Israeli War Cabinet Member Benny Gantz on Monday. It comes as a U.S. official tells CNN that Israel has quote, \"basically accepted a six-week ceasefire and hostage release proposal in Gaza.\"Now, negotiators are waiting for Hamas to agree to a defined category of vulnerable hostages. The U.S. is hoping to have a ceasefire in place before the start of Ramadan, which is about a week away. CNN White House Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez has more on the ceasefire talks and the U.S. efforts to get aid into Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The White House on Saturday described the humanitarian airdrop in Gaza as successful precaution that more still needs to be done. And here's what we know about the operation that happened on Saturday. It included 66 bundles that were dropped in Gaza. It was done with the Jordanian Air Force and in total included 38,000 meals. There was no water or medical supplies that were part of this operation. And U.S. officials say they chose the location based off assessments so that people were sheltering in that area, and were in need. And after the fact, they saw that civilians did approach the assistance and that they began distributing it. But administration officials made clear that this is not enough that they want to flood the zone that includes humanitarian airdrops, as well as exploring other avenues like a maritime corridor. And they also noted that none of that is a substitute to the crossings into Gaza and making sure that those land crossings are also available to surge as much aid as possible into a region that has been grappling with a worsening humanitarian crisis. Of course, all of this comes as those hostage deal talks continue. And a senior administration official told reporters on Saturday that Israel has, quote, \"basically accepted a framework.\" That framework includes a six-week ceasefire that would allow for the release of hostages who are deemed vulnerable. That includes women, the elderly and the wounded, as well as more assistance to get into Gaza. And over the course of those six-weeks, the expectation is that officials could continue to hammer out some of the stickier points like the release of hostages, who are also IDF members as well as to establish a more enduring plan. Now, this comes ahead of a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris and Israeli War Cabinet Member Benny Gantz on Monday where the two are expected to talk about all of this as well as day after planning for Gaza as the clock ticks for the hostage deal, but also to address this worsening crisis in Gaza.

All right now to U.S. politics in the looming Super Tuesday nominating contests that are just two days away, 865 delegates will be up for grabs in 15 states. It takes more than 1200 delegates to win the GOP presidential nomination. Donald Trump racked up more wins Saturday. He claimed nearly 85% of the vote in Idaho's caucuses compared to just over 13% for rival Nikki Haley. Missouri's Republicans also held caucuses on Saturday. Trump commanded a whopping 100% of that vote. Trump now has 247 total delegates compared to Haley's 24. Now, despite his ongoing successes, Trump is trying to turn his focus away from the nominating contest and toward the general election.

They have to go to their constituency, and you say, their constituency might accuse them of looking weak or giving in.

And that is a problem for government as it looks ahead. The government projects a 15,000-doctor shortfall by 2035 to cope with that aging population.It also has another problem that it has healthcare concentrated in the main areas, the main cities and not in the rural and regional parts of the country. And so it is trying to address all of these changes. Now there have been some calls for an overhaul in the insurance, the insurance framework around medical provision. And as our team on the ground have been hearing today, some doctors are saying that is an issue that the government is avoiding. So what the government has proposed is something you've alluded to, it is adding more doctors to the role to get more trainees coming through the system. In fact, 2000 trainees in 2025. And what the doctors are telling us is, well, that's all very well but the system is broken in other ways. And just adding 2000 students isn't going to fix it. Here's one we spoke to you earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOON BYUNG-KI, ENT DOCTOR: We need more doctor. We're not arguing with that. It's just that, like I said, it's 2,000, 2K Number is a problem right at once. No nurses, no PAs.
