But our colleague Ted Barrett did have a chance to talk to Senator John Cornyn, who's seen as someone who could potentially succeed Mitch McConnell as the leader of the Republican Party. And Ted was pressing him, as were other reporters, on whether or not he planned to vie for that role. He said today is not the day to have those conversations. Another person spotted on the floor, John Thune, the number two Republican right now in the Senate, and another person who is largely seen as potentially being able to fill McConnell's shoes when he steps aside as Republican leader in November. But it was really this amazing moment as McConnell went to the floor and made clear that one of the talents that is underappreciated in Washington is knowing when it is time for new leadership. And, certainly, he's referring to many lawmakers he's seen stay in their roles for perhaps longer than they should have. He also was making it clear that he's not going anywhere just yet. He is not planning to step aside as leader until November. And he argued that he still has plenty of disappointment for his critics that he's going to look forward to in the months ahead. Certainly, he is someone seen on the Republican side as a long- serving, respected leader, someone that people listen to within his party. But he wasn't shy on the floor about the fact that some of the most pressing issues that he's been pushing for, including aid to Ukraine, has really put him at odds with many members of his own party, saying that he isn't perfect, he has a lot of flaws, but the one thing that he does get is politics. And I think he acknowledges the fact that the Republican Party has really shifted beneath him, even as he has continued to view his role as making sure that the U.S. has universal and global impact on the world stage -- Brianna, Boris.",

And I was incredibly moved by his speech. I had a chance to talk to him on the phone a little earlier today, and he's at peace with the decision and looking forward, frankly, to the next couple of years. When you're not in leadership, it often frees you up to do some things that are more issue-based and things you really care about, as opposed to having to run the whole conference. And I know he's looking forward to that. I think he's likely to have a senior role on the Appropriations Committee, specifically dealing with defense appropriations. And one final note. I think he's very much looking forward to continuing to be the leader of the faction of Republicans who still believe in sort of the Reagan foreign policy objectives of making America a superpower and a force for good in the world. And so I'm happy for his career. I mean, the longevity he's had, he's the longest-serving senator in the history of Kentucky and he's the longest-serving party leader in the history of the United States Senate. I mean, it's a heck of a career for a guy who Ronald Reagan once introduced as Mitch O'Donnell at a campaign rally in 1984.

He's lived through the Trump undulation.I mean, he really has maintained a position of leadership through a lot of turbulent things over the last several years. So I think that's number one. Number two, certainly, the courts. I think one of the accomplishments he's most proud of is his role in helping get conservative judges on the bench. And that, of course, includes the Supreme Court. I think that is a proud accomplishment for him. And number three, as a national matter, I think he really is leaning into his traditional role as being a hawkish U.S. senator, somebody who believes that America is a force for good in the world. And even though the isolationists in our party are ascendant right now, he believes that that viewpoint, that Reagan viewpoint, deserves to be promoted and defended. And I think he's very proud of his work on that. Back home in Kentucky, where I live and where I have known him for the last 28 years,he's very proud of all that he's been able to deliver to a small rural state. I mean, Kentucky wouldn't have much influence over the last 40 years if not but for the leadership and influence of Mitch McConnell. So he's very, very proud of what he does for his constituents as well. There's some big-ticket items that he's got left to work on, though. But I think this foreign policy idea, the notion of what it means to be a global superpower is really on his mind, and I know he's going to spend a lot of time on that.",

He's tried to channel some of the force behind Trump, but he's often really provoked the ire of Donald Trump, just kind of by being Mitch McConnell and the way that he is.

And I think he believed that convicting Trump would have torn apart the Republican coalition. And even if he personally wanted to do it, he was unwilling to take that risk. It is important to understand that what he represents in a policy sense is on the declining side of the Republican Party. A majority of Republican senators voted against the aid to Ukraine. A majority of Republican House members last fall voted against the aid to Ukraine. Senator from Missouri Eric Schmitt tweeted the day of that vote, when McConnell was on the losing side of the Democratic -- of the Republican Party, but the winning side overall, he tweeted, 15 of the 17 Republicans elected since 2018 voted no. And, again, it goes back to my to my first point. The trend in the Republican Party is in a Trumpian direction. And the idea that they would be kind of the adults in the room who are institutionalists who are resisting many of the more extreme things that he wants to do, whether it's withdrawing from NATO or minimizing our participation, or -- massive militarized door-to-door deportation, that force is going to be a lot less powerful in the second Trump term.

A large group of Democrats came out earlier, told us that this was an embarrassing spectacle, that what they had seen so far appeared to be a waste of government time and money. But Republican Nancy Mace, she came out and she described Hunter Biden as being defiant and dishonest. But she did note that, at least at the time she came out a few hours ago, she said that he had not invoked his Fifth Amendment. Now, that is significant, because he is, of course, facing two separate criminal probes. Now, we expect there will likely be another break, so we will likely get an additional round of details. But they only really got Hunter Biden to sit down behind closed doors to answer questions by making some concessions. One is that this is not being filmed and the other is that we're going to have a transcript release, and we're told that could come within 24 hours. So that's really what we're going to need to get the full picture of what's going on in this hearing, which, as you noted in the introduction, it really is a make-or-break for GOP lawmakers, who so far have not been able to produce any clear evidence linking President Biden to his son's foreign business dealings.",

He said that the homes across the street from him, his friends, his neighbors completely destroyed. They went down in 30 minutes. It was crazy fast. Those are the words that he used. And he actually saved one of his neighbors' life. He had to knock on the door to wake him up to get him out of there to get him to safety. He's back. The neighbor unfortunately lost everything that he owned. And that is just one of the many stories here unfolding. One of the difficulties with these fires is that they erupted so quickly.
