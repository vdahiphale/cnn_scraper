Activists and human rights monitor tell CNN, it was regime forces that killed the 27 year old. Authorities denied killing Samak. They're investigating his, quote, suspicious death. They say several suspects have been arrested. Investigations by the Iranian government into the death of young protesters since September lack credibility and impartiality, according to the U.N. We are not allowed to report from inside around. Those who speak to us face jail or worse. Making it hard for us to tell the stories of victims, and those left to mourn. Samak's Instagram posts just a little snapshot of a life ended too soon. An athletic young man who enjoyed life, being with his friends, and water sports. Growing up, he played soccer with Saeid Ezatolahi, now a midfielder in the national team, who shared this photo. Mourning his childhood friend, he wrote: I wish we could always stay at the same age without any concerns, without hate, without jealousy, without fighting to put each other down. After another bitter night last night, and with the news of your death, my heart is even more on fire. At Samak's burial, mourners chants: Death to the dictator. Khamenei must go. Every life lost brings more heartache, more anger, more defiance and determination of people risking it all in this bloody battle for freedom. (END VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (on camera):  And, Jake, more than 400 people have been killed in this crackdown sense of timber including at least 60 children. More than 14,000 people have been arrested and at least six protesters have been sentenced to death in what rights groups say are sham trials. Many others facing charges that carry the death penalty in the Islamic republic. But I can tell, you this isn't stopping the Iranian people. There are plans for nationwide strikes and protests next week, Jake.",

Israel, just one month after a long timeformer Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was able to cobble together enough support to soon reclaim power, today, even ardent supporters of Israel are publicly worrying that the alliance Netanyahu is forging with some of the far-right will lead to unacceptable changes to Israel 's government and society, including two prominent American backers of Israel and its government, Alan Dershowitz and Abraham Foxman. Foxman telling \"The Jerusalem Post\", quote, I never thought that I would reach that point where I would say that my support of Israel is conditional.

But it seems as though this incoming government is going to be testing that commitment. It gives you a sense of fears that this could be the most far-right government in Israeli history, with the likes of Itamar Ben-Gvir as ministers.Now, there are several main concerns amongst Israel's allies about what this new government can do, they sort of fall into several main categories. One, the policy in the occupied Palestinian territory. Now, Itamar Ben-Gvir has already been announced at the national security minister, but this is somebody who was once convicted of anti-Arab racism and was barred from the mandatory military draft he says because of his political views. They are also concerns about changes from this incoming government to the judiciary. Essentially, they want to allow these really parliament to override Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. This is something Dershowitz has called a terrible, terrible mistake if it happens. There are concerns about LGBTQ rights, and there are also concerns that some of the orthodox parties, essentially they're all orthodox except for Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, want to essentially make Israel a more religious country, including by changing the law of return, including who essentially consider Jewish enough to emigrate to Israel. And there are concerns that they want to -- orthodox parties make this a stricter requirement. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu has responded to some of these returns in a recent podcast interview with Barry Weiss. I want to play that for you. He said: I've often heard these team projections but none of them have materialized. I maintained Israeli's democratic nature. I maintained Israel's traditions. This Israel is not going to be governed by Talmudic law. We're not going to ban LGBTQ forums. As you know, my view on that is sharply different to put it mildly. We're going to remain a country of laws. But, Jake, just a few hours after that interview was published, it became public that Benjamin Netanyahu had appointed the head of the proudly homophobic party to be a minister in the ministry of education. This has led to widespread outrage in Israel, including the Tel Aviv mayor, warning that Israel is heading towards becoming a fascist theocracy -- Jake.",
