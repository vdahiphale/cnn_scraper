That swing state the focus of both presidential campaigns today as we now enter the final days of the race for the White House. Just moments ago, former president Donald Trump wrapped up a rally in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. This was his second major campaign event in the state in the last two days. He's now headed for a rally in Pennsylvania. Meantime, Vice President Kamala Harris is also campaigning in Michigan today. In the next couple of hours, she will hold a rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. That's where she will be joined by former first lady Michelle Obama for their first joint campaign appearance. And today is a significant day in Michigan. Right now voters are heading to the polls for the very first day of statewide early voting. We have a team of correspondents covering today's race for the White House. We have Alayna Treene. She's at that Trump rally that just ended, but let's begin with Eva McKend, who is at the Harris campaign in Kalamazoo. And Eva, that rally, it hasn't started yet but we have already heard from the vice president after she lands in Michigan. What did she say?",

She had an event with a former Trump official where they centered this issue of reproductive rights.And now that issue still top of mind for the vice president. It is where she is the strongest. She has become an ambassador for that issue for the administration. And she's telling health care providers in this state that she understands the hard work ahead for them, but that it is vitally important work. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You all are on the ground doing this very, very critical and important work, and since the Dobbs decision came down two years ago, I do believe that we as a country have faced a health care crisis.

We would have heard Eva talk about that if they were. But I'll go to what Donald Trump said today, which was really trying to focus specifically on issues that matter to this area, Novi, Detroit, or excuse me, Novi, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.He's really been ramping up in his remarks in these different battleground states over the last several weeks, things that he knows are specific to the audience he is talking, and I note this, Rahel, that we know Donald Trump has often dangled promises as he has sought new audiences. We saw that when he promised no tax on tips and he rolled that out in Nevada, recently in Detroit when he was speaking for the economic club, he talked about having no interest on car loan payments. And today he kind of used that strategy again. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You've been hearing about promises for 40 years on Detroit. We're going to make the promise. You can have those car companies come roaring back through intelligent uses of tariffs, taxes, and incentives. They're all coming back.

And here in Michigan, he's trying to paint himself as a savior of the auto industry, and we did see as well, he called up some union workers to the stage and touted that, you know, he doesn't have the support of the UAW's union leader. He does have the support, he argued, of many of the rank-and-file. So he made that pitch.One thing that I also found very interesting, Rahel, is that he actually called up a group of Muslim imams, Muslim -- local Muslim leaders to the stage. He said he had met with them earlier today, but that he was overwhelmingly getting their support in this state. Unclear if that's actually true, but I think it's notable given that we know that Kamala Harris has struggled with Muslim and Arab- Americans in Michigan. So something that he's also been definitely courting here. He also even noted himself, Donald Trump, and said this publicly that he believes that their vote, these Muslim and Arab-Americans in Michigan could really make a difference in this election. But all to say, Donald Trump is running head first at all these different demographics, these key demographics that he believes will make a difference on election day particularly on the margins. And that's where his campaign as well as I think Harris's campaign as well believe this election will be won.",

But Ambassador Danny Danon said that last night's strikes on Iran are, quote, \"small test\" of Israeli capabilities. Joining me now our Arlette Saenz in Washington and Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, as we hear from Israeli officials, they seem to be saying two things. One, that the retaliatory strike on Iran that we saw overnight, that that's the end of it, that that particular strike is done. But in effect, they are showing that they could strike again if need be. Is that your read as you speak to Israeli officials about their capabilities against Iran?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Jim. And I've been told that there were kind of two main aims with these strikes. And the first of which was to demonstrate that Israel's intelligence and military capabilities could strike deep inside of Iran, showing the Iranians directly that they were able to disable key missile defense systems and also go after their ballistic missile production facilities.The second aim, though, is related to what we're seeing right now. And that is the relatively muted public posture from the Israeli government about the details of the strike and how successful the strike actually was. And that is to say that they were able to demonstrate to the Iranians directly with these strikes that they could carry out attacks deep inside the country and disable key facilities. But now they are giving an opportunity to the Iranians through the lack of details that are being provided by the Israeli government about the exact nature of the strikes, the exact damage that was caused by these strikes. They're giving the Iranians the ability to downplay it. And that is indeed what we are hearing from Iran so far, downplaying the extent of the damage of these strikes, even as they acknowledged that four Iranian soldiers were indeed killed in this attack. The question is whether or not that Iranian posture will actually hold because, on the one hand, Iran does seem to want to avoid further escalation in particular if it causes an all-out war with Israel, a war that Iran perhaps cannot win. But secondly, it is also -- there is also the risk in not responding that they appear weak to the internal Iranian public but also of course to their proxies and their allies in the region who we should note have also been significantly weakened by Israeli attacks in recent months.",

Arlette, over the last several months there have certainly been times when the U.S. -- when U.S. and Israeli officials have been at odds over Israeli military action, whether that'd be in Gaza or in Lebanon, or elsewhere. But it appears that this strike, at least in how it was carried out, shows perhaps a meeting of the mind of U.S. and Israeli officials. U.S. officials did not want a broader strike, for instance, on nuclear or oil facilities. They wanted one focused on military targets. That appears to be what Israel delivered.

And the U.S. have been working behind the scenes, consulting and counseling Israel as it was preparing for this response against Iran with the hopes that Israel would take a measured approach. President Biden was out there publicly saying that he did not think they should target nuclear facilities or oil facilities either.And in the aftermath of this, these airstrikes by Israel against Iran overnight, senior administration officials have been very quick to note that this was a targeted precise strike, that it took a lot of planning and that ultimately they believe it was proportionate and done in self-defense after Iran had launched that barrage of missiles at Israel at the beginning of the month. Now President Biden this morning told reporters that he hopes that this latest round of military action will be the end of the back-and- forth that we've seen between Israel and Iran. The U.S. is really focused right now in trying to prevent this from escalating any further. And one thing that administration officials have really been doing in the past 24 hours is putting the onus on Iran, saying that it is up to them to stop its attacks against Israel, to end this cycle of violence and not do anything that could further escalate the tensions in the region. [15:20:16] That is something President Biden, when he met with his national security team today, said. He told them to take the steps to ensure that American forces are protected and that the U.S. would stand ready to help Israel if Iran were to respond.

Thanks so much for taking time this afternoon. You know, I hesitate when one major Middle Eastern power, Israel, is firing at another major Middle Eastern power, Iran, soon after Iran fired at Israel, to say that the conflict is calming down.

Everything that's coming out of Iranian media suggests they're downplaying this, and the Israelis frankly are not briefing in great detail about how or what they did it, nor do they appear to be croning about it.So I think that's right, that we dodged another bullet, but I must say this. This is the second time that each side, first the Iranians struck Israel directly, April 13, 14. The Israelis then responded with a one-off strike against, in its 300 radar in -- near Isfahan protecting a nuclear site. Then again, October 1, the Iranians come back with 180 plus ballistic missile barrage and we saw what the Israeli did last night. I think the paradox here is worth paying attention to because what these strikes demonstrate to me unprecedented is that both sides I think may come away with this believing that the risk tolerance is much greater than it's ever been.

Election after election in Wisconsin has determined by such razor-thin margins in just 2020 when Joe Biden won by around 20,000 votes. So it's no secret that the youth vote could really determine this election. You know, the Madison campus is, you know, double the margin that Joe Biden won in 2020.So something that I think is really important when I'm talking to youth voters that I'm hearing a lot is the 48,000 Wisconsinites that decided to vote uninstructed in the presidential primary in April in order to send a message to the Democratic Party that they want an arms embargo on all weapons to Israel and an immediate ceasefire in Palestine. 48,000 voters, that's double the margin that Joe Biden won by in 2020. And the policy hasn't really changed since Harris has stepped up.

They want to have conversations about immigration related issues that humanely discussed the conditions of people they care about, not simply the militarization of the border.Climate organizers who've spoken to me with Sunrise Movement want a climate plan and in many ways, they've said that Harris's new economic proposal puts forth some energy-related issues. That is a significant step forward and they will be there to hold her accountable after election day just as they are now. I'm also hearing from trans people in the United States. We just had a wonderful op-ed from a high school student come out on TeenVogue.com yesterday, who wants the Harris-Walz campaign to talk about trans rights just as much as they're talking about abortion with young women in the United States.

What does that tell you, one, about Israel's capabilities, but two, about Iran's defensive capabilities?",

So on the Israeli side of the ledger, it tells me that the Israelis did a fantastic job from an air campaign perspective to actually put together a real strong air campaign. It's very complicated to put together a, you know, series of movements that involve over 100 aircraft. Those aircraft will need to be refueled. You need to have intelligence assets. You need to get that intelligence to the fighter pilots.You need to get the fighter pilots to coordinate with other members in their formation and you need to make all of that happen. It's kind of like a really intricate ballet. So the Israelis did a fantastic job with that when it came to targeting and doing all of those things. On the Iranian side, it really shows the weaknesses in their air defense systems because it seems as if based on what we know so far that the Israelis were able to penetrate those defense systems almost at will. We knew that the Israelis attacked areas to the west of Tehran, but also know that they attacked installations in the western part of Iran along the Iraq border and just the Persian Gulf. So those areas, you know, proved to be vulnerable. Those were also, at least in the western side, launch sites for the Iranians that they use to attack Israel back on October 1st? So this is, you know, something where the Israelis knew what they were doing. They knew how to prepare the intelligence for this, and they knew how to execute the operation. The Iranians had ample warning that something like this was going to happen, but yet they weren't able to integrate all of their air defense in one coherent whole so that they would have a better chance of, in essence, protecting their targets.",

Where the answer gets to -- turn into a probable no is that the Israelis would need bunker buster bombs to actually penetrate the hardened bunkers that the Iranian nuclear program actually is in.The Iranians have developed hardened concrete that is among the hardest types of construction materials in the world and it becomes really difficult to penetrate with standard munitions, not completely impossible in certain areas but very, very difficult to do, and that makes it, you know, kind of a mixed answer there. But generally speaking, the Israelis can attack almost any target in the Middle East because of the aerial refueling capabilities that you've talked, capability that they've developed over the last few years. The other thing, though, is that they need the right kind of penetrating munition in order to get that capability for those specific nuclear targets. And they don't have those munitions as far as we know yet.",

They need to admit evidence. They will need to listen to those arguments, and that could take some time, even though the attorneys for the brothers are telling CNN they are very optimistic, that they will be home by Thanksgiving.Now, if you remember, this petition is coming after a lot of new attention or renewed attention, I should say, on the case after documentaries, a Netflix series, but also two key pieces of evidence that have come up in the last year. One of them is the accusation from a former member of the boy band Menudo that Jose Menendez himself raped him when he was still a child. Another piece of evidence that is being brought to light is a letter from Erik Menendez to a family member where he describes some of the abuse by his father before the killings. At the time they were convicted during, that trial, none of this evidence was actually entered into the trial. The jury couldn't hear much about their experience of sexual abuse. And this week when the D.A. came out with the announcement that they would recommend this case for re-sentencing, they actually acknowledged that since then the L.A. district attorney's office has gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding sexual violence and that they recognize the lasting impact that it has on victims. Now, what's interesting, Rahel, is that none of that is particularly relevant for this recommendation. What they're saying is that it's neither about the facts of the case in the '90s nor about this new piece of evidence. But instead it's about whether or not they have behaved well in prison and that is what we should be looking for as they bring this to court is their behavior is what will be noted by the judge -- Rahel.",
