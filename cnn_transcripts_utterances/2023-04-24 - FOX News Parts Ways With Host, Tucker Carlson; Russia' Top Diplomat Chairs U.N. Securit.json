Markets are waiting for Fed direction, and with the summer nearly upon us, maybe a bit of nice weather. It all means very little, really that is taking place at the moment. The main events that we are watching: FOX News parts ways with its right- wing firebrand, Tucker Carlson, days after settling the huge defamation case. Customers continuing to pull money out of Credit Suisse. When it comes to the right mix for your portfolio, the earth is flat. BlackRock argues the old rules no longer apply. We are live in New York, as you might expect, together, Monday, April the 24th. I'm Richard Quest back in New York, and I mean business. Good evening. There was an earthquake in the cable world today when FOX News announced Tucker Carlson is out. He was the network's top rated primetime host. FOX News said the decision was mutual, and that Friday, that's last Friday was his final show. A source tells CNN Carlson was informed of the decision this morning. Of course, last week, FOX News settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting that cost FOX $787 million, and Tucker Carlson was a key figure in that. FOX shares were negative after the announcement for good reason, he was their number one anchor. They were down as much as five percent. They've now leveled off roughly about three-and-a-half percent down. Carlson attracted millions of viewers to FOX News. His primetime show often led US cable ratings. The right-wing host was known for embracing conspiracy theories and extreme stances. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A couple things to note, though. One is that there are still lawsuits that are pending with FOX News. Smartmatic has a $2.7 billion lawsuit against the network, but then two, FOX is entangled in a legal brawl with one of its former producers, and she has said that there is outstanding tapes that allege some of the guests that they put on their programming knew that what they were saying about Dominion Voting Systems was wrong.

But you bring up a good point. I mean, neither of these big anchors have been able to sign off to their audiences and tell them exactly what happened, and I think part of that is because these were very rushed, and unexpected firings, generally speaking, regardless of whether or not one anchor had more heads up than another and that puts both networks in a precarious position. CNN has not announced a replacement for Don Lemon on its morning show. Of course, FOX News has not announced a replacement for Tucker Carlson in the primetime hour.",

The point that I was making in my article is, yes, it does have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Still, even though it's been decreasing in recent quarters, relative to any bank, if you think about the banking business model, it is essentially to take deposits, which we now know can come and go much more quickly than we like to believe, and to use those to lend out. And bank CEOs often make the mistake of thinking about those deposits as permanent assets on their balance sheet. They can go, that's what we saw with Silicon Valley. That's what we just saw with Credit Suisse in the wealth management division, and Apple is in a different position.

Our commitment is to the Sudanese people in support of their wishes for a peaceful and secure future. We stand with them at this terrible time.

Those issues still remain. The big sticking point in negotiations was how to fold in the rapid support forces and the general leadership of Hemedti as he's known into the military. That issue was kind of pushed aside or set aside while other issues were ironed out. Some are criticizing the U.S. and U.K. and other mediators kind of moving along without that major issue being figured out. Ultimately, it's up to these generals to stop the fighting. But as you know, once the actual fighting starts, it makes clawing back from that even more difficult. And the power how hungry military elite in that country, we have a great deal to lose both financially and politically by transitioning to the civilian government rarely seem to just want to fight it out to see who has ascendancy.

Well, the financial world is because that's sort of the effect after BlackRock said, investors need a new approach to how they build their portfolios. The traditional 60-40 portfolio, 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. Well, we've all been brought up with that. And you've all been told to rebalance as you get older. Now, historically, a stock prices would fall bond prices rise. It's a natural hedge that took place. BlackRock believes today, Central Bank's raise rates and keep them higher that relationship is breaking down. Jean Boivin is the head of Blackrock Investment Institute. He joins me now.

We don't think that the last 40 years prior to 2020 will be a good guide for what's ahead of us. That said, it doesn't mean that the 40 allocation to balance and 60 is broadly wrong. What we really mean by this is that the simplistic approach of simply like, you know, getting an allocation broadly to a broad index of that bonds and a broad index of equities and sitting there, you know, setting and forgetting will likely not be working as much as well as it has in the past.

And the reality is that we're in a world where everything was, you know, we had a market and everything during that period. And whenever things were getting a bit sour, then you could count on central banks to come and to the rescue. And so, that prevent -- provided a very favorable environment for a simple simplistic allocation like 60-40, again, in this simplistic form -- simplest form. But we're talking about now going forward is that might not be a crazy starting point. But you will have to do more than that to be able to generate return. We need to be more granular. So that means you need to not simply look at broad market exposure, you need to think a bit harder about thematic sectors, countries and so on will be more important searching for relative value will be more important going forward. And moreover, you will need to also be more nimble, you know, it will change more quickly.

So, that is already making the bar for your certification much higher. You can already generate that kind of income just by sitting on cash. And now you need to think about much harder about how you redeploy the rest. And that's another game changer in this environment. That's why we favor like short duration bonds.
