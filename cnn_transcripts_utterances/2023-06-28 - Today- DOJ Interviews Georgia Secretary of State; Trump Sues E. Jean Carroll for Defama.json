You could actually see the dome and the view port and if you compare what they brought up today to the submersible when it was intact, a lot to go by there.We had been told by the U.S. Coast Guard when they first announced this tragedy that in their term the area was unforgiving, and a very challenging and remote area in which to recover debris. But here we are, we do see quite a few pieces of it. I have to say, obviously, it was with some disquiet. This is the resting place for five people who tragically lost their lives, and I'm sure while the family members are glad to see there will be clues in the investigation, it's obviously causing so much grief again to see all of this play out. I will say, though, this investigation is very important to many people and many countries. Right here in Canada, the Transportation Safety Board trying to determine exactly what went on. They've conducted many interviews and they refused to say to me today where those pieces of debris are headed. But they will be headed to labs either in the United States or in Canada to be examined further. And I will mention as well, Bianna, that obviously, the RCMP, the national police force here, is determining whether or not a criminal investigation needs to be opened. And again, the more that they can salvage from the deep see, the more that they'll have answers because the last thing anyone wants here is for this to be a guessing game.

He warned back then that the company's experiment approach could result in catastrophic consequences and, of course, we did see that exact thing play out. Bart, what do you make of the size of the pieces that have been recovered thus far? BART KEMPER, WARNED OF POTENTIAL TITAN SUB ISSUES IN 2018:  This is consistent with an implosion. Don't forget, an implosion is a collapse in on itself. It's not an explosion. So to have the living quarters, which is the only part at one atmosphere or the normal what we breathe atmosphere, it will collapse inwards on that. But rest of the items are what we call implodable volumes or that are not part of living space which could be the batteries, lights, the gas cylinders, those aren't part of the one atmosphere place where the crew would be. So, that -- those would still be intact as would be the framework holding it altogether. So I'm not surprised to see large pieces come out.

Didn't confirm how many people were on board. But it is the first time the number of aircraft have been confirmed. Of course, what the Ukrainians say and what is military bloggers say is that Wagner shot down far more planes. That been so far, the Kremlin hasn't confirmed it.",

He didn't just criticize Putin's military, day in and day out for past eight months in unbelievable terms, he led an armed rebellion. So is he just going to go free? KOZYREV:  Yes. Prigozhin is one of the -- of the organization. He criticized somebody inside of the mafia for being -- for not being effective enough. But he never kind of called it seriously, he kind of hinted on various things, but everybody knew that he was not challenging a political line or challenging in serious terms the war itself. It was war criminals of his and they would call themself. So that's different. Those people could be killed, could be poisoned and still -- it is not the end of the story.
