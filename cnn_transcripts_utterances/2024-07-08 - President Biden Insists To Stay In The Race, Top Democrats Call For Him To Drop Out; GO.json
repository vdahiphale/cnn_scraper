This hour, the disturbing evolution of the so-called alt-right in their years since that notorious deadly march on Charlottesville, Virginia. I'm going to be joined by an award-winning CNN journalist who has just written a book and will explain how their jokes and their ideology and their violent tendencies are becoming hidden influences in the 2024 elections.Plus, we're just one week from the start of the Republican National Convention, and today, a key party committee approved the new platform with changes made to reflect Donald Trump's views on multiple issues. So what exactly is in these plans for the GOP? And leaving this hour, quote, \"I'm in this race to the end,\" unquote. President Joe Biden telling supporters today, Democratic lawmakers, and the American public that he has no plans to drop out of the 2024 race. Instead, his team is going on offense, which today included joining a call with top donors to his re-election campaign, where the president said he is still the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump. A growing number of Democratic lawmakers, however, are calling on Biden to drop out of the race, including Congressman Adam Smith, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, who told me just a few minutes ago this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): Well, look, I think he should step aside. I think it's become clear that he's not the best person to carry the Democratic message. And here's the thing. We have an incredibly strong message and record to run on. In all, you know, respect to the president, he's done a great job. Personally, I think Kamala Harris would be a much better, stronger candidate. And because she is constitutionally his second, that's the way it's supposed to work.

And also key question, what will Hakeem Jeffries do? The Democratic leader has yet to formally take a position about whether Biden should remain atop the ticket. He's in listening mode, I am told. On the Senate side, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer came in to the Senate today and only would say, quote, \"I am with Joe.\" He would not answer any other questions at the moment saying that he's for Joe, but wouldn't answer questions about his viability as a candidate and whether he has confidence in him as a nominee. I also put that question directly to Congressman Jamie Raskin, Maryland Democrat, top member of the House Oversight Committee, about President Biden and about him staying atop the ticket.

Manu Raju on Capitol Hill, thanks.Let's bring in a Democratic House candidate who's calling on President Biden to drop out of the race. His name is Michael B. Moore. He is challenging Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mason, South Carolina's first congressional district. Thanks so much for joining us, sir. You released a statement on Twitter, or X, calling on President Biden to step down as a Democratic candidate for president. You wrote in part, quote, \"This is the most consequential election of our lifetime. The party needs to come together to identify and rally around a new nominee and look to President Biden's experience as the only candidate to beat Donald Trump less than four years ago,\" unquote. Why do you think this is the best course of action? Do you think Joe Biden can't beat Trump, or do you think something else is going on here beyond just his poll numbers? MICHAEL B. MOORE, SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, first, thanks for the invitation. It's wonderful to be here with you. Look, I think it's a really difficult situation. I think the president has done an amazing job in office. I think he's beaten Donald Trump. He's accomplished an amazing legislative record. I think he's got a crucial role in helping Democrats win in November and take office in January. I just am at the point where I don't believe that it's with him at the top of the ticket. I think we've got to bring along longtime Biden voters, but I think we've to broaden the coalition. We've got to be able to bring in young people. We've got to be able to bring in independents, moderate Republicans, and the like. I just am at the point where, after having talked to so many people in my district and talked to donors and constituents, I just believe that having the president in this, you know, sort of emeritus almost kind of a role, but in guiding the next person, I think that would be the best way that he can help Democrats win in November.",

      "sentences": "Well, the most striking part about it, Jake, is one, it is much shorter, much more watered down than what we saw in both 2016 and 2020. And it really mimics the candidate himself, which isn't that surprising, because I am told that not only did Donald Trump help edit the document, but he also wrote some of the parts of the platform himself. So three of the parts I want to specifically point to.One is abortion. Again, a much more watered-down version of abortion policy than we have seen in the past. There is no call for a national abortion ban. And in fact, he talks about how it should be punted to the states, something he has said since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The other point I want to make is this of marriage. They took out how to define marriage as between a man and a woman. The third one that was interesting was instead of this emphasis on paying back the national debt, they focus on inflation and ending inflation and making America wealthy again. Again, national debt has been something that has been on the Republican agenda for decades, now, really scaled back and that's something that Donald Trump doesn't care about. The other points of focus here, Donald Trump, are things that we obviously have heard from the former president time and time again, ending the weaponization of the government, talking extensively about immigration. What is also interesting, though, is that a lot of it is very vague. Again, this is a very short document compared to what we have seen in years past. So when it comes to federal agencies, for example, something that we have reported extensively on how in a second term, it would be likely that Donald Trump would have enormous powers under the executive branch because they would move all those agencies under the executive branch. It's actually very vague as to what powers the federal agencies would have, Jake.",

So I don't think he had a choice here. He had to bend. He had tobecome more -- move more to the center here or because he knows it's a losing issue. This is the one winning issue for Democrats that we can win on and so I think that he sees that as an opportunity for him.",

I mean, Russ Vought and the others.And some of the things in here, roughly 900 pages of documents, banning abortion, issues having to do with contraception, IVF, changing how the government actually functions, getting rid of the Department of Education, allowing the new president to fire as many as 50,000 federal workers to be replaced by political appointees rather than government appointees. Do you think that Project 2025 is a liability? MATT MOWERS, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT ADVISER: Yeah, I mean, look, you've seen some consternation between the Trump campaign and Heritage Foundation and other groups that have been trying to develop lists of potential appointees or develop white papers, what could happen in administration. We've been seeing that going on for months now. Remember, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, both with the Trump campaign, came out and essentially warned both of these groups to stop going out there and promising jobs or acting as if they're maybe recruiting for a future administration, essentially saying, we haven't won yet. And so, you know, there is this difference of opinion between what actually should be out there as far as policy. I think the platform is much closer reflection of where Donald Trump wants to take the party than necessarily Project 2025, which look, is probably the opinion of Russ Vought and a few other folks who are over at the Heritage Foundation. I doubt that the Trump campaign has gone through all 900 pages of it yet, though, to decide whether they agree or disagree on every single policy point. So they don't want to take ownership of a document they had had no ability to craft into it, even if a couple of those people may end up in the administration. Ultimately, it will be Donald Trump's administration, be a reflection of the policies he puts forth, which is probably more accurately, closely reflected in this platform, which, by the way, is the first time it's really been updated in quite some time. Usually, these platforms have become very like Frankenstein almost, you know.",

He has not been totally transparent in terms of his health and all aspects of his health. He has not. I want to bring in CNN's resident neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, you wrote an essay over the weekend, inspired by conversations you've had with other doctors. The headline, it's time for President Biden to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological testing and share his results. What's been the reaction?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it's been robust, Jake. And I certainly have heard from a lot of people in the medical field. And I think, you know, pretty unanimously people agree with that. People who are specialists in cognition and movement disorders have reached out to me sharing what their -- what they think that specific testing should even look like. I think what was interesting, Jake, I got a lot of comments as well saying, look, OK, yes, if Biden gets this sort of testing, then Trump needs to get this testing as well. And, you know, that's fair, frankly, you know, anyone over the age of 65, in this country, Medicare recommends that they get a cognitive test as part of their annual wellness checkup. So that's totally fair. But I think what struck me about it, Jake, was that it almost feels like people thought the cognitive testing was sort of a source of embarrassment. And that certainly wasn't the intent that this should be a source of embarrassment, but rather be an opportunity to potentially early diagnose something and potentially treat it. I think we're getting to the point, Jake, where we can think of some of these brain ailments the way that we used to think about heart disease, people didn't want to get tested for heart disease in the past. Now, we do that regularly. I think we're going to get to that point with brain stuff as well.",

I think it's because it's embarrassing, frankly, and it shouldn't be. But I think it's somehow been conflated with this idea that it's going to diminish somebody, and therefore they shouldn't even bother getting tested in the first place. And that's just not how the medical establishment thinks about this.They think this is an opportunity. There are things that can be done about this. Things that can actually be corrective, whether it's cognition or movement disorder, or whatever, to simply not even try and get that sort of data or do that sort of testing.

So I don't know what to make of that.Here's what I would say is that the doctors at Walter Reed are some of the best doctors in the world when it comes to this. So if it is, if they are seeing the President, I'm glad, because that's part of the reason I wrote the essay was that this isn't about again, embarrassing anyone.
