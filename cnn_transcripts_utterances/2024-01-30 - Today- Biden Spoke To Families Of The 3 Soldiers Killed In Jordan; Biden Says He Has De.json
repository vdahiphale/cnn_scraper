The President confirming earlier today that he has in fact made a decision on how exactly the U.S. is going to retaliate after the deaths of these three U.S. service members. But, of course, as you can imagine, the White House has been otherwise incredibly careful to avoid telegraphing any moves that it might make in the future. But we do know that U.S. officials have been weighing a range of options, including options that could be multi-pronged, that could take place in stages.And the President, when he was speaking with reporters earlier at the White House, he made clear that it is very, very, very much clear in his mind who exactly is responsible for the attack over the weekend, take a listen.

So the question for him and you were saying this, about how difficult of a needle this is to thread, is to balance the desire to have a forceful response but also to prevent this conflict from broadening out into a bigger regional.

And not only President Joe Biden expected to attend, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as well. So that was one of the key points that was made just before the press briefing we had just a moment ago.Of course, one of the other key questions, how is it that a single one-way attack drone got through U.S. air defenses at Tower 22 that led to this deadly attack? That is something U.S. Central Command is still looking at. On the key question of what changes will be made, the Pentagon Press Secretary, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder wouldn't say definitively that there would be updates to force protection measures or air defenses, but that is certainly something Central Command is looking at because of the number of U.S. forces spread across the Middle East, many of them in smaller bases that rely on air defenses for protection, so that's a key question there as well. We also learned earlier in the day that three of the U.S. members who were injured were flown from Baghdad medevac to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, one of them in critical condition there. They'll be evaluated. Then the question of whether they need further treatment in the U.S., that will be answered.

Well, reading the tea leaves, based on what President Biden said and what he was indicating, it seems as if he's backing away from the most aggressive option, which would be a direct, at least overt attack inside of Iran. If you had to guess, it would be that they've decided to attack Iranian- backed militias in places like Syria and Iraq, but not actually cross that Rubicon and attack inside Iran. I think that makes sense considering what he said and what we know about what's going on inside of the administration.Now, the good news, I guess you could say, is that there's plenty of good targets, plenty of Iranian-backed Shia militiamen trying to kill Americans all over the region. Syria is the easiest place to attack them. Iraq is a little bit more tricky; Lebanon, a little bit more tricky; Yemen. So I think you'll see a wide array of attacks, but I don't think they're going to go attack Iran. I could be wrong, but it seems to be what Biden's telling us.",

One is can the response stop the attacks and that's a mix of deterrence and actually killing the people who are trying to kill Americans and one way is to scare Iran into telling the proxies to stop. The other way is to kill the guys who are trying to kill Americans.So I think you need a combination of those things, frankly. More broadly, I think, the administration is going to have to recognize that these attacks are coordinated and related to what's going on in Israel and Gaza there's just no two ways about it the Iraqi, the Islamic resistance of Iraq, which is what these groups now call themselves is expressly stating when they claim credit for these attacks that it's related to Israel and Gaza. So in their minds it is, so yes deterrence is important like sort of mowing the lawn of the terrorists and getting rid of a few of them that are attacking us, that's important, but also finding a larger solution to the regional war that would be also be a really big help.",

What I'm arguing here is that the action that the administration took before the investigation is complete will definitely result in a lot less food medicine and health supplies and water going to a million starving children in southern Gaza, they didn't do anything wrong, 13,000 U.N. employees, 12 of them may very well be guilty and deserve whatever they - punishment they've earned. But the other 12 900 employees so far we don't know that they did anything wrong and all of the Gazan children definitely didn't do anything wrong.So I argue that defunding the aid organization that's keeping thousands of people alive is not only kind of cruel but will have the opposite effect because it'll just make the problem worse and push the burden onto other countries like Israel, and Jordan, and Lebanon and make - solving all these problems much harder and deepening the suffering of these people. One in four people in Gaza is starving and so I don't think this is the time to pull the rug out from under their safety net despite the fact that these 12 U.N. employees deserve to answer for their actions.",

What's he going to say? Oh, yes I'm definitely going to interfere. As far as like are you going to interfere, absolutely. No, I mean he's going to deny it.And let's remember that Xi Jinping has a long track record of lying to American presidents. He lied to President Obama about militarizing the South China Sea. He lied to president Trump about there's no genocide. And so yes, I think you have to, based on all of the evidence, assume that he's lying. And, of course, Chinese government's already interfering in American politics in a number of ways on both sides to promote chaos and undermine our democracy to advance their cause of reshaping global order to make it safe for their system, for the autocratic system.
