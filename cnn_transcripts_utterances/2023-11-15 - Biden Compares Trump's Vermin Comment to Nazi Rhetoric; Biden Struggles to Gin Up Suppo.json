We do not know, of course, if Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee, but President Biden has increasingly been calling him out at fundraisers and other places.He also said this in very stark words last night. He said, \"There are a lot of reasons to be against Donald Trump, but damn, he should not be president.\" So there's no doubt, President Biden is trying to fire up his own rhetoric, fire up his own base as well, and perhaps take the attention off his own challenges and turn it back to a contrast with his former and perhaps future rival.",

But now, many of these young voters have questions about the economy, concerns about promises that were not specifically delivered upon.

They say they are going to be drawing a sharper contrast between the Biden record and the Trump record, and they say \"We will go after voters where they are.\"But Dana, the young voters, the concern, the enthusiasm will be a central part of the story we'll be covering for the next year.
