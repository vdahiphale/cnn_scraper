It would raise taxes on the rich and slash the US deficit. The Dutch introduce new restrictions on sending semiconductor technology to China. And South Africa still grappling with HIV 20 years after a landmark relief program. Live from New York, it is Thursday, March 9th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. In the last hour, President Biden has unveiled a $6.8 trillion budget. It seeks to increase spending on the military and healthcare and reduce the deficit. Now to do so, President Biden plans to increase taxes on the wealthy and businesses. You are looking at live pictures of President Biden as he unveils this budget. This is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. But with Republicans in control of the House, it has no chance of becoming law, but it does lay down the challenge to the President's political opponents. It also draws the battle lines on issues like the debt ceiling and social spending. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think when you talk to White House officials, Rahel, they acknowledge that fact. But their view on this is twofold. One they believe they actually have to put pen to paper, lay out their budget, lay out their proposal and to some degree, challenge Republicans to put their own on the table, which House Republicans in the new majority haven't done so yet. But the broader issue, I think you've got this in the lead in a really sharp manner, which is this is laying out the battle lines of what's next, and what's next is a couple of different things, all of which are very high stakes. The first and foremost, obviously, is that debt ceiling showdown. They have a deadline of this summer, there has been no real engagement. In fact, White House officials say explicitly they will not negotiate on the debt ceiling. Republicans say that is a nonstarter. How does this end? Not really sure at this point in time. But this budget is a very key element of the White House effort to really ramp up pressure on Republicans. And then I think there's the longer term element of this as well. When you talk about the tax increases on corporations in the wealthy, when you talk about the investments the President is proposing, when you talk about Medicare and Social Security and defending those programs trying to elongate the viability of Medicare based on what the President is laying out, those are campaign items. Those are things the President wants to campaign on in 2024, if and when he launches a reelection campaign. Those are the two critical elements here. Policy certainly matters.

And we're looking at the very advanced end, in terms of microchip semiconductor technology, so these are used and are critical for numerous sectors, but of course, particularly advanced military systems, weapon systems. Now it is interesting, I think that ASML, the biggest chipmaker, or technology that supports chipmaking in Europe, has actually come out with a statement. They weren't mentioned in the letter, either, but of course, they will be impacted, but perhaps not as much as you might expect. It actually said, they think these measures won't have a material impact or their financial outlook for this year or for their longer term scenarios and that might be because the measures introduced here by The Netherlands, which will take a few weeks before they're actually implemented are quite niche. They're just limiting perhaps, the supply to China of the second most advanced machines that make semiconductor chips. Already ASML doesn't actually supply their most advanced machinery. So then you question how much bite does this measure have? I think given that you're looking at this measure from the Netherlands, plus the United States and this sort of alliance of countries, that's possibly where the pressure will come. But it will only be as effective really, as however many countries join the Alliance and also just how effective and significant the measures are.

You're absolutely right, we do expect something similar from Japan. But listen, there are a lot of other markets around the world that are very important to the sector, for instance, South Korea, and they're not only not supporting this, they've actually actively opposed the measures introduced by the US and they're likely to oppose these measures from The Netherlands today. And really, at this stage, I mean, given the measures that were introduced by the US, it could cause some pain for US chipmakers.

And instead, they want to go back to what some people still remember used to be the way cards used to work, every time you made a purchase, you pressed one for debit, or two for credit. So you have that optionality and this is exactly what we encourage people to do. Don't use credit for every purchase. Use debit occasionally, credit occasionally. So I think what we're seeing however, in the US right now, in the numbers reporting is also somewhat of an apples to bananas comparison, because what COVID meant was that a lot of people got a check, people spent much less money and credit card debt, as you may remember, was dramatically down as a consequence of the almost enforced savings programs that most of our consumers were at during the COVID times. So what we're seeing now is slightly a reversal of that. And in general, then I think banks maybe have been a little bit too open and too desperate to get more credit card balances back up, and maybe we're too relaxed in probably writing policies a year ago.",

As you will see in today's Call to Earth report, the zoo is in the midst of a baby boom, providing new hope for the preservation of some of the world's rarest species. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  The small northern English city of Chester might seem like an unlikely place to find some of the world's most endangered animals. But since the 1930s, Chester Zoo has grown a reputation as one of the best in the world for conservation, with the targeted aim of preventing species extinction. MARK BRAYSHAW, CURATOR OF MAMMALS, CHESTER ZOO (voice-over):  There is a huge biodiversity crisis at the moment. We are losing species at a phenomenal rate. Some of these species we aren't even aware of them. We don't know their role. So by taking species out here, we don't know the long-term impact. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  While the gold standard for Chester Zoo is to bring species to be reintroduced to their natural habitat, in many cases now, the urgent focus is on creating a safety net population in captivity. BRAYSHAW (voice-over):  (INAUDIBLE) the zoo is acting as an art. And we might be in a situation where actually species' habitat is gone and they're not going to go back into their natural habitat. So we have to look at other places we can put them back into and balance out any sort of impact that that might have. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  Luckily for the preservation of some of these critically endangered species, the zoo is in the midst of a baby boom. A birth for the world's rarest chimpanzee, triplets for the Madagascan fossa, a greater one-horned rhino, Malayan tapir and finally, in addition to the zoo's family of marsupials. Increased mining and deforestation in Papua New Guinea have seen the world population of Goodfellow's tree kangaroos more than halved over the past 30 years. So the birth of a new joey in Chester provides a glimmer of hope for the future of the species.",

(MUSIC PLAYING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  Much of Chester's success in breeding is a attributed to its onsite endocrinology lab. KATIE EDWARDS, LEAD CONSERVATION SCIENTIST, CHESTER ZOO (voice-over):  I oversee our conservation physiology and reproduction team and our wildlife endocrinology lab, which is the only one of its kind a zoo in Europe. That mostly means we measure hormones in animal dung. So for something like the tree kangaroo, we'll take samples every day. We will run them about once a month so we can measure reproductive hormones in our female. It helps us pair together the visual cues and behaviors that the team see with the physiologically of the animal and what's happening inside so that we can make sure we are putting the male and female together at the best possible time to give us the best chances of a successful breeding. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  The lab is yielding such impressive results that zoos around Europe are sending in dung samples from their animals for analysis at Chester. There is hope that Chester's conservation focus can be a model for other zoos to follow. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  Our scientists are just a new model for what a future zoo could look like. So we're incorporating all of these facets and direct conservation, where the fundraising model can actually health and well-being of the visitors who visit.
