And we are watching to see whether or not these additional forces, theseadditional movements by Israeli forces deeper into Rafah will eventually cross that red line that President Biden set out a couple of weeks ago when he said that he would withhold further weapons shipments to Israel if it goes into those population centers in Rafah, carrying out this full scale ground offensive that it has been threatening for months. We are not at that threshold yet, it seems. The defense minister, as he was himself in eastern Rafah, visiting with Israeli troops, carrying out a situational assessment about those military operations so far, saying that Israel will send additional troops into Rafah. The Israeli military has already deployed an additional commando brigade to Rafah to assist the troops that are already there with their military operations, which the Israeli military says has so far consisted of going after Hamas militants in the area, but also critically searching, discovering and destroying Hamas tunnels that they say exist in eastern Rafah. We know that the troops are creeping closer to central Rafah, but we have yet to see the go sign being given for an all out offensive that would cross those red lines by the United States. We are also witnessing very intense fighting in northern Gaza in that Jabalia refugee camp, which was the site of some of the most intense fighting in the early months of the war. Israeli troops withdrew and now they have gone back in. And interestingly, the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, just yesterday, raising significant questions about this overall strategy and talking about the need for a day after Gaza plan, calling on the Israeli prime minister, who is a member of his own party, calling on him publicly to lay out his plans for the day after Gaza and calling on Netanyahu to rule out Israeli military or civilian governorship of Gaza in the day after the war. So, this is certainly an inflection point in so many different ways, both in terms of the intensity of the fighting that is returning to Gaza, the intensity of Israeli military activity, but also, of course, what the United States is going to do as Israel looks to step up its campaign. And, of course, on the ground, we are watching very closely the impact that all of these this stepped up military activity is having on the civilian population in Gaza. More than half a million people have already been displaced from Rafah, fleeing to areas further north. And that Rafah border crossing, which is critical not only for getting humanitarian aid in and out of Gaza, into Gaza, rather, but also for humanitarian aid workers to get in and out of Gaza, that crossing remains closed. Israeli and Egyptian officials still negotiating over reopening that closing, but so far they appear to be trading blame more than finding actual solutions. Zain.",

However, Michael Cohen does so far seem to be taking it relatively in stride. The defense team is really oscillating between questions about Michael Cohen's past criminal record and everything that goes along with that. And then, you know, they keep harping on the fact that Michael Cohen obviously has this huge animosity toward Donald Trump. So, those are really the two lines of questioning. You just heard the defense team asking Michael Cohen about how he really wanted to be picked as chief of staff, again, going to this idea that maybe Michael Cohen is just seeking revenge in some sense against Donald Trump, particularly in testifying at this trial. It was interesting just before the morning break that happened around 11:30. It was Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, who really, for the first time, waded finally into questions that went to the core of this case. He did ask Michael Cohen about that home equity line of credit that Michael Cohen drew from to make the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels before being eventually repaid by Trump. Blanche asked Cohen about the fact that he hid the loan details from his family. And that was pretty much the extent of the questioning when it went to the actual payment to Stormy Daniels. It seemed like Todd Blanche was maybe trying to bring that up to cast some doubt on sort of Cohen's, you know, whether he really did care about his family, as he previously testified he did, that they were the real reason he pleaded guilty to those federal crimes. But guys, it was really the only time in this cross-examination, we've done hours of cross-exam between Tuesday and today, that was really the only time that defense attorneys have brought up the core of this case, the repayment to Stormy Daniels and how it was accounted for. Other than that, the defense team has really been hammering Cohen's criminal record and also his credibility, casting doubt on his motives for testifying in this case. That seems to be the tact they're going with, this whole liar, liar idea. But it'll be interesting to see if the defense team gets back at all to what's at the core of this case. I mean, Michael Cohen offered some very damaging testimony repeatedly about how Donald Trump, in his words, knew about this repayment to Stormy Daniels and how it would be accounted for, leading to these false business records charges. So, we'll see if the defense hits on that and how much this, you know, trying to damage Michael Cohen's credibility is going to work with the jury, guys.",

There is always a risk that a jury can kind of overhear things and kind of get tired of it. So, my guess is that the prosecution does a redirect. They'll keep it to the point. They'll keep it to two or three questions, basically. Why are you here? Are you telling the truth? And is the information that you've provided accurate? He'll say yes, yes, yes.

But I will put out one little caveat that about two thirds of Americans are invested in the markets in some way or another. So, yeah, I mean, you do like to see the markets do well. You look at your retirement account and feel just a little bit richer. But a few things really driving the enthusiasm or the jubilation, if you want to call it that, in the markets today. So, one was that inflation data that you just pointed out, Bianna, that came in cooler than we were expecting. And that is a difference than some of the last inflation reports we were getting. So, inflation moving back in the right direction and also this expectation now that rate cuts are coming. They are back on the table for 2024 because we also got some retail sales data that was actually softer than expected. So, you put it together and you have a scenario where it's looking like maybe we might see a rate cut maybe in that September meeting. And so that sort of sort of is what investors are sort of, you know, reacting to. We also had really good earnings from a Walmart this morning -- part of the reason why. I want to just point out, guys, that it's not just the Dow, but also the S and P also having a pretty nice year. S and P, I think, hit a new record yesterday, up 12 percent for year to date NASDAQ up 13 percent. But Zain, I want to sort of circle back to something you pointed out, because it's an important point that the state of the consumer, right, when you think of the U.S. consumer, that's about two thirds of U.S. GDP. So, as goes the consumer, so goes the economy. And I was just in the last hour speaking to one of the senior economists of Bank of America, and I asked him, how would you describe the state of the U.S. consumer these days? And he said, benign moderation. Consumer spending is seeing a benign moderation. So, they're still feeling pretty optimistic about the health of the consumer, i.e., the U.S. economy. But they are seeing a moderation. But for the two thirds of Americans that are invested in the markets in some way or another, you might want to look at your 401K today, you might want to look at your portfolio today. It might make you feel a little bit better about things.",

The day after Hamas will only be achieved through the rule of Palestinian elements that form an alternative to Hamas. Above all, this is an Israeli interest. Unfortunately, no such plan has been brought for debate. And worse yet, no alternative has been presented in its place.\" This was an argument echoed by Benny Gantz, as well as the Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari. We've already heard from the usual suspects on the far right in this government who are calling for Gallant to be fired. He has incidentally been fired in the past during the judicial reform overhaul there. And in all of that, the crisis that ensued, he was brought back into the government.

When you go to war, that you align military means and military operation with tangible and attainable political goals. And this government did not do so. And he was the defense minister throughout this process. That said, as goes the cliche, better late than never. He basically presented the prime minister with a very simple thing. You've been told, you've been asked, you've been implored by the U.S. administration, by the Biden administration to come up with a postwar plan. You've been given all the support in the world from both the military and in terms of on the ground, U.S. diplomatically. And seven months later, or seven and a half months later, you still didn't even give it a second of a day to come up with a plan.

No, I have the fullest sympathy in his predicament because he's the Prime Minister of my country. But that said, it's been seven months, for God's sake.

There's, there was fatigue after nine months of demonstration, of mass demonstration against the constitutional coup d'etat now instigated. Then came the war. And with it, devastation and agony and humiliation and anger and resentment and frustration. And what have you. And everyone knows someone who's in the army. A son, a brother, a cousin, a neighbor, a college roommate. And you don't demonstrate. The Israeli psyche, you don't demonstrate in that situation because it's, we're all in this together. But one month goes by and another month goes by and another goes by. And this Prime Minister does not assume responsibility. Does not, is not willing to be held accountable. There's no mea culpa at any point. And it goes on and it goes on. So, my point is, it is reaching a boiling degree. It is reaching a critical mass in which, you know, a combination of the public, the hostages' families, the media, the general public, the U.S. administration are going to say to Netanyahu, enough is enough, Sir, because you don't seem to know exactly what you're doing. Now, as for what you said about this poll, look, consistent polls show that over 70, seven to zero percent of Israelis want him to either resign now or resign immediately after the war. Over 50 percent support an immediate election once the war is over. And now, you're coming with this correctly, with this new piece of data, new piece of information that Israelis don't think it's winnable. It is winnable. It's not winnable according to the platitudes, I'm sorry, and cliches that he spread. Total victory, eradication, alliteration. Come on. You want to topple Hamas? You do that.

Thequestioning has really been bouncing back and forth between topics. We've seen a lot of focus on Michael Cohen's criminal convictions, but also about his bitterness toward Donald Trump, you know, especially after not getting a post at the White House. I will say that in the past few minutes, Todd Blanche has sort of refocused and he's moved back a bit to more questioning that goes to the heart of this case, the payment to Stormy Daniels. So, right now, Todd Blanche is questioning about phone calls that apparently happened in October 2016, phone calls that Cohen had with Trump where the payments to Stormy Daniels were discussed. Basically saying, I think at one point, one of the phone calls said that Cohen said it's all taken care of. Other than that, though, Cohen's really saying that he doesn't recall a lot about the phone calls. It does seem that Todd Blanche is trying to poke holes in Cohen's memory of these phone calls and maybe in some of the details. But again, a lot of this has been a bit hard to follow just because it's been all over the place. It's interesting. It'll be interesting to see, you know, maybe how the jury's reading this. I guess we won't know until a verdict. But in terms of the actual Stormy Daniels payment, this is the second time over hours of questioning that Todd Blanche has waded into these questions about the core of this case. The first time was this morning, just before the morning break. You know, Blanche asked Michael Cohen about the home equity line of credit that he drew from to make that $130,000 payment before he was eventually paid back by Trump. In that instance, Todd Blanche really was stressing that Michael Cohen didn't bother to tell his family that he had taken out this line of credit. So, to that point, he was sort of poking at Michael Cohen's credibility and his truthfulness and his honesty. So, the questioning has really run the gamut this morning. The courtroom seems to be a bit more tense than it was on Tuesday. But this questioning has been all over the place, mostly focused probably on Michael Cohen's criminal history, but also, you know, talking about the fact that he might have an axe to grind against Donald Trump. And then little by little, they're bringing up Stormy Daniels issues, as well. But there's definitely not a through line of questioning. They're just kind of hitting Michael Cohen from any angle that they can get at.",
