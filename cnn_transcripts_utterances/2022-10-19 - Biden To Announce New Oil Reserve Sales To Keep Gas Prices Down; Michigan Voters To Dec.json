Three weeks from this morning, we should hopefully know the winners of the midterm elections. The latest CNN polling shows the economy and inflation are the top issues for voters.Later today, President Biden will announce the sale of 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That will happen in December. Mr. Biden's aim is to ease gas prices as Republican candidates focus on inflation and rising prices. The move fulfills the administration's decision back in March to release a total of 180 million barrels from the reserve over a six-month period. We get more now from CNN's Phil Mattingly.",

A run that was really put into question by the decision from OPEC Plus to reduce its output targets by nearly 2 million barrels. The administration has moved quickly and intensively over the course of the last several days to do something to blunt the impact of that. And the President on Wednesday is set to announce at least some of those steps. This is part of the plan the President laid out in the spring. 180 million barrels released over the course of six months. It is an additional release than they planned at least a couple of weeks ago. And it underscores the President's real urgency to try and address this issue particularly just three weeks out from the midterm elections. It's something he alluded to at an event Los Angeles last week. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
