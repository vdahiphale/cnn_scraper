EMPLOYEE: I think it's encouraging that we have started to see some degree of a shift, but at present it has made almost no difference to the lives of people starving and being bombed inside Gaza. I think to the extent that even things like the U.S. being willing to abstain at the U.N. Security Council is significant. But then the administration came out and immediately said that that was non-binding. So, in general, I just find that the way the administration is trying to do this, I think, they made a political calculation that they thought that it made the most sense politically to maintain this extreme support for Israel, regardless of the illegal behaviors that Israel engages in. I would push back against the characterization of Israel's behavior as self-defense. The administration continues to use those words, because self-defense is permissible under the U.N. Charter. But the actions that Israel is engaged in, as far as -- like we already discussed, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, continuing to hit buildings, institutions that are protected under international humanitarian law, such as hospitals, the ways that Israel is conducting this war, I would argue are fall far outside the bounds of what might credibly be considered self-defense. And, instead, I would argue that with, you know, I would add to the argument others have made that Israel is committing war crimes and is possibly engaging in an act of genocide. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The newspaper will mark the anniversary in its print edition Friday by leaving part of its front page blank. That represents the missing articles Gershkovich never wrote because of his detention.The headline will say in part, \"His story should be here.\" The crime, journalism. Meanwhile, the Kremlin says ongoing contacts about his possible exchange must be conducted in absolute silence or they'll be less likely to succeed. Earlier this week, Gershkovich's pre-trial detention was extended until at least June 30th. Russia says it has detained a 12th suspect in last week's terrorist attack near Moscow. The U.S. said on Thursday it warned Russia more than two weeks in advance that a terrorist attack could be coming. Russian President Vladimir Putin chose to ignore that, but now an activist group in London says Russian security services were aware that ISIS might have been preparing to strike. CNN's Matthew Chance has that story, and again, just a warning, some images in his report might be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's the worst terror attack in Russia in 20 years. And new evidence suggests the Kremlin's own security services were aware of an ISIS threat. Internal Russian intelligence documents obtained by the London-based Dossier Center warned of an increased likelihood of an attack in Russia just days before the assault. According to the investigative organization, ethnic Tajiks could be involved, radicalized by ISIS-K. That's the Central Asian offshoot of the terror group claiming responsibility for the attack near Moscow. With statements, photographs, even this propaganda video filmed by the attackers themselves. The Kremlin hasn't responded to CNN's request for a comment on the Dossier Center report. But U.S. intelligence warnings to Moscow were dismissed by President Putin himself as a provocation intended to intimidate and destabilize Russian society. The Kremlin seems determined to blame Ukraine, which adamantly denies any involvement for this destruction and bloodshed. Suspected Islamists may have carried out the attack, says Moscow. But it was supported by Kyiv and Russian investigators now say they've extracted evidence from the battered suspects. SVETLANA PETRENKO, RUSSIAN INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE (through translator): Working with detained terrorists, studying their technical devices, evidence was obtained connecting them with Ukrainian nationalists. We have confirmed data the perpetrators received significant amounts of money and cryptocurrency from Ukraine. CHANCE (voice-over): But it's hard to take the Kremlin fighting a brutal war in Ukraine at its word. Critics say it may be using the tragedy in Moscow to bolster flagging support for a conflict costing tens of thousands of lives, and to mask the shortcomings of its own intelligence services. Too focused in recent years, say critics, on Russia's political opposition. Like supporters of the late Alexei Navalny, and not enough on the Islamist threat. For the Kremlin, that's a damaging criticism. President Putin here visiting a military helicopter base north of Moscow, has long cast himself as the guarantor of Russian stability and security. Now, more than ever, to many Russians, that guarantee seems threadbare. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Dow and S&amp;P both gained a little more than a tenth of a percent. The Nasdaq dipped slightly.

The founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, who carried out one of the largest white collar crimes in history, has been sentenced. Sam Bankman-Fried, once known as a crypto whiz kid, was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy last year following the collapse of the exchange. He was convicted of stealing $8 billion of his customers' money. His sentence, far less than the 110 years allowed by sentencing guidelines, and also less than the 40 to 50 years prosecutors wanted, he's getting 25 years in federal prison. The judge also ordered him to forfeit more than $11 billion. Now, there's no parole in federal cases, but Bankman-Fried may be able to shave years off his term. His lawyers have called the sentence Medieval, but the judge said Bankman-Fried never showed, quote, \"a word of remorse for his terrible crimes and that there's a risk he could do something very bad in the future.\" Dr. Scott Bonn is a criminologist and an expert on white collar crime and he's with us from Las Vegas. Thank you so much for being here with us. So just to start, what do you make of the sentencing? I mean, 25 years was half of what the prosecutors were asking for. So does the punishment meet the crime here? DR. SCOTT BONN, CRIMINOLOGIST: Well, you just gave the definition of just desserts, which is the assumption and belief that the punishment should fit the crime. And I think in this case, it definitely does. I mean, based upon the tremendous harm that this man did through his fraud theft and corruption, I think that 25 years and $11 billion forfeiture hits the mark.",

You know, the cryptocurrency market arena has been referred to by many people as sort of the wild, wild west of financial markets. So it's time to weed out some of these bad actors and allow more respected and appropriate actors to move in. For example, the asset manager BlackRock, I understand, is moving into this arena.
