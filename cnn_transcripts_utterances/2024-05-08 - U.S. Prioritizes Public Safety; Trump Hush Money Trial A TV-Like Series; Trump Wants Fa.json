So which specific weapons delivery was paused and why? We'll bring you the latest comments from the U.S. Defense Secretary. Also ahead, what happened and when? An exclusive CNN report on Afghanistan is making waves on Capitol Hill. And later, the rise of the Ozempic baby. Several women are reporting surprise pregnancies after taking the popular weight loss drug. For one struggling mother, it was a dream come true. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching One World. We begin with a direct political message from the United States to Israel. A looming high stakes report and what appears to be a growing divide between the allies during a key moment in the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. Secretary of Defense confirms the White House paused a shipment of bombs to Israel amid concerns that they would be used in Israel's long threatened ground invasion into Rafah. More than one million Palestinians are currently sheltering in Gaza's southernmost city and were told the decision to pause this transfer of weapons was a result of the Israelis not providing the U.S. with a credible plan to protect those civilians. The Biden administration once again made clear it's against a full-scale military incursion after Israel captured the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: This appears to be a limited operation, but of course much of that depends on what comes next. They have said, I think quite clearly, it's no secret that they want to conduct a major military operation there. We have made clear that we oppose such an operation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say slightly delayed, so we'll probably see it in the coming days here. But it's looking at, studying at, you know, two major questions here. First of which, as you pointed out, if the -- if Israel is using U.S. weaponry in a way that is not in accordance with international humanitarian law. So, the way that this national security memo 20 that President Biden signed requires the State Department to do is to get assurances from Israel that they are in compliance with international humanitarian law. And then the secretary of state has to make a determination as to whether those assurances are credible and reliable. We have already reported that there is division within the State Department over this question, over if those assurances that Israel has provided are indeed credible and reliable. So, we'll have to watch and see what that final determination looks like. And we should note that there is pressure from Congress, particularly those in President Biden's own party, Democrats, who are saying that the State Department shouldn't just take those assurances point blank. They should look into them. They should be getting evidence from the Israelis. They should be getting explanations from the Israelis in terms of why they carried out certain strikes that may have created the perception of violating international humanitarian law before they just rubber stamp that, yes, they are indeed in compliance. The other thing that this report is going to be looking at is the question over whether Israel impeded the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. We've heard repeatedly from U.S. officials that Israel has made progress on that front, getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza. But they've also said repeatedly that Israel has to be doing more here. So where do they land on that final determination? And I think it's important to note that this report doesn't require a change in policy, but it could certainly trigger a massive amount of pressure on the Biden administration to potentially change what has been this green lighting of continued U.S. military support for Israel. We've now seen, of course, the first time in the last few days here with this news that they're putting a pause on one of those shipments. But to date, we haven't seen much change from the Biden administration on this real leverage point that they have. And if Israel is found to not be in compliance with international humanitarian law, you can expect that there will be tremendous pressure for the Biden administration to change its tact here quite dramatically.",

But when she found out Trump and Michael Cohen were interested in buying the story for $130,000, she told the court it was the best thing that could have happened because then I'd be safe and the story wouldn't come out. Then in a searing cross-examination, Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles, pushed Daniels. Am I correct that you hate President Trump? Yes, Daniels replied. You want him to go to jail, Necheles asked. I want him to be held accountable, Daniels said. If he's found guilty, yes. Daniels casual and relaxed demeanor changed as the defense's questions became more pointed, attacking her credibility and trying to establish Daniels has always just been trying to make a profit. You've been making money by claiming to have had sex with President Trump for more than a decade, Necheles asked. That story has made you a lot of money, right? Daniels responded. It's also cost me a lot of money. Court will not be in session on Wednesday, but Daniels will be back on the stand Thursday to continue that cross-examination. The big thing we're watching for over the next 72 hours is whether Trump can continue to abide by the gag order that prohibits him from attacking any witnesses in this case.

There's no reason this case could not be getting ready for a trial this summer when we finish here in Manhattan with the 2016 election interference case. And instead, Judge Cannon, who's inexperienced, she's a new judge, she's never worked with the key issue, which is guiding the pretrial preparation here, SEPA, the statute that governs the use of classified documents in a criminal case. And she's dragging things out because of that inexperience. And frankly, some of these decisions are bizarre enough that you have to wonder if she doesn't have a bias towards the president who appointed her, Donald Trump.

They wanted to get through the day to have a full day today to prepare and reset and undoubtedly to come after her hammer and tongs when we start again tomorrow morning at 9:30. I think they are going to attack her for being a liar. They're going to point to the times when her story has admittedly diverged. People do remember things differently over time. There's many more examples. We'll probably hear about all of them tomorrow morning. They're going to hit her motives that they say are corrupt, her goal of making money from this. There's more examples of that they can point to. And her bias, one of the most striking moments was when they asked her, do you hate President Trump? Did you say you'd dance in the street if he was convicted of crime? But she pushed back on all of those fronts, Bianna. And I thought she was very effective. You can't see it so much from the transcript. But sitting in the courtroom, watching her, hearing her tone, the strength that she displayed, her inner steel, that was much more of the real Stormy than the one we met on direct. And I observed the jury put down their writing instruments. They paid more attention during the cross. So, she is pushing back. And we'll find out when there's a verdict in this case, whether the jury believed her or not, and whether Donald Trump's aggressive cross-examination by Susan Necheles helped or actually hurt.

We've been talking with doctors and researchers about this, and they say it's not necessarily surprising to learn about this because it has been known that weight loss can help with infertility by making cycles more regular, for example, in conditions like PCOS or for any other reason. They say losing 5 to 10 percent or more of your body weight can normalize cycles and help people get pregnant. There is also a really important thing to know about these medications, specifically ones that are based on the active ingredient Tirzepatide, that's Eli Lilly drugs, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. They actually contain a warning in their label that they make oral birth control pills potentially less effective. That's thought to be because of the way that these drugs work. They slow the food moving through the digestive system, and that can affect absorption of other medications taken at the same time. So, doctors say it's really important to be aware of that. We did talk with one mom who started taking Mounjaro for weight loss reasons. She ended up losing 40 pounds over five months. Her name is Catera Bentley. You can see her there. She had been struggling with infertility for two years. After taking this medicine for five months, she unexpectedly got pregnant.

So far, the early data are not extremely concerning in humans, but there are very early animal studies that suggest some cause for concern. So, the recommendation is to stop taking these medicines two months before trying to conceive, or if you find out you're pregnant while on them, stop them right away.
