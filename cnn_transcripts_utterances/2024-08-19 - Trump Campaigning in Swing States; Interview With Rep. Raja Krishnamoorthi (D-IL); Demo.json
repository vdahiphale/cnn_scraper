      "sentences": "Hello. It's the top of the hour. I'm Brianna Keilar at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. And my colleague and friend Boris Sanchez is in Washington.It is day one for the Democrats' weeklong nomination, celebration of Vice President Kamala Harris. And over the next several hours, thousands in the party will gather here in the United Center to celebrate Harris and also to salute President Joe Biden as he delivers tonight's keynote speech and passes the torch to her. The president is expected to talk about his 50-year legacy of public service and to make the case for the Harris/Walz ticket. First lady Jill Biden and Hillary Clinton will also take the stage. With just 78 days until the election, the Democrats arrive here in the Windy City with a strong breeze at their backs, as new polling shows Harris with a narrow lead nationally. The goal now is to build on the momentum and introduce Harris and her vision to the country. CNN's M.J. Lee is joining me now. I know you're learning some new details about what the first lady is going to be saying, which I think is particularly interesting tonight. What have you found out? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. And it's not surprising at all that we are going to be hearing from the first lady, obviously no better person to introduce the president than his spouse, who knows him best. Keep in mind, we have talked a lot about what a challenging time the last few months have been for President Biden. Of course, the same goes for members of his family. The first lady included, by all accounts and all of our reporting, she did remain supportive of whatever decision he was going to make. Even up until the moment that he announced that he was going to be dropping out, we are told that she was really fully there. And then the speech that she is going to now give tonight is completely different than the one that she was going to give four weeks ago. We are told that, first and foremost, she will be calling on Americans to support Vice President Kamala Harris. According to a source, she will say that it's time for Americans to come together with faith in each other, hope for a brighter future and love for our country and back the vice president. But, not surprisingly, there's going to be an element here where she is paying tribute to her husband, talking about his character, talking about his accomplishments over the last 3.5 years. And there's going to be an element here that is also a tribute to the first lady. There's going to be a video, we are told, that introduces the first lady, sort of marking the key moments from her time as first lady as well. So, just remember that this is, yes, an important political speech for the first lady, but I think in so many ways we will likely see how personal of a moment this is for her as well.",

More than anything else, similar to what we're going to hear from the first lady, he is going to stress over and over again that Democrats must win in November, that they have to defeat Donald Trump in November. But I am told that this is not going to be a farewell speech, that the moment for that is likely going to come in January. That would very much mirror what we saw from former President Barack Obama, when he gave his sort of formal farewell speech to the nation back in January of 2017, actually here in the city of Chicago as well. He sees the president, the endorsement that he immediately gave after he dropped out that Sunday afternoon to Vice President Harris, as being singularly important, being responsible, and helping her quick ascent to the top of the ticket. We certainly expect that there's going to be sort of a tribute to the personal relationship that he has and has developed with the vice president as well. And he will, I think, talk about the vice president as somebody who is capable of speaking about her accomplishments, her attributes, her strengths in a way that nobody else can, because he has now been through so much with her in the last 3.5 years.",

They did an excellent job electronically to do a convention four years ago, but we're back to the ways of old right now, and we're going to see Joe Biden on the stage behind us, really, as you noted, passing the torch, the idea of talking about all the accomplishments that he has done with his wing person, that being Kamala Harris, and him putting her -- giving her the opportunity to be on a ticket and now stepping aside and allowing her to elevate up to be the nominee. I will tell you, Brianna, there is a wave of excitement, certainly in the Democratic Party, certainly in this town that we're feeling right now that, 30 days ago, when Joe Biden was still the standard-bearer, still going to be the nominee, you didn't see in the Democratic Party.",

Now, she's going to be building off of, obviously, the record of President Biden and herself over the past three years, but she has to sell herself. She has to not only go on that stage and get the American people to like her, but over the next three, four days, all of these folks who are on stage giving testaments to her have got to sell her to the American people. In many ways, she does have a honeymoon right now. There have been no mistakes so far in this campaign, but it's still early, and you and I both know that a campaign can turn on a dime. So expect a very hard sell on Kamala Harris in talking about the future.",

She's bridging the Democratic Party of her generation to the Democratic Party where we are right now.She didn't break through the glass ceiling when she ran in 2016, but she put a lot of cracks in it. She certainly blazed a path for other women, not only just in Democratic politics, but in all political parties to take a jump, to get involved, to run for office. And I think what you're going to see from her tonight is, she's going to talk about not only that, but talk about the empowerment of women and how Kamala Harris is going to be looking out for women certainly in this election. And let's not forget, one of the biggest issues that we will hear from the Democrats over the next three months will be about abortion and about how Donald Trump is trying to take away the right to choose.",

Now, most of these folks are probably Democrats, right? In many ways, they are Democrats, but they're very upset about how the United States is backing Israel in this battle with Hamas and all the folks that are dying over in the Gaza Strip right now. Not only will we see them on the outside, Brianna, but we're going to see them on the inside, because there are about 30 uncommitted delegates, folks who want to be able to voice their opposition to the Hamas war right now. And you could see something happening -- happen on the floor behind us. I do expect that, if that does happen, they will be shouted down. And really the protests that happen on the outside, Democrats can only hope that they stay peaceful. If they stay peaceful, then this will just be forgotten about. If they do get violent, then, of course, the attention will turn to that.",

They're willing to listen to her, but they're not certain yet because of the prosecutorial background. How does she balance that? Also, we got some donors that are not yet in this barn. Silicon Valley walked away from this party and now you have got somebody from the Bay Area, from Silicon Valley area who's on the ticket. Can she signal to them that she's not going to be as aggressive on the technology companies as Biden was? There's a lot of stuff happening under the hood here. You got to figure it out.",

Pennsylvania is a big gun owner state, big hunter state, huge fracking state. Those are losers. Right? She's also tied to the guy who's given the keynote here tonight. It is the Biden/Harris administration. So, she's trying to run as an outsider, redefine herself, is not part of this team. I'm going to change things. Donald Trump got something right at that press conference at Bedminster. She said -- he said her day one was 3.5 years ago, because she said I'm going to be ready on day one. He said, yes, that was 3.5 years ago, Madam Vice President. It's the Biden/Harris ticket. It's hard to distance yourself when your name's on the door.",

She was trying to figure out a way to navigate a primary. This person you see now has something you can't buy, authenticity. She is speaking for herself. There was just an article written about how she didn't even really have time to pull together a fake stump speech with her first speech. That was more from her heart.
