It is 05This morning, the Supreme Court will consider a question that's never before been asked of it, did a presidential candidate, Donald Trump in this case, engage in insurrection? And if so, does that allow him to be disqualified from the ballot? The justice's answer has the potential to upend the 2024 race. Trump is now for all intents and purposes, the presumptive Republican nominee and that's exactly how his party is acting. Following his lead, congressional Republicans have basically descended into chaos, and the Senate leaders are going to try to salvage something from the collapse of a laboriously negotiated border deal. That measure would have traded the most conservative immigration policies in decades for crucial aid to Israel and Ukraine. But Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to advance the bill after Donald Trump started lobbying against it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  Donald Trump wants chaos. Donald Trump does not want success at the border. He wants chaos and if he became president, I doubt he'd ever solve it.

I want to start just by making sure we dig into what a historic day we're going to see today unfold. And I know, you know, there are -- there are these cases across the country in different states. This is about the Colorado ballot officially, but its really going to answer a broader question for states about whether or not Donald Trump is going to be on the ballot. And, you know, I realize you're not a lawyer, but it's really the politics of this that, you know, I want to dig into here because its going to be, you know, half the country is going to be upset likely with the Supreme Courts decision. It's the biggest moment for them since Bush versus Gore.

They said we need border provisions.Like you said, laborious negotiations. Senator Lankford spent months negotiating what turned out to be, I think in the history of recent immigration deals are fairly conservative product. There was nothing in there for undocumented immigrants, nothing in there for DACA recipients. It was mainly focused on the border and on border enforcement. And it still wasn't enough for Senate Republicans. And I think Senator Lankford is, is right to call out the election near dynamics. This is a deal that Donald Trump has railed against has urged his supporters of whom he has many in Congress to not support, and I think it just shows that for Senate Democrats anyway, Senate Republicans might be going the way of the House.",

I mean, that is just -- I feel like the phrase quiet part out loud is way over used now because it happens so much, but that's a pretty extreme version of it.Lets talk Gabby about the House because Mike Johnson, the House speaker, is also on the rocks here, with people suddenly saying, hey, maybe it was a bad idea to get rid of Kevin McCarthy. We're underscoring that this shows it was a bad idea to get rid of Kevin McCarthy. I want to show you an assortment of lawmakers talking to my Hill colleagues over the course of the last 24 hours.

MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI):  It's unclear to me why we barreled ahead with a vote knowing that the votes weren't there. We did not need to embarrass ourselves. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  There's been a real lack of leadership on this. And what I'm mostly disappointed in is that were not having that conversation of, okay, what's round two?

I think this was a pretty stunning embarrassment for Speaker Johnson, for Tom Emmer, as the whip, for their team.The three Republicans who ended up voting against the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas, I don't think they were -- they were quiet about their intentions. You know, I think all three of them, people had eyes on them that they might be the votes for no. And it seems that Republicans were relying on Democratic attendance and false information about Democratic attendance to move this through. And so, I think even if they vote on the Mayorkas impeachment again next week, when Leader Scalise is back from dealing with his health problems, if there even -- if they're able to move it, I think the conversation has been diverted from talking about the southern border, which is what they want. And instead, I think it's about Speaker Johnson and about House Republicans.

His comments come after Hamas leaders on Wednesday issued a three-phase counter proposal that included a full Israeli troop withdrawal in exchange for hostages. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed it, calling it delusional. But Blinken, who's on the final day of his Mideast visit, is optimistic at least that negotiations would continue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We also see space in what came back to pursue negotiations, to see, if we can get to an agreement. And that's what we intend to do.

      "sentences": "Kasie, I suppose as long as they're still talking, there is still hope that a deal can be done and its also unclear as to whether what were hearing from Hamas and from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if those are maximalist positions from which they won't budge, or if they are just part of the negotiating -- negotiating tactics.So Hamas demanding, for example, the release of vast numbers of Palestinian prisoners, including some 500 who have been convicted of either killing Israelis or being part of attacks that were -- that had deadly results. And at the same time, a full withdrawal from Israel, from the Gaza Strip, and Prime Minister Netanyahu saying and that Israel will not do a deal at any cost. It won't release thousands of prisoners. So they probably both have their red lines. Whether those red lines are being articulated just yet is I suppose something that we will find out in due course. But interestingly, Netanyahu didn't flat-out reject the possibility of any deal, just not the deal that Hamas seems to put on the table people. And Hamas delegation is today in Egypt to continue the conversation, the Egyptians being alone with the Qataris, the key mediators in all of this. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken is still optimistic that a deal can be done, but there's a lot of pressure from a number of different sides and it's quite hard to see how Netanyahu is going to balance all of these different pressures, because you've got the families with hostages still being held in the Gaza Strip. They've been there now for four months, who believed that time is running out. And then let's not forget, there will be those who perhaps lost loved ones at the hands of some of those Palestinian prisoners that Hamas wants released. And they won't be particularly keen to see them released. So, there's quite a delicate balancing act that needs to be done. But one word we did get from a former hostage or seventy-two-year-old, Dina Mahsa, saying, I'm terribly afraid that if you continue with this line of dismantling Hamas, no hostages will be left to release -- Kasie. HUNT:  Yeah, really, really difficult reality there. Elliot, on a slightly different topic, U.S. Central Command has said that one of their drones brown strikes killed, a key commander that is in one of the -- one of the major Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq. What more can you tell us about that?",

A CNN team on the ground heard two explosions in quick succession. This commander from Kataib Hezbollah was killed and another person according to the Iraqis, was also in the car as well, but no additional collateral damage or any other casualties that were aware of -- aware of. Now, Iraq has derived at -- decried this as a violation of its sovereignty. And it comes at a very delicate moment because the U.S. is about to restart talks with the Iraqis about their presence in Iraq. And this could prompt the Iraqis to say they no longer want Americans to be there on their soil -- Kasie.",
