Russian defense officials say it's one of four drones they intercepted on Tuesday. Aviation authorities temporarily closed all the airports in the Moscow region. And Russia's Defense Ministry says it destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat on the Black Sea, which was spotted near a Russian gas production facility. For its part, Ukrainian officials say they carried out a successful attack on a Russian military base on Monday, claiming one of its drones damaged at least one aircraft. Well, meanwhile, Ukraine's president is meeting with Balkan leaders in Greece. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying, Greece will help train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets.

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, I think BRICS has taken on a new relevance in particular because of the context of the war in Ukraine. And that will be the event that's sort of shadowing a lot of this summit, both in terms of what these countries represent and their viewpoint on the Ukraine war.So, if you look at some of the key things to watch out for one is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be here, of course, he is under in a warrant from the International Criminal Court. He faces charges of human rights abuses in that Ukraine war, and the decision was taken for him to not come in person. There will be a very interesting moment when all of these leaders of Brazil, India, China, and South Africa are in a room together, that Vladimir Putin has to attend virtually, and that will send a message about his isolation. But I think it's more complicated than that, because these countries have supported Russia in some sense, or kept on the sidelines. And this bloc of countries, is also looking possibly to expand. That's another key issue. China, in particular, is pushing for that expansion. We've seen more than 20 countries formally, try and add their names to BRICS. And that is something that could mean this becomes a de-facto group of countries to take on the G7. At least, that's what China would want. It's a more complicated when you look at what perhaps Brazil, and India, in particular, want to see out of this organization. We'll see if that becomes a formality, this particular summit. And then, I think finally, you know, will this become a major power center of the so-called Global South. You've seen moves by BRICS to form their own multilateral lender in the New Development Bank or BRICS bank. There is talk about trying to reduce the dependency on the U.S. dollar when it comes to trade between countries in the Global South. So, you know, after some years of trying to find its footing, this might be a moment where BRICS comes into more relevance on the global stage. We'll have to see in the next few days, but it is a significant meeting, indeed, Rosemary.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, you know, it's worth noting that this is only Xi Jinping's second international trip after the pandemic.The first one was actually back in March to Moscow to see his \"dear friend,\" Putin. So, this kind of dynamic really underscores what David was saying that as despite these country's vastly different political and economic models, these leaders really bonded by these shared grievances or a desire to change this current global order, led and dominated by the U.S. and its allies. And David mentioned some of the items on the agenda: expanding this grouping, but also reducing their reliance on U.S. dollars. I think, Xi Jinping very much is on board about this. You know, that, of course, is why you have seen state media and officials here really drumming up this narrative of the Global South, emerging nations around the world coming together to counter what they describe as the U.S. policy of unilateral sanctions and long arm jurisdictions. But Xi Jinping comes here at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's biggest -- second biggest facing a lot of strong headwinds back at home, this post-COVID rebound really not going as well, as officials had hoped they are faced with a burgeoning local government debt crisis, a deepening real estate crisis, not to mention, youth unemployment, consistently reaching historic highs for several months. And now, the government has decided to stop releasing data on this front. So, that means, Xi Jinping may be more constrained in terms of what kind of investment, projects -- what kind of projects they can invest and finance compared to given just the past few years. But some experts say the Beijing leadership has now switching -- has now switched to a so-called low-cost high impact strategy by, for example, improving party to party relations to tout the superiority of the Chinese political system by having more African military officers being trained here in China, not to mention of course, expanding China's soft power. The state media outlet, Rosemary, CCTV (PH), debuting the second season of a show called, \"Classics Quoted by Xi Jinping\" across Africa.

A short time ago, the country's Supreme Court gave him eight years in prison for corruption. Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 military coup, while he attended a U.N. meeting in New York.

But finally, he has returned today.It is the same day, in fact, as you say that there will be a vote on electing a new prime minister. So, the timing is obviously interesting. The prime minister who or, at least, the candidate running for prime minister, is a member of the Pheu Thai Party, which is the Thaksin-backed party. He's a former confidant of Thaksin. In fact, he's also tweeted, saying he welcomes Thaksin back to the country, and is happy that he can be reunited with his family. So, he certainly has some support from a man who is currently a candidate and will be voted on to be prime minister in the coming hours. Now, when it comes to this Pheu Thai Party, what we have heard on Monday, is that they agreed to be part of an 11-party coalition. Now, Pheu Thai did not win the election, they got the second most amount of votes. Move Forward, the progressive party won the most votes, but they were unable to form a government as they were blocked by the conservative military-backed parties. So, this new coalition with Pheu Thai will not include Move Forward. It's certainly a very stringent a bank turn from the group itself. And they will be included in this coalition with two military-backed parties. So, certainly, it'll be interesting to see what kind of reaction there is from Move Forward. Voters, much of them among the youth of the country. But when it comes to Thaksin, himself, he has been affiliated with this party. He is now has been sentenced, as you say, to eight years in prison. It's a corruption case or three charges, in fact, that he was tried on in absentia, while he was in self-imposed exile, and he could have been sentenced up to 10 years. The judges decided eight years, and we will have to see what the format is where he will spend those eight years, and in fact, how many of those eight years he will spend behind bars. Rosemary?",
