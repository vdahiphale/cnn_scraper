      "sentences": "Well, hello and welcome to a special edition of \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson, coming to youtoday, live from COP 16 in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. That is right. We are at another COP, short for Conference of the Parties. Now many of you will be familiar with COPs focused on climate change, of course, and biodiversity. This one is meant to tackle an issue that often flies under the radar, land degradation. It is a crucial yet overlooked piece of the global conversation on the climate crisis. And we are here to shine a spotlight on it. And the reason is simple. If we don't act to protect and regenerate our land now, the result will be more food insecurity, which leads to more conflict and more enforced migration. It really is that simple and that stark. Well, today, the U.N. for the first time, quantified the cost of restoring the world's degraded land saying at least 2.5 trillion dollars needs to be invested by the end of this decade. That is $1 billion a day, a huge ask, especially at a time when the world is grappling with so many competing conflicts, but for the hosts here, not acting is simply not an option. Well, earlier, Saudi Arabia's Climate Envoy Adel al-Jubeir told me how this region knows firsthand, the impacts of desertification and why we need to act. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADEL AL-JUBEIR, SAUDI MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND CLIMATE ENVOY: Our region suffers from lack of water. Our region suffers from lack of plants. Our region is suffering from increasing temperatures, and we want to reverse this trend. We want to set an example. We want to lead this effort. We want our region as well as the world, to focus on the importance of dealing with this issue, and the fact that this issue is not limited to desert countries or countries in the Middle East or in North Africa. This is an issue that has an impact on everybody, just like climate does, just like water does. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, there hasn't been any type of official response yet, Becky, but certainly this wouldfeed into the worst fear of many Lebanese people, which is that those areas, those homes, most of which have been decimated by consistent air strikes on those areas, will be rendered further uninhabitable because of a potential reluctance, or indeed an actual order, to refuse to allow those homes to be rebuilt. As of now, you mentioned that thousands of people, Becky, have returned to their homes. Well, there are many more who are simply unable to go back to their homes. The IDF has said, I believe it's about 60 villages that are still inaccessible. People are being told not to move into those areas. And all of this sort of part of this really delicate bit of choreography that is expected to transpire over the coming now, just under 60 days, during the course of which the IDF is supposed to pull back from those areas. And Hezbollah is supposed to pull back 25 miles from the border, just north of the Litani River. And the Lebanese army is expected to move down into those areas to sort of oversee the extraction of Hezbollah. So obviously, there are a lot of moving parts, when it comes to that, we have seen and heard of multiple cases of violations of the cease fire. But broadly speaking, it does appear to be holding. And it is very much, Becky, the fervent desire of the vast majority of Lebanese people that it does continue to hold, because this is a country that has been beleaguered by this war, the cost has been incredibly high, not just in terms of the high number of casualties, roughly 4000 people killed. But also, in terms of the economic price that Lebanon has paid the World Bank saying $3.4 billion in physical damage to actual buildings. But beyond that, an estimate of $5.1 billion in economic losses. And this, taken against the backdrop of Lebanon's already beleaguered economy, has really resulted in a situation that is simply unsustainable for so many people who are struggling to survive here. So, the hope that we have found in the conversations that we have had is very much that this cease fire, shaky, though it may be, will continue to hold, Becky.",

U.S. President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter who faced sentencing this month for federal tax and gun convictions.Now this pardon spares the president's son from a potential prison sentence. Sunday's controversial move comes after Mr. Biden repeatedly insisted that his son would not receive a pardon or special treatment in his criminal cases. Well, the president explained in a statement, and I quote partly, no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion that under was singled out only because he is my son, and that he said is wrong. CNN's Arlette Saenz following President Biden on his trip to Luanda, Angola, the last trip certainly scheduled trip for Joe Biden as president. Why did this pardon, Arlette happen now?

There are some Democratic lawmakers who say that the president is putting family over country and that he should not have done that. But then there's others who agree with the president that the charges that were brought against Hunter Biden would not have been brought up in court if there it was another just anonymous person who was facing these charges. One of the president's supporters is Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who had posted on social media that he didn't think that these charges should have been brought against Hunter. So certainly, a lot of the reaction from Republicans has been quite predictable, but it's interesting to see the democratic split, with many believing that the president should not have pardoned his son, but others agreed with the president's case that he made in that statement.",

Well, it's notable that Trump himself had not ruled out pardoning Hunter Biden himself. In a radio interview in October, he said it's not off the table. Well, let's get more now. Alayna Treene joins us live from West Palm Beach in Florida. You won't have to make that decision now, because, of course, Joe Biden has pardoned his son. We've heard from the president- elect.

      "sentences": "Well, Kash Patel is a fierce loyalist of Donald Trump, one of the most hardline conservatives that supports him. He previously worked at theJustice Department, but also was in Donald Trump's first administration, in several different national security roles, but he is very controversial as well. He has made many claims and criticisms of the FBI, including arguing that he wants to shut down the Bureau's Washington headquarters, that he wants to fire FBI leadership, and also has said that he's committed to firing large swaths of agents within the bureau to really root out that bias that I was mentioning that Donald Trump and him believe is permeating the FBI over the last several years. Now he like Trump, is very distrustful of the agency. And again, has made many controversial statements, including arguing that Donald Trump should seek retribution against political opponents. He's also talked about wanting to seek retribution against American journalists. All of this has led to some skepticism behind the scene, including from some of those close to the president-elect, about whether or not Patel was right for the role. I was told that he was actually being considered and pushed by many people to be deputy director, rather than the director itself, because there are concerns that he may not be able to get confirmed by the Senate. Now I'm also told, Becky, that Donald Trump was really wavering in recent days between two different people to replace Christopher Wray. I should also note that Donald Trump would have to fire the current FBI Director, Christopher Wray, who is serving out a 10-year term right now and order to install Patel to the role. But he was wavering, I'm told between Patel as well as Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. However, I was also told that Bailey, who interviewed with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in person for the role, didn't impress Trump, because essentially, Donald Trump really wants someone who will be a legal pit bull farmer, who will carry out his agenda and not hold him back. He believes that Patel is the person who will do that, and according to a lot of the things that Patel has said, and those who know him, they argue that he is the person that they believe could disrupt the FBI in such a sweeping way, Becky.",

When you have land degradation, you have the reduced ability to produce food, which means you have more migration as people move towards areas where they can grow food.

That's the view of the U.N. which says globally, about 40 percent of once fertile land around the world is already degraded the result of climate change, drought and poor land management. A further 100 million hectares is lost every year. That's equivalent to two times the size of Greenland. Conflict, forced migration, social cohesion and the simple ability to feed the world's growing population are what's at stake if the problem is not addressed. Saudi Arabia post of COP 16 has made restoring the world's degraded land and holding back its deserts a focus of its vision 2030 economic plan. The kingdom has committed to grow 10 billion trees in the nation and another 40 billion across the region through the Middle East green initiative, that's the equivalent of restoring 200 million hectares of land. And it has urged the private sector to play a greater role. The message from the hosts is that land restoration is not only an environmental necessity. It makes business sense too.
