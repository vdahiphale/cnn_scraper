      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, so he just posted, and I don't want to shock you, but it's not a message of unity. It is an attack on Nikki Haley, which is unsurprising, given that we know that he is increasingly angry with the fact she hasn't dropped out of the race.He essentially said that he heard that Nikki Haley, and calling her a nickname, which I'm not going to read, totally bombed last night in South Carolina, saying why the surprise? She just bombed in Iowa and New Hampshire. And we can just stop it there, because he goes on to talk about Nevada, which she's not competing in. The point of this is that he is still very angry that she hasn't dropped out. And there are several reasons why. One is they want to move on to the general election. They don't want to be spending time in places like South Carolina and Nevada. They don't want to be spending money in those various areas. They want to be building out their teams in places like Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and she's now standing in the way there. The other part of this, and this is something else that he posted that I thought was very interesting, is that he pushed back on this idea essentially threatening people, that if they gave any money to Nikki Haley or contributed to her in any way, they would be blackballed from MAGA world. Now, this is a tactic that we have seen Donald Trump and his team used before, but there's something very different about telling people that if they go work for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, they can't then work for Trump versus talking about actual money. Because there are people within the campaign, the people who actually pay those campaign bills, who would like to see some of those big dollar donors come in. And, in fact, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott said as much on Fox yesterday, essentially saying, that after South Carolina, they're hoping those big dollar donors come in. They thought it might come after Iowa, since they'd all gone to Ron DeSantis instead. That money shifted to Nikki Haley. Now, they're hoping after South Carolina, it will come to them. But, again, all of this larger issue, as Donald Trump has just fixated squarely on Nikki Haley.",

We are relying on our colleagues who are inside, giving us minute-by-minute updates.A few notable things. One is that there was a 30 minute delay to the start of this case today. That's notable, because this is federal court. It usually starts on time. Trump only sat down at the defense table a few minutes ago. There were a lot of questions. Where is he? Is he preparing for possible testimony? Also, two jurors are currently socially distancing, right, very 2020, in the jury box. Now, earlier this week on Monday, court was adjourned because one of the jurors was sick, that we don't know what that individual had. So, today, two jurors socially distancing. The judge didn't say anything beyond that. And now, E. Jean Carroll's lawyer is getting underway with their first witness of the day, Roberta Myers. She was Eugene Carroll's editor at L. So, she'll be speaking to potential damages, the impact that Trump's statements had on E. Jean Carroll's career. She was also witness back in the spring. Back in the spring, her testimony took about an hour-and-a-half, two hours.

And one thing we saw when voters were coming out of the primary in New Hampshire, is that people are buying this argument that he is a martyr, the victim, right, of an unfair system, because they're not paying attention to whether he actually followed the rules that the federal judge set out for the parameters of his damages testimony. They want to know that, oh, he was stopped, he was deprived of the opportunity to tell his side of the story, which, of course, he didn't show up for the trial in the spring when they were actually talking about sexual abuse.It's all about being a loud martyr for him politically, even if, legally, that makes no sense. I don't think he's worried about the damages. He's trying to regain the White House and he truly believes that this is an opportunity to once again frame himself as a victim.

He can interrupt him, he can tell the lawyers to try to control him, he could offer to even sanction him if he continues that, or he could just stop him from testifying. So, there's ways for the judge to control Trump, and I think that the way it plays out is Trump just wants as much time as he can in the limelight there to be doing his thing, to be railing against the judge.",
