The court stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas.

They are going to argue that they are already not committing acts of genocide, that they are already ensuring that their forces do not commit acts of genocide. Those are the first two rulings from the court. And then of course there is this notion of providing humanitarian aid. And on that front, Israeli officials, including the Israeli prime minister, today once again emphasizing that they will continue to work to allow and to facilitate humanitarian assistance into Gaza. There is very much a sigh of relief that this court did not go as far as South Africa had asked it to in terms of ordering a cessation, an immediate cessation of hostilities as part of this provisional ruling. And we've heard the Israeli prime minister view that rejection as something that was just and something that rejected an attempt at discrimination against the Jewish state in the Israeli prime minister's words.

Israel passed these accusations, its findings about UNRWA staff partaking in Hamas' horrendous October 7th attacks of killing Israelis and storming their properties. UNRWA moved very swiftly they say to instantly review the situation and terminate those staff involved. The head of UNRWA who's spoken directly to the U.N. secretary-general. The secretary-general has expressed in a statement that he is horrified about this situation, and he points out also that those people involved have been terminated. But already you see this response coming from State Department that they are withholding funding. We know that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, on Thursday to discuss this and Blinken saying that he was -- he appreciated that the U.N. was going to have a thorough investigation, one that they said would be complete, comprehensive and independent this review of UNRWA. But just to give a little more detail on UNRWA, which is something that the State Department also mentioned in their statement, this is a massive organization in total. In all the places, it works about 30,000 employees, mostly Palestinians in Gaza, 13,000 employees is the number UNRWA says they have working for them. And it has long been a concern of Israel that some of those members have been sympathetic to Hamas. Israel has pointed to this in the past. UNRWA provides a massive amount of humanitarian aid and help to the people in Gaza. So any reduction at this moment of funds coming to them, it has the potential for an immediate effect. We don't know quite how much money from the State Department is in the pipeline, quite how quickly they're withholding funding would impact. But for example, it was an UNRWA shelter for displaced people yesterday, housing about 43,000 people, 800 of them in a particular building hit by Israeli tank fire just in the past 48 hours. So UNRWA's role in Gaza is a very important humanitarian role, but this is going to call into question that role and the impartiality with which they their staff conduct their jobs. UNRWA itself has lost more than a hundred, I believe, of its own staff already in the conflict in Gaza.

And I just want to state here from the top that Donald Trump does not need to be in court. He did not need to testify. He does not need to attend closing arguments today. He is choosing to take himself off the campaign trail and be there, and part of that is because this is a trial about defamation and money. Both things that Donald Trump cares very much about, but he also really wants to defend himself in this case. And it's something actually that the judge has admonished him for because he has been speaking out of turn saying he doesn't know E. Jean Carroll, saying that the accusations are false and of course, I think also very much worth making clear here is that it has already been decided. A jury has already decided that E. Jean Carroll was defamed. This trial is about damages and how much money Donald Trump will owe. And that's really what has been one of the most major controversial topics of this. And we heard that from E. Jean Carroll's attorney today. She said, and I'm sorry, I'm going to read some of this since this is all breaking news, it's happening in the court right now, but she said that Donald Trump did not respect the prior jury verdict. She said not even for 24 hours. And she wants the record to reflect that Trump rose and walked out of the courtroom. Now, that was another big moment this morning. A lot of drama Donald Trump in the middle of E. Jean Carroll's attorney going through her closing arguments, got up and walked out. And it's still unclear to us at this moment why he did so. But we're following those breaking developments as they come in. And I also just want to point out that again, Carroll's lawyer is very much focusing her closing arguments on what this case is about. She said, quote, \"This case is about punishing Donald Trump for what he has done and what he continues to do, punishing him for the malicious nature of his attacks and his continuing attacks right up and during this very trial.\" And so definitely getting heated during these closing arguments. The offense or the prosecution, I should say, argues that they will take about an hour to deliver their closing remarks, then Donald Trump's defense team will begin. They also expect to take about another hour. It's unclear when all of this will wrap it. But it could be by this afternoon.",

It's clear that the South African team led by some very senior advocates will continue pushing the evidence of that.
