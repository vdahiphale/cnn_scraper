Israel's friends and enemies warn not to punish Gaza's civilians. And mass displacement. Nearly 3,000 dead and basic supplies running out. We'll have a report from inside. And the main U.N. relief coordinator joins me. Then, 1,400 people in Israel are dead. My conversation with the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, on Israel's endgame. Also, ahead, violence in the occupied West Bank. I speak to Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti about the wider fallout. And later in the program, America's chaotic Congress. Susan Glasser talks to Hari Sreenivasan about the endless race for house speaker. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And this just in from Israel. The top security chief says, the responsibility is on me for the devastating Hamas terror attack. Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar wrote, \"Despite a series of actions we carried out, we weren't able to create a sufficient warning that would allow the attack to be thwarted.\" 1,400 people were massacred that day and 199 were taken hostage according to the IDF. Meanwhile, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel today meeting with the defense minister and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in urgent shuttle diplomacy across the region to try to prevent a wider war. President Joe Biden says that while taking out Hamas extremists is necessary, he cautions Israel that a prolonged occupation of Gaza would be \"a big mistake.\" About half a million Palestinians have heeded Israel's warning to leave their homes in Northern Gaza and head south, but life's most basic necessities are dwindling fast. The Palestinian Authority has warned Gaza's people face a real famine, while also condemning the killing of civilians on both sides. As we said, 1,400 were killed inside Israel by Hamas, and at least 2,800 Palestinians have been killed in nine days of Israeli airstrikes. Blinken also hopes to secure at least a temporary opening of the Rafah Border Crossing to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid in and foreign nationals out of Gaza. Ibrahim Dahman is a CNN journalist inside Gaza, and he had to evacuate his own home in the face of these airstrikes. Here's his firsthand report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IBRAHIM DAHMAN, CNN JOURNALIST (through translator): I'm with my family fleeing airstrikes in Gaza. My son is terrified. I tell him, don't be afraid, son. But the truth is I'm afraid too. My name is Ibrahim Dahman and I am a CNN journalist. For years, I have covered the stories of people in Gaza. I never thought that I would become part of the story. Last week, I was in Gaza City when I was told to evacuate. I don't know where to go. Where? But where do I go? My home, my family and my life are here. Like so many others, I don't have anywhere else to go. We reach a nearby hotel. There are journalists, families and people on their own. We're not among the displaced, 1.1 million people told to evacuate Northern Gaza.",

Lynn Hastings is the United Nations Resident Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Deputy Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process.

I don't know whether you were able to see that report from our colleague, local colleague inside Gaza. But it does seem that it's very, very difficult even to heed Israel's warnings to leave the most dangerous areas. LYNN HASTINGS, U.N. HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORY AND U.N. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, MIDDLE EAST, PEACE PROCESS: Absolutely. It is extremely difficult to tell 1 million people to leave their homes to leave hospitals from the north of Gaza and to go south when most people have no fuel, if they have cars. And of course, a lot of the roads have already been destroyed. So, absolutely impossible to evacuate hospitals and for people to move that quickly.",

You know, of course, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. last month said Abbas \"is no partner for peace.\" And they've said that -- why would an Israeli government or prime minister \"prefer to deal with Hamas than the PA,\" which is internationally recognized?",

I do not think -- I do agree that Netanyahu does not want Palestinians to be unified. For him, it's easier to say it, if Palestinian Authority goes to unity with Hamas and have democratic elections, he says that Palestinian unit -- Palestinian government is dealing with terrorists.

They're too divided as a party. They can only afford to lose four Republicans at any given moment. And so, basically, what they did is they took one of the weakest speakers that I can ever remember, Kevin McCarthy. Remember, it took him 15 rounds of voting back in January to get the job.

My first job out of college for eight years was working at \"Roll Call Newspaper.\" And one thing I will tell you is that every time there is a crisis on Capitol Hill, whether it's a threatened government shutdown or a leadership fight, there's always the specter of these mythical sort of centrist, the -- you know, the bipartisan coalition that's going to come and rise to the rescue and save the day. And in my experience, that almost never -- basically, never happens. In fact, there's a reason that the middle of the road members are in the middle of the road. Generally speaking, we've become in a situation where that is even more true in our politics, that the highly mobilized extremes in either party have tended to dominate outcomes in recent years. They have the television advantage, right? You know, they're promoted in say right- wing media. They have a fundraising advantage by playing to and arousing the sympathies of the party's base. And generally speaking, it's not a situation where you can have the kind of middle of the rotors and the moderates, if you will, come and ride to the rescue. But they do have the numbers. This is a very close call and it's unprecedented. I think people may not realize it's not just another example of kind of dysfunction on Capitol Hill, this is actually never happened before in the entire history of the United States.

And, you know, it's kind of the Senate analog to eight members in the House being able to get rid of a speaker, even though the vast majority of Republicans wanted Kevin McCarthy to remain a speaker now in this in the Senate, talk about minority rule, one senator has been able to stop senior appointments from getting through. I mean, so senior, the leaders of the Armed Services, the different branches. The Armed Services have been caught up in this blockade. Many generals have been caught up in this blockade. Commanders in key regions have been caught up. And essentially, it's a one-man protest that is somewhat obscure. He says that he is against the Pentagon and the Defense Department reimbursing service members who need to travel to a different state to obtain an abortion. Now, the Pentagon does not pay for the abortions of service members. So, it's not even that they would be paying for abortions. This is a policy that would apply really to very few people that would involve simply reimbursing the travel for service members, and that's what this blockade is about. There's a big finger pointing in the Senate between the different leaders. Basically, Democrats run the Senate. They have the majority, but they say it's up to the Republican minority, it's up to Mitch McConnell to get his own members in line. There's a reluctance in both parties to change the rules. Of course, they could do that, and simply ram through these nominations anyways. They don't want to do that because the individual senators, of course, want to maintain their own ability in the future to have this kind of protest.

But actually, what you're seeing is the increasing nationalization of our politics. Donald Trump made a very controversial decision to jump in and to endorse the candidacy of Jim Jordan for speaker. Jordan, as I mentioned before, has become -- Jordan has been one of Donald Trump's staunchest allies internally on Capitol Hill for years, going back to when Trump was president. There was always Jordan there. When it came to Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and his effort to overturn that election on January 6, 2021, Jim Jordan was one of his closest lieutenants on Capitol Hill, intimately involved in strategy with then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Donald Trump talking about how to raise the objections to Joe Biden's victory on January 6, 2021. So, Jordan this -- in a way, was payback for his loyalty to Donald Trump over the years, but it's very controversial. And what did it say about Trump's power and popularity as a would-be presidential nominee that the majority of House Republicans did not vote for Donald Trump's candidate when they had the election last week, they voted for Steve Scalise over Jim Jordan. And yes, once again, you find this party sort of taken hostage by hyper empowered Trumpist minorities. The Trump faction in the House of Representatives is not the majority of the House of Representatives in the sense that they were willing to vote against Trump's choice for speaker. And yet, somehow, Jordan has sort of taken a page from Donald Trump's playbook and is sort of doing the sore loser thing and turning that into you ought to vote for me because I'm willing to keep going when the others are not.",

They're not serious about doing the business of government. They are essentially engaged in a kind of performative race to the extremes. And it would -- it seems to me that this ongoing fight over the speakership, their willingness literally to leave the speakership open is an example of the kind of dysfunction and Republican disarray that Democrats have been talking about for a number of years, and combine that with their critique of Donald Trump who is running away, it appears, with the 2024 Republican presidential nomination despite, you know, the chaos of the time when he was president, despite the four different pending criminal indictments against him.
