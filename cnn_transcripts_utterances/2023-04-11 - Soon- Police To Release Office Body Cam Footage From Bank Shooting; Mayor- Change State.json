      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake. So under Kentucky law, whenever police confiscate a weapon, if it's not retained for what they call official purposes, the law says that it shall be auctioned off. Not that it may be auctioned off, it shall be auctioned off.And it's important note that the spirit of that law was likely intended for a positive purpose, and that was generating revenue. The law states that funds from those auctions sales will go to purchase police supplies, purchase service animals, increased safety at school. But of course, the big question here is after a mass shooting, under the state law, you -- that law is now being required to be auctioned off. And so, as the mayor pointed out there, it could end up in the hands of someone else. So that is obviously something that that lawmakers there will be taking a look at. Let's look at some of the other laws in the state of Kentucky. Of course, after these mass shootings, the big question comes, how did the shooter get access to the weapons? It's important to note that there are quite lax gun laws in the state of Kentucky. It is a strong gun rights state. Under the state law, there is no requirement of a universal background check before you get a weapon. There are no so- called red flag laws. So even if someone in the shooter's orbit, had concerns and wanted to petition a judge to have a firearm taken away, in that state, that's not on the books. And there's also no permit to require the carrying of a firearm. It's important to note, I'll have you listen here to our colleague Jennifer Mascia on the CNN guns beat (ph). She points out that when that permit law was rescinded back in 2019, lawmakers also got rid of a requirement that would have made gun owners show that they're actually proficient with the weapon and how to operate it safely.

We'll have to wait and see whether lawmakers in Kentucky actually move forward on any types of reforms and changing some of these laws.",

They very frequently want to die during this incident, and perhaps one of the ways we can look at prevention of these particular types of shootings, not all gun violence, of course, but these particular types is really to look at the same methods we would use to prevent suicides because you're trying to off ramp somebody from doing something like this, just like you would try to offer him somebody from taking their own life.",

There was a moment where they all head under umbrellas so that the police helicopters flying overhead and police drones couldn't spy on them. Today, the police went in that cemetery and in that same area where those young men were hiding, they found four pipe bombs today. The police believe these would have been used against the police.

You mentioned Joe Kennedy, who's here is the special envoy to Northern Ireland specifically on economic issues.

The judge, as you said, ruled that Fox or the Dominion cannot bring up the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol the judge saying that this maybe for another court at another time, but it's not for this court at this time.That said, Jake, that judge did rule in favor for Dominion on a number of issues, the judge ruling that they can bring up financial information that they found in discovery as it relates to Fox or compensation, for instance, they can bring that up . He says economics are irrelevant, and he also talks about how Fox cannot bring up some of the broadcast they aired in which they fact check some of Dominions or some of Trump's election lies. He says, that's not relevant to the case at hand here because you can't absolve yourself, he says from defamation by putting someone on a different time. So, some victories for Dominion, some for Fox. Again, like you said this jury selection starting on Thursday, and the trial will go on on Monday with opening arguments, unless a settlement can somehow be reached between the two parties.",
