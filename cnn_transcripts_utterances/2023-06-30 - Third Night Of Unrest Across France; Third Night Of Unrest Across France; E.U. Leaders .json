Racialized groups in France, ethnic minorities, communities of color.We'll talk about the fact that it is precisely their visibility as ethnic minorities, as communities of color that leads to them being targeted by the police and racially profiled. So as much as liberty, equality and fraternity are the cornerstones of this French Republic, observers will point out and individuals through their experiences that there is a deficit with the equality pillar in those ideals and that these communities feel that they are permanently characterized as being somehow second-class citizens whose adherence and to Frenchness is somehow always under suspicion.

And his greatest fear is not so much that urban violence continues to escalate that that the urban violence around this particular issue ends up kind of galvanizing the very significant opposition in France around just about anything that he goes about proposing to Parliament. So, it makes it undermines his presidency or rather further undermines it. And I think also makes it increasingly difficult for his government to be able to legislate and push his agenda forward.
