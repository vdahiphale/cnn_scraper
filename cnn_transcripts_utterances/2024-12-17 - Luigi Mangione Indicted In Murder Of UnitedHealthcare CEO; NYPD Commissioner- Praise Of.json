You heard the DA speak about it, saying that they're going to have a jury selection process, but certainly this is going to come up in that jury selection process.The jurors will be chosen from here in Manhattan, which is a large area. So you will get a diverse juror. But it's going to be very hard to find someone who hasn't heard of this case and who doesn't have any kind of feeling towards this case. The good thing is, you know, we could be a year or so away from trial. So, perhaps the time and distance from when this happened will help that jury selection process.

He is also known as Abu Hamza (ph). He was known to run Air Force Intelligence checkpoints in the city of Homs. He's accused of extorting and harassing people. And we have now been able to corroborate the information those residents gave us with a photograph of Salama. And it's clear that far from being an ordinary guy as he presented himself to be, he was a part of Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime who somehow found himself in prison. We don't know why he was arrested. The fact checking website verify as why. Has said that he was held in the prison where we found him for one month because of some kind of a disagreement over profit sharing of extorted funds with a higher ranking officer. That lines up with what we've been told. But CNN cannot confirm that. We are continuing to dig, obviously, and as of this moment, we have not been able to contact Salama himself.",

And this industrial scale detention of opponents. But this clearly shows it wasn't just opponents who were incarcerated and it wasn't only opponents who fell afoul of the regime. Also important to note, we visited three separate detention facilities while were in Damascus. In all of them, we found vast amounts of documentation, largely unprotected people sifting through it. Much of it was destroyed or burned by the regime as they fled. But there are still huge troves remaining and it's going to take a long time to go through them and get clear answers.",

One needs to be elected president or in this case, reelected. As Donald Trump clinches the presidency, he is still fighting legal battles.New York Judge Juan Merchan is refusing to throw out Trump's conviction over the hush money cover up payments to Stormy Daniels. Merchan ruled Monday that Trump's conviction should not be tossed out despite the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity. Merchan writing, quote, if the act of falsifying records to cover up the payments so that the public would not be made aware is decidedly an unofficial act, so too should the communications to further that same cover up be unofficial. Trump railed against the ruling today. He called Merchan a radical partisan and responded to the decision on his social media site, Truth Social, quote, if allowed to stand, would be the end of the presidency as we know it, unquote. Let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell, and former New York State Supreme Court Justice Jill Khan Visor. Kara, we're just over a month until Trump's inauguration.

And they have said that because of the level felony that Trump was convicted of and his age, it's not required that the judge sentence him to prison.It seems the DA's office wants to try to lock in this conviction, which of course, Trump will try to appeal. Now, if the judge does set a sentencing date, though, I think we can expect Trump's attorneys to try to get a judge either in New York or all the way up to the Supreme Court to stay that sentencing and put it on hold so that Trump is not sentenced before he enters the White House.",

The United States Supreme Court said core constitutional powers are entitled. The defendant in this case, the president, is entitled to complete immunity.They then said there are other things that might just be outside the perimeter of that with which is a core constitutional situation, that there should be a presumption of immunity. And finally, they did say that anything that is unofficial is not immune. And the judge found clearly in a 41-page decision that none of these acts were in fact official and therefore the case should not be dismissed and the 34- count indictment should stand. Keep in mind, though, that he also said in that decision that even if some of the evidence that was used to support that conviction was received in evidence at the trial. Well, in that instance, even if that happened and even if those were partially official acts and perhaps entitled to a presumption, in that situation, it was still harmless. Harmless era is a doctrine well rooted in New York law. And it wouldn't make a difference. And he denied the case. Certainly he was well within his rights to do that.

It refers to low quality, low value content on social media and the state of your brain from constant doom scrolling. But is brain rot real? Here now is CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, can binge watching viral videos and reading nasty tweets really rot our brains?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the -- the -- the short answer is -- is yes. I mean it can change your brain. There have been some recent studies on this. It's -- it's interesting and we've known for some time that the -- the sort of doom scrolling or whatever you call it more than three hours being on social media for teens is associated with doubling depression risk. So that's obviously concerning. The average amount of time people are spending, teens are spending on social media is five hours. Just three hours can double your risk of depression. But what's more interesting, I think, lately is -- is this fact that they've measured these changes that occur in the brain. So, for example, the outer part of your brain called the cortex, the gray matter that can thin in response to a lot of social media use, or just the scrolling constantly, that can affect your cognition. But also the -- the area in between the gray matter is called the white matter, and that can also be affected, and that can slow down your speed of processing. So scientists are starting to get a better idea of -- of sort of this brain fog thing that people describe and finding out what is happening in your brain, what sort of causes that. And those are two things that might be sort of being attributed to that.",

One is this idea that if you've watched five videos of the same thing, you're more likely to watch another one as opposed to just watching one.So if they get you going, two or three of them, how much you watch is going to make a big difference. How similar is the content? They actually want to give you very similar content to keep you going on this. It's really interesting when you dig into the algorithms and even where you're watching the content or consuming the content, if you're doing it in a place where you're not as distracted, that's going to keep you down the rabbit hole longer as well.",
