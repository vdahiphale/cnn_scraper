Here the district attorney, Fani Willis, has made a choice to structure this as a RICO prosecution. As you noted in the intro, RICO is most commonly associated with the mob. It's a law that was designed to dismantle organized crime. So, it allows you to charge a group of people with certain crimes, even if not every person, in this case not every one of the 19 defendants, participated in every one of the crimes. Now, in the indictment at the top she lays out how they allegedly engaged in this conspiracy. For example, she alleges that as part of this conspiracy this group lied to state officials, state lawmakers. She also alleges that they tried to install slates of fake electors. This was part of an effort to subvert the Electoral College process in favor of Trump. She also alleges they tried to harass at least one election worker. Also she alleges the Justice Department, they were putting a lot of pressure on that organization to try to help Trump to overturn the results of the election. As we've reported extensively, the vice president also facing a pressure campaign. She also alleges they tried to breach voting machines in rural Georgia, and then cover it all up. So, Kate, by far this is the most broad-sweeping indictment ever brought by a local prosecutor. And, of course, the former president, he has denied any wrongdoing.",

If you can do that, the benefits accrue.So, first thing you have to prove is the existence of what we call a criminal enterprise. Traditionally it would be an organized crime, mafia family, a drug trafficking organization. But, as here, can be applied to a large, corrupt, political organization. And the indictment makes very clear Donald Trump was at the head of that criminal enterprise. If you picture one of those hierarchy charts, he would be up top. The other thing you have to prove is what we call a pattern of racketeering activity. Meaning, two or more acts designed to further that enterprise. Here, Georgia prosecutors allege a mere 161 acts. Now, each of these acts on its own does not have to be a crime. Some of the acts are put a - post up on Twitter, for example. Not a crime. But the point is, they further the illegal purpose of the enterprise. The illegal purpose here was to steal the 2020 election. A really important point. Under Georgia law - Georgia RICO law is actually tougher than the federal law I used to charge, because if someone gets convicted under RICO in Georgia, five years mandatory minimum behind bars.

He is charged here, but in a fairly limited capacity. He's charged in the RICO. He's also charged for that call to Raffensperger. The lawyers, eight lawyers, charged in one state. These five, by the way, are the five co-conspirators from the Jack Smith indictment. But a lot of this ran through and was blessed by and designed by the lawyers. Jeffrey Clark, it's worth noting, is a DOJ -- was a DOJ official. Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani also were former federal prosecutors. That's kind of shocking to see. And then let's not forget the fake electors, the campaign officials, the locals. The thing to keep in mind, John, here, 19 co-defendants.

And based on what the lawyers says, this thing may never go to trial before people cast their votes, either in the Republican primary or even in the November 2024 election.So, he has every right to counter message it. I think most of his supporters want him to counter message it. I would just say this, if I were a strategic thinking Republican voter, I might ask myself, do I want the election next year to be a referendum on Donald Trump's claims about the 2020 election, or the state of America under Joe Biden.

This is - you've never seen it before, but this is the campaign. Donald Trump presenting himself as some kind of a victim, some kind of a martyr, when the actual - the victims and the martyrs are people like Ms. Freeman who was just trying to do her job helping her neighbors vote and have her life destroyed. And I'm glad that we have a prosecutor in Georgia who's willing to stick up for people like Ms. Freeman. The true defenders of democracy are the ordinary people who stood in long lines to vote, they're the everyday people who listen to podcasts and got educated on issues and did the best they could to participate and almost had their votes nullified by this criminal conspiracy.

Of course this becomes white noise. And I think in a lot of people's minds it's all just part of the same trap. They laid a trap for Trump.
