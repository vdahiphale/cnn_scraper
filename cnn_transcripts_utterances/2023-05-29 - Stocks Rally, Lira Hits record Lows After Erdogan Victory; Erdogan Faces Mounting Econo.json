That policy was a major factor in a currency crisis in 2021, which sent annual inflation to a peak of 85.5 percent last year. It is now cooling, but still around 43 percent. During the campaign, Erdogan gave no indication he plans to change his economic policies. Let's listen to what he said in his victory speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): It was caused by the price increases as a result of inflation and compensating for welfare losses is the most urgent issue of the process ahead. It is not difficult for us to find a solution to these issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Itis bobbing around 20, so it's lost maybe two lira in the last couple of weeks and this is an indication that they expect high budget deficits, the market is expecting a continued increased level of borrowing for the foreseeable future, and that the economy is going to weaken. That's the fundamental point here, Zain. We can dress it up any which way, backwards and upside down, but the economy stands to weaken if they continue to have inflation running at 40 percent. And by the way, food inflation is well over 65 to 70 percent. So the issue now becomes how does he get inflation down if he is going to use his unorthodox methods, which he's been using for some time, and haven't really worked? Certainly, they are not going to work like anything he expects. I don't know the answer to that, but what I can think and can see is that there is going to be -- he is going to put forward some sort of mini boom, it'll make people feel better. You saw that in the stock market today. The rally there is because you're going to get more government spending, you're going to get policies on taxes, that's going to perhaps put more money in people's pockets, which, of course, Zain will raise inflation even further. It is -- I never want to be disrespectful, but it is a bit like being in economics \"Alice in Wonderland\" to hear the economic policies and realize what the reality is.",

But the overall impact of that was not expected. That was the big surprise on Sunday. If there was a surprise in the announcement on Monday from him, the surprise on Sunday was that the polls had said the conservatives were going to do well in those elections, but not as well as they did. They ousted socialist leaders from city halls and regional governments in places that the socialists usually win. So now, the leader of the conservative popular party or People's Party, as it's also called, has called on Spaniards to finish the job and get the socialists out of the national government. In the background, importantly, Zain is Spain's far-right party VOX, which doubled the number of its votes in the local elections on Sunday compared to four years ago and got congratulations this day, from far-right leaders, well-known far-right leaders in Italy and in France. There are reports that the far right is trying to negotiate some governing deals now with the main conservative party. So a political analyst tells CNN, that Sanchez's move here is possibly to motivate and let progressive voters know in particular that the far-right is about to get a lot more power in Spain, this anti-immigrant party that's against all their progressive values to try to get them to get out and vote in July and save him and save the socialists and keep them in power.

If that panel approves it, a full House vote could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Senate would need to approve it next. Congress doesn't allow more borrowing and the US Treasury could run out of money next week. CNN's national politics reporter, Eva McKend joins us live now from Washington, DC. So Eva, good to see you. How hard do you think it is going to be at this point for the White House to really gather support from progressives, especially given that this bill essentially reinstates student loan payments, and then also the work requirements for entitlement programs are a problem as well for certain progressives, how hard is it going to be?",

That was one of the first texts I got actually from a chief-of-staff of a prominent progressive member who didn't even realize because the president had been saying that he wasn't going to negotiate. So I think progressives are kind of just having whiplash right now trying to come to terms with the fact that work requirements were even on the table. That is a really hard sell for Democrats. Other things that are in this deal in addition to lifting the debt ceiling for the next two years, cap spending at two years, there are no cuts to military or veterans benefits, but it does claw back $29 billion in unspent COVID funds. So all of the federal dollars that were pumped into the states, pumped into the economy during the pandemic, Republicans have been really eager to claw back some of that money that went unused and that is part of this deal. But the work requirements, Zain, that is really the source of stress, I think, among the left, and we know that the White House is actively making calls to progressives to try to convince them to support this and essentially saying, consider the alternative, consider going into default.",

So there are benefits in terms of the costs. You create a digital twin, you use AI to generate a completely unique image according to whatever you want. And in that terms, it's also unrestricted. Imagine, you can have a car as you saw, I think there in the video driving across the desert. It would be just as easy for AI to put that car on the moon. You are completely unbounded. And then you're right, as the whole personalization issue and I think in the future, you and I will probably see completely different adverts. It won't just be as simple ads, you'll see a car, and it's driving around in New York, and I'll see one driving around Trafalgar Square, I think it'll take the data that it already knows about us through all these platforms and will probably make it really targeted. So they'll know what it is that I like, who I hang out with, where I like to go, what inspires me. We might see something totally different for the same car in probably just a few months or years' time. So there's that. The downside to all of this, and we talk about this a lot is the issue of jobs, because surely if it's going to have huge cost savings, it's also going to reduce the amount of human labor that is required to make some of these campaigns. That is a fact. It's also a fact that it's not just creative and advertising industries that are being hit here, also actually computer engineering and coding, all of these things can also be done or helped with ChatGPT and the other generative AI systems out there. It was interesting though, the CEO of WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency that is striking this deal, Mike Read was speaking to the FT, and he said, it is much easier to identify the jobs that AI will disrupt than it is to identify the jobs that AI will create and that's the good news there.
