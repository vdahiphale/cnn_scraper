You may recall American officials telling Americans on the ground in Gaza some two weeks ago to go to the Rafah Border Crossing in hopes that it actually might open. That never happened. People have been waiting under some pretty desperate conditions ever since.So this would be monumental. The question is how many will ultimately get let out beyond today, and whether or not this is a sign of things to come, and whether everyone will be allowed to go. We are also seeing ambulances at the border. We have those pictures there. These are ambulances waiting on the Egyptian side ready to take about 80 or 81 patients from Palestinian hospitals -- people who need surgery that cannot be performed in Gaza -- to a field hospital just inside the border with Egypt. This would mark the first Palestinians who are able to leave Gaza since this conflict began. And again, the question is: is this a sign of things to come or is this a one-off?",

Stephen, thank you very much for being here. He is -- the House Speaker is basically saying not only is he going to separate Israel and Ukraine aid from each other, which is something that Democrats and the White House think means it's less likely that Ukraine will get funded the way they would like to see it funded, but he also is putting spending cuts related to the IRS -- basically, these very right-wing conservative priorities into something that historically would really just go by itself because the recognition would be hey, we urgently need to aid Israel.

McConnell favors President Joe Biden's approach of putting them all together. I think this is really interesting because you never get to see a new political leader almost creating his public persona and the foundation of his power from scratch. Normally, if it's a new president, we've seen them for two years on the campaign trail. Anyone that comes into high leadership in the Senate or the House has generally been in the public eye for years.

And that gulf of experience there between McConnell, who has been in Senate leadership for years, let alone all of his years in Congress, and Johnson, who is just starting out, is pretty interesting. And it does lay bare these splits in the Republican Party between the old establishment Republicans like McConnell and Johnson, who comes from this pro-Trump far-right wing of the House for whom McConnell is very unpopular.But at the end of the day, the dynamics of Washington are clear. What can come out of a Democratic House -- a Democratic Senate and will be accepted by a Democratic White House is going to be very different from what comes out of a Republican House. And perhaps having made an initial stand, Johnson has built the political capacity to then roll back and take these pay-fors out of the Israel package and it will pass the House quite easily and he will have made a political stand that will help him with his own flank as he goes forward. But ultimately, he still has to get bills through the House that can pass the Senate and will be accepted by President Joe Biden. That was the same conundrum that led to the fall of Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago. HUNT:  Yeah, it's absolutely right.

Don Jr. and Eric Trump are senior Trump Organization executives and also defendants in the case. The New York attorney general accuses them of fraudulently inflating the value of Trump's properties. Don Jr. is expected to take the stand today. Eric is scheduled for tomorrow. And their sister, Ivanka, set for next week. Their father not expected to be in court for their testimony. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning. It's always good to see you. What kind of questions do we expect Don Jr. to face today? And it's kind of interesting to me that Dad's not going to be there even though he's made a point of sitting down in that front row for a number of days of this trial. JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, I guess the optics are of concern. Good morning to you, Kasie. So there's a lot to unpack as it relates to the children and what they knew. And obviously, if you get the children, you want to know what they did in the company, when they did it, and what their specific roles were as it related to really directing others to do the bidding and the business of the company. Who they were working with. What relationship they had with the chief executive of the business. What strings they were pulling. What applications they were involved. Really, the essence of how closely were they tied with what was going on. Sometimes Kasie, in these -- in these cases, you see an executive perhaps or people who are vice presidents even, right, who may be disengaged and may leave things to subordinates to get things done. I think here the attorney general will really tie in to the extent of saying and arguing that this was a family conspiracy. They knew they were filing false statements. They knew they were -- they were inflating values of properties. They knew they were evading, really, their financial obligations and responsibilities. And so, I think the essence of the testimony will be to determine what level of involvement they had, who they were involved with, and the extent to which they were orchestrating collectively and getting information collectively in order to carry out what, in essence, the attorney general claims is a fraud. And so, expect to hear a lot of information concerning the management and the ongoing dealings that he's had with the company.",

Mike, thank you so much for being up early, especially after Halloween night with little kids. But I loved your story. And this obviously has been something that the Ron DeSantis campaign has also, in the kind of last minutes of the Republican primary, really started to focus in on. What do you think the effect of that is going to be? MICHAEL BENDER, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Skype):  Well, I think the effect here is going to be or could be pretty harmful for Trump. One of the new things in our article is we looked at some polling questions that a lot of pollsters are asking now. Do you think Trump is too old to run for office? And then the second question: Do you think Biden is too old to run for office? Now, about two of every three voters say Biden is too old, and about half of America thinks Trump is too old. What we asked the pollsters to do was to look at the number of people who said both people -- both candidates are too old. And that is a pretty stunning 40 percent of the country. And to dive just a little bit deeper with me here, in that 40 percent, Biden is winning about 60 percent of those voters. Now, I will say Democrats are much more likely to acknowledge their candidate's age than Republicans are willing to acknowledge an issue with their candidate. But that wide gap -- what that shows is that if more people start to think Trump is too old, which these kind of gaffes and verbal slips could do, Trump could really pay a price in a head-to-head matchup with Biden.",
