      "sentences": "Good morning. Thank you for getting up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt.The big story at the bottom of the hour -- Kim Jung Un's armored train now over the border and inside Russia, according to Russian state media. The North Korean leader is set to meet with Vladimir Putin. The U.S. is warning that the two nations could make an arms deal. And the Biden administration says it has advanced a deal to free five Americans who are being held in Iran. The latest move involves freeing up restricted Iranian funds. The State Department insists the money can only be used for Iran to buy humanitarian goods. And the House is back in session today. Speaker Kevin McCarthy must confront twin challenges -- avoiding a government shutdown and addressing calls on the right to impeach President Biden despite resistance from party moderates. Let's get right to it. Joining us now is Margaret Talev. She is a senior contributor at Axios, and the director of Syracuse University's Democracy, Journalism, and Citizenship Institute. And, of course, a longtime reporter in this town. Margaret, you've seen so much here. You've seen so many speakers of the House. I can't even tell you how many government shutdowns we've now covered. That used to be so incredibly rare. But let's start there. Speaker McCarthy -- everybody's back in town today. The House comes in late. They vote later tonight. And Speaker McCarthy has to figure out how to thread this needle and potentially avoid a shutdown. He's squashed -- squished between, on the one hand, the conservatives in his conference and potentially, the threats the moderates are facing to their own reelection chances. How do you see the landscape here and what happens next?",

      "sentences": "Correct, Kasie. You've laid it out exactly right.I mean, could Speaker McCarthy cut a deal with Democrats to avert a government shutdown? Sure, but he's got four votes inside his own conference holding him back from the brink of losing his speakership. And under the deal that he negotiated to become speaker, just one member of his conference -- of his conference can force that vote, right? So it's a really difficult path to tow. And because we're heading into an election year, aside from all, like sort of practicalities of a government shutdown, there is the question of who would get blamed heading into an election year if there was a government shutdown. McCarthy and most Republicans who have been in power for a long time or are in the Senate say they would get blamed for it. So he's hoping to avert that and that creates a pretty tricky landscape. Impeachment is the one sort of political lever that he has, potentially, to appease that right flank of the caucus. And we're talking here about the potential impeachment or at least an impeachment inquiry being opened into President Joe Biden. What has Joe Biden done to deserve impeachment? That's another question.",

It's a conversative state but the district she represents is an interesting one in the Charleston area. And she sort of struck out as somebody who occasionally is on the moderate -- the moderate side of things.She was on CNN last night talking about the challenges for moderates in her conference. Take a look at what she had to say and we'll talk about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  An inquiry is an investigative tool. It's different from an impeachment. On the impeachment side, the House would investigate and the Senate would essentially hold a trial. But no -- I mean, the Senate is not going to hold a trial. There's not going to be 60 votes. It's not happening. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Is the goal of an impeachment inquiry to unearth evidence that would lead to someone's impeachment or is the goal of the impeachment inquiry to blunt the actual four criminal cases and 91 counts against the former president from the other party who was, by the way, impeached a couple of times and not convicted?So there is a political goal here. And that is also part of what's driving the right flank is pressure from Trump, who is calling for this and saying that any good Republican would proceed on that front. Just a couple of other numbers to throw out there. Forty billion dollars -- that's the extra amount that the White House is asking for. And this is a combination of Ukraine assistance, military and humanitarian. And another $12 billion or so for federal disaster relief, for money at the border to deal with fentanyl. That disaster relief goes into Republican districts. So there's actually -- there are a lot of complicated levers here. The other final number I'd raise for you Kasie is the polling because right now, there is some polling that's Democratic-commissioned and Democrats are floating around. But there's also polling from Fox and from Ipsos. And all of these polls in recent weeks show that something like a third of non-affiliated or Independent voters think that Biden's done anything that would warrant an impeachment inquiry at this point. Like, a third is probably not the number you want to take in there with you if you are a Republican --",

      "sentences": "All right, let's take a quick look at where some of the legal cases against Donald Trump stand right now because we've got some development.We're going to start with the election subversion charges in Georgia. The former president asking a court to dismiss several of the charges -- unsurprising. He's also indicated that he might ask for the case to be moved to federal court -- another maneuver. Trump also asking the judge in the federal election subversion case against him to recuse herself. The former president claiming that Judge Tanya Chutkan's previous comments about January 6 rioters suggests that she has quote \"prejudged\" Trump's culpability. And Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows urging a federal appeals court to hurry up and step in after his attempt to get his Georgia case moved to federal court was rejected. Meadows' attorneys said that the court could order the Fulton County D.A. to stop prosecuting him while the appeal plays out. All right. With me now, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Sir, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thank you for getting up early with us. Let's start in Georgia. Trump is asking the judge to dismiss several charges there. I mean, this feels to me like he's just going through the motions. That they're going to put anything up there to try and kind of throw sand in the gears. What's your view as the lawyer here on this early morning panel? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Good morning to you, Kasie. My view is not dissimilar to yours. Now, what happens is that it's widely obviously expected and anticipated that this would be done. What is this? Lawyers -- defense attorneys, like myself, file motions aplenty as they relate to pretrial proceedings. You file motions to attack the legal sufficiency of the indictment. You file motions to preserve and protect your client's rights. And so, let's, of course, Kasie, remind viewers that this was a one- page motion, which essentially adopted the arguments of his co- defendants. That's also not new, right? You have 19 people on trial. The attorneys generally speak with each other and they'll determine, right, what they're going to do and they will piggyback off each other in that regard. And so, certainly, in this motion, I do not anticipate or expect that the judge will dismiss the case at all, but you need to do that to preserve your right to appeal. If you don't attack the indictment at all based on First Amendment grounds and people have a right to speak, and this wasn't really a conspiracy and people didn't know each other, then you certainly put yourself or your client in peril because you're not preserving their rights. So, no, I don't see anything fresh or new in the one-page motion that adopts the motion of his co-defendants. And this is largely a procedural measure used by attorneys to preserve their client's rights in moving forward to go to trial in the event of a conviction.",

I mean, these were -- this motion was an effort based upon -- to seize upon comments that were made by Judge Chutkan, who has been very involved with respect to other defendants on January 6 and what their activities were. So as a result of that, Kasie, from the bench she expressed some points of view as it related to sentencing them.And so, they seized upon, right -- Trump's attorneys did to say hey, you're unfair. Your impartiality is brought into question and as a result of that, you can't be here. You should recuse yourself. The problem is that although the law itself says the judge -- they should avoid the appearance of impropriety and a result of that you should recuse, the standard is very high. If you have some deep-seated antagonism, says the Supreme Court in a 1994 case -- such that you should disqualify -- you should be disqualified. And I don't --",
