Max is the author of the new book, \"Reagan: His Life and Legend.\" Welcome to you all. Max, let's start with you. And as both leaders head eventually to this working lunch, talk to me about, you know, how you would characterize Biden and Macron's relationship. Obviously, there are political calculations at play as well. And in the back or I should say front of Macron's mind, he has to be thinking about the potential return of Trump to the White House?",

And as you say, I think Macron is very happy to have Joe Biden in the White House rather than having to deal with placating Donald Trump.But I think the, you know, the anecdote that Joe Biden often tells us how that when he first came back into office and met with Macron, and he said, you know, America is back and Macron and others said, but for how long? And I think that's the shadow of Trump hangs over all of this. And of course, but even though Biden and Trump and Macron do have a good relationship, they do have a lot of things to discuss, including Macron's proposal to send French trainers into Ukraine or is suggesting that they could be sent into Ukraine, which is something that Biden has expressed doubts about or suggested is not a good idea. So, I think there are things for them to hash over, but mainly, I think this is just a wonderful moment of transatlantic unity to highlight how close the alliance is under Biden and how greatly endangered it would be if Trump were to come back into office.",

There was the IDF operation that happened at a refugee camp that freed four Israeli hostages. Some of the concerns here around the ICC seeking an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. While Paris backs that, Washington called it outrageous, the backing and supplying of weapons. How significant are these differences on Gaza, on support for Israel between these two?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I'll chime in with what Max just said, Victor, and that is they are certainly -- there is certainly a close relationship between President Biden and President Macron, but they do have some differences. President Macron has been very vocal in making pronouncements about different things. He has supported different things than President Biden has. So, you know, while their relationship is very close and they see democracy, and the emotions of what has occurred over this last week as being similar, they do have some differences of opinion. And I heard you earlier talking about the lunches and the dinners that will occur today, certainly, presidents and dignitaries do a lot of eating and drinking for their country, but this is a time for them to hash out some of those disagreements, some of those differences of opinions. I think President Biden is going to state very succinctly what he believes should be happening in Gaza and in Ukraine and how the NATO alliance should move forward. So, that's what these dinners and lunches are all about, outside the view of the kind of pomp and circumstances we saw this morning at the Arc de Triomphe.",

As Mark Hertling mentioned, there's going to be a lot of lunches, a lot of dinners, a lot of, you know, ceremonial occasions. But while all that is going on, they can also have very substantive talks. And of course, some of the stuff they're going to talk about is going to be the kind of stuff anybody talks about at lunch or dinner. It's going to be, there's going to be some polite chitchat, but I think they will also get to some of the nitty gritty and try to hash these things out. But I think, you know, I think the big thing that Macron and other Europeans are going to be looking for is something that Biden really can't offer, which is reassurance. They want reassurance that the United States will stay committed in Europe, that we will remain committed to the defense of Europe. We will remain staunch and standing up for Ukraine and opposing Russian aggression. And, of course, the best that Biden can say is that's what I want to do. But I don't -- you know, we have free and fair elections in America. And if, if I, Joe Biden, lose in November, everybody knows that they could have, we could have a very different policy come January 20th of next year. And so, you know, I think there is just, there's going to be a lot of handholding as well as a lot of hand wringing about the outcome of the political process in the United States.",

It was a significant operation which at this point we understand has left at least 45 killed on the ground and hundreds injured according to our CNN producer on the ground.But what it has also meant is that four Israeli hostages have been rescued and they have been brought back to Israel. Now, according to this statement, they say that they are in good medical condition. They have been taken to a medical center near Tel Aviv to receive treatment. At this point, we have already seen video of one of the hostages that you just mentioned there, Noa Argamani, receiving a phone call from the Israeli President Herzog. But there are four that have been released. So, Noa Argamani, who, as we remember we did see her on the back of a motorbike being taken at the Nova Musical Festival on October 7th. Also, Andrei Kozlov, a 27- year-old, he's a Russian-Israeli citizen, who was working security at that musical festival. Also, Shlomi Siv, a 40-year-old, he was also working security, and Almog Meir Jan, a 21-year-old. So, four hostages have been released at this point. We understand from the IDF that they are all in medical condition. This was Saturday morning that this was happening, and it was described by the IDF, the police, and the ISA as a complex special daytime operation in Nuseirat. It is the third successful operation that the Israeli military has carried out since October 7th to try and retrieve some of those, those hostages that were taken on October 7th by Hamas, by other militant groups. We understand there was one in October, one in February, three released jointly during those operations there. But that's the latest that we have at this point from the Israeli military side.",

There were -- the other thing I'd comment on, the hostages were near the Nuseirat refugee camp, which is in northwestern -- more the center part of Gaza, while the operations in Rafah continue, you -- this makes it very clear that operations across the Gaza Strip, in these, specifically the underground subterranean facilities, the tunnels that Hamas has built underneath different infrastructure is what's been critical. So, yes, the intelligence is what drove this, I'm sure. This wasn't just stumbling upon for different hostages in two different locations.

It certainly will gain some time domestically from Mr. Netanyahu, because he has a lot of supporters in the Israeli government.I'd like to point out though, one thing that our great reporter Ben Wedeman mentioned, you know, he said the last big tranche of hostages occurred after the cessation of hostilities several months ago, and there hasn't been that kind of release since then. You know, I'd like to point out, though, that Israel has made the offer to Hamas on multiple occasions, to have ceasefire in exchange for hostages, and Hamas continues to play with them on this. They will bring them right up to the doorstep of a ceasefire with the potential for release of hostages from both the Palestinian camps in Israel, but all So the ones that they took on October the 7th. And then, at the very end, just when there is hope, Hamas dashes those hope. I think that's what Max was describing. So, you know, it means -- it's going to mean a continuation of the operation. And there is certainly a disconnect between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government in terms of what they should do in terms of a ceasefire. And that three phase plan that president Biden pointed out that he was offering, allegedly with Mr. Netanyahu's approval a few days ago. But I think as long as the hostages are still in captivity, and Hamas shows no interest in releasing them. Remember, these four that were kept, were recovered this morning, alive, were not given up by Hamas. They were driven by intelligence operations, by the Israeli military. So, I think you're going to see a continuation of that kind of intelligence. And plus, I'd add that these hostages will also be able to add to that intelligence in terms of their type of treatment, where they have been moved from, the number of moves they have made, what locations are they putting their fellow hostages in, they may be able to add a lot of information and intelligence for the Israeli military to go after some more houses.",

But for those families, and you could feel the euphoria at the hospital back then. So, in -- outside Tel Aviv. So, I can only imagine we're witnessing now some of -- some of the celebrations, but I can only imagine how it must feel for the doctors there, who are real professionals in helping these hostages come out of this horrible environment that they have been in. I mean, I'm looking -- you're looking at Noa Argamani now. She was handed a telephone. The president of Israel was congratulating her on the phone. But just look how pale she is. Go back and look at the video of when she was captured. She was tanned. She was clearly terrified in that video. So, it's quite amazing to see her now having endured more than 250 days of captivity, you know, surviving it. But you can just see the way -- the way that she looks now. These hostages, it appears to have just been kept either underground or completely out of sunlight for so long now. It's a big process. As we know, we're talking to doctors back then, earlier on in the year about the process of recovery for the hostages, and, you know, it's going to take a lot of time. There is the emotion. Noa got to meet with her father again. There were kisses. These are huge moments. But it's an intense trauma that they have been through, and it's going to take a long, long time, if ever to begin to unwind that. But the medical staff at the hospital they're absolute professionals, and that know their job. But this is a moment of pure celebration, I think obviously for these families, but more broadly in Israel.
