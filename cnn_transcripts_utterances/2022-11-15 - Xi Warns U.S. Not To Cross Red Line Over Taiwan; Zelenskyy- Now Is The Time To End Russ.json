It's the first time the group has gathered in person since Russia invaded its neighbor back in February. Earlier delegates heard a plea from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to end the fighting.And U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to rally world leaders against the war. Diplomats have been working for months on a formal condemnation, although it's not clear exactly which countries will sign on. Earlier French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the war with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. State media in Beijing report China is calling for a ceasefire and peace talks. And British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a statement saying Russia will never have a legitimate seat at the table until the war in Ukraine ends. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not attending the G20. Summit. Well, presidents Biden and Xi focused on multiple key topics including Taiwan during their three-hour meeting. The Chinese leader warned the U.S. not to cross the red line when it comes to Taiwan. The White House says Mr. Biden raised concerns about human rights in China and emphasized agreements on climate change. President Biden added that he expects competition with China but not conflict.

      "sentences": "Well, I think what President Biden went into this meeting, hoping to accomplish was a commitment that neither side wanted conflict. And it does seem like he accomplished that. He accomplished his objective once this meeting ended. Both sides seemed ready to take down the temperature to resume discussions after they had been somewhat stalled for months.Now, President Biden was clear that the issues, the disputes that they had going into this meeting, issues over Taiwan, issues over restrictions on technology, certainly human rights, that's a big one. Those remain disputes after the meeting ended. The President said this was not a kumbaya moment. There were moments of tension, when they were sitting across from each other for the three-hour meeting. But what they did agree with that they would start talking again, and they tasked officials to speak with their counterparts, high-ranking officials, potentially cabinet members to go over this litany of issues where they think that they can accomplish something and really kind of get to the business of diplomacy. One of those big issues is of course, climate change. You can't really solve the climate crisis without the U.S. and China talking to each other. They're the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gas. So that's one of the biggest things that they will resume talks on. The secretary of state Antony Blinken will also visit China in the New Year. Now President Biden said that he found Xi Jinping to be sort of the same person that he's always been. He's been open. He's been straightforward. He didn't find him to be confrontational. And that did allow them to have a candid discussion about areas that they disagree. But interestingly, the president said they also talked about areas that they didn't necessarily understand each other. Places where they weren't sure where the red lines were. Afterwards, the president said that there were no misunderstandings. That he was able to get a sense of where she stands. And one of those key areas is, of course, Taiwan. And the president said at that news conference last night that he does not see a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as imminent. So that was one of the big takeaways. One of the other things they wanted to talk about was North Korea, the president sort of cast doubt on how much influence she has in Pyongyang. So that was an interesting takeaway as well. But certainly, this was really the beginning. Now, the real work of diplomacy will begin as these officials begin their talks with each other. Rosemary?",

      "sentences": "Of course. And Steven, let's turn to you now. What all did China's president get out of his meeting with President Biden and his other bilateral meeting with the French president? STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEFBut he made a specific point to Biden that China opposes the threat or use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. That is a point that he had previously made with the visiting German chancellor in Beijing. But still, the fact that he told Biden this was very telling, given Mr. Putin's recent nuclear posturing and given Mr. Xi is supposed no Limits friendship with the Russian leader. But it's also a very interesting that this point was not included in the Chinese government read out about the Biden Xi meeting. It did later appear in a separate foreign ministry statement. So there still seems to be some hesitation on the part of the Chinese in terms of how to address this very sensitive issue while maintaining their close ties with Russia. But when it comes to U.S.-China ties of course, the most contentious issue remains to be Taiwan. You heard Kevin say that the U.S. president coming out of the meeting, having a more optimistic assessment of the situation. And as far as the Chinese are concerned, Mr. Biden has also said all the right things opposing Taiwan independence and also sticking to a One China policy, but the situation remains very precarious, especially with domestic U.S. politics thrown in. With the Republicans are still very much favored to win the control of the House. A leading candidate for the new speaker's job is Kevin McCarthy who has previously said he would visit Taiwan as the speaker. So if that happens, it could really plunge this relationship back to where it was before the meeting. So, potentially making all the smiles on the leaders faces just a fleeting moment, Rosemary?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So Rosemary, given that this was a meeting between two spies, we will probably never truly know what was discussed inside of that room. We can only go based on what each side has told us. In the U.S. side at least officially says the Bill Burns was there in Ankara, the capital of Turkey to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergei Naryshkin to essentially talk about risk and managing risk, especially nuclear risk and the risk of strategic stability.So you can draw your own conclusions based about what exactly that may mean, precisely, but it seems to indicate that the U.S. was there to give Russia a warning about the risk of using nuclear weapons and the consequences that would come if they were ever to be used. You'll remember back in September that Russian President Vladimir Putin seem to give a not so veiled threat about using nuclear weapons, though last month, thankfully, he seemed to back off of that somewhat. The U.S. says that it was not in Turkey, though, that Bill Burns was not in Turkey to negotiate any kind of settlement or any kind of ending to this conflict in Ukraine because it says that its policy is that anything involving Ukraine should actually have Ukraine there at the table. And obviously, the Ukrainians were not there, though they say that they were given a heads up. The Kremlin for its part at first refused to confirm or deny that this meeting took place at all. Then later, they confirmed that it did take place, but said that this was at the invitation of the United States and the Kremlin declined to say anything specific about what exactly was discussed. Turkey obviously was the host here. And they confirmed that the meeting took place and said that this is just one more example of Turkey contributing to brokering dialogue for peace between the Ukrainians and the Russians. This is something that President Erdogan has really tried to make it one of his primary focuses, of course, the Turks are in a pretty unique position having maintained pretty good relations with both the West and with Russia as well. And with Ukrainians and the Russians as well. They've previously hosted peace talks and President Erdogan who is at the G20 right now says that it is still very much his goal to try to coax both sides back to the negotiating table though at this point.

And, of course, both sides said that they were able to communicate their positions clearly and feel like they were understood by their interlocutors. However, if you just think about it, to talk for three and a half hours and to not find any areas of agreement or progress at all just shows you how far apart the two sides are.

He did not repeat his statements that he intends to send U.S. troops to defend Taiwan, statements that he has made four times probably in the past. At the same time, it was very clear that Xi Jinping's message was that Taiwan is a core issue to China, that any U.S. interference would be frowned upon and because the U.S. is not going to stop helping Taiwan because China is not going to stop being angry about that help, I think the U.S. China tensions over Taiwan are destined to only going to increase.",

Which is, he allegedly told the student he had a gun. That student passed it on to the school. The school passed it on to the threat assessment team. The threat assessment team interviewed the person who reported who and said, well, he mentioned he had a gun but he didn't say he was going to do anything with it. So, there was no threat attached to it. They interviewed his roommate who said, I've been, you know, in the same room with him here at the school. Never saw a gun. He hasn't shown me a gun or brandished a gun. And presumably, and we don't know this Laura, and we will, you wouldn't close a case like that out in a proper way without interviewing the subject.",
