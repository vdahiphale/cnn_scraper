If you spend any time at his rallies, it felt like a Trump rally. It was rambling, a little incoherent. He made some strange reference to Hannibal Lecter, as he's done in the past from \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Still can't figure that one out. He went after Nancy Pelosi.

What he was trying to accomplish was trying to show that he was a steady hand moving away from the extremism that has defined his persona, his political brand. And what he did was he reminded voters of why they rejected him in 2020. He's not competent. There's clearly cognitive decline.

I think his decline has that debate was just undeniable in terms of his cognitive limitations, and he hasn't been able to convince folks since that time. So as we're seeing, you know, everything go right for Donald Trump, whether it's a case getting dismissed or, you know, essentially surviving an assassination attempt and then being able to essentially say you're a messiah.

When we hear a convention speech like this, it's very much a sign that China will be part of the discussion on the campaign trail between now and November. Part of this focus is going to be on economics, the economic relationship between the United States and China. President Trump, former President Trump, has been making a big appeal to American workers and has been talking a lot about the auto industry, as we just heard. He is raising concerns about the growth of auto plants in China as well as Mexico and how that could impact the domestic U.S. economy.

He'd like to see me back, too,\" referring to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, saying, \"I think he misses me if you want to know the truth.\" Now, it is true that President Trump, former President Trump and Kim Jong-un did have a diplomatic relationship at one point. But it broke down in 2019 after talks in Hanoi. And since that time, we have seen North Korea continue to further develop its military ambitions. As far as China is concerned, though, again, China wanting to be very hands off. We did see some mention on Chinese social media about his bandage on his ear, as well as talk of a possible trade war.

Now, he faces a very serious sentence, potentially up to 20 years in prison, for a crime that, as you mentioned, U.S. officials and his employer, the \"Wall Street Journal,\" of course, say he did not commit.Let me read you a statement that's been issued by the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Evan's wrongful detention has been an outrage since his unjust arrest 477 days ago, the statement says, and it must end now. Even as Russia orchestrates its shameful sham trial, we continue to do everything we can to push for Evan's immediate release and to state unequivocally: Evan was doing his job as a journalist and journalism is not a crime. Bring him home now. Now, it's unclear, Kim, when a sentencing will take place. The trial proceedings are happening behind closed doors, so very little detail on what's happening inside that courtroom. We do know Gershkovich is in attendance behind a glass cage, head shaved, as we've seen previously. That's according to prison requirements. But the hope is, Kim, that although this is happening at a lightning fast pace, that it could bring Gershkovich one step closer to coming home. And that's because Russia has indicated that they are willing to trade him in a prisoner swap, but that potentially he would need to be sentenced first. So there is some optimism that this moving forward could again bring Evan home and, as the U.S. has said, allow that bargaining chip that Moscow wants to play to come out.",
