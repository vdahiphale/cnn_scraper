Russia is vowing to retaliate after it says at least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in a Ukrainian shelling attack on the city of Belgorod inside Russia. The attack appears to be in retaliation to a massive Russian air attack on Ukraine that killed at least 40 people on Friday. It was Russia's biggest air assaults since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began almost two years ago. CNN's Nic Robertson is joining us now with more. Nic, what do we know? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The ongoing tensions between Israel and Hamas has ramped up concern of lone wolf attacks during the Times Square ball drop. And while there are no specific threats to the celebrations, the intelligence community remains concerned. The high-profile event may be seen as an opportunity for violence.

Now, that being said, again, still no credible threat that's been established here. But what they're really focusing on now is the potential for protests that we've seen play out here in New York City, almost on in everyday basis.

But there are two key ones here. The potential for demonstrations, but also what intelligence analysts describe as a potential for a homegrown violent extremist.

They confirmed that there were a total of 15 launches today from Lebanese territory towards Israel, including that aerial target that crossed from Lebanon into Israel.And now, yesterday there were 10, on Thursday, there were at least 50. So, it's not as though things are increasing. I don't want to say it's kind of business as usual. But certainly, pretty much since October the 7th, we have seen this situation where Hezbollah, this is the, of course, militia backed by Iran has been firing rockets, missiles, drones towards Israeli targets and Israeli communities. And Israel has been responding. And the remain tens of thousands of people who live along that border with Lebanon, who are unable to return to their homes. So, for now, this is still a kind of war that isn't a war. It is still simmering. It is yet to boiled -- boil over. But we've, of course, had more warnings from Israel over the past week from people like the foreign minister. Also, Benny Gantz, member of the war Cabinet, warning Hezbollah that if it doesn't back off, if it doesn't move back, away from the border where it is supposed to, according to United Nations resolutions, then, Israel will make it. And I suppose the last thing that anyone wants, especially the United States and leaders in the region and the international community -- the last thing anyone wants is to see an escalation of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip to the Northern Front between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Amara? WALKER: You know, Elliott, just days ago, there was a lot of talk about perhaps a lower intensity phase of the war that the U.S. has been urging Israel to implement. But as of Friday, the IDF is saying that it's extending its operation in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza. What more do we know about this military operation?",

More than 100 of them still being held in Gaza after they were abducted on October the 7th as part of Hamas's terrorist attack.And indeed, in Tel Aviv, right at this very moment, as you said, a couple of moments ago, thousands of people demonstrating to keep up the pressure on the Israeli government to find a way to bring those hostages' home. So, the expansion of Israel's operations, whether it's against infrastructure belonging to Hamas, things like tunnels, weapons storage facility, or against militants themselves, those will continue. And Israel will make no apologies to expanding these operations. It hasn't started ground operations in the central part of the Gaza Strip. But it is on the ground in the north, of course, where it's still can't say mission accomplished. And, of course, expanding those operations in and around Khan Younis, where it believes that the senior leadership of Hamas remains, which of course, is another objective of this war, which is to kill the top leaders of Hamas, the masterminds of that terrorist attack on October the 7th.

And Israel is having an extremely difficult time. Clearly, in accomplishing those objectives. The administration, first and foremost, has to figure out a way to at least press the Israelis to change their tactics in Gaza. And I suspect, by the end of January, there will be a change. If there isn't a change, there is absolutely no way that you can begin to create predictable and reliable corridors to surge, not dribble. To surge, humanitarian assistance into Gaza, to deal with the needs of a tantamount almost 2 million people who are on the verge of acute malnutrition, in many cases, and the spread of serious illness and disease. So, that I think is the initial challenge for the administration, then sometime, I think in the middle of this year, plans are going to need to be developed to try to create a different post-conflict reality in Gaza.

The problem with bringing back the Palestinian Authority politically for Mr. Netanyahu is it's going to mean a commitment to two states, which could easily bring about the collapse of this Israeli government.At the same time, I think that the administration acknowledges the reality that at some level, the Israelis are going to be operated in Gaza militarily at some level, not as kinetically intense as what we've seen since October 27th, and the beginning of the ground campaign. But Israel is going to be operating there militarily. And I think that is in essence is the real challenge. And I have to be honest, I don't think anyone right now has any real assurance of a predictable post- conflict stability in Gaza. This is very much day by day, week, by week, a month, month by month. First and foremost, there has to be a change in Israeli -- Israel's ground campaign, shifting from division level operations with artillery and comprehensive airstrikes to a more brigade-focused, intelligence-driven operation, otherwise, I can't see the future, and I -- and I would predict growing tensions in the U.S.-Israel relationship as well.",

Then things will start to diminish and calm down going into Sunday.But some of the images that we've seen over the last couple of days, I mean, like you mentioned, I'm really told this storm extremely dangerous. That's the words the Weather Service is using to describe this thing. We haven't seen this in many years. This is the potent storm that's headed into the west coast this morning. That's what's kicking these waves, because it's just moving around the water. So we're looking at 20 to 30 feet of some of these wave heights. This is the peak happening today. Then notice how the colors come down. We start to find those waves relax a little bit going into Sunday. So the high surf warnings continue from Santa Barbara down to San Diego. We're looking at wave heights up to 15 to 25 feet. But if you go up into the San Francisco Bay area, 40-feet waves are possible. That can cause damage to piers and jetties. That's where, again -- up and down the coast, it's just been extremely dangerous. So the coastal flood warnings continue as well, because you'll get waves that high that can also send the water inland, especially with this happening right now with high tides. The tides alone are about four to five feet, the highest of the month. So adding insult to injury. And that's where we're seeing the flooding in the low-lying areas and the rip currents as well. I want to mention this, because, as you saw, there are people on the beach. Remember, a rip current takes you out to sea. If you get caught in a rip current, you cannot swim back to the beach like you want to. Right? You have to be faster than an Olympic swimmer to fight that current, which most of us are not. So to get out of a rip current, you want to swim parallel to the shore to get out of it. And that's where you might be able to make your way back to the shore.

Even here in Nashville, one of the Vanderbilt law professors uses her in his trademark and copyright law class. So it's just studying her and her impact. She is far bigger than just a celebrity or an entertainment. She's a brand. She's a businesswoman. We are definitely going to be seeing a lot more of her now, definitely in the classroom.",

When she spoke out against Senator Marsha Blackburn, we saw, in Tennessee, more than 100,000 registered voters appeared. So I definitely think she'll be saying in the next year, like, get out, exercise your vote.

She has two re-releases that she has yet to release, \"Refutation\" and also \"Debut.\" And we never know. She likes to keep fans on their feet. So could she release another project or another album? What we know about Taylor is that she is very good at keeping people guessing, clowning, as the fans would say, when they think an album is coming out and it doesn't happen. They almost are disappointed and they say they're clowning. We will also see her enter the movie industry. She's nominated for a Golden Globe. She also has a feature film contract that she signed with Searchlight Pictures. So I'm going to be looking into her going into that industry. A lot we can expect coming into 2024.",
