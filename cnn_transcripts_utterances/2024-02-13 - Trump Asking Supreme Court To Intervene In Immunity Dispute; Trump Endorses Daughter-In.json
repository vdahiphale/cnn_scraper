      "sentences": "The Supreme Court once again in the spotlight, Chief Justice John Roberts has asked Special Counsel JackSmith to respond to the request that they block a ruling against Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity, and all of this playing into Trump's strategy to delay, delay, delay. Plus, voting underway in New York, where a special election will fill a vacant House seat. In almost an evenly divided House, both Democrats and Republicans view it as a must win. And House Speaker Mike Johnson is vowing to kill the Senate's bipartisan foreign aid package with Donald Trump signaling his opposition to both foreign aid and immigration reform. Can Congress pass anything on these key issues? Good day everyone. I'm Jessica Dean to our viewers watching all around the world. It is 11 a.m. right here in Washington, Tuesday, February 13. There are now just 11 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, 265 days until Election Day. And this is today's State of the Race. We have our first indication of how the U.S. Supreme Court is going to handle Donald Trump's latest legal maneuver. We're learning Chief Justice John Roberts has asked Special Counsel Jack Smith to respond by next week to Trump's request to block a lower court's ruling which has denied that he has immunity from criminal prosecution. Of course, the delay has been a key part of Donald Trump's legal strategy, and political strategy for that matter, trying to put any criminal prosecution off until after Election Day in November. Whatever the court decides, though, could determine if Trump will face trial, the Special Counsel's election subversion case before the election. Meanwhile, the former President moving to solidify his control of the Republican Party itself. He is endorsing loyalists, including his own daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to take over top leadership spots in the Republican National Committee. Let's dive into all of it with today's panel. Lance Trover was the spokesperson for North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum's presidential campaign. Chris Kofinis is the Democratic Strategist and the former Chief of Staff for Senator Joe Manchin, and Margaret Talev is the Senior Contributor for Axios, and the Director of the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship, at Syracuse University. Great to see all of you. Margaret, let's just start with you. As I'm laying it all out there, we go -- we turn back again and again to there is the legal bits for Donald Trump and then there is the political piece of it, and we continue to see them collide. What do you make of the Supreme Court now going to have a hand in all of this? MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS, &amp; DIRECTOR, DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM &amp; CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE AT SYRACUSE UNIV.: It was always going there. And the question is, not just what does Chief Roberts and the court do now, but how quickly do they move to do that? Through the primary season, it's definitely clearly benefited the former President to be able to use all of these court proceedings, in federal court and civil courts in states, to energize his base and help solidify his move toward the nomination. It's is a different prospect. Probably, it's certainly a more complicated prospect in the general election. And you've seen in poll after poll the idea that there are -- there is a block of Americans who say it would make a difference whether or not he were convicted. And so, the delay strategy becomes increasingly important as you head into a general election.",

Let's take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): That would mean that this President thinks that he is above the law. And I think that he is on trial for certain things. I think the Supreme Court is on trial as well. Four votes to hear it. Five votes for a stay. How could they possibly give a stay for justice to proceed? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kristen, tell us more about what you're learning today as this unfolds. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, right now, we're just figuring out that Donald Trump is going to be going to New York for his court appearance. It had been kind of up in the air. There are two hearings regarding Trump's legal issues on Thursday, one being in New York regarding the hush money case, the other in Georgia. There had been some intrigue on Donald Trump's part to go to Georgia. There is a possibility that Fani Willis, the District Attorney there, was going to testify. It still hasn't been completely ruled out. And just a reminder that this hearing is whether or not Willis needs to be disqualified from running this case. Defendants have alleged that she had an improper relationship with a top deputy there, and that that has rendered her unable to run this case. So, whether or not she testify is still up in the air. But, Donald Trump was interested in possibly attending that hearing. Instead, he will go to New York. And I'm told by senior advisors that the decision at the end of the day was relatively easy. In New York, it's a hearing directly related to his criminal case there, directly related to something that impacts them. They view what's going on in Georgia more as a procedural issue. So, when it comes to Donald Trump, the other thing to note here about New York, if this case holds, if the trial date holds that the judge set on March 25, it will be the first criminal trial that Donald Trump goes through. So, that's another very important factor here. There have been a lot of questions about whether or not that was going to hold given the other criminal charges that were brought against him, both by the Department of Justice and in Georgia. But, it does appear that with that election interference case being put on delay, the Department of Justice case, that this is going to be the first trial that he actually faces.",

Thanks so much.And Lance, it's interesting to hear her talk about how the former President is going to appear, is planning to appear. That has been such a strategy, in addition to delay, delay, delay. That has been a big strategy for him is to go to these court appearances and really use that to weigh this in the court of public opinion. And that's a difference than being convicted. Right? That's kind of using it in more of a strategic way. How long do you think he can afford to kind of walk that line, and do you think it's going to work? LANCE TROVER, SPOKESPERSON FOR DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, it's Donald Trump. This is what he does. He commands the media. He commands media attention, and he does it to great effect every single day. And I think you hit on something that I think is really interesting. We see polls now that say, convicted, yada, yada, yada. He is going to be in deep trouble. But, most voters aren't really tuned into this presidential election. And I think as he starts to litigate this in the court of public opinion, there will be voters that start asking questions about, well, what is going on? And why now, and why are all these cases going on? Why is the Biden Justice Department coming at him? And I would just remind folks that no one has shown resiliency the way Donald Trump has with broad swaths of the American public, and that is because if you talk to pollsters around the country, people are able to separate the policies from the man oftentimes with voters out there. And I think that's something to think about, no matter what the Supreme Court decides at the end of the day. He is still going to be there right at the end.",

But, the bill faces steep opposition in the House because President Trump opposes it, and House Republican leadership has been falling in line behind him. Speaker Mike Johnson saying last night \"The Senate should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help in the ongoing catastrophe.\" Earlier, Trump posted, \"From this point forward, are you listening U.S. Senate (?). No money in the form of foreign aid should be given to any country unless it's done as a loan, not just to give away.\" The House will be also busy today trying to for a second time in a week impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Even if Republicans have the votes this time around, the Senate is expected to kill that measure. The panel is back with me. Where to begin with all of that? I think let's start with foreign aid, because that is what happened to this morning. And now, the big question, everybody had kind of decided -- we knew the Senate was going to pass this.
