Congressman Jeff Jackson will be OUTFRONT. And Russia desperately recruiting fighters as one top Kremlin ally, talks publicly about obliterating Paris, London and New York. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Mike Lindell forced to pay millions of dollars for telling lies about the 2020 election.

He says that it would have to be arbitrated and you take it all the way to the finish line. What's your reaction today when you find out you've been awarded $5 million from Mike Lindell? ROBERT ZEIDMAN, DEBUNKED MIKE LINDELL'S FALSE ELECTION DATA:  Well, Erin, thanks for having me. And I think it was relief not because I doubted my own findings. The -- in fact, I never expected to be able to show that it was bogus data because normally data analysis could take weeks or months and I had three days. But the data was so obviously fake that I spent a few hours before I could show it was fake. I always worried though. Mike Lindell has a lot of resources, a lot of money and you never know. You know, I think the court system -- generally, justice is served, but not always. And so, I was never sure if I was going to be awarded the money. And more than the money, I really wanted the people -- the public to know what was going on.",

But if you know how to substitute them, then you get a message. And basically somebody did that kind of transformation twice on just asimple Word document. One was a Word document is a table of numbers and the other was just pages and pages and pages of nonsense, gibberish, as if somebody were just typing randomly. But I happen -- I have 40 years of experience doing this kind of thing, and I just happened to notice certain patterns, and I said, I wonder what happens if you do this transformation, and if you do that transformation. And what I ended up was with these very simple Word documents, and I was just so surprised that -- that I was able to do that. It's not what I expected.

Or did just -- he just didn't know and he wanted so badly to believe that this was evidence of hacking into the elections, that he just put it out there? But I think in the long run, after the whole arbitration -- let me put it this way -- I think he has convinced himself it's real because it needs to be real.

There's a very tense situation tonight, where the U.S. military says it's deploying hundreds of marines. They're doing this near Sudan to secure the American embassy there and assist with the evacuation. That country is teetering on the brink of civil war. The sky over Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and the airport there remain unsafe, according to a source, and at the core of this violence is a battle for control of Sudan. It is the third largest country in Africa, and there's a fight going on between the official military there and a paramilitary group. And tonight, CNN has exclusive details about how the Wagner Group, the private military on the front lines in Bakhmut that we're just talking about is now secretly trying to tip the scales in this deadly battle. Nima Elbagir is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Sudanese and the Libyan Army celebrated a successful joint operation Wednesday, April 19th, near the remote desert border between Libya and Sudan, having captured the Chevrolet Garrison belonging to the rival Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the RSF. But why is this military base is so important, given how far it is from the existential fight in Sudan's capital Khartoum? Because CNN can reveal that the fight in Khartoum is being influenced by what was happening at that garrison, a Russian resupply campaign backed by a key regional player aimed at turning the tide in Sudan's war in favor of the RSF, who have been a key recipient of Russian training and military aid. In collaboration with all eyes on Wagner, a research group focusing on Russian proxy Wagner, CNN investigated the group's current presence in Libya. You can see here on April 16th one day after the fighting began in Khartoum, a Russian Ilyushin 76 transport plane at the al-Jufra base in Libya, previously identified by American intelligence as a Wagner base. Three days later, this same plane is spotted by flight tracker aviation expert Gerjon coming back from the Russian airbase in Latakia, Syria, before returning to the Libyan air base in Khadim. Images of that same plane began circulating online April 17th heading in the direction of Sudan. Sudanese and regional sources tell CNN that weaponry was air-dropped to the RSF within that timeframe, April 15th to April 18th, to the Chevrolet Garrison during a period of fierce fighting, boosting the RSF. The al-Khadim and al-Jufra bases where the Wagner planes departed from in Libya are under the control of field marshal Khalifa Haftar, who commands territory in the east of Libya. Haftar and the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, aka Hemitte, have in common strategic alliances, one with Wagner, who Haftar is hosting in his territory in Libya and whom a previous CNN investigation exposed as working with Hemitte to extract Sudanese gold, a second with the United Arab Emirates, who tapped Hemitte to send forces to the conflict in Yemen and backed Haftar in the fighting in Libya. What does it all mean for the ongoing misery and conflict in Sudan? It means that both a regional Libyan General Haftar and a global player, Russia, putting their thumbs on the scale, which raises the stakes for the region, for the global balance of power, and for the people of Sudan caught in the crossfire.
