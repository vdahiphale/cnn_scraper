That promise -- the promise there is that each person will support the party's eventual nominee. The Republican National Committee has also made that a requirement to get on the debate stage. Just this morning, Republican candidate Will Hurd, he said this is why -- he explained why he won't sign a pledge like this.Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILL HURD (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The issue is not with me supporting the Republican nominee. The issue is I'm not going to support Donald Trump. And here's why, Donald Trump is a proven loser. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Six others, though, have made it, I think we can say, less clear statements about it, or sent mixed messages about what they'll do when presented with it. But they're all going to be presented with it very soon.Joining us now for more on this and more is senior political correspondent for \"The New Republic,\" Daniel Strauss. Daniel, thanks for coming in. So, what is the point of a loyalty oath for -- to the party? You know, to -- to the party? I mean, to -- for this or any candidate running, it's unclear why the party cares about it, why the national committee cares about it and why the state cares about it so much. DANIEL STRAUSS, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW REPUBLIC\": Partially it's because any GOP or Democratic operative in a divided primary, in a crowded primary, is worried that they're -- that it will be a lasting and bitter fight. And that lasting and bitter fight will spill over into the general election. So, the question is here, will there be supporters of candidates who aren't the eventual nominee who will coalesce around the eventual nominee. That was the concern in 2016 and that's what the -- what the effort is here. I'm pretty skeptical, though, about how effective these pledges are. Again, there was a move to have pledges in 2016, and that didn't really work. Voters generally just coalesced around their candidates, or their party's candidate in the end. I am extremely doubtful here given that in particular former Congressman Hurd, former Governor Chris Christie have been vocal critics of Donald Trump, that the rest of the field will follow suit and say they will sign a loyalty pledge even if that means supporting Trump in the general election.",

He is on video in the Capitol during the insurrection of January 6th. He's outside the Capitol scuffling with police and other demonstrators. So, he's somebody they were looking at.Interestingly, he's from Pasco, Washington. He ends up in the other Washington, Washington, D.C. And for the past couple of months he's been on the radar there live streaming. Last week it came to a head when he was live streaming that he had a detonator, that he had a van, that it was a self-driving vehicle, that he was going to go to NIST. NIST is the National Institute for Science and Technology. It's up in Gaithersburg, Maryland. And he's saying the car is going to drive in there and blow up is what he's implying. So, now they start looking for him. After the former President Trump's tweet where he retweets an article that has the street the Obamas live on in the Kalarama (ph) neighborhood, he ends up live streams from that street, saying, we're looking for the Obamas, the Podestas. We're going to -- we're going to meet them in hell. I'm trying to get a shot, trying to get an angle. Now, he could be talking about on his live stream from his phone. You know, I'm trying to get a good shot of the house or an angle to see. But he's talking about the tunnels that connect their basements. So, there's a lot going on there. The context of getting a shot or an angle is changed when they find his van, and there are two semiautomatic weapons, hundreds of rounds of nine milliliter ammunition. And the Secret Service locates him, he runs into the woods of Rock Creek Park. They capture him. They search the van. Clear it with the bomb squad. So, there's a lot going on there.",

The question is, can they charge under Title 18, 3056, threatening a former president or others under the protection of the Secret Service. And he seems to have walked that line very carefully. That's going to be up to prosecutors as to whether they believe all the other factors, the guns and the cars, the claims of explosives and detonators, kind of meet the bar that matches the language.",

People were returning to their homes, thousands of them that had fled during the incursion. And they were looking around, surveying the damage. But one of the first things that took place, John, if you can believe it, was a huge funeral for the 12 people killed in that Israeli military incursion. I know we have footage to show you, just crowds of people, masses of people filled the street.And what really stood out was the armed resistant factions. Was the Palestine armed factions that were in and out in that protest funeral, carrying their weapons, carrying their flags, making a clear message to Israel that they were unbowed, unbroken by its military operation there. Several of the dead were claimed by one of the Palestinian factions, the Jenin brigade. That is an armed resistance faction that is extremely active in Jenin. And they promised essentially to rebuild and fight again. But you also have to remember, of course, this is a densely populated area. Thousands of people, families and children, trapped in this conflict. So alongside, of course, seeing what were the remnants of sites that Israel's military says it struck to take out terror infrastructure, we also found homes heavily damaged, heavily destroyed. I know we have images to show you of that as well. And what was so extraordinary to see, John, was just how quickly people began to rebuild themselves. They expect very little help in an area that's essentially been abandoned by Palestinian leadership and in an area that continuously is targeted by the Israeli military. Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu says that his forces did achieve their objective. That the Israeli military was able to neutralize what they see as a terror threat, a safe haven for combatants in Jenin. But we saw -- what we saw on the ground there with those militants again at that demonstration is that they are willing to come back, and many Palestinians believe in the Jenin camp that so is the Israeli military.
