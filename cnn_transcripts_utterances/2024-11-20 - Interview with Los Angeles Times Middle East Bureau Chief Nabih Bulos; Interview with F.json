Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. We have a real opportunity to bring this conflict to an end. That is the assessment of U.S. Envoy Amos Hochstein, who is bringing a ceasefire proposal to Hezbollah and Israel. Both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah are said to have responded positively. And so, we await word from Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Israel has been intensifying its airstrikes, even in Beirut. And the impact on children has been particularly dire. With news now from UNICEF that more than 200 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past two months. Among them, two four-year-old twin girls on Sunday. Just a snapshot of the devastating reality on the ground. So, let's go straight to Beirut. Nabih Bulos is the L.A. Times Middle East bureau chief based in Lebanon's capital, and he joins us from there. Nabih, always great to have you on the program, especially given where you are in Lebanon. We've had you on the past few months since this official war began here and you've given us some real insight into what things look like on the ground, the impact that this has had on civilians.

There are boulevards that are just really, I mean, damaged at this point where it's just not possible to pass through them. And, of course, it should be said that the whole area is virtually devoid of residents at this point. So, you're talking about really hundreds of thousands of people that have been displaced, and that's just near Beirut. Of course, if you go further on, if you go to the south, if you go to eastern -- you know, eastern parts of the country, like the Beqaa Valley, et cetera, you will also see similar devastation in towns and villages and also some of the major cities of the south. It really is -- I mean, this has been about now -- I'm here for about two months now, and I must say that the level of damage really far, far exceeds what we've seen in the past in 2006 and elsewhere in Lebanon.",

He also said in his press conference that the reason why he was going to Israel is because there is progress or which is -- what's more accurately is that he conditioned his going to Israel on the basis of there being progress in Lebanon. And I mean, apparently, there has been. But I must say there are some major sticking points that are, I mean, I think at this point, very unclear. Now, of course, Mr. Hochstein has not said anything in terms of details about the situation. I mean, the negotiations, I guess, and the various conditions. But the fact of the matter is, if you consider what is being said or what has actually been said in the media because of leaked documents, I mean, there is a major sticking point, which is that Israel would want to be able to retain the ability to strike at Hezbollah throughout the country at any time. Now, as you can imagine, this is not going to fly with Lebanese leaders because it would mean essentially ceding the country's sovereignty. At the same time, Israel will tell you that it wants to have drones and overflight ability to go through across Lebanon at this point, and indeed -- I mean, close to the Syrian border. So, I mean, these are major sticking points, and I simply cannot imagine the Lebanese government being able to actually cede that level of sovereignty without getting into a major, major uproar from people.",

At the same time, you're also talking about using the Lebanese armed forces to basically, I guess, increase their number and increase their influence and their presence in Southern Lebanon, right, and throughout the territory as well. Now, it should be said, over the last, I suppose, 18 years before this war started, yes, UNIFIL was there. Yes, the Lebanese army was there, but at the same time, they did manage to keep a somewhat wide berth from Hezbollah. I mean, I suppose there was a bit of a gentleman's agreement, and it should be said that that agreement did hold for about 18 years. So, it is worth noting that it did succeed for a bit. Now, at the same time, it's clear that the status quo ante will not be returned to, or at least that's at least what's being said by Israel, and that would involve a more, I think, elaborate UNIFIL, but also at the same time, there's talk of this enforcement mechanism, this international monitoring mechanism of some sort. And that one would have to also be -- I think, it would have to involve a few nations and would have to have teeth as well.

But with a newadministration imminent, does the White House lack leverage to restrain the Netanyahu government and drive through a meaningful agreement? Veteran U.S. diplomat Daniel Kurtzer knows the issues at stake well. He was U.S. ambassador to Egypt and to Israel, and he joins us now from Washington. Ambassador Kurtzer, thank you for the time. So, there -- you heard my conversation with Nabih about potential prospects for a ceasefire deal in Lebanon. Let me turn to Gaza, because as it relates to this transition period, last week when we saw President-Elect Biden meeting -- President-Elect Trump meeting with President Biden in the Oval Office, it was reported that one of the issues they seem to both agree on is the need for a resolution and a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza that both agreed to work together on. What are your views on the possibility of that happening, especially now, while we're in this lame duck period? DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL AND EGYPT:  Well, I think the Biden administration will work until the last hour to try to bring about a ceasefire agreement that allows for the foreign and Israeli hostages to return. But as we've seen over the past months, the leadership among Hamas and the leadership in Israel have set conditions that have basically derailed the effort to bring about that agreement. And therefore, it's hard to see whether or not in this period of a lame duck president and in anticipation of a new administration, there would be any major change in the position of the two parties. Clearly, Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to be on the good side of the incoming administration and therefore, he has to assess whether or not he needs to modify his position in order to bring about an end to the hostilities. But no one really has control over Hamas' decision making and they are in a bit of a straits now because their leadership in Doha has been moving around, maybe relocating to Turkey. It's always been hard for them to make decisions and there's not been an indication until now that they want anything less than the full withdrawal of Israel from Gaza and an indeterminate end of the hostilities.",

I'd like to play sound from Prime Minister Netanyahu as he was making a visit in Gaza yesterday, as it relates to the hostages themselves and a proposal, a financial reward for those who would release the hostages unharmed. Let's play that for you and talk about it after. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  I want to say to those who are holding our hostages, whoever dares to harm our hostages, his blood is on his head. We will pursue you and we will get you. I also say to those who want to get out of this maze, whoever brings us a hostage, we will find a safe way for them and their family to get out. We will also give a reward of $5 million for each hostage returned. You choose. The choice is yours, but the result will be the same, we will bring them all back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You remember back in Iraq, it was Saddam Hussein's bodyguards who turned him in at the end. So, it's not impossible that individuals here or there may step forward. But Hamas has been very tough on the Palestinian people themselves and has taken action to prevent that kind of response to Israeli entreaties. So, I wouldn't be optimistic that we're going to see an end of the hostage situation, even though, hopefully, one or two or perhaps more hostages individually will be released.",

Now, there had been some speculation perhaps that the U.S. would not veto resolutions at the United Nations, but that is not what happened today. The U.S. in fact vetoed a U.N. Security Council Gaza ceasefire resolution for not being linked to a hostage deal. As it relates to the issue at hand now to an incoming President Trump, this is clearly not something that he wants to inherit. He ran on ending wars not starting them. What leverage do you think he could have on Prime Minister Netanyahu alone, obviously knowing that there's Hamas as a player here too, to prioritize a ceasefire hostage deal as opposed to remaining in Gaza longer?",

So, unless the president-elect decides to get a hold of what his spokespeople are saying and to send a message to the prime minister that it's got to come to an end, it doesn't look as though there's going to be pressure to bear. And if there's not that kind of pressure to bear after January 20th, well, we're certainly not going to see it before January 20th. You mentioned the veto, the administration is also putting pressure on Democrats in Congress not to oppose additional military assistance to Israel. So, it's -- it doesn't look very positive that the United States will exert any kind of influence on Israel until there's a -- until we and they are persuaded that the mission has been accomplished. And that's the problem. We don't really know what the mission is. It's in Netanyahu's head. But we don't know at what point he will declare, quote/unquote, \"victory.\"",

Like these are the struggles that we're all dealing with while we're trying to put food on the table. And there's another example, you know, 250 bucks used to fill my cart up at the grocery store. Now, it's barely skimming the bottom. People are hurting. And insurance costs, healthcare costs is extremely expensive in this country. And I think that's the change people are looking for, is we just got to do better to live. Look, I don't think most people are looking for handouts. I'm certainly not. But I'm just looking for even playing fields when it comes to, you know, monopolies to -- you know, without -- there's nothing to drive down costs, if you don't have competition. You know, we see that playing out over and over and over again. And, you know, we got to talk about price gouging when we talk about inflation. Kroger admitted to inflating their prices. I saw Kellogg's did it when I worked there. And, you know, now we got to --",

He's accused many others of them of breaking the law, and even though those sorts of prosecutions are unlikely, in the long run, to be successful in the courts, the expense and pressure of being under investigation is itself a significant cost.

And yet, he's announced his intention to nominate RFK Jr. to be head of HHS. He's announced his intention to nominate a number of cabinet members, none of whom should be taken seriously, except that they will seriously have these responsibilities.

That is a Black Swan phenomenon that would come and then pass away. And if you think that's what somebody is or some phenomena is, then you don't change your behavior. You think this too shall pass and we should maintain standards, maintain our fidelity to norms of behavior. This is what Michelle Obama meant when she said, when they go low, we go high. You know, they're going down in the mud, we're going to stay up here and treat America like America. But what has become clear over the last eight years, to me at least, and most saliently, of course, with Trump's re-election earlier this month, is that he is not an aberration. He's a phenomenon. He's a movement. And his movement engages in norm breaking behavior. You know, nominating people manifestly unqualified to lead the government, not because he really wants them to lead the government, but because he wants them to break the government. And if you think that's who he is, if you think that's what Trump is about, then you have to change how you respond in kind. You have to start using all of your counter levers of power as aggressively as you reasonably can within the bounds of law, even if it is not normal behavior as we would have thought of it 10 years ago.",

That even though you could do so, we shouldn't because we didn't want to become like other countries where every turn of the political wheel resulted in the prosecution of the former office holder. January 6th made it clear to me, or -- and I think to much of the country, though apparently not a majority, that Donald Trump was intent upon breaking the system, as much as he was intent upon about upholding it. And that if the system was going to sustain itself, it had to respond in kind. And so, for me, that moment made me change that particular aspect of my belief and support the subsequent prosecutions of Trump, particularly the ones for violating -- for the actions on January 6th. And, you know, for other people, it might be different times, but I think, for example, a number of my friends see his nomination of Tulsi Gabbard, a Russian apologist, if you will, to the Intelligence Community as one of those breaking the paradigm moments that calls for breaking your own response paradigm.",

One was thenormal path of legislating around traditional democratic priorities, expanding health care, inflation reduction acts, you know, the bipartisan infrastructure act, or he could have treated this as a critical moment in which the legislative priorities should have been -- could have been strengthening the electoral guardrails against Trump, limiting the possibilities for an executive to exercise unilateral power. He chose the former of those paths, as did the Democratic majority for the first two years of his presidency. And that was, I think, in large part because they couldn't bring themselves to believe, and again, to be fair, nor could I, they couldn't bring themselves to believe that the American people would return to the aberration of Donald Trump and make him a phenomenon. So, they self-edited. They didn't do things that would have strengthened their ability to resist Trumpian excess, things like limiting executive powers, things like insulating the military against what Trump has now proposed, which is a wholesale firing of disloyal generals. Again, you know, adopting law proposals to bring in two more states that would have given them four more Democratic senators. All those would have been extreme things that we would have thought unnecessary up until a few years ago. But now, in the face of Donald Trump's promises, seem palpably essential.",

The Biden administration, in the time that is left to, it should consider every -- doing everything it possibly can to strengthen the Ukrainian hand, because we know that the first thing that Trump will do when he takes office is sell that poor country out to Vladimir Putin. Going forward, you know, I think that some of the things that we are already starting to see, like with Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker in California and Illinois of strengthening state laws as resistors to federal activity, that's not something that we would've ever thought should be done, that a state should pass laws resisting the federal government and trying to undermine federal authority. But now it seems a reasonable step to take in order to erect as many barriers as possible to, for example Trump's threat to use the National Guard to deport illegal immigrants. State law, for example, prohibiting any state's National Guard from being federalized for that purpose would be an extreme step, but one that may -- there will be considered necessary.",

Washington -- GeorgeWashington pardoned the Whiskey rebels in the Whiskey Rebellion. In the aftermath of the Civil War, Andrew Johnson pardoned the Confederate soldiers, not the leadership, but the soldiers. He even pardoned Samuel Mudd, who had given -- who had treated John Wilkes Booth after Booth assassinated Lincoln. And then, of course, you mentioned the Carter pardons after the Vietnam War and Ford's pardon. So, to some degree, I think it -- this is an effort to make peace. But to another degree, I think it's slightly different. It's the pardon to do justice in response to unjust actions by the government, by the prosecuting authorities, right? We have a history of that as well. For example, Jack Johnson, the African American boxer was prosecuted under the Mann Act for crossing state lines with his wife, who happened to be white. We pardoned him, to do justice to him individually. This will also partake, I think, if Biden does what I recommend, which I'm guessing he won't do, but we'll see. But if he does what I do, it will have that aspect of doing justice by preventing Liz Cheney, Mark Miley from William Kristol, George Conway, the whole -- Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi from being improperly and unjustly targeted with the full might of the federal government.",

I mean, you were speaking with me and all, you're sort of appropriately lawyerly restraint, but what you are suggesting is, in fact, a very radical thing for at least establishment Washington to consider.

We're not arguing about, you know, what the right tax policy is, or whether or not the EPA over regulates benzene emissions, or, you know, anything like that anymore. What is clear to me is -- well, you know, frankly, the same thing that became clear to people like me like Liz Cheney, that Donald Trump is transgressive in his nature. He is a mold breaker. And it's irresponsible not to see him as what he truly is, an existential threat to the very foundations of democracy. Now, people will say that's extreme, and I hope, like heck, that I am overstating it, overstating the threat. But I think that the course of the last eight years says not. And the course of the last two weeks, super says not, you know, as Trump begins to roll out his initiatives for the next administration.
