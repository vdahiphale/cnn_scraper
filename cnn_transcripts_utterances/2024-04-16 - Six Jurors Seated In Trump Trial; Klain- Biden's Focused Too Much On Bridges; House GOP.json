The debate and arguments today that could even impact Donald Trump's January 6 criminal case.Plus, the rather dramatic delivery on Capitol Hill today. House Republicans sending two articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over to the U.S. Senate for trial. The underlying message House Republicans are trying to send about one of the biggest issues dividing America right now. And leading this hour, day two of the New York hush money cover up case against Donald Trump going long. And on a very critical day, court was supposed to wrap for the day about half an hour ago. Let's go right to CNN's Brynn Gingras in New York. She's outside the court. Brynn, what are you hearing? Why are they still in session there?",

And now by today, at this moment, there are six that are seated, including a foreperson. So the process is continuing at this very hour.Some of the details about the six people that we know about so far, of course, they remain anonymous, but one is originally from Ireland. That person is already declared the foreperson when this case goes to trial. There's an oncology nurse, there's a corporate lawyer. There's one person who actually told the courtroom that he found Trump fascinating. There's another person who says that they appreciate Trump's candor but didn't really have strong political views. All different ages, marriage -- not -- married, not married, different sort of, you know, group of people that are right now sitting on the jury. And before that, though, there was quite a process. We know that the jurors who went through this process had to answer 42 questions. You know, where did they get their news from? What sort of -- you know, have they gone to a Trump rally? Sort of those questions. But after that, that's when both the prosecution and Trump's attorneys could really ask deeper questions to get some answers. Well, they did that. And then after a short break in court, Trumps attorneys came back and its clear that they were digging through the social medias of some of these people who were prospective jurors. In one case, they found that one juror had put on Facebook to lock him up. He was dismissed on cause by the judge. Another juror, there was video of that woman somewhat celebrating in a video posted to Facebook when Joe Biden won the election in 2020, that person was dismissed by the former president's attorneys. But all in all, remember that each side has 10 strikes and so far with the numbers, Trump's team has struck four jurors and prosecutors have struck three. Jake, this is a continuing process, right now we're going late because they're continuing with more jurors. A fresh group of 96 people went into the courtroom and they're starting that process, but likely we'll be wrapping up soon. But, Jake, big news here, six jurors now seated for this criminal trial.",

Once that prospective juror left the courtroom, the judge immediately told Trump's attorneys to basically, you know, keep control of him. He said, quote, \"I will not have jurors intimidated in my courtroom.\"So, certainly got a scolding there. For the most part, though, Jake, Trump has been very much involved.

WEIRBut at this point, I had been covering climate for a couple of years and really had a pretty dark view on the planet that my little boy had joined. So I started writing these earth day letters, and they were pretty dark and angry at the beginning. But when I deliberately strived to focus on the helpers, as Mr. Rogers told us to do in a disaster, look for the helpers, the dreamers, the doers, the entrepreneurs, started looking for solutions. Boy, my mood brightened. And it turns out there was so much out there to be hopeful about new energy streams, new ways of connecting with communities, new ideas, fundamental old ancient wisdom that if employed, can save so much life, there's so much we're saving. And in the end, I ended up collecting dozens of just practical ways to fortify our communities come what may. And because our kids can no longer take sort of air, water, a stable temperature, shelter and food supply for granted the way we did we have to rethink these things in a more sustainable, holistic way.

The way humanity did up until recent generations will connect us and be better for our mental health as well as everything else.",
