I'm Linda Kincaid with CNN Breaking News coverage of Israel at war.Take your belongings and go south. That's the message from Israel to the residents in northern Gaza as it prepares to launch a military ground operation at any moment. The U.S. is now sending a second carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean as well as additional fighter jets. The move is intended to deter Iran, Hezbollah and others are entering the conflict. On Saturday, Israel declared that it's ready to open a new phase in the war with a focus on significant ground operations. The IDF says it struck more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight, and a CNN team close to Northern Gaza has been hearing heavy machine gunfire near the border fence as well as loud explosions. Earlier Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the front lines offering words of support and telling them to be prepared. Palestinian authorities in Gaza say the death toll from Israeli airstrikes is now more than 2,300 people with more than 9,000 injured. According to the health ministry, 300 of those deaths were in the past 24 hours, the majority women and children. Thousands of Palestinians have fled to southern Gaza since Israel issue the evacuation order early Friday. It's not known how many stayed behind. But one thing is abundantly clear whether people in Gaza City choose to stay or go, no place is truly safe. We get more now from CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and a warning her report contains graphic and disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This is what running for your life looks like in Gaza. An ambulance with a young girl and wounded woman inside rocked by explosions as they attempt to flee. It is unclear what happened to the pair but they're among the tens of thousands of people on the move after Israel's military called on nearly half of Gaza's population, some 1.1 million people to get south in a matter of hours. But along the safe passages specified by the IDF, utter horror. You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Salah al-Din Street, one of the designated evacuation routes in the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings. CNN has geo located this video and four other clips from the horrifying scene. The U.N. calls Israel's evacuation advisory impossible and a violation of the rules of war. And Palestinian officials accused the IDF of bombing civilians even as they fled. Dozens of evacuees were killed or wounded by Israeli airstrikes. According to Hamas, CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza overwhelmed hospitals. And again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): What did the children do to deserve this? This woman says did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead. The only survivor is a two-year-old girl.",

For those still able to move south this is one of the neighborhoods families are expected to flee towards, Hayunes (ph), where Israeli airstrikes have wreaked havoc. This is a genocide not a war. It's genocide, this man says. And it's an attempt to force all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Finding refuge is proving dangerous and deadly. And for the many families desperate for shelter, the fear is there may be no safe places left. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Israel carrying out more than 100 strikes overnight on everything from rocket launchers, anti-tank launches to headquarters belonging to Hamas, and also the other militant group, Islamic Jihad and also targeting specific militants. They say they took out one of the commandos from the Nukhba, elite forces of Hamas as well overnight.In terms of a ground invasion, we've been talking about this, of course, ever since Hamas launched that deadly and brutal terrorist attack on Israel killing more than 1,300 people just over a week ago. We've been talking about this ground invasion being likely it's always been a question of when, rather than if. It does now seem to be imminent. And indeed, that is one way. One reason why or the main reason why Israel has been asking these Gazan civilians to evacuate from the northern part of the Gaza Strip, specifically Gaza City, to the south so that they can get out of harm's way and minimize civilian casualties. Now, as we saw, there were some civilian casualties on Friday afternoon, as people were trying to evacuate, it's unclear precisely where that strike would have come from the Palestinian saying that it was an Israeli airstrike. And we just heard the Israeli IDF spokesman speaking with you saying that the Israeli Air Force wasn't striking at the time, and it wasn't responsible for those deaths. But clearly, as we see the death toll rise in the Gaza Strip more than 2,000. Now, the feeling the fear, the expectation, is that that could rise significantly, as and when that ground invasion takes place, Lynda.",

But the somewhat rare addition of another aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean really, I think is designed to deter Iran and of course, its proxy and southern Lebanon, Hezbollah from getting directly involved.Now we've already seen some skirmishes, rockets fired from Hezbollah in southern Lebanon towards Israel, Israel retaliating. We've also seen rockets fired from Syria, and reports that Syria's airports in Aleppo and Damascus have been hit those airports, believed to be often a conduit for weapons to the radium back to a militia of Hezbollah as well. So there is every danger that there could be a Northern Front opening, according to the Israeli National Security Minister that has, excuse me, the head of National Security Council, the thresholding, in their words, for an escalation has yet to be met. But there are concerns that that could escalate that another front could open up for real in the north. And of course, at the same time, we're seeing violence rising in the Israeli occupied West Bank as well. So Israel kind of fighting on all those three fronts, things could get worse. And at the same time, there's this information war going on, and the court of public opinion, and one has seen over the past week, progressively, the more or less steadfast backing that Israel was receiving, initially kind of shifting as the civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip rises. And it wouldn't be a surprise to start seeing things like condemnations in the United Nations coming through as well that no doubt is expected by Israel, which this time round, in contrast to previous conflicts, perhaps with militants inside the Gaza Strip. I think Israel is much less concerned about the optics of what is going on. Such was the gravity of that terrorist attack on Israel just over a week ago, Lynda.",

In Europe a rise in antisemitism is worrying the Jewish community. French police say they have detained at 65 people for dozens of antisemitic acts since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. And the U.K. is increasing security after they say there was an uptick in antisemitic activity. CNN's Melissa Bell is more from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Far from the frontlines of the Israel-Hamas war, many European Jews say they're not just feeling the pain of what's happening there but also fearing the potential ramifications much closer to home. In France at the Great Synagogue in Marseille, a prayer is held for the people of Israel. It's a fervent prayer, after reports of antisemitic incidents in parts of Europe, after Hamas launched its assault on Israel more than a week ago and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza. MARC MELMOUN, WORSHIPPER (through translator): First of all, it's important to be present whenever the Jewish people are in danger. Unfortunately, we're used to this kind of gathering this kind of prayer. We're tired of it all. Nevertheless, we have to respond in unity.",
