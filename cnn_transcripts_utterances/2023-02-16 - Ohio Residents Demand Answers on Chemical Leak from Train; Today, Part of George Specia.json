We have now learned from a source telling me that Donald Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has been subpoenaed in the special counsel's investigation into January 6 and the role that Trump played that day. I'm told that the special counsel, Jack Smith, is seeking both testimony and documents from Meadows. He got the subpoena back in January.This is the latest aggressive and significant move that we have seen from Smith. It matters because Meadows, as you know, has firsthand knowledge of Trump's actions on several fronts. He was in and out of the Oval Office that day. He was on that infamous phone call that happened in December between Trump and the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffenspgerger, where Trump was pleading with him find him more votes. Meadows was also in that bananas December 2020 White House meeting about election fraud claims. He also visited a Georgia audit site as they were counting and recounting votes. He sent emails to Justice Department officials about unsubstantiated fraud claims. His attorney and the Justice Department did not comment to CNN when we asked. It's unclear how he's going to respond to the subpoena. It will likely set up a clash, though, over executive privilege given he was one of Trump's most senior aides. Meadows got his subpoena before Mike Pence got his. The former vice president, though, last night said he is going to fight that one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  I'm going to fight the Biden DOJ's subpoena for me to appear before the grand jury because I believe it's unconstitutional and it's unprecedented. I'm aware that President Trump is going to bring a claim of executive privilege. And that will be his claim to make. [07:10:00] That's his fight. My fight is on the principle of separation of powers and the Constitution of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All of this is coming as we're learning that Jack Smith, that special counsel, is locked in at least eight secret battles tied to investigations into 2020 election and Trump's handling of classified documents. Most of the disputes are under seal and outcomes, though, could have far reaching implications for reaching implications for Trump.On top of all of that also this morning, the part of the Georgia's special grand jury report on Trump's attempt to overturn election results in that state is going to be released. The recommendations on criminal charges, though, are going to still be kept secret. CNN's Sara Murray joins us now. Sara, what are we going to learn from what they will reveal today?",

But today we are going to get the special grand jury's introduction to their report, the conclusion of their report as well as a section that dug into the grand jury's concerns that's some of the witnesses who appeared, who testified before the grand jury may have actually lied in their testimony.Now, look, the grand jury has been digging into efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election for months and months, and this investigation all got started back in January of 2021 when Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Take a listen to part of that phone call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  So, what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellows, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state. The people of Georgia are angry. The people of the country are wrong there is nothing wrong with saying that you've recalculated out. SECRETARY OF STATE BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R-GA):  But, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) MURRAY:  So, that is the call that set this all into motion. And as you just saw it before, look, this is a grand jury that has heard from 75 witnesses, heard from people, from Senator Lindsey Graham to Trump's former attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to many, many others. So, we're going to get sort of a sense of the tenor of what the grand jury came away with this but we are not going to get their specific recommendations on whether anyone should face charges. If there are names in any of these sections, those are likely to be redacted today. The judge who is overseeing this special grand jury made pretty clear that he doesn't think it's fair at this point to name people publicly when no one has faced charges yet. Kaitlan?",

That is something the FAA is looking into.Now, this new incursion happened on January 23rd in Honolulu, and I want to walk you through how it played out. So, flight data shows a UNITED 777 land just ahead of a small cargo plane landing on the next runway over, and that United Flight then turns and that is when the FAA tells us the plane crossed that next runway despite being told to wait by air traffic control just ahead of where that cargo plane was landing. Now, the FAA says the two aircraft were a little more than 1,100 feet apart, so not nearly as close to colliding as in those other two incidents at JFK and Austin, and neither plane here had to actually abort takeoff or landing, which they did in those other cases. But, look, this is just adding to the list of alarming aviation incidents.
