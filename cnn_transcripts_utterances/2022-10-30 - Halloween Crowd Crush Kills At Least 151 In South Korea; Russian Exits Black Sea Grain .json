As you, say the death toll has, once again, risen; 153 people are now known to have lost their lives. There are dozens more who are in hospitals, in this area and certainly the concern is the death toll may rise even further. It is a very somber mood, a mood of shock, disbelief here in Itaewon.

We have spoken to many eyewitnesses who were here last night and have come back to pay respects and to see what had happened. One of them saying, she realized she was one of the lucky ones. She was on this particular alleyway. She was pushed into a stairwell of a bar and was able to avoid the crush. We have seen images of people trying to scale vertical walls of the building to get out of the sheer number of people that were here, as well. [05:05:00] HANCOCKS:  Eyewitnesses that we have spoken to say that there was no crowd limit, no crowd control that they could see. People just kept coming into this area, the first Halloween for three years, because of the COVID pandemic. There were no restrictions, no restrictions whatsoever, including on the sheer numbers of people coming in, with devastating consequences. I spoke to sisters, two sisters, who were traumatized. They said in shock. They had not left the area overnight. They did not know where to go. They talked about what they saw.

But people are really crowded from there to here. Beside, there were people already stuck inside. Some people were looking at the others and just faint. There was so much blood everywhere.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. KEITH STILL, CROWD RISK ANALYSIS LTD:  Once the density, the packing density, the number of people per square meter increases above six or seven, there's a high risk of shock waves, progressive crowd collapse and people toppling like dominos. The more people you have in a confined space, the greater the risk to life and limb. So it really is very much the number of people per square meter, duration of exposure, the geometry and any escape routes that might have been available. So this is a progressive crowd collapse, a crowd crush. The surge was in a crowd, with a very small amount forces but they get amplified in the crowd. So the physics here is horrendous but the analogy is simple. It's like a car tachometer. Don't run it in the red. Don't allow density to exceed that critical limit.

This huge swath of territory, where people are struggling to put food on the table and this grain crisis from Russia's war has just made it that much worse. There is also an issue in the long term not just of price but in supply. Ukraine is a hugely important grain producer, as you were showing there. There are countries like in Tunisia, we were there earlier this year, which are subsidizing their food supplies, particularly bread and wheat, heavily for the population. There has been a move by countries like Tunisia to get an emergency loan, just to afford the wheat to supply their people. You can imagine, with Russia unilaterally pulling out of this complex deal, it will just exacerbate that further. And if you look into next year's growing season and the impact this will have on the decision of Ukrainian farmers, whether to plant at all, given the fact that many of them are planting in or near front lines, they will be making very tough choices. It is not just an issue for developing countries but even rich countries are feeling the squeeze. And you have to believe that the analysis of Putin using this as political leverage to try to break up the support that Ukraine is getting, as you head into the Northern Hemisphere winter, could be a factor here and a very strong factor indeed from the Russian point of view.",

That is not to say at the school district level we did find that school districts that were closed more had modestly larger declines than those that were open.

You know every week, we got updates on what the case rates were for COVID in every community in the country.And we got updates on hospitals' rates, hospitalization rates and how many beds available. So it was easy to see, OK, where do we need to be paying more attention this week or next week. But we didn't have the same kind of information about school. It was not possible to say where the communities, where the kids are really starting to fall behind in school. We had to wait until spring of 2022 to get that information retroactively. I think if our education systems were able to do a better job monitoring kids, not that they don't monitor them. But that data is not available in a way that allows officials to make strategic decisions about where the target resources in real time, rather than having to wait and solve the problems a few years later.",
