U.S. aid is in limbo and encouraging news is hard to come by as the war in Ukraine enters its third year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON (voice-over): Those air raid sirens ringing out in Kyiv as Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, unleashing the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. This is what the city looks like now, with a makeshift memorial to fallen Ukrainians standing downtown. European Commission chief meantime, Ursula van der Leyen arrived in Kyiv Saturday morning for the anniversary. Short on troops and ammunition, Ukraine is fighting on, saying it shot down a Russian spy plane Friday. And president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Kyiv will launch a new counter offensive. With some $60 billion in U.S. aid stalled by congressional Republicans, a group of U.S. senators visited Kyiv Friday in a show of solidarity. Mr. Zelenskyy told them it's not just the future of his country that's riding on continued support from Ukraine's allies. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that message is coming through today. As you mentioned, Ursula van der Leyen, the European Commission president, has arrived in Kyiv in a show of solidarity. And she tweeted on her arrival, \"More than ever, we stand firmly by Ukraine, financially, economically, militarily, morally, until the country is finally free.\" And that message is continuing from other partners too. The U.K. has announced that it will send $300 million worth of munitions aid to Ukraine. But crucially, there is still an aid bill totaling somewhere $60 million -- $60 billion, rather, in the U.S. Congress that needs to be passed.

You have young mothers and their kids coming to this memorial with photos of their lost loved ones and just bawling their eyes out. And I mentioned this because that type of scene is being played out across Ukraine. Lychakiv cemetery in Lviv is almost bursting at the seams. You have small towns in Western Ukraine, which have no men left because they've either been killed in the front line. Then the other thing, Paula, I should mention, I'm saying for the very, very first time, pretty much this week, heads of command, commanders of brigades on the eastern front, saying that they're -- men are lacking enthusiasm, that they need reinforcements immediately, that they need ammunition immediately.

And then, if the Russians are looking toward Ukraine, from what I'm hearing from my colleagues on the field, Paula, they're not probably expecting much in terms of obstacles -- lack of trenches, this sort of thing.

Now that means Trump has exactly 30 days to put up the cash or post bond to cover the $355 million judgment and about $100 million in interest in order to be able to appeal the verdict.Trump has said he does plan to appeal. Judge Arthur Engoron rejected a request from Trump to delay the official judgment for 30 days. The judge said Trump did not explain or justify a reason for that delay. Now in just a few hours, U.S. Republicans in the state of South Carolina will go to the polls to choose a presidential nominee. Trump has maintained his commanding lead in the polls. But rival Nikki Haley insists she's not bowing out. South Carolina's primaries are open, so people don't have to be registered as Republicans in order to participate. The only requirement is that they did not vote in the state's Democratic primary that was held earlier this month. Now some see former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as betting it all on her home state, a primary contest that ranks among the most important in this nominating season. A loss there could spell the beginning of the end for Trump's lone rival, who has yet to win a primary race and is currently trailing Trump in the South Carolina polls. But she vows to stay in the race no matter what. Here's what she said to supporters at a rally last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We had 14 people in this race. I defeated a dozen other fellows. I just have one more fellow I got to catch up to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Nikki Haley also telling them that it's important for them to show up at the polls tomorrow, even if the voters aren't typically ones who vote in primaries. They just vote in generals, she's urging them to show up because the stakes couldn't be higher. Now Nikki Haley has said earlier in the week that she will go on, she'll keep her campaign alive on Sunday the day after the South Carolina primary, effectively, no matter what happens here in the state. But the stakes are incredibly high for her because it is her home state, because she hasn't won any of the first three contests in the Republican primary contests.

And she has emerged as the number two in this contest. I do see her staying in it, although I'm not sure what that's going to do. I think what we have to look for is how big this lead is going to be. It could be just a monstrous defeat by Donald Trump. He's ahead in the polls over 30 points. But she might do better than expected. There would be have to be some sort of massive polling error if that was true. But if she does better than expected, she's going to use that to justify the reason why she's she should stay in the race. And she's going to keep hammering this idea that if she were to go head-to-head with Joe Biden, she would probably have a better chance of defeating Joe Biden than Trump would. And that's something that she'll have to connect with with voters. But the problem is in the primaries, of course. The voters are more extreme and more rapid and more committed to Donald Trump.",

I can't imagine a case where Donald Trump doesn't win the nomination. And of course, Biden is going to win the nomination on the Democratic side.And it looks like it's going to be really close because of the polling that we're seeing in some of these swing states. Like you mentioned, like Michigan, like Arizona, like Georgia, which became a swing state and Biden was able to win in 2020. And we're seeing right now the polling is not good for Joe Biden. And his campaign is really going to have an uphill battle to win some of these states. And we're seeing with some of the foreign policy events going on, like the war in Gaza and the state of Michigan, which has some 250,000 plus air voters. This could affect Joe Biden at the margins there. I mean, Biden won the state of Michigan by only 178,000 votes. So it's going to be an incredibly close contest, a very nasty, ugly contest. And it's also a contest that most Americans are not particularly excited about. NEWTON: And it's a good point that they're not excited about it. They don't want this rematch.
