      "sentences": "Well, Isabel, there have been questions swirling around what may have caused this plane crash early on Wednesday. Certainly, a lot of speculation. Of course, as you mentioned, we are now learning, according to a report published by Reuters just a short while ago, citing multiple unnamed sources that the crash may have been caused or the plane, rather, may have been downed by Russian air defense systems.Now, that sort of speculation, those allegations, were reflected earlier this morning by a Ukrainian official within the defense and security department putting out a tweet on X earlier today, accusing, of course, Russia of downing the plane, using potentially missiles. We'd also, of course, heard accusations that Russia had failed to close the airspace over Grozny in the Russian region of Chechnya, where the plane was, in fact, supposed to be heading. But again, no clear confirmation just yet from officials. This is very much an ongoing investigation. The Kazak government has set up a commission to carry out this investigation to examine the evidence in the moments, of course, led to this crash, and we've seen the video emerging, showing essentially the plane circling the airfield before it appears to make a nosedive and crashing into the ground, bursting into flames. So, there is a lot, of course, to be examined. That investigation is ongoing. But, this is certainly troubling reporting that we are hearing now from Reuters, again, citing those unnamed sources that this crash may have been caused by Russian air defense systems. And of course, there had been questions after video and images emerged of the wreckage in the aftermath, showing holes in the fuselage. Now, it's not clear what may have caused those holes. It appears to look similar to perhaps the impact of shrapnel, but again, no clear confirmation just yet. And officials from Russia, from Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, all three nations, of course, with passengers on board that plane connected with this crash, have called on people not to speculate, to wait for the full results of that investigation. We certainly will be keeping an eye on those updates from officials as they come in. But, of course, this is a tragic moment of mourning for many, 38 people killed in that crash. Remarkably, 29 people survived the crash. We saw that video of those survivors emerging from the wreckage, many of them injured. Of course, we know some are still said to be in a critical condition. We're still waiting to hear more updates from officials with regards to the status of those survivors as well. But, certainly, a lot of questions persisting, as we wait for that investigation to be completed.",

      "sentences": "Let me talk you through who exactly Trump is nominating to this increasingly key post in his administration. His name is Kevin Marino Cabrera. He is a Miami-Dade County Commissioner. In fact, he is someone who won his seat in part because of an endorsement from Donald Trump two years ago. And while he was on that commission, he sponsored legislation that would rename a state in Miami-Dade after Donald Trump. He also represented Florida on the Republican National Committee Platform Committee at the convention where they wrote a very pro-Trump, pro-MAGA playbook for Trump's next term that was heavily influenced by Trump's campaign. And lastly, he also worked on Trump's campaign all the way back in 2020.So, he is someone who is obviously very close to Donald Trump, close to his inner circle, and trusted by him to carry out what is potentially a critical mission, although I will say at this point, we have very few details about what Trump actually wants to extract from Panama, what he actually intends to do there. Anything short of -- anything that would require seizing the canal back would potentially require military intervention, and Trump is someone who has been calling for the U.S. to pull back some of its military engagements throughout the world. Would he really be interested in sending troops to get back an asset that has been in Panama control for a quarter century? In fact, Panama, Isabel, in the next five days here is about to celebrate 25 years of full autonomous control of the canal, and have taken many steps to ease U.S. commerce there over the last two decades. It's been a delicate but productive treaty for both sides for many, many decades, with Trump, as he did in his first term, throwing a wrench in those plans and trying to get a better deal for the U.S. here.",

Steve, does it seem more likely that President-elect Trump would go the full route of control of the Panama Canal, or is it him sort of trying to do better negotiation for the fees on those American ships going down the waterway, as he has spoken about at length on social media posts? Is there any indication of that?",

And so, they are surprised, as many Americans are, to see this being a forefront issue over the holidays here.But, look, Donald Trump often throws out these threats and then tries to get someone to the negotiating table so he can claim victory. He did that earlier in his transition, with these threats that he would impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, getting them both to reach out to him. They had conversations with Trump, and then Trump, without really getting much extracted from them, went on to claim victory. And so, it's not clear if that is his intention here.

The journalists were sleeping in -- inside of a vehicle parked outside of Al-Awda Hospital when they were hit, according to other journalists at the scene. Here is a vehicle right here. It belonged to a Gaza-based television channel affiliated with the Palestine Islamic Jihad militant group. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out that strike, but said it was targeting a terrorist cell Meantime, Hamas and Israel are blaming each other for the failure to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Here is Israel's defense minister.

In Gaza too, we will ensure that there are security spaces, buffer zones and command posts that will ensure the security of the communities.

And those engines, they were made by GE. They are extraordinarily safe, extraordinarily robust, and they're designed to contain that kind of failure. So, it looked much more similar to the Malaysia Flight 17 accident in 1990 -- 2014, in which a Russian separatist group launched an air -- a missile -- a surface-to-air missile, and took down the plane, killing almost 300 people, and the Dutch investigated that accident, rebuilt the nose of the plane and it showed the tell-tale impact of multiple pieces of shrapnel.

There may have been drone attacks earlier in the day. People were on edge, and they simply make a decision that they regret later. And America has done that. In 1988, a U.S. warship, the Vincennes, shot down an airbus -- Iranian airbus after taking off from Tehran and mistook it for a fighter jet. So, these things can happen.

That could continue across parts of the south today. Dallas, Houston, Memphis could have some problems as those storms continue to ignite. The Pacific Northwest will have problems not just today, but through the rest of the week. We have an atmospheric river bringing just a series of storms. So, we could be looking at some problems in the air from Seattle to Portland and down towards San Francisco.Starting on the West Coast, we've got rain and snow coming on shore, pretty much all day already. We've got winter storm warnings in effect, where we could get another foot of snow possible in the highest elevations. This is coming with winds up to 60 miles per hour. So, that will -- those gusts will blow around and snow drop the visibility, and could cause some problems with downed trees and power lines. All this continues as we go through the day today, and then again into tomorrow and through the weekend, because we just keep this machine going with storms just right -- one right behind each other, like train cars. You've got two to four inches of rain possible along the coast, about a foot of snow possible in the highest elevations of the mountains. And that's just through Friday. We'll have additional storms rolling through as we go into the weekend. We have another storm along the Gulf Coast that is continuing to feed off of some of that daytime heat and humidity. It's actually quite muggy around Texas today. We've got these showers and storms rolling into Dallas, and they're packing a punch with the flooding. We now have a flash flood warning in effect for Dallas. It's in effect for more than two million people, where we could have some heavy rain, leading to some flash flooding. Again, there has already been some slowdowns at the airports there this morning. We now have an enhanced risk, a level three out of five for severe weather from Houston and points to the east. This is where we can have a couple of tornadoes today. We're talking damaging winds, large hail and a tornado threat as we go through the afternoon. Kind of a rare threat to see in December, but that will cause some travel headaches there, you can see, that could be moderate. Notice again, the West Coast just keeps it going. All of this moves east as we get towards the weekend. By Saturday, we could be looking at problems across the south from Nashville over towards Atlanta, and then it spreads up and down the East Coast. On Sunday, as the storm moves east, you'll have some soggy conditions from D.C. to New York and Boston. So, all things to watch for, again, as this storm just flourishes and continues to work its way east, through Friday and into the weekend, and notice all of those airplanes on the West Coast. We just keep that atmospheric river pumping as we go into the weekend. Sunday, a lot of return home trips will be on the wet side of things. Boston, New York, D.C., all could have some problems with some of that rain. Again, through the weekend, we're looking at multiple feet of snow, and some of those rain totals even by the end of the weekend could be approaching 10 inches for parts of the West Coast. Isabel.",
