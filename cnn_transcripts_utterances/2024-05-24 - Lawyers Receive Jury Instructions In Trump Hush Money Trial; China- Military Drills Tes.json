This as Trump goes out of his way today to insult the judge and Biden gears up to unleash a new fresh round of attacks. Plus, seizing power. That's what China says it's now training for as its ships and aircraft surround Taiwan. Is the U.S. about to be drawn into a war with China? And an OUTFRONT investigations, CNN tracking down a wealthy Trump supporter who's now leading a high-profile campaign to block a law designed to protect election workers. Why? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Boris Sanchez, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news: the lawyers and the Trump hush money case have now received those all important jury instructions -- instructions which are key to the verdict. They explained to the jury what it must find a convict Donald Trump on 34 criminal charges. Now this new development comes as Trump is hurling new insults at Judge Juan Merchan, calling him corrupt and deeply conflicted. And while Trump is on a rare break from the courtroom, he's still fixated on the trial that could ultimately make him a convicted felon, the first former president and major party presidential contender to hold that dubious title. Just a short time ago, Trump writing online, quote, I am being incorrectly an unconstitutionally prosecuted because I called a legal expense a legal expense. And the attacks continuing.

Will we even get a decision next week?But eventually, the trial is going to end and the campaign knows that the coverage of the trial is also going to slow it down. And that they think will give them an opportunity and more of an opening than they have had in recent weeks to really try to make their case. And I'm told that they do believe that the end of the Trump trial is going to basically coincide with what they see as a more aggressive phase of their campaigns. So, we are talking about the kinds of ads that they ran. We, of course, saw two new ads earlier today. One of them which you played earlier in the show, and also just the messaging and the rhetoric that we are going to hear from the campaign, is going to be more ramped up, including what we will hear from directly from the president himself. And, of course, you know, no matter what happens next week, the campaign is going to have to calibrate and decide what is our messaging going to be, what exactly is our strategy going to be depending on, again, exactly what happens next week. But I am told whether he is a convicted felon or not, whether he is guilty or not, the campaigns basic thrust of the message and making the case against Donald Trump. That is not going to change. And just the final thing that I would note, too, a reality that the campaign is grappling with that I think is just so core to how the Biden campaign is thinking about everything, is that the vast majority of voters they believe still do not believe that it is going to come down to Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and they want to convince more voters as many voters as possible before November that it is going to be Donald Trump on the ballot.",

Number one, was Donald Trump primarily motivated, or seriously motivated by the political pressures of the campaign to pay off Stormy Daniels and keep her quiet? The answer to that question was yes from his own friends, not from Michael Cohen, David Pecker, Hope Hicks, and others. That's checked that box. They can convict without even hearing Michael Cohen. The second one is did Donald Trump lie? You just saw him when he described the $35,000 a month checks that he signed and sent to Michael Cohen while sitting president. Did he lie when he called them legal fees rather than reimbursements for the advances that Michael paid for the hush money and for other things? The answer is, don't believe Michael Cohen, believe Allen Weisselberg's handwritten notes in which he took $110,000 doubled it, and then described in his own handwriting that that doubling is a reimbursement to Michael Cohen.

If you're a RFK person who's being pulled out of the previous Biden camp. I find it hard to believe you'd be going back to Biden. But I think Trump has a fighting chance of getting them back. And that's obviously why Trump is going to speak at this convention because he thinks he can have a conversation with them. So I do expect -- if RFK makes some ballots, I expect him to get some votes and I expect both campaigns to be scrambling to try to recover those people for the rest of the year. SANCHEZ: Okay. Just a few minutes ago, the DNC put out a statement bashing Kennedy, saying, in part, quote, much like his campaign for president, RFK Jr.'s speech today was a bizarre and poorly received exercise in narcissism.

So I think, you know, what you've seen the Democrats do from the outset is to continue to try to define RFK Jr. to continue to try to bring forward some of the most outrageous things that he said about vaccines, you know, and really not allow him to skate along as this undefined avatar for a third choice who isn't either Trump or Biden.

At the time, it seemed a little bit ambition, but truthfully, over the last 20 years, they have mastered some of the arts of what they're doing.

There were a lot of films today of Chinese aircraft going over the Taiwan zone, something that has happened before, but Taiwan for the first time is filmed those aircraft and they have seen more and more dangerous since, as Will Ripley just reported, there has been a new election of a new Taiwanese president who is trying to ensure the sovereignty and freedom of the Taiwan people.",
