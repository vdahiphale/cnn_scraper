There is an hour to go of trading on Wall Street, but gasping our way to the end.I don't think we'll be too disappointed to see the day over, off 230 points, good gains earlier in the week, but they are now being wiped off the market. So it's an end of the week, downer, if you will, and there are lots of reasons why including this particular event. An historic strike has targeted three major US car makers, all at the same time. President Biden is speaking out in support of the workers. More than a hundred ships racing to pass through the Panama Canal as a drought means traffic has to slow down. And the scourge of shrinkflation, Carrefour goes on the offensive to warn customers about smaller portions. I promise you, there will be some good news, I think. Live from New York, Friday, September the 15th. There you are, that's the good news. It's Friday. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. One of the most powerful unions in the United States is now taking unprecedented action against America's Big 3 carmakers. Members of the United Auto Workers, UAW have walked off the job at three plants, including this Stellantis factory in Ohio, where they were greeted by cheers. Others have targeted a Ford plant in Michigan and a GM factory in Missouri. It is the first time the union has fought all three car companies at the same time. This morning, President Biden voiced his support for the workers and was urging quick resolutions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just three miles down the road, the Stellantis factory where right now, there are right around 15 picketers outside each and every gate and they are going to be there 24/7 for the foreseeable future. There are roughly 13,000 auto workers now on strike across the United States as the gap between the UAW union and the Big 3 automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis seems to still be wide. We were told last night by the head of the Auto Workers Union, that there would be no bargaining today, that today is about picketing, striking, demonstrating and that they would likely be back at the table on Saturday.

These days, you have to worry not just about what happens when you aggressively hike interest rates to low inflation, what happens to growth? But what happens to financial stability? And what the central banks are worried about is if you -- if you go too hard at this, not only do you increase the risk of recession, but you also increase the risk of financial instability. So, that's -- now, that's another issue, which should, and you and I can discuss this for a long time is what is the right inflation target? I, for one, don't think two percent is the right inflation target. We are living through major supply changes. We are living through a different process of globalization. The labor markets have skill mismatches, companies are looking to diversify the supply chains, and we have an energy transition. And a world like that, two percent is not the right target right now.",

Now, there is always a way to have one decide one way or another,because it is one of the world's busiest commercial waterways. This time, the bottleneck is really broken. Although it's never been as bad. It stems from a dry summer in what's usually a rain-soaked region. The administrators warn that further drought conditions could make the backlog even worse. And while the disruptions haven't had major impacts yet, the longer this goes on, the trouble it spells for consumers' supply chain. CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports from Havana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Panama Canal is running low on water. A persistent drought caused in part by the El Nino weather pattern has left water levels dangerously depleted. Now, the global supply chain is under threat, as a holiday season approaches. The 80 Kilometer waterway connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and is a vital route for transporting goods. Handling an estimated five percent of the world trade. The canal was completed in 1914, revolutionizing how goods can be transported. And further expanded in 2016 to meet the skyrocketing demands of global commerce. But over the last 20 years, decreasing rainfall has reduced the water level of Panama's Lake Gatun. From 27 meters above sea level to 24 meters. RICAURTE VASQUEZ, ADMINISTRATOR, PANAMA CANAL AUTHORITY (through translator): Call it climate change, whatever you want to call it. The true fact is that precipitation levels are changing. And as I have said repeatedly, the Panama Canal is the only global maritime route that uses freshwater. OPPMANN (voice over): Canal officials have imposed draft restrictions, forcing ships to lighten their load. A ship's draft limit is the minimum depth of water it can safely navigate. And if a ship is carrying too much cargo, it risks getting trapped in the canal. Since May, ships have had to reduce their cargo by as much as 25 percent. The Panama Canal Authority has also limited the number of vessels authorized to enter the canal each day, creating a bottleneck with some ships waiting as long as 14 days to get through. As of Tuesday, 116 vessels were waiting to pass. The canals administrator warns the number of authorized vessels could decrease further the drought continues into next year.",
