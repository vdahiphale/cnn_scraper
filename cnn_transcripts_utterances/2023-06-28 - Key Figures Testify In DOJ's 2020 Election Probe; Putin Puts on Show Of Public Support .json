But it comes after a day in which more reporting is emerging suggesting the split and dangers from his own military top brass.I spoke to a European intelligence official who said it was possible that there had been prior knowledge amongst the Russian military and security establishment of this insurrection. He said they heard of hints to that effect and that possibly some of those people had, in fact, wanted to see how it played out, or even see it succeed and that Putin's prestige had been damaged and that may well have been what these differing factions in the Moscow elite had indeed sought.

He could have put a stop to it. He let it kind of boil over because he thought that he could useful initially as a foil to put pressure the Ministry of Defense to do more, to be more effective in his work. He doesn't have firm control over his own elites that he's nurtured and developed for a long time and he's -- in a lot of ways, he needs to demonstrate that to himself, to the elites and, frankly, around the world as some strength.

And he also did this, he put out a fundraising text messaging e-mail. We actually have it for you here, we'll show you from a source, where he says, Trump is the strongest opponent to Biden, so clearly here trying to counter that narrative.

You have to remember this is not the first time that McCarthy has said something that has really sparked ire in Trump world. We actually have a photo, and you'll remember this kind of an infamous photo, of Trump and McCarthy at Mar-a-Lago.

But I really heard what McCarthy said more of someone as the speaker of the House that wasn't a bash on Trump, but it was more he's not going to take sides in a primary, but anything short of a full- throated endorsement for Donald Trump is critical. And in terms of the backlash of this, speaking with many people in the House, it's more in the media and the talking class, because, look, the House caucus is similar to Republicans across the country. There are those that support Trump, and in the House caucus, there are members of the House, there's the Freedom Caucus, those people tend to be more supportive of Ron DeSantis.

We were just coming out of the great recession and people were still reeling from it, even though, objectively, lots of progress had been made and we were moving in the right direction.What we learned was you can't jawbone people into feeling better, but what you can do is report with some humility the progress that you've made. And in this case, look, Biden's cut unemployment in half. He's passed some landmark bills that will help the economy in the long-term and will help working people in the long-term with the infrastructure bill, manufacturing bills and so on. So, I understand their frustration because they want some credit for that, but you can't get out in front of people. So, I think what they've decided is if they don't go out and claim some credit, no one else is going to give it to them, and we'll see that works out. One other thing, Wolf, just on the point about McCarthy, I think more than anything else, what this reflects is the fact that Donald Trump is still the dominant figure in the Republican Party. What McCarthy said is absolutely true. Trump would not be the strongest candidate for the Republican Party in 2024 given -- we don't know how many indictments he'll be under by the time the primaries roll around. But, you know, McCarthy needs Trump and needs his base of support that Freedom Caucus is deeply committed to Trump and McCarthy got out over his skis and had to pull them back, and he's done that several times now.

Our own CNN poll shows that 76 percent of Americans feel that the economic conditions are poor in this country. And just because President Biden says things are good doesn't make it so.

The White House says he recently began using a CPAP machine to treat sleep apnea, something the administration acknowledged after the president appeared this morning with indentations from straps on his cheeks.Let's bring in CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner. Dr. Reiner, thanks for joining us. Biden first disclosed his sleep apnea diagnosis back in 2008. What exactly is this condition? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: So, first of all, sleep apnea is super common. It's estimated that at least 30 million adults, mostly between the ages of 30 and 70, have it. And it's basically a condition where during sleep the muscles that support the structures in the airway relax, which allows the airway to collapse during sleep. When that happens, the person will stop breathing, sometimes for ten seconds or more. And the effect of that is that when the person stops breathing and their oxygen drops and their carbon dioxide rises, they will be awakened with basically a startle response. This can happen over and over and over again dozens of times an hour. The person with sleep apnea may not even know they have it. But the net effect is they don't get truly restful sleep. And people with sleep apnea often wake up with a headache, have what's called hyper somulance, increased somulance during the day where by midday they feel like they need to get a nap. Maybe they fall asleep driving home. It's super common. And we see particularly in men, it increases with increasing age, more common with increasing age, and also with increasing weight. And I'm glad that the president is going to be treated. He'll likely feel a lot better after more effective and restful sleep.",

I think if we're looking to optimize -- if we want the president of the United States to have a sort of optimum health and he's been diagnosed with CPAP, you would want him to use this. Look, if I were in the president's physician and the president was going into what is likely to be a very, very busy campaign, I would look to optimize his health condition.And to do that, I'd make sure that he's eating right. And the president certainly looks fairly thin. I'd make sure that he's exercising. We've seen the president riding a bike, and he certainly appears to be fit. And the final aspect of optimizing his health would be maximizing his sleep. Remember, the first campaign was during the pretty hot days of the pandemic, and there wasn't a lot of travel. But during the upcoming campaign with -- we're obviously in a different condition relative to the virus, the president is likely to be traveling a lot. And I'd be looking for ways, you know, around the margin to improve his health. I think this is a smart thing to do.",

In that post, he said she developed this infection, which, of course, led to that stay in the ICU.He noted her health was improving. But the singer does remain under medical care. A full recovery is expected. A source close to the singer tells CNN she's out of the ICU, she is recovering. We do know this, though, Wolf, she had a tour, her 12th tour, the celebration tour. It was set to kick off July 15th in Vancouver. We now know, again, from that statement from her manager that she's going to need to pause not only on that tour but on all commitments understandably. This was a pretty ambitious tour, too, Wolf. So, they said it was set to kick off July 15th in Vancouver, 84 shows scheduled across North America and Europe through January of 2024 as everyone, of course, is expressing their well wishes, plenty of that being seen on social media in reaction, hoping that she recovers quickly. And, of course, we'll be watching for not only more information on her condition but also whether there will be more information on plans when she may be able to resume that tour.",
