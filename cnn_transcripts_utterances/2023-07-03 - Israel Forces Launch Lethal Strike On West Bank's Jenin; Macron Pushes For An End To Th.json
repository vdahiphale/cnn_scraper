You'll recall just the other week that one of those took out some Israeli military vehicles on another incursion, another operation going on there. So far, Israel says that it's actually killed seven militants. This operation has been going on since about 1:00 a.m. local time. So now for the past seven hours, and according to the IDF, there is no timeline, there is no particular endpoint. They are going to operate in there for as long as they feel the need to do so.

And then there were reports just yesterday, saying that actually, he was potentially going to revive them.Of course, this controversy surrounds the effectively neutering the Supreme Court's ability to throw out laws that it deems as unconstitutional from the Israeli Knesset or parliament and also giving the government of the day the power to choose the judges that would sit on the Supreme Court. So these protests today are planned to take place at Ben Gurion International Airport. This to all intents and purposes is Israel's main endpoint and outpoint for international passengers are about 90,000 due to come in and go out today, on more than 500 flights. The protesters say that they are upping the ante, if you like in their protests against this judicial overhaul. They're planning to block rows going to and from the airport. They're advising passengers to travel by train, and really just to try to show that they are still there that they are still protesting and that Netanyahu is government's plans for this judicial overhaul need to be revised and put to bed and these protests have now been going on for something like six months. But protesting at the airport, not the first time that it's happening, but certainly it's not something that happens every week and the protesters will be wanting to make their voices heard. Israel for its part is determined. The government says As determined to ensure that there's no disruption to flights. [01:05:03] Although there are expectations that there will be delays and as I say that passengers have been advised to avoid going to the airport certainly later on in the day by car and to go there by train instead.

How worried are you? DR. SHIVANI AGARWAL, FLEISCHER INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND METABOLISM: I am very worried the numbers are staggering.

That blows my mind, surely prevention is better than a trillion dollars spent on treatment, not to mention lives lost. DR. AGARWAL: I totally agree. Unfortunately, our health care systems and the way that we even practice medicine is not built for prevention, right. So, we create problems and then we try to fix those problems.
