Now one is in the city of Kharkiv where officials say Russian strikes destroyed a three-story residential building and damaged two other ones. Nine people were wounded in the attack, which also started a fire that was later put out.Ukraine is also reporting a massive drone attack on its Odessa region. The drone's damaged port infrastructure and a grain facility on the Danube River, which Ukraine uses for grain exports. Now all of that's coming on the heels of one of Russia's most horrific attacks since the war began. Kyiv says a Russian missile hit the village of Hroza on Thursday, killing at least 51 people. It happened while the victims were holding a wake for a fallen Ukrainian soldier. Ukrainian prosecutors say there were absolutely no military targets in the area at the time. For more, Nic Robertson joins us from London. So just a horrific attack, Nic. What more are we learning? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yeah, a tiny village, a population about 330 before the war and population now perhaps 150 to 200, according to local officials, about 40 kilometers from the front line. So really not a place you would expect to be targeted. The Russians have had a big offensive in that part of eastern Ukraine over recent months and closer to the front line. Ukrainian officials have asked women, children, elderly people to leave the area if they can, but not that particular village. So the funeral was underway when this high-precision, high explosive Russian missile slammed into the cafe and shopped there the store. What happened was devastating and the pictures that you're going to see are quite disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Rushing to recover survivors. Emergency workers scramble through rubble in one of the deadliest Russian strikes since the war began. Children among the victims, an eight-year-old boy killed, many attending a funeral when the precision guided Iskander missile hit a cafe and store.

What more can you tell us about that?ROBERTSON (on-camera): Yeah, in 2018 Putin announced that he was going to be developing this sort of new range of ballistic missiles and this is one of them, potentially the longest range, the Borovetsnik. It can or will be used according to Russian officials as not a first strike weapon but a second strike because it can go up in the sky, it can go further than previous missile systems and it will carry a nuclear warhead as well, which gives it very destructive capabilities and they say that this would be used in a sort of second wave of strikes to make sure that there was nothing left standing after the first wave. So it's a concern but we do know that during the development of this missile system, although Putin says it's ready to go, we do know that during the development it's had a lot of problems and a lot of issues and some of the other missile systems, the Kinzhal, a hypersonic missile that Russia's developed over the past couple of years, is effective, is hypersonic but it doesn't quite live up to the hype that Russia has put on it, if you will, and it's still able to be taken down by a patriot system, for example, as we saw seen recently in Ukraine.",

But I'll take you through a bit of what the country's attorney general said earlier on Thursday in making this announcement. He accused Juan Guaido and the interim government that he led in that country from 2019 to 2022, he accused them of tapping into the resources of the state-run oil company and using that money to pay for some of the interim government's projects and some of its legal bills. You'll remember Guaido in 2019 was recognized by the United States in a broad international coalition as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And in the years that followed, he led an interim government, a transitional government as the interim president, up until late last year when the opposition there actually dissolved the government, the opposition government. He's now living in Miami in exile and he's actually teaching college courses there and he responded forcefully to these allegations in a live stream, calling them false accusations and questioning the timing of them just a few weeks outside of primary elections that the opposition is going to be holding down in Venezuela. Take a little listen to a little bit more of what he had to say about Nicolas Maduro, the country's president. JUAN GUAIDO, FORMER VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): So no Maduro.

Just last month, we saw National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan meet with Wang Yi, China's top diplomat in Malta. And then of course, in June, we saw Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meet with Xi Jinping himself here in Beijing. So the framework for this meeting is certainly being built. With that said, there are certainly some profound differences between these two nations, profound differences on issues such as Taiwan, such as human rights, such as some of the economic trade and technology issues. And that's why these meetings that are taking place now are so crucial, because it will establish points where there are agreement, but also points of disagreement.

To the Taliban, they are criminals defying a ban on female education. But these students say they're determined to continue their schooling no matter the cost. Two of them told us why. I've told myself that even if the Taliban arrest me, I will stand up and tell them I don't want to be kept at home. She says, I just want to learn and that is not a crime.

MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: All classified information is provided to those only with a need to know and every president needs to know a lot of stuff to help them in decision- making. But that need to know also comes with a requirement not to disclose. If he was truly talking about capabilities, as Maggie said, about the nuclear part, the sea-based part of our nuclear triad, I would suspect, and I don't know this for sure, that they are at the higher levels of security clearances, either top secret or code word when you're talking about the nuclear force. That puts the country, and as the secretary said, it puts service members in harm's way when he's giving up capabilities. And one other thing I'd add to that, if this alleged incident did occur, and it seems that it did, this is just one incident that's being reported. How many other times at Mar-a-Lago or one of his golf courses did he lean into somebody and put other secrets in our citizens in danger because he's given up other secrets?

UNKNOWN (through translator): There's an emerging phenomenon, but we've been seeing an increase in infestations for about 20 years now. It's happened gradually because there's no miracle product to combat bed bugs. But today, in these last few weeks, there's clearly been a media phenomenon of psychosis created around bed bugs. BELL (voice-over): And the media interest says as much about Paris as it does about the bugs themselves. With Fashion Week on as well as the Rugby World Cup and soon the 2024 Summer Olympics, the issue is also one of image. Bed bugs are after all about as universal as it gets, but France now knows that it needs answers urgently. OLIVIER VERAN, FRENCH GOVERNMENT SPOKESPERSON (through translator): We need to give the French people an answer. Is there or isn't there a clear upsurge in bed bugs since when and where?
