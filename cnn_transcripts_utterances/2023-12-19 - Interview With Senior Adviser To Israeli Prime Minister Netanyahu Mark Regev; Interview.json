We'll have a special report. And Israel's closest allies voice concerns about the country's wartime conduct. Mark Regev joins me. He's senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister. Then, a look ahead at 2024 with the economist Tom Standage. He tells Hari Sreenivasan next year could be a make-or-break moment for democracy. And finally, the other Ukraine war to save a priceless piece of Jewish heritage. Historian Jonathan Brent joins me. Welcome to the program everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As casualties continue to mount in Gaza, Israel's allies are also continuing to mount criticism about surging settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The U.K., France, and the United States are all calling on it to end and slapping travel bans and sanctions on some extremist settlers. This comes as the European Union, Britain, and 13 other countries, including Australia and Canada, release a joint statement saying \"Israel's failure to protect Palestinians and prosecute extremist settlers has led to an environment of near complete impunity in which settler violence has reached unprecedented levels.\" And according to the United Nations, this year has been the deadliest on record since 2005 for Palestinians in the West Bank. 477 have been killed, with more than half happening after October 7th. Correspondent Nima Elbagir has this special report from Hebron. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): We stop at a service station in the occupied Palestinian West Bank. A man in military fatigues demands to check our I.D.s.",

So, the family would understand that they're not playing. It's a serious threat of killing if you don't leave your home. That lead for like 35 families to leave and these settlers have been wearing uniform also. ELBAGIR (voice-over): Settlers have heavyweight support in Israel's far- right government. Itamar Ben-Gvir, minister for national security, settler. After the Hamas October 7 attack, Ben-Gvir loosened gun permit regulations, making it easier for tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to bear arms. Bezalel Smotrich, minister of finance, settler. Also, post attack, pushed through over a hundred million U.S. dollars for West Bank security, including funds for training and equipping settler security squads. But it's not just arming and equipping. We witnessed firsthand some of the restrictions the IDF imposed on Palestinians.

For the sake of a five-minute walk. Now, I have to go around a one-hour journey. ELBAGIR (voice-over): Since the 1990s, the City of Hebron has seen many curfews. The day we visited, there was a curfew in place from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Ihtidal (ph) has to go through this checkpoint. Palestinians have to be searched. Settlers aren't normally checked. Ihtidal (ph) has to walk, settlers can drive. Palestinians need permission for visitors, settlers don't. The IDF says all these measures are in accordance with their security assessments to provide security for all residents. Settlers and Palestinians live side by side, but the rules for each are very different. Faiza (ph) and her husband have lived in this house for 14 years. They inherited it from her husband's grandparents. Their house is overlooked by an IDF sentry post, yet they fear for their safety. FAIZA, HEBRON RESIDENT (through translator): This scene is so inappropriate and depressing for our home. You can see up here what we've had to put in place to protect ourselves from the settlers. ELBAGIR (voice-over): As we leave Faiza's house, we get stopped by an Israeli soldier. He says we're not allowed to walk along the main road.

The overwhelming majority of them are not involved in violence in any way. We're talking about a very, very small minority.

This is a time to cause terrorist incidents. And we've been preempting -- and there have been gunfights where when we can arrest people peacefully, we of course do that.

We didn't expect to see hostages walking around the streets. And there was obviously -- they perceived these three men as a threat and that's why they were killed. But it is unacceptable. And we've made changes now to the instructions of our soldiers so this won't happen again. But for Israelis, it was the worst thing, as you said, in any combat situation, especially in urban combat, where you've got close quarters fighting in an urban area, you'll often -- unfortunately, you'll get friendly fire incidences where you kill your own people. This was even worse because we didn't kill a soldier, we killed civilians who had been -- I mean, close to 70 days they had been held by Hamas.

There have been many, many surrenders of Hamas terrorists. We're close, we believe, to a collapse there. In the south, because we started our operation a bit later, it'll take a little more time.

We uphold the rules of law. That's why we asked civilians to vacate areas of combat because we didn't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire. And while Israel makes an effort, a maximum effort, to try to avoid hurting civilians, of course, Hamas has the absolute opposite strategy. As our IDF spokesperson said yesterday, for us, it's a tragedy when a civilian is killed, for Hamas, it's their strategy. For us, a tragedy, for them, a strategy. And that's why they've embedded themselves using Gaza civilians as a human shield. Not just Israel says so. The E.U. says so. The U.K. says so. The U.S. says so.

It was precisely-- not because Hamas suddenly became humanitarians, they released them because they were facing a lot of military pressure from the Israeli Defense Forces and they were desperate for a timeout, for a ceasefire. And we said we will agree only to a ceasefire if you release people, and I think that forced their hand. And that could be repeated in the future, that's not impossible.

So, at \"The Economist,\" our sister company, the EIU, actually preparessomething called a democracy index, and it gives every democracy around the world a score. And some countries are classed as full democracies. So, if I'm talking to you from London, and we're going to have an election in Britain in 2024, and it seems very likely that the current government will be chucked out. Now, that's, you know, one of the features of democracy that you should be able to vote to change the government or change the leadership. And if you go to the other end of the spectrum, we also know there's going to be an election in Russia in 2024, and I could tell you what the result of that election is going to be right now. Vladimir Putin is going to be -- he's going to win. He's going to continue to be president of Russia, and he wouldn't be having that election at all unless he was sure that he could guarantee that outcome. So, that's not a democracy. That is a sham. And then, you have lots of other countries in the middle that sort of are more or less authoritarian. And then, sort of right at the top, just below the full democracies, you get the flawed democracies. And I have to say that the two biggest democracies in the world, India and the United States, both of which are voting next year, are both classified as flawed democracies for one reason or another. So, it is still possible for the outcome to change the leadership of the country, but there are other problems with their democracies.",

There's very clearly a sort of breakdown in trust in the whole democratic process, whether you're on the left or the right, you think that the process is broken in one way or another. And then, there's also things like, you know -- I mean, as an outsider, it seems extraordinary that in America, politicians are allowed to draw the boundaries of their own elections. You have sort of partisan boundary commissions. And I mean, not in the whole of America, I think California has sort of gone back to the sort of situation you get in many other parts of the world. But essentially, that means that you can draw electoral boundaries that guarantee that your guy always wins. And what does that mean? The only way that you can lose in a situation like that is if you are primaried by someone more extreme from your own party. So, that is a recipe for polarization, which is exactly what we've seen in America. So -- and then, that in turn leads to a breakdown in trust in the overall democratic process. So, that's the kind of thing. I mean, to be fair, the - - I think the U.S. scores seven and a bit out of 10 which is pretty good.",

And this time around, he seems to be planning to ensure that he can make more of the changes. He wants to, you know, politicize the sort of executive, the -- things like the Department of Justice. He wants to chuck out everybody and replace them with his own people who can then prosecute his enemies and that sort of thing. So, that's very concerning. And also, he's making noises about how, you know, at the end of the term, if he wins again, he might want to stay on for a bit longer. I think there's a word for that where you get to stay in power for as long as you like. And I seem to remember that you weren't terribly keen on that arrangement in the 18th century. But anyway, so there's that. But I think the other big difference is that the world now is sort of much more aware of the global implications of a second Trump presidency. If Americans want to vote for Donald Trump in America, that's fine. That's, of course, up to them, and it's their democratic choice. But the global implications would potentially be huge. He's talking about pulling out of NATO. Obviously, he wants to pull the plug on support for Ukraine. We don't know what he'd do over Taiwan.",

And all of the -- you know, the Senate seats and the House of Representatives seats, that -- all of that worked fine. I mean, it seems very implausible that the meddling only happens in one part of the ticket when, you know, people are voting on the same piece of paper. So, yes, the whole thing is deeply implausible. And you know, it's -- it would just send a very odd message to people around the world to whom America is trying to preach the virtues of democracy. But America doesn't preach the virtues of democracy quite as much as it used to. The place where democracy really needs defending right now is Ukraine.

But just being completely sort of, you know, looking at an accountant's view of this, this is an incredible deal for the United States to basically wear down the military of one of your biggest geopolitical rivals without having to put American servicemen and women in the line of fire and, you know, at very low cost, because, in effect, the subsidies that you give to Ukraine are going straight in a large -- for a large part of it, it's going straight to your own arms companies. So, it's subsidies, it's creating jobs at home in America, and it's wearing down the Russian military at very -- this is an incredible deal. So, even if you don't care at all about democracy but you do care about, you know, America's continuing, you know, military supremacy over other powers, then I don't know why you wouldn't want to continue to support Ukraine. So, yes, it's a mystery to me. And yes, I realize that there are concerns about border security and so forth, but you can have both, right?

You have this short war between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Russia's backyard. Then you've got the whole situation in the Sahel. You can now walk from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, 6,000 kilometers, just passing through countries that have had a coup since 2020. So, the world seems to be preparing for a situation where there's more conflict in future, rather than less, the unipolar moment where America was the sole superpower has definitely passed. And there are now, you know, many, many great powers, large powers sort of vying for influence. And then, the middle powers, this makes the middle powers, the sort of swing powers, like Saudi Arabia and Iran and Turkey, gives them a lot more clout as well. And so, there's just a general kind of feeling that if you want to do something, like invade your neighbor, now's a good time. And, you know, Venezuela is talking about invading Guyana. I mean, there does seem to be a sort of move towards much greater disorder and much more conflict, and I'm afraid that's extremely depressing.

So, if you then -- yes, you've got a multipolar world, but as a sort of higher level ofabstraction, you've essentially got a China led bloc, which does include Russia, and then you've got a western -- you know, American led bloc. You've got countries trying not to take sides in the middle, like India most obviously, but, you know, other countries too who sort of want to be friends with both sides. Vietnam is doing a great job of, you know, playing both sides. Southeast Asia is generally trying to be friends with China, or at least not enemies, but also be friends with America. So, yes, it is very much a Cold War vibe. The big difference though, between this and the original Cold War, is that there was no trade to speak of between the West and the Soviet Union during the original Cold War, and there is an enormous amount of trade and economic linkage between China and the West. And, you know, just think of your iPhone again. It's assembled in China and it has components from actually all over Asia. But, you know, this is a very different situation because supply chains are so dependent on China. And so, this is why we hear a lot about decoupling and de risking and companies trying to move their supply chains and their factories out of China. It's actually incredibly difficult because even if you move your assembly to -- and this is what Apple is doing with iPhones, it's assembling some of them in India now, and it's moved some other manufacturing to Vietnam. But the fact is an awful lot of the components and materials are still coming from China. So, if there were to be a war over Taiwan, and there were to be sanctions imposed, then I'm not sure that, you know, trying to build things in Vietnam or India would help because I don't think you'd be able to get any components out of China.",

And the Olympics can be --even for a jaded old cynic like me, can be, you know, surprisingly moving to see, you know, all of the best people at a particular sport, you know, facing off and you kind of think, actually, this really cool. But the 2024 Olympics are likely to be overshadowed by arguments about, you know, what about the athletes from Russia and Belarus? And are they allowed to compete? And do they -- you know, compete under a neutral flag that doesn't represent their country? But everyone knows that it does and it's all a bit silly. And also, Vladimir Putin says he wants to have his own version of the games called the Friendship Games, which is for Russia and its friends. So, that whole thing seems to become a political football already, as it often does. And then there's the possibility of Americans returning to the moon in 2024. There's supposed to be this this mission blasting off in November. It may get -- November '24, it may get pushed into '25, but they're not going to land on the moon. The idea is that they go around the moon. And this should be, you know, extremely inspiring. Surely, it's going to include the first black man, the first woman and the first non-American to leave Earth orbit. And so, surely that's a cause for celebration. And to some extent it is, but I think, again, this likely to be overshadowed by the sort of political messaging around this. This very reminiscent of the Cold War. And this very reminiscent of the warm up missions that were done before Apollo 11 and the landing in 1969. And so, I think, you know, this once again may look like America flexing its technological muscles and saying, look, you know, we're the best at this. And in the same way that we're the best at going to the moon, we're superior in other ways too. So, I think it's actually going to be very reminiscent of the Cold War as we are in now another Cold War. So, I'm afraid that the chances of that leading to, you know, in theory, you're going to have like four members of the human race in one place, you know, and looking back at the earth and seeing absolutely everybody else.
