No one is trying to restrict the former president from discussing this case writ large.The problem is between now and when this eventually goes to trial is that prosecutors have to share all their evidence including sensitive information with the defense attorneys. And here, prosecutors say they want restrictions on Trump's ability to share some of that sensitive information. They don't want him to get a key piece of evidence and then blast it out on social media. So, this is a protective order. It's something that's very common in cases. It is not -- I repeat, not a gag order. But let's take note of this, the pretty tight timeline here. Because they filed this request on Friday. Trump's lawyers asked over the weekend for more time, and that was denied. So, they have until 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.

Individuals with long guns -- police officers with long guns, these metal barricades went up to date to block this main street in front of Fulton County courthouse's prior street. They've added to this in addition to those plastic barricades, some of which had been filled with water to make it hard for vehicles to drive through if that was their intention. The street has been closed down to vehicle traffic and is still open to foot traffic.But I want to move out of the way here just to give you a sense of the increase in police activity. You could see this area flanked by sheriff's vehicles. We see local law enforcement here. And part of that, Jim, having to do with the threats being received by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Since she started this investigation more than a year ago, there have been countless threats against her life. Some of them, according to her credible threats. So much so where she's spoken about publicly the need to have to change her own personal security. Now, we're seeing that increased security presence here in front of the courthouse. It's one of the several indications of seeing that this sprawling investigation may near its end. May be very close to coming to an end here. Of course, this investigation looking into the potential of racketeering charges, conspiracy charges, and it's really -- you know the rhetoric has really been fueled by what President Trump has said about Fani Willis. Calling her a racist. Saying that this is politically motivated. In fact, we saw a Trump protester or supporter out here protesting last week with a flag and a bullhorn echoing those sentiments from the president. But it looks like things here are coming to an end. It was recently that we reported the seating of two grand juries here. It's going to be one of those grand juries that are seated that is going to ultimately have to hear the evidence gathered by the special purpose grand jury and their many months of work. Remember, they had the power to subpoena. They heard from more than 75 witnesses. And some of the biggest names in Trump's orbit showed up here. Now, it's going to be up to one of those grand juries. They have 24 jurors in all, plus two alternates. 16 needed for a quorum. 12 of them will have to be in agreement in order for potential indictments to be handed out.

You know, there's obviously competing concerns I'm sure that the judge has. She may want this to be handled in a speedy way.

The public also has that right.I think one difference though, Brianna, is that -- is that when I asked prosecutors for things in cases, OK? And when I was a prosecutor for many years, I had defense attorneys who were asking me for things. I don't -- I usually don't get a response from the prosecutors five minutes later. Usually, they're very busy. They got hundreds of cases on their docket. And you know, things can take some time. And Jack Smith's filings are you know saying we're available in the evening, holidays, weekends, and we are eager to move this forward. And so, when a prosecutor takes that you know point of view or has that perspective and is willing to do whatever it takes to move it forward, that really you know matters. That helps move the ball forward. And I will say that the question is just will the judge go along with that? You know, it sure looks like she is -- she is in the short run.

And that just happened over the weekend. The -- essentially, they had to be refurbished and repaired before they could actually be given to the Ukrainian soldiers. Well, now, we're learning that that process is complete. And they're expected to head to Europe before they will then move into Ukraine and be given to the Ukrainian soldiers. Giving them a very powerful ground component at a very key moment. Now, just to -- just to give you a sense of what Bush told reporters this morning. He said .\"They are done. They have to get to Europe and then to Ukraine, along with all of the things that go with them. Ammunition, spare parts, fuel equipment, repair facilities. It's not just the tanks, it's the full package.\" But he said even despite that, the timeline here is still on track. He makes a very interesting point, though, which really harkens back to the original U.S. argument for why it would be impossible to provide these tanks before of course, the Biden administration changed its mind. Namely, that they're just so complicated to operate and maintain. The logistics of these tanks are very difficult. And that is why the Ukrainian spent -- roughly 250 Ukrainians spent about 10 weeks training on these tanks in Germany before completing that course earlier this month, late last month. And now, of course, they are set to receive them. But still, this is going to be a big logistical challenge for the Ukrainians because these tanks, they break down pretty easily, they are sophisticated but there are so many things of course going on in this counteroffensive that could pose a challenge to their ability to maintain them. Still, they are expecting to you know really see these tanks play a really important role in the battlefield.
