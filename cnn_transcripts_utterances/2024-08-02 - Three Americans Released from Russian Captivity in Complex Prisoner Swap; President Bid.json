The emotional reunion played out before cameras at Joint Base Andrews late last night. Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, and Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva taking their first free steps on U.S. soil last night.With Whelan, President Biden, he was seen taking an American flag pin from his lapel and pinning it on Paul who spent nearly six years in prison in Russia, though he made a point to remind reporters in speaking with them last night, its five years, seven months, and five days that he was in prison. Gershkovich getting off the plane and sweeping his mom off feet. Asked how he feels to be home, he replied, it's not bad. And Kurmasheva running to get into the arms of her two young daughters. Reporters on the ground said you could hear the little girls sobs from what yards away. One of the girls turns 13-years-old today. All possible after a massive deal between seven different countries.

And that's when he says that it hit him, that this was real, that he was going home. And he described his home coming as just a great homecoming. President Biden was there to greet them on the tarmac, and so was Vice President Harris.His family, of course, he said that it was nice to hug his sister, Elizabeth, for the first time in years, and it was just an emotional moment. And as you mentioned earlier, he also said and confirmed that the lapel pin that he was wearing here in San Antonio, Texas, was the same lapel pin that President Joe Biden gave to him on the tarmac in D.C. And he said that it was just a nice keepsake, that they were chatting, and that the president just took off his lapel pin and gave it to him. But he also took a moment to criticize the Russian government. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL WHELAN, U.S. MARINE VETERAN FREED IN PRISONER SWAP WITH RUSSIA: I went on a two-week vacation.

Of course, this did require a lot of leaning on partnerships and alliances around the world. And that was a theme of the day yesterday as the president and his aides talked about this massive and historic effort. Now, this included the president going all the way up to the highest levels, talking to the German chancellor to try to strike a deal, because of course, part of this was that there were Russians held in other countries that the U.S. had to tap but into to create a deal here for Americans and others to be released.And so this morning hearing from National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who said that over the last few weeks and months they had to put pieces into play. That required leaning on Germany, Slovenia, Poland, and Norway, again, to get Russians to make this deal worthwhile. Now, this wasn't easy. This, again, required conversations between the president and counterparts, as well as the vice president who had, for example, a meeting with the chancellor in Munich earlier this year. So those were some of the details we were learning over the course of the last 24 hours, including the president calling the Slovenian prime minister only an hour before he also withdrew from the presidential race last week. Now of course, this culminated in this remarkable moment that we saw play out on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews just yesterday that was, again, concluding what a historic effort it was, and the relief and jubilation among officials was felt yesterday here at the White House and this morning as that continues into the day, knowing that these Americans are here. Now, the president, taking a moment on the tarmac to really stress relationships with partners. Take a listen.

It could happen in the next in the next few days.But look, I mean, the former president's strategy of delaying this case to make sure that it doesn't happen before the election is pretty close to being accomplished. I mean, it's very, very hard to see how you can fit a case like this in between now and those 94 days before the election, as you pointed out. So, the strategy has been aided by a number of things, including of course, the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, you'll remember, Omar, ruled a month ago -- just over a month ago that the former president had broad immunity for official acts. And one of the most important parts of that ruling was also to say that the Justice Department essentially couldn't use some of the key evidence that it has in this case. Some of the evidence from close aides, people like Mike Pence, people like Mark Meadows. Some of that evidence could be essentially off- limits for prosecutors and that could make this case be much, much harder to bring and which is why Judge Chutkan is going to have to do more proceedings, more hearings to be able to determine whether to move forward and how to move forward in the next few weeks. Now, all of that means that the pressure is on. The judge has made clear that she does believe this case should go to trial before the election. The mechanics of that, the procedure to get there is going to be the more difficult part of that -- Omar.  JIMENEZ: It is already a complicated procedure and now made even more so, Evan, really appreciate the reporting, thanks.",
