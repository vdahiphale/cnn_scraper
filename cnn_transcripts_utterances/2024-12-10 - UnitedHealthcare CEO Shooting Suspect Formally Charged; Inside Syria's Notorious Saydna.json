Police say he got nervous and started kind of shaking when asked if he'd recently been to New York. Well, police say Mangione was found with a gun and suppressor, quote, \"both consistent with the weapon used in the murder,\" as well as a two-page document railing against the health care industry.

So what it has been doing over the last 48 to 72 hours is striking all across Syria, mostly with its air force to eliminate these capabilities whether it's the air force of the Syrian military that no longer exists, whether it's the chemical weapons suspected sites or missile production facilities.

It's up to the international community. This is not something that Israel is going to be able to engineer one way or the other, but at least along its own border. And I think that, Anna, this is even more important in over the last 14 months, when we've seen what happens when Israel neglects its border security, like what happened last October 7th when Hamas barreled across the border and massacred so many people in southern Israel, Israel wants to make sure that there is no threat that is now merging along its own border. So what I would anticipate is that it will stay there for a short period of time. It won't be something that's going to be long term. It's going to be there to be able to defend itself for the short term and to send a message to whoever might be taking over the country to the north.
