Alex Murdaugh very emotionally saying no to both of those. But his Attorney, Jim Griffin, as he has this entire time went into excruciating detail as to how both Paul Murdaugh and Maggie Murdaugh were killed. We have heard those brutal details about those killings for the past month now here in Walterboro South Carolina.Alex Murdaugh, I will tell you, before he took the stand I had been told since this trial started by defense sources that he wanted to testify on his own behalf. But there was a lot that goes into it. It is a high risk for any defendant to testify, to take the stand. But especially because Alex Murdaugh as you guys played that sound at the beginning, has been caught in lies during this trial so far. And talking about his voice on a video that was found on his son's phone that was recorded at 8:44 p.m. at those dog kennels on the property, and that's where Paul Murdaugh was killed just moments after that video was shot. The video wasn't discovered on Paul's phone until the Secret Service got into it in early 2022, more than six months after Paul had been killed. And so, it wasn't something Alex Murdaugh was questioned about originally. He had sworn to anybody who would listen to him that he had never been to those kennels after dinner, that he did not see Peggy -- Maggie and Paul after dinner. But person after person, family member, relative, friend testified that they heard his voice on that video. Alex Murdaugh admitting that he lied, think he couldn't get control of the lie afterward. He said, oh what a tangled web we weave once he had lied because of that drug addiction. He then broke down apologizing to everyone, including his wife and his son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If they don't believe Alex Murdaugh on the trial -- on the stand, he will not be acquitted because they have to believe him to have a not guilty verdict. So, this is a pivotal moment right here. And there's been so much evidence in the last few weeks and are our holes in the evidence, there's no question about it. One thing that was touched on today in the examination so far was his clothes because they were clean. And there was blood spatter, according to the prosecution, found in a secondary test. But the first test done by SLED showed there was no blood on that T-shirt. And then a secondary test showed there was some blood spatter on it. But he said to the jury, they lied. There wasn't blood spatter. Well, here's the thing. In that initial test, there wasn't. The secondary test, there was but it was fish blood, allegedly because it was a fishing shirt that he had used.

      "sentences": "Some of the very big takeaways here, Bianna, about the heat that was involved in this lead- up to the derailment at East Palestine, what's so interesting is that the NTSB says this all comes down to a wheel bearing that began overheating. You mentioned that rise in temperature that was very quick, 38 degrees above ambient temperature, then 69 degrees above the ambient temperature, 103, and then 253 degrees. That was only then that a wayside detector, that is something that is either on the track or next to the track with an infrared beam, was able to detect that high rise in heat that very quick rise in heat, and alerted the crew that there may be a problem and to tell them to slow down. That is so critical.But if you look at that graphic one more time, the big issue here according to a very impassioned NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, is that those detectors are spaced out by miles. The mile markers count down there as the temperature goes up. 79, 69, that's 10 miles, another 20 miles to the next one. That is not federally regulated and NTSB chair Jennifer Homedy says that is something the National Transportation Safety Board will look at, as it considers instituting some recommendations here for the Department of Transportation to then regulate. It has been such a huge issue safety advocates say because the rail industry fights tooth and nail according to safety advocates against new regulations. Even though Norfolk Southern, the train operator here says, safety is a top priority, it's complying with this investigation, but there are big questions now, Victor and Bianna, about whether or not everyone was on the same page Although we do know, at least from the NTSB, that they're not laying any blame on the crew. Although there are some big questions about whether or not those detectors picked this up early enough and whether or not that part that failed, whether or not it was overused, or if it was re nearing the end of its life. A lot -- a lot of big questions here are not done just yet. We're only at the very beginning stages of this investigation.",

And as you can imagine, he's been criticized for why he did not come here sooner not just only by politicians, but by a lot of folks here on the ground as well.And when that question was put to him several times, he finally admitted that it was something that he should have expressed himself on sooner. After that, though, he did go over some of the things that we've heard before about the need for more regulation, higher fines when it comes to some of these -- some of these rail companies, the need to get Congress more involved in terms of train deregulation, things like that. But then what was really important, too, is a number of residents that I've spoken to earlier this week, had indicated to me, if you ever does come ask him, if this administration will be here five years from now, will they be here for the long run?

Meanwhile, NATO says that it has seen signs that China is considering and may be planning to send arms to Russia. CNN's chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour is in Kyiv.And, Christiane, it's interesting listening to us talk about this build-up to this anniversary because every day is a war there really, for Ukrainians. And every day they're trying to go about their lives. Still, they are dodging bullets. They are dodging missiles. They don't have electricity in large parts of the country. I'm just curious to get your response now to the news, however, that China could possibly be helping Russia with lethal aid. How are Ukrainians responding to that?",

They have not yet seen any direct evidence of a state-approved help lethal aid to Russia, but they want to make sure that doesn't happen. Victoria Nuland also said that this is something -- this war is something that simply never had to happen. This was her take on what it is to be one year into this war now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VICTORIA NULAND, U.S. UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS: This is just all so unnecessary, and evil. You know this is all about one man's fantasy of conquest, Vladimir Putin's decision that Ukraine ought to be his rather than a sovereign free country. And the suffering in Ukraine is unbelievable, as you illustrated there. But they are standing tall, and they are standing strong because they are fighting for their land and for their future.
