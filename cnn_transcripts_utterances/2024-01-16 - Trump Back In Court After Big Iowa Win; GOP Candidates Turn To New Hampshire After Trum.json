This is the first day of a trial where a jury will determine how much Trump must pay E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him of raping and sexually assaulting her.

But let's talk about why I'm here in the great state of New Hampshire today, because Iowa was yesterday, New Hampshire is today and the political -- the focus of the political universe now lands squarely here, after Donald Trump's big win, dominant win in Iowa yesterday.We have big news, it's just dropped. Nikki Haley now suggesting that there may no longer be any debates coming this week. Her campaign releasing a statement that read, let me read this. We've had five great debates in this campaign. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them. He has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do, Nikki Haley says, will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it. Obviously suggesting she's no longer interested in debating Ron DeSantis. That decision comes as the first official results of the 2024 primary are in, and everyone is working through what the numbers out of Iowa now mean for New Hampshire, and beyond. The Iowa caucuses, the results there, and Donald Trump's big win, are answering some of the questions that have been swirling for quite some time like would Donald Trump break 50% in Iowa? He did. Would any of his rivals drop out? One did. And is a Trump-Biden match looking more likely today? It is. President Biden's team watching all of this very closely. The President saying this about Trump's Iowa win, it's clear Donald Trump is the official front runner. We need to work even harder now, that from President Biden. And here was Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: People in our country are great, they're all great. We love Iowa but they're all great. They only want to see one thing, they want our country to come back. They're embarrassed by what's going on. Our country is laughed at all over the world laughing at us. And they want our country to come back. They want America, you know, they want us to be great again. It's a very simple, MAGA, Make America Great Again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, John, in just a few minutes here, a jury will be selected to determine if Trump should pay damages to E. Jean Carroll, about comments that he made denying that he raped her in a department store in the 1990s. Now these specific statements are from 2019 when he was, of course, president. And this specific statement, there has been litigation related to this whether he had possible immunity, because you may be thinking, wait, didn't we already have a trial on this exact issue? Yes, we did.Last year, early last year, there was a trial and a jury found that Trump was liable for sexual abuse and defamation, and awarded her $5 million over her claim that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid '90s and then defamed her. Now this time around, the judge said, look, we're not going to re litigate, are those bigger questions about what happened in the department store or if she was defamed. He says that that decision, that verdict carries over. So instead, this jury is just going to look at damages. E. Jean Carroll is asking for $10 million. This should only take a few days for a trial like this, but the big difference is Trump wants to participate this time. Last year he did not participate at all in this trial. But this time around, as you noted, while he's on the campaign trail, he is expected to be there today for jury selection. It's unclear how many other days he will attend. There's also a possibility he will testify. But the judge has put some restrictions some guardrails on what he could say. Again, they're not really litigating what happened in the department store. Instead, this is just about damages. But, John, I think what the former president is going to see today is this is federal court, and it's jury selection. There is no role for him. There are no reporters and cameras roaming the hall. There's no pool spray at the top. So if he wants to get some limelight today, he's likely going to have to hold a press avail at one of his nearby properties. Because federal court, again, no cameras, very little transparency, so not a lot of attention to get inside a building like this or proceeding like this.",

I mean, I guess it makes some sense for her not to engage in DeSantis in terms of debating. But one question I have, the debate is on WMUR, the main TV station here in New Hampshire. It's a tradition. Maybe traditions don't matter anymore like they used to, I'm not sure, but we'll see if she gets any blowback for that.

I mean, things have got to really line up. And one of the things plaguing her campaign, and it's nothing she can do about it, is that Joe Biden's numbers continue to be so bad that that Republicans that are sitting on the fence about Donald Trump don't feel any threat that Joe Biden is going to beat Donald Trump. If those numbers were tighter, I think we would have seen a different outcome. But, look, this perfect storm off Republican island is continuing to form again, the most morally corrupt or bankrupt individual.

Maybe on paper, but in reality, it's a one person race.We'll be charitable. I will be, until we get through New Hampshire and South Carolina. But right now, it's fair to say Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. As John Berman pointed out earlier, he blew everyone away. He set records in Iowa yesterday. No other candidate, Republican candidate has ever gotten over 50% of the vote. Biggest margin of victory ever in the history of the Iowa caucuses, hit every single demographic group that he normally doesn't, Independents, women, college graduates, he won them all.

She's trying to play to win over those Independent voters here in New Hampshire.But as Pete was saying there, the math is so difficult for her going forward. But let's not get ahead of ourselves in the process. What some candidates want to do, obviously, is collect delegates.

I mean, we walk into New Hampshire, where his numbers are at best numbers, I think 5%, then you walk into South Carolina where he had finished a distant third or further. You know, this is a tough situation for Ron DeSantis, and I think it'll be tough for him to raise money and do the things he needs to do.Look, this is what we all saw coming months ago when we said, hey, we got to have a consolidated effort. If we're going to beat Donald Trump, and the mess and chaos that surrounds him, we've got to come with one voice. And this is what happens. We forgot for a period of time that that was important.

So also Donald Trump will have the opportunity to look at the jurors, as they're being asked questions and getting qualified for this process. Now this judge moves pretty quickly, so I think we'll have this jury seated by the end of this morning. And then we could have opening statements this afternoon. E. Jean Carroll's team will go first then Donald Trump.And as we know that this trial is not about finding defamation. The judge has already ruled based on an earlier verdict, that Donald Trump defamed E. Jean Carroll. The question here for the jury will be damages, how much money Donald Trump may have to pay Carroll for harming her. She is seeking more than $10 million in damages in part because of statements that Donald Trump made days after the verdict last year at a CNN town hall. She wants that to be some punitive damages that he should have to pay for continuing to repeat the statements that the jury found to be defamatory. Now the big question here, Donald Trump, will he testify in this case. E. Jean Carroll is expected to take the stand. Donald Trump's attorneys say that he wants to testify. The judge has made rulings ahead of the trial saying that no witnesses can talk about the actual sexual assault or the defamation. Donald Trump is not permitted to say he didn't assault Carroll. He's not permitted to say he didn't know her and that he doesn't -- that he never attacked her. But the judge -- so the question here is what will Donald Trump be able to testify when he takes the stand. His lawyers say that they want him to talk about his state of mind.

There is no role for him today during jury selection, or if they get to opening statements. So this is very different than what we saw late last week where we heard from him four times in one day, right? He talked to cameras in the hallway on the way into court. He spoke in court. He spoke on his way out and then he had a press conference.
