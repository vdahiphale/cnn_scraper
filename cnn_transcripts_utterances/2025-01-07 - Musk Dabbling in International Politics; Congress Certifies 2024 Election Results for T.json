You know why we're showing you that this morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. So, starting next week, the newly seated Senate will begin holding confirmation hearings for Donald Trump's cabinet picks. And among them is Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is Trump's choice to become the next secretary of state, America's official top diplomat. But in recent weeks, another Trump ally, Elon Musk, has been the one trying to interact with world leaders. The world's richest man, the owner of the social media platform X, has been busy, as he always is, online. He has posted dozens of times about foreign affairs. The topics have included promoting a far-right political party in Germany, calling for Britain's prime minister to resign, and alleging Britain's leaders covered up sexual abuse cases. At one point, Musk even put up a poll. He wondered if, quote, \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government,\" end quote. Without calling out Musk by name, Britain's prime minister said this about the recent firestorm generated online. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump posting after the announcement, once again referring to Canada as the 51st state and wondering what it would be like, quote, \"if Canada merged with the U.S.\" With Trump now a little under two weeks away from returning to office, some American allies are left wondering what this all means for diplomacy in the years ahead.

And I don't see the conditions on the roads in Kansas City, where that video came from, getting any better anytime soon. Right? Like, this is what it feels like as you step outside in Kansas City: - 12 degrees. Look how cold it is in D.C. this morning: 13. This is all thanks to the hefty snowpack from the last snowstorm, which, by the way, dumped over six inches or more of snow over a 1,000-mile-plus stretch from Kansas City all the way to the nation's capital. Daytime highs today really not edging much above freezing. And of course, with the ice and the snow comes the power outages. Nearly 2,000 [SIC] -- 200,000 customers without power. Guess what? The cold air sticks around. And the reason this is important is because it's going to set the stage for the potential of another snow and ice event, particularly across Texas, the Southeast by Friday, and potentially, the East Coast by Saturday. More on that through the course of the week. But the culprit is this low-pressure system that's actually driving a strong wind event in Southern California. This is a particularly dangerous situation with extreme fire behavior and damaging winds expected for Ventura and Los Angeles counties again today -- Kasie.",
