      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, frankly tonight we saw a more disciplined former president Trump than perhaps we have seen him over the course of the weekend here in Pennsylvania. They were far fewer tangents tonight. He mostly stayed on topic. It was actually even a shorter event than we were accustomed to seeing from the former president.It seemed like the former ESPN anchor who moderated the event, plus the campaign selected voters who asked him questions really were able to keep him on track for the majority of the evening. He emphasized his proposals on the economy, talking about no taxes on tips and overtime. He talked about supporting fracking, but mostly he railed against the Biden administration on the subject of immigration. Now, make no mistake, there were several exaggerations when it comes to the economy, immigration and crime, and some of his normal asides including bragging about his polling, airing grievances against ABC News for their past debate performance. But there were none of the vulgarities that we saw for example last night in Latrobe or any anecdotes like we heard about Arnold Palmer again last night in Pennsylvania as well. I will say, though, Trump did continue to boost his surrogate Elon Musk, the billionaire tech giant, who has been stumping for the former president all weekend long, including offering a million dollar raffle to supporters who signed a petition which some legal experts say might not be legal. Take a listen to how he described Kamala Harris and also Elon Musk in the same breath almost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This woman is so incompetent, she is so bad, you cannot -- and I would normally not like this speak like that. If they get chosen, our country is finished. You know, Elon Musk is a very smart guy. You got to see his endorsement. He said, if this election isn't won by Donald Trump, our country is essentially finished. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Focusing on making students -- going to college more affordable.

Airstrikes also hitting parts of the city's southern suburbs. The IDF issued evacuation orders saying it was targeting Hezbollah's financial network. Israel is also right now stepping up its military operation in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing that the war will continue after the killing of Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar this week. And CNN's Matthew Chance has the latest now from Tel Aviv. But first, we want to warn you some of the images you are about to see are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the central Gaza Strip. These latest images from the Israeli military what they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. To the south in Rafah where the Hamas leader was recently killed, drone footage of strikes what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure. While across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip, an influx of casualties from a new Israeli strike at Beit Lahia where Palestinian health officials say dozens of people including women and children were killed. Among the shrouded bodies of her family, this woman calls her father to grieve their loves. I swear, Dad, nobody is left, she sobs. Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated and that they operate against Hamas in a precise and targeted manner. But eyewitnesses at the scene say the Israeli airstrikes felt like an earthquake. It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's life. His killing fueling hopes of a hostage release, even a ceasefire in Gaza and beyond. [19:20:11] In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos with the Israel stepping up strikes and pressing deeper into neighboring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian-backed Hezbollah like here at the town of Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon. Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north. One drone even hitting near the Israeli prime minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military action. Iran denies involvement and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility.",

Now House Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed this investigation earlier today. He said he anticipated receiving a briefing on the matter and said that overall the leak is very concerning. Now these two documents first came to light into public view on Fridayafter they were posted on Telegram. The documents include markings, it showed it is top secret, but also that it was meant for the viewing of only the U.S. and the Five Eyes allies. That includes countries like the United Kingdom and Canada. Now, without getting into the specifics of these documents, they essentially show the U.S. descriptions and assessments of satellite imagery that was taking a look at Israeli Air Force exercises that include using air-to-surface missiles as well as the movement of Israeli military equipment including munitions. Now the fact that Israel might be preparing for a response against Iran is no surprise. But it is surprising that these highly classified documents were leaked out into the public. It does come at a very sensitive time when the U.S. is working with Israel trying to offer counsel on the next steps that they should take as they are preparing to retaliate for Iran's barrage of missile attacks that the country had launched towards Israel back earlier this month. Now President Biden has said, he does have an idea of how and when they will be responding. But one thing that this leak does show is that the U.S., even as they are in deep conversations with Israel, they are also taking other steps to assess and analyze on their own the plans that Israel is planning to take against Iran at this very complex moment in the Middle East.",

CBS should have its licenses taken away by the government. \"60 Minutes\" should be forced off the air, and it should be investigated for this behavior. That is the message from Trump. And let's get to -- what is he really saying to his fans. He's saying they're all out to get us, they're all out to get you even the big news outlets. Okay, so that's the message from Donald Trump. That's why this response from CBS is important. CBS saying in a statement tonight: \"Trump is accusing '60 Minutes' of deceitful editing of our October 7th interview with Harris, but that is false. \"60 Minutes\" gave an excerpt of our interview to 'Face the Nation.' They used a longer section of her answer than the one that was on '60 Minutes.' It was the same question, same answer, but a different portion of the response.\" \"60 Minutes\" goes on to say: \"When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, a movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on '60 Minutes' was more succinct, which allowed time for more subjects in a wide-ranging segment.\" Then CBS reminds everybody that Trump pulled out of his interview with \"60 Minutes\" while Kamala Harris did participate. And then CBS concludes: \"Our long-standing invitation to Trump remains open if he would like to discuss the issues facing the nation and the Harris interview, we'd be happy to have him on '60 Minutes.'\" So, CBS really trying to clear things up here, trying to correct the record after two weeks of controversy. Media critics, like yours truly, had said that this seems like a screw up by CBS to run one part of Harris' answer on one show and a different part of her answer on a different show. But it seemed like an innocent mistake by two different shows and that's exactly what CBS is saying tonight. Donald Trump is trying to portray this as a conspiracy, as a scandal by news producers who are out to get him. We know that for him, bullying the media tends to work. But in this case, CBS isn't taking it. They are standing up to him and saying, he's wrong -- Jessica.",

But when it comes to broadcast networks, he threatens their licenses. Local stations have to have licenses to broadcast on the public airwaves. Normally, that's no big deal. Media policy is not usually a part of a presidential campaign. But Trump has threatened to CBS and NBC and ABC. He also complains a lot about Fox, but earlier today, in an interview on Fox, I noticed there were some clear edits to the interview. Of course, Trump didn't complain about that because Fox, he views as his home team. But once again today on Fox, he complained about CBS.

This is history that many Americans don't know how strongly Charles Lindbergh advocated isolationism as World War II was dawning. Walk us through why it is so relevant again? How it is so relevant again, as Donald Trump strongly criticizes US support for Ukraine?",

It's been about what particular policy, you know, what specific area, but never the issue of should we have alliances with countries in Europe? Should we be providing foreign aid to the world's poorest countries? Those fundamental questions we kind of answered in 1945 and we said to build a more peaceful, more stable world, we are going to jump in and were going to stay involved as the leading country in the world. We tried it the other way and that led to two world wars. A lot of what Trump says, what JD Vance says, and a lot of where the Republican Party is going, is just -- ask for a kind of fundamental rethink of that seventy-five-year-old consensus, so I think it was really important to remind people what the history was and it's an absolutely fascinating history that I found myself surprised by when I was researching it.",

It had just been formed and guess who was running, who is going to run against him or thinking of running against him, General Eisenhower, the first head of NATO.And so there you had the clash between these two figures and I discovered -- I talk about a meeting that they had, which, I mean, I don't want to give it all away, but it was absolutely fascinating.",

I mean, just think about the trade and travel and all of that, that goes on, all over the world.So, when you try to pull out, just on this one way politically, it's going to be much, much messier then it was when we pulled out in the 1920s and 30s because we weren't really engaged with the world. It was easy to draw up the drawbridge. How do you do that now and what will it look like? In a sense, we'll suggest that it's going to be very messy to try to do something like that. And remember, nobody can fill the role the United States does. There's just no country big enough, no country that has the heft. We are still --  our military budget is still larger than next five countries put together. We're still the largest economy in the world by far.",
