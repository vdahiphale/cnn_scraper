I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. Sarah Sidner is in Chicago for us this morning. This is CNN News Central. Breaking overnight, on the brink, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, killed inside Iran where he was visiting. We are getting new reaction this morning from both Hamas and Iran vowing harsh retaliation against Israel, whom they blame. The questions this morning, what form will retaliation take, what will Israel do next, what does this mean for peace negotiations over Gaza? Haniyeh was a central player in these talks. Let's get right to Jeremy Diamond in Haifa in northern Israel with the latest. Jeremy, what are you hearing this morning?",

      "sentences": "John, this is a tremendously significant event with potentially enormous regional implications. Ismail Haniyeh was targeted in an assassination in the Iranian capital over the course of the last 24 hours. We don't know exactly when this happened, but Iranian state media saying that he was targeted with a, quote, airborne-guided projectile, Hamas, in a statement, saying that he was targeted in an airstrike.Haniyeh was in Iran for the Iranian president's inauguration. It appears that his bodyguard was also killed in this assassination. Israeli officials not confirming that they were behind this, but certainly not denying it either, which is effectively the modus operandi for these types of events. Ismail Haniyeh has been a key figure in Hamas since 2017 when he took the helm of the organization. And over the course of the last 10 months of this war in Gaza, he has played a central role, not only as a figurehead for Hamas abroad, but also more recently as one of the key interlocutors with the mediators in these ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations. And so now there's no question that this will put on ice those negotiations, which appear to have been getting some momentum behind them over the course of these last several weeks. But now there's no question that at least in the short-term, those negotiations will go nowhere fast. And then, of course, there is the question of the broader regional implications. This was already a region that was incredibly, incredibly tense in the days leading up to this assassination. The Iranian leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, saying that you killed our dear guests in your house -- in our house, and now you have paved the way for your harsh punishment. So, a region certainly on edge, we will all be watching to see whether or not this tilts into all out war. John?",

Did Israel decide to make a seismic move like this, taking out a key negotiator in talks that the U.S. has invested vast amounts of political capital? CIA Director Bill Burns flying back and forth trying to get some headway in all of this.Did the visit to Washington of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, leave him thinking that he could? May just go and walk his own path? Israel has always said that someone like Haniyeh would be on their hit list, but the timing of this after the strike in Southern Beirut, extraordinary inflammatory. And so the question really is here, did the U.S. know about this, let it happen, not know about this, and wake up to be shocked? And why are they still talking so focused on a ceasefire now? And that, for the short-term, as Jeremy was saying, is a highly unlikely prospect and what traction does the U.S. now still have over Israel in these exceptionally dangerous weeks ahead?",

Plus, a suspect is on the run this morning after fatally shooting a man who was walking to prayers at a Philadelphia mosque. Police are calling it an execution-style killing.

What the president will also be doing is calling on Congress to take legislative action to close loopholes and also to regulate fentanyl-related substances as schedule 1 drugs.Now, the president is expected to receive a briefing on this later this afternoon. But of course, fentanyl is an issue that the administration has been trying to tackle, particularly on the U.S.- Mexico border, also an issue that has been used by Republicans to attack this administration.

      "sentences": "Yes, it sure is, John. I mean, this is from a 200,000-pound recall previously announced from Boar's Head, which was linked to its liverwurst product. This was made at a facility in Jarrett, Virginia. And now the company is expanding this recall to include more than 7 million pounds of other kinds of meat products made at that same facility. These include products including ham, baloney, bacon, frankfurters, and sausage products. These have sell by dates between July 29th and October 17th. They're also pausing their ready to eat operations at that facility.Now, this comes amid this outbreak of listeria, which can be a very dangerous bacteria in this current outbreak. There have been 34 illnesses across 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and 2 deaths. So, this is a bacteria that can be particularly dangerous in to people who are pregnant, people over the age of 65, and those with compromised immune systems. The CDC and USDA say that anybody, particularly in those groups who feel sort of flu-like symptoms within two months of eating these products, should seek medical care and let their providers know that they consumed these products and tell them about this recall. Listeria can cause listeriosis. That's the third leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the U.S. So, in addition to sort of gastrointestinal symptoms, if it moves beyond that, it can cause a fever, muscle aches, fatigue, sometimes a stiff neck, confusion and seizures. The recommendations for folks here is obviously check your fridge. The full list of products is available at the USDA's website. If you find any of these products, discard them or return them to the retailer. Thoroughly clean your refrigerator and be on the lookout for any of these symptoms. They also note sort of more broadly that people in these more vulnerable groups should not eat any deli meat unless it's been heated until it's steaming or reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees. But I think maybe in this situation, it's sort of a when in doubt, throw it out. John?",
