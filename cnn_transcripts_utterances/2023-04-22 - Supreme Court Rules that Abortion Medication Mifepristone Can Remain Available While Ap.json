That's \"King Charles\" Wednesday nights, got to get used to saying that way, launching this fall right here on CNN.All right, hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. All right, a new legal battle is taking shape after the U.S. Supreme Court issues a last-minute order to protect a common abortion drug. The high court deciding last night to freeze a lower court's ruling that placed restrictions on the drug mifepristone. The pill is the predominant method for ending pregnancies in the U.S. But now that decision sets up the most consequential abortion related dispute since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Another appeals court is scheduled to take up the case, meaning it could take weeks or maybe even months before a final decision is made. CNN's Jessica Schneider has more.",

      "sentences": "The Supreme Court stepping in to protect full access to the abortion pill mifepristone while this appeals process plays out. That means it will be status quo for the administration of this drug. Women can continue to take it up to 10 weeks pregnant. They can continue to receive it by mail and via telehealth visits with their health care providers, and the generic version will remain widely available.This is exactly what the Biden administration and the FDA, what they were asking for. They warned that if there were restrictions imposed on this drug at any point, there would be confusion and chaos. So now this chaos has really been averted. So where does this go from here? Well, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, they'll be hearing arguments on the underlying issue in this case, and the underlying issue is whether the FDA properly approved mifepristone in 2000. Those first briefings in the appeal, they actually must be filed at the Fifth Circuit next week, and the case as a whole is being fast tracked because arguments are set for less than a month from now on May 17th. But regardless of what the Fifth Circuit decides, any possible changes to the drug are being put on hold indefinitely by the Supreme Court order, so women can continue to fully access mifepristone until the Supreme Court acts again at some point, which wouldn't be for months, if at all.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, the president, his advisers breathing a sigh of relief after that decision came out yesterday, but certainly no one in the White House really believes this is the end of the road. And what you hear from President Biden's advisers is that they are prepared for quite a lengthy legal fight going ahead.And the president did get at that in his statement. He released it really within minutes of this decision last night. He said, \"As a result of the Supreme Court stay, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective use while we continue this fight in the courts. I continue to stand by FDA's evidence-based approval of mifepristone, and my administration will continue to defend FDA's independent expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs.\" So an acknowledgement there that while this is a victory for the Biden administration, certainly they have a long road to go. Really in the lead up to this decision, Fredricka, the administration had been working behind the scenes to develop some contingency plans at the counsel's office, at the Department of Justice, and within the president's senior team. Those options will remain on the table as this moves forward in the courts. But I also think it's important to note something else that the president said in his statement, which is that if Americans want to see abortion rights preserved, they will need to use their vote as their voice. Essentially, they will need to elect lawmakers who support abortion rights if they want to see the protections of Roe versus Wade, which were stripped away by the Supreme Court last year, restored. And that really does get at the politics of all of this. Certainly, as the president gears up for reelection, as Democrats hit the campaign trail, this will be a central issue for them over the next year. Certainly, they believe this can galvanize supporters heading in to the 2024 elections. So even as president, the president's advisers focus on the public health issues at stake here, there are also very focused on the politics at play as this continues to play out in courts going ahead, Fredricka.",

So one more day, Sunday will be the last one, and it's not been a smooth ceasefire in the way that the international community expected of these two warring generals. There's been fighting still going on in the middle of the capital Khartoum, especially around the presidential palace and the general command headquarters. That is where the army is located.But at the same time, because of the lull in fighting, people have been leaving Khartoum, trying to make it to safer parts of the country. And there's a convoy, several convoys, actually, making its way eastwards to the port of Sudan that is the main seaport in Sudan on the Red Sea. And that is why Saudi Arabia has already reported four ships left the port of Sudan, went across the red sea to the port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, not just of Saudi citizens, but also of friendly, brotherly countries, according to the country, one of those countries, Kuwait. But back at the capital, the army saying it is open and has agreed to a ceasefire with countries including France, the U.S., the U.K., and China to evacuate the citizens using the airport of Khartoum, and that matches what the other side of the conflict, the Rapid Support Forces, said they were open to reopening all airports to allow any countries that want to pull out their diplomats and the citizens to do so. Here's a warning, though. The U.S. is planning to evacuate the diplomats out of the Khartoum embassy and to security that were necessary. It will not be evacuating private U.S. citizens in Sudan because, according to the State Department and the White House, that is not standard practice. It's been done once in recent times in Afghanistan, but that's been described as a unique situation. The U.S. says it didn't evacuate citizens out of Libya or Yemen or Syria when those governments were collapsing. This conflict drags on. We're on day eight now, 427 people already wounded, almost -- 427 dead, Fred, almost 4,000 wounded.",

There was some stirring, you could see, some possibility, even though the thing had broken down by the time we came to office. And I thought -- I've often wondered whether it was just because you were straight into government, and maybe you had this feeling that everything was possible.

So it was an enormous security operation. So everyone was just taken on.But I think there did come an opportunity to new governments coming in, support of the president, the parties begin to listen. I think when Tony Blair as prime minister went to Balmoral Show and set out his position, that gives us an opportunity to get the IRA to go back into a ceasefire again. And then the big risk I think we took was to start the talks with the paramilitaries, or those that represented them, because just quickly, the history of the Troubles start in the sixties. There was one effort in 74. The next effort wasn't until 85. The next effort wasn't until 98. And if we fail, it was another decade. So I think there was that opportunity, and if we did not do what we did 98, the violence would have continued.

So, and then, when it comes back to what you and President Clinton were just talking about, it became easier for him to intervene constructively when it looked like everyone was being involved and there was a seat at the table for everyone. And then Mandelson who was at that time the secretary of state for Northern Ireland actually visited loyalist prisoners who were from the other side engaged in terrorist activity.

We -- it's selfish, but I think Tony and Bertie and I and a lot of others, we did a pretty good job with the whole European continent, trying to keep people working together at the end of the cold war.But it did strip the sort of veneer off of longstanding differences, racial, religious, ethnic, cultural differences, that other people could exploit.

When Martin McGuinness in the first government where Seamus Mallon represented the totally nonviolent Republican side. Martin McGuinness was the education minister and stunned them by first recommending increased funding for the poor schools in the unionist community. And he proved that he would be fair.

But one principle is the same, which is if once you determine what is the right outcome, and in my view, the right outcome is that the aggression in Ukraine does not succeed, then you don't give up. The one thing I think that that was very clear about the Northern Ireland peace process, for whatever reasons, is that none of us were prepared to give up on it at any point in time. We never really -- we never really resigned, even though at points it did look absolutely impossible. And so I think if you want to resolve anything, you've got to decide, first of all, what is the just and the fair outcome. And then you've got to keep committed no matter what the obstacles.",

I think one of the things that everyone needs to understand, trying to make sense of Ukraine and comparing it to what happened here, none of us thought we would stay for life. We all believed in democracy within our own jurisdictions. I loved being president. If we didn't have the term limit, they would have had to take me out in a pine box or beat me. But I believed in it because I don't think anybody should stay in power for life.If you determine to stay for life, then the only thing you really care about is breaking the opposition. And it's very hard to get a good outcome. And you see that now in Mr. Putin's Russia. He never agreed with Boris Yeltsin when Yeltsin promised me and actually signed an agreement that he would, with John Major, your predecessor, and with NATO, that he would respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine.",

India had an active nuclear program, still does. Pakistan did. But South Africa and Brazil were about to join. And they totally gave up their programs because of what we were doing. So Ukraine played a very positive role there. And we tried in turn to guarantee their territorial integrity.But I will give this to Mr. Putin. He was totally honest with me. He told me three years before the invasion of Crimea that he did not agree with Yeltsin, and Yeltsin never got this adopted by the Duma. It was not a treaty. He wasn't bound by it, and he didn't agree with it. But he always wanted to reconstitute in some form or fashion the Soviet Union, or a capitalist version of it. And so we can't forget that the fight for democracy goes on even as we try to use democracy here by giving everybody a say and making sure everybody was represented to make a better future.",
