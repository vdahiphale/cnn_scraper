And it comes the week of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion. Biden also announced a new $500 million military aid package. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy hailed the visit and the promise of more fire power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRSIDENT (via translation): The results of this visit will surely be seen and will surely be seen and would surely have a reflection on the battlefield and in liberating our territories. I know, Mr. President, there will be a very significant package of security support to Ukraine. And currently, it will serve as a clear signal that Russia's attempts will have no chance.

You have to wonder what folks at the Pentagon were thinking about this trip. I know a lot of planning went into it. Our reporting bears that out. But would the Pentagon have felt pretty confident about the president's trip to this active war zone, or do you think that there is a lot of nervousness? MAJ. GEN. DANA PITTARD, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good afternoon, Pamela. I'm sure there was a lot of concern, especially from the Secret Service. I worked with the Secret Service certainly in the past. As far as the Pentagon is concerned, the Pentagon, with the number of troops that we have in Europe and the ability to do certain things from as close as Poland, I think probably the Pentagon and the military was OK. It was probably the Secret Service that was probably the most concerned.",

She cited the U.K. Defense Ministry as saying that Russia is losing about 800 soldiers a day.So, it makes you wonder, how are they going to keep this up? But it does appear that it is ramping up for a major offensive. Do you think they will be trying to make up for a lack of quality with more quantity, bringing in more and more untrained troops, recruits, just trying to wait out the Ukrainians?",

But they have amassed more and more troop units.But what they're doing now is sending those troops basically untrained into battle. They had very little training. And their ability to employ them, that are using them in frontal attacks, in some cases, almost like suicide attacks. So, there is a lethality with mass and the Russians are showing that. But the Ukrainians are playing pretty smart as far as absorbing those blows by the Russians and then counterattacking. And that's what the Ukrainians need. They need more equipment to be able to do that counteroffensive, whether its tanks on the ground, armored vehicles, artillery and of course, fighter bombers.",

This was the right signal to send at the right time.\" Graham even went so far as to say the U.S. ought to start training Ukrainian pilots now on F-16s because he believes the U.S. will send them soon enough. Of course, that means the F-16s was not on the list of weaponry that the U.S.Is handing over that Biden gave Zelenskyy today. But is training Ukrainian pilots the smart thing to do right now?",

Especially on equipment that they're more familiar with, like MIG 29 aircraft, which are Russian-built or old Soviet built aircraft, which Ukrainians are familiar with. And they can get those aircraft from Poland and other sources.But eventually, having more modern aircraft like the F-16, could be very beneficial to them. But that will take months if not years to train their pilots to do that. And the U.S. has sent more military equipment than any other nation in the world to Ukraine. I think it's now close to $113 billion. Ukrainians are very grateful for that, but they also believe they need more to win this fight against Russia.",

Now there's concern about China.When meeting with his Chinese counterpart over the weekend, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned China not to provide lethal support for Russia in its war with Ukraine. That was a point re-enforced by the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. when I spoke with her yesterday. How does China benefit if it does supply that type of military support? PITTARD: Well, China is supplying non-lethal support at this point. But the United States and other nations are getting indications that China wants to funnel or send lethal aid to Russia. And this is where it benefits China. It is in China's best interest to prolong this war between Russia and Ukraine because it's burning through the military stocks, ammunition stocks of both the U.S. and NATO and the West. So that's in China's best interest. It is not in China's interest for Russia to collapse. But it is in China's interest for Russia to be weakened and more dependent upon China. And if Ukraine wins, with the support of the U.S. and NATO, that is not in China's best interest because it will impact their future ambitions and aggressions against Taiwan.",

But as you speak to folks here, nearly everyone has some sort of story about the former president or a member of his family. We're just a stone's throw away from where he went to high school. Just down the train tracks is the train depot at the end of the block. And that's also where his campaign headquarters was in 1976. There's also a great southern restaurant, Bonita's, not too far from here. We spoke to the owner about the legacy of the former president. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BONITA HIGHTOWER, OWNER, BONITA'S RESTAURANT: You see this restaurant? It's plopped right in the midst of where the former president grew up at. You know, and for him to come from these humble means to being the 39th president of our United States is just phenomenal. You know, so it just goes to show that it doesn't matter where you come from. It's all about what you desire and where you can go with that desire. So he's a living example to me.
