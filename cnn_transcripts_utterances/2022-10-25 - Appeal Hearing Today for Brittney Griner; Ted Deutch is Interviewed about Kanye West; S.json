      "sentences": "Well, John, we're not expecting fireworks. In fact, I had a conversation with the lawyers in Moscow a few days ago, and they said, look, you know, anything could happen, of course. They're pushing for the sentence of nine years to be overturned and the verdict to be overturned as well. But what they're hoping for is, at the very least, a reduction in the amount of time that Brittney Griner has been sentenced to serve in a Russian prison.She's been sentenced to nine years. Perhaps that will go down to eight years is one suggestion that one of the lawyers made to me, but they could leave it unchanged because, you know, as we know, Brittney Griner, who's appearing in court right now, outside of Moscow, she's appearing not in person but by, you know, video conference from her pre-detention trial - pre-trail detention center where she's currently sort of staying. You know, it could be that, you know, they don't change that at all because she's become something of a political pawn. There are massive efforts underway, of course, in the United States to have her potentially released, potentially swapped for a Russian national. In particular - one in particular, Victor Boot, a notorious arms smuggler, in the prison swap. But that hasn't come to anything yet, John.",

Who knows what the judge in the appeal is going to say. He might - he or she may delay it for some time in the future.The problem with it is, or the issue with it is, is that this will be the end, essentially, of Brittney Griner's legal opportunities to have her sentence reduced or thrown out. And so after this outcome is handed down by the judge, then Brittney Griner will essentially be left to serve the rest of her sentence, potentially, unless there's a prison swap, in a Russian prison.",

Production company MRC said it's shelving a documentary on West. California Governor Gavin Newsom is condemning increased incidents of anti-Semitic hate in Los Angeles, including this. These are banners expressing support for West hung over a freeway overpass. Photos taken Saturday show a small group of demonstrators with their arms raised in what appears clearly to be a Nazi salute here behind these banners reading, honk in you know, alongside another banner that says, Kanye is right about the Jews.

But at the same time that we've been dealing with this, let's remember that in Massachusetts there was a group that put out the names and addresses of Jewish groups saying that they should be dismantled. And in California, at Berkley - Cal Berkeley Law School, there was a whole effort by groups to turn a blind eye, to make sure that nobody was invited to speak to them if they support Israel, if they're Jewish and support Israel.We've seen on college campuses around the country increases of anti- Semitic acts. So, this draws attention to it. But this isn't unique, unfortunately. And we need to speak out about it, confront it and we need to be strong and taking action to repel it. What happens - and if I can just say, when there's anti-Semitism in our country, it suggests not just that there's a threat to the Jews, but that there's really something wrong we need to address. The White House was clear about that yesterday. We need to come together to confront this.",

He's talking explicitly about Jewish people. He's dabbling in tropes. He's talking about them as a group. He's saying that there is a double standard.

And nobody should be giving a platform to someone who says the kinds of things that Kanye says. But, again, it is not just about -- it's not just about Kanye, it's about this alarming rise in anti-Semitism in our country.And in Kanye's case, what you point out is the use of anti-Semitic rhetoric and some of the really outrageous things that he said. People often understand the straight-up calls for violence from anti-Semites. They don't understand the history of anti-Semitism and the threat that it's posed to the Jewish community throughout history. AJC has a resource called translate hate, which helps people understand just how damaging it is when we hear this kind of rhetoric and what kind of threats it poses to our community and to the country.",

So, let's get to it. Where does this weather go? It is in this yellow zone here across the east. Birmingham, Huntsville, all the way down to Mississippi and Alabama. This now is noon. Storms are firing along this squall line. And then, by later on today, look at the colors you see here. It's the warmest part of the day. It's when the weather will be the strongest. But the weather's going to continue in the overnight hour us. Some of these wind events could even be after dark or after you're asleep, if you are on the east coast here on the southeast coast. Here's the rain. We will take it. Many spots, two inches or more. And we need that much to get it to run off. You just can't get a half inch and hope the Mississippi goes up because it's been so dry the ground is just absorbing it. Temperatures right now, 44, Kansas City, and almost 20 degrees warmer in St. Louis because of that front. And highs today pretty nice across the southeast. You'll notice an increase in humidity.
