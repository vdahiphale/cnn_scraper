Could the war be won or lost 5,000 miles from the home front? I ask Ben Hodges, former U.S. Army commander in Europe. Also, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is still missing. His close aide, Maria Pevchik, shares her worries. Then, the extraordinary Marina Abramovic, the performance artist who brings a whole new meaning to body of work. Plus, the collision of free speech and antisemitism at some American universities. Harvard backs its president, while Hari Sreenivasan speaks with Rabbi David Wolpe, who resigned from an advisory group there over the issue. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Nearly two years ago, President Joe Biden and his NATO allies rose up to defend Ukraine and help stave off Russia's illegal invasion. Billions of dollars, tons of armaments and ammunition was sent and the battle for democracy was well and truly joined. Biden and his allies promised that they would support Ukraine for \"as long as it takes.\" Until now, that is, when the U.S. Congress decided to insert politics over the U.S. border into this existential fight against Putin's autocratic Russia, holding up about $60 billion in new military aid as the White House warns that current funding could run out in just a few weeks. Here's House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: This is an important battle for all the reasons we know. But I don't think it is a radical proposition to say that if we're going to have a national security supplemental package, it ought to begin with our own national security first. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I never would have imagined that. This is a sea change in American foreign policy. Now, the burden is also, though, on the administration. The president and his team have got to explain to the American people why this is in our interest. Speaker Johnson is not correct when he says they need to focus on American security. This is about American security. This affects our economy. It affects the possibility of us ending up in a NATO conflict. And of course, China is watching. If the Chinese see that we lack will and industrial capacity, then I don't think they'll be too impressed with anything that we say about the Indo- Pacific region.",

And today, we're hearing, an M.P. talking to CNN earlier, basically saying the following, Kyiv can be turned into the second Mariupol and totally erased because we see hundreds of drones flying to Kyiv every day. But they're not using the missiles a lot yet. In other words, Russia's not yet using its missiles. So, we're waiting for a massive attack of hundreds of drones and then hundreds of missiles.

I think that Iran, Russia's most important and closest ally, supporting Hamas, did this to support Russia. Russia's benefiting from this attack in Israel more than anybody. Now, to your point, the -- I have a problem with the mission statement that comes from Prime Minister Netanyahu. He told the Israeli Defense Force, destroy Hamas. That was it. Destroy Hamas. There's no political dimension to the strategic end state he described for his military. And if there's no strategic end state, then the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, obviously ends up using kinetic force only. But if the strategic end state includes a political dimension, such as we have to live with our Palestinian neighbors at the end of this, that will inform how Israeli Defense Forces go about their task of destroying Hamas. Right now, I think, given the attitude of the Netanyahu government, on all aspects of this, I don't see it getting any better, unfortunately, and that does not bode well for the ability of the United States to continue to support Israel.",

He is, of course, the Russian opposition leader who's been jailed for years. This morning, he failed to show up for a court date. Adding to the concerns, Navalny has suffered serious health issues while in prison. Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed questions about Navalny's whereabouts, saying, \"The Kremlin has neither the intention nor the ability to monitor the fate of prisoners.\" Maria Pevchikh is Navalny's close aide and runs his anti-corruption foundation, and she's joining us now from headquarters in Vilnius, Lithuania. Maria, welcome back to our program. So, just can you give us an update? Is there any more news in the last few hours? Have you received any more information about the possibilities of where Alexei Navalny might be? MARIA PEVCHIKH, HEAD OF THE INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT, ANTI-CORRUPTION FOUNDATION: I would love to give you an update, Christiane, but we don't have anything new and that's exactly the problem. It's been a week since we haven't heard anything specific from Navalny and we are desperately looking for an update, for some sort of information, for clues that would help us locate him.

And around this time, maybe a day or two before that, this is when we have lost touch with Navalny. And I would imagine these two events are interconnected. We have also announced our own campaign, anti-Putin campaign, antiwar campaign. And I think the ultimate purpose of this extreme isolation that we're dealing with now is to silence Navalny and cut him off from the outside world entirely. So, it's very likely that this is the way that Putin is going to manage his presidential campaign, and he would love it to be as quiet and as smooth as possible.",

We don't know exactly what his plans are, and this is also a terrifying thing. We know that the very same people who keep Navalny in custody right now, before that, have authorized his murder. Before that, have attempted to poison him with a chemical weapon with Novichok. So clearly, these people have zero boundaries. These people have no respect to human rights, and they are capable of absolutely anything, and I hope that by talking about this, by bringing spotlight on Navalny, we will pressure the Russian government to release an information, some information about his whereabouts, because it's -- it is unreasonable that such a high- profile prisoner, one of the most well-known political prisoners in the world right now has gone missing.",

And we had the idea at that time in the desert, let's walk Great Wall of China. In eight years, we were writing to Chinese government letters. In eight years, we were getting very friendly answers, but we didn't move anywhere. The idea was to walk this Chinese wall, and we meet in the middle, and we married. And eight years, Chinese don't answer. So, we finally found the one man who was a specialist on China politics. And we show him all these letters. And he said, he started laughing. I said, what is so funny about it? He said, you know, Chinese have 17 ways to say no. And in these eight years, they exercised all 17 ways. I mean, so, we have to go through the government, the Dutch government and the Chinese government. And finally, after eight years, we got permission to walk the great of China. But at that time, our relation was ending. But as we never give up anything, we say, OK, now we're going to walk. Instead of marry, we're going to say goodbye.

I don't know. But nonetheless, the effect on the Jewish students is the same because of those 200 students masked on the steps of Widener Library screaming from the river to the sea, you don't know who's expressing genuine hate and who just said -- who came along because their roommate said, come, it'll be fun.

Ignoring Jewish suffering is evil. Belittling or denying the Jewish experience, including unspeakable atrocities, is a vast and continuing catastrophe. Denying Israel the self- determination as a Jewish nation, accorded unthinkingly to others is endemic and evil.\" Now, I understand a little bit of the historical context and the concerns that Jewish people have. But, you know, is there a place for a legitimate criticism of the actions of a country, Israel, without a negation of Israel's right to exist or the Jewish people's right to exist?",

We saw hundreds of thousands of Israelis in the streets protesting before October 7th, criticizing Israel. But here's what I haven't heard. I hear people criticizing Russia, I hear no one say Russia shouldn't exist. I hear people criticize Germany after the Second World War when the worst country in the history of humanity, nobody said there shouldn't be a Germany anymore. That is reserved solely for the one Jewish state in the world. There are 50 Muslim states. I've never heard someone say one of those Muslim states shouldn't exist. Only the Jewish state shouldn't exist. And that you have to ask yourself, why is it that that is the only state that receives that imprecation over and over and over again? And if it isn't antisemitism, then it confounds me what it could possibly be.",

I spoke yesterdayat a synagogue and someone stood up and made a long and eloquent plea about why he thought a ceasefire was justified. And I said to him, I appreciate your point of view and I think it comes from a humanistic place. I really do. And I want to tell you why it is that I disagree with you. And that kind of exchange is the way adults speak to each other. And we're trying to train our students to do the same, but it's not always easy when, you know, people line up into teams. Look, this is not -- by the way, this is not unique to college campuses. When I was a kid if you asked people, would you marry someone of another race, most people said no. And if you ask, would you marry someone of another political party? Most people say yes. Now, it's exactly reversed. If you ask, would you marry someone of another race? Most people would say yes. Of another political party, most people would say no. Which tells you two things. One is that progress can be made in our world, which is an optimistic thing. And the second is that the polarization is very bad right now. And that's something that we really, really have to work on, how to have dialogue across views.",

It's not peripheral to it, and we need to deal with that and with the place of Jews in the creation of our civilization.
