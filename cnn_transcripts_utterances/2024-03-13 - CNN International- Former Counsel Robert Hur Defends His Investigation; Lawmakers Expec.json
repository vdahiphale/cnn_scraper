The White House has responded to testimony by former special counsel Robert Hur about Joe Biden's handling of the classified documents. He said his assessment of the president's memory and cognitive skills was necessary and fair. After his report concluded that the president was forgettable -- forgetful, rather, and lax about sensitive information. But the White House says the case is now closed since President Biden hasn't been charged. CNN's Paula Reid has more from Capitol Hill. PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former special counsel Robert Hur, grilled by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle today about his investigation into President Biden's mishandling of classified documents.

Criminal investigators were carrying out two arrest warrants that were issued by U.K. judicial authorities for the, quote, commission of sexual offences and exploitation of persons in Great Britain.According to a police statement which was obtained by CNN affiliate, Antenna 3. Tate's spokesperson responded swiftly to the arrest, calling them bewildering and saying that they had left the brothers, quote, dismayed and deeply troubled. Both brothers categorically reject all charges, the spokesperson added. The pair appeared before a Bucharest court on Tuesday with Andrew telling the judge he wanted to, quote, remain in Romania and clean up his reputation rather than be extradited to the U.K. Tate, who previously had his social media account suspended on several occasions, also made a typically cryptic post after the news broke, saying: The matrix is afraid but I only fear God. The former kickboxer turned social media influencer built up his fame and loyal following online, drawing attention for his posts encouraging young men to engage in money-making schemes. Long accused of promoting misogynist views to impressionable audiences, things took a darker turn when Andrew and his brother were arrested in Romania in 2022 on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal group to sexually exploit women. Little has been heard from the brothers since their release from house arrest last August. Their lawyers are now set to be kept busy with these fresh charges, with the Romanian court hearings still looming on the cards for later on this year. Bianca Nobilo, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And in its wake, it left behind these huge clouds of smoke, a fire and also bits of the rocket actually falling from the sky. Now, there were people nearby watching this rocket launch. Fortunately, nobody was injured and that fire was very quickly extinguished. Now, Space One doesn't know what went wrong with this launch. They don't know why it exploded in that dramatic way that it did. But its president at a press conference earlier today stopped short of calling it a complete failure. Masakazu Toyoda said, and I quote: I will not use the word failure. Today's data and our experience will feed our new challenges. So trying to inject some positivity, some optimism there. But really, this is a huge setback for Japan's space industry. They've been trying to develop more satellites as the Japanese government has been trying to ramp up its intelligence capabilities and its overall national power with a specific focus on satellites. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. JAXA, Japan's version of NASA, saw its flagship rocket H3 explode during a test last year. Another solid fuel rocket also exploded last year during a test. But, you know, there are some positives to highlight. Japan last month in February became the fifth country ever to land on the moon. It achieved a soft landing on the lunar surface and also something called a pinpoint landing, which means that it landed within several meters of its target rather than several kilometers. So, you know, a huge, huge feat. So Japan still can become this bigger space power in this space race as it's been trying to do. But, you know, as for Space One, it said that it's going to continue trying to develop its rockets, hopefully ones that don't explode, however -- Max.",
