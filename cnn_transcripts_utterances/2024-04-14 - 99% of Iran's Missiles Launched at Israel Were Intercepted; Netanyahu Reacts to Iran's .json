      "sentences": "-- you can hear there -- the sirens going off. Interceptors in the sky. The IDF says that more than 300 missiles and drones were fired on Israel overnight. 99 percent of them, according to Israel, were shot down. Those few that got through hit an air base in the Negev, that's in Southern Israel, but they just caused minor damage. Tehran says that the attack was their response, their retaliation to an Israeli strike last week on Iran's embassy last week in Damascus that left some seven members of the Revolutionary Guard, including a senior commander dead. But now Iran is saying is the matter can be regarded as concluded after this retaliation. At the same time, Israel's foreign minister is now repeating an earlier statement that if Iran attacks inside Israel, Israel will then have to strike inside Iran, and that is the main concern right now. U.S. President Joe Biden has spoken with his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They spoke by phone.According to a U.S. official, President Biden said that the attacks had largely failed. Which meant, he said, this was a win for Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu also posted a statement on social media, you can see right there, saying, \"We have intercepted. We have contained. We shall win.\" Now, that the attacks are over and they lasted some five hours, airspace in Israel, Jordan, and Iraq have all reopened, and you can see all of that air traffic there in the sky throughout the region. Notably, you can see that big blank spot there in the middle over Iraq, but airlines are also avoiding flying over Iran, which includes a vital corridor for global commercial travel. I want to get to CNN's International and Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson. He's in Jerusalem. Nic, you have been on air reporting since the very moment those first sirens sounded in the wee hours of the morning over Jerusalem. Telling us about the intercepts that were going up to take down the drones and the missiles that were incoming. It appears that life is slowly returning to normal in Israel. What's the latest from there? And what sense are you getting about what may still be to come?",

President Herzog today saying that, congratulations to the army, to the air force, to the intelligence services for a job well done. Thanking the United States, President Biden and the White House as well.Which really -- sort of, I think, underscores how really -- how big a sense of relief there is here that Iran could fire so many missiles, 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles and the attack being deterred so effectively. But as you just mentioned, the foreign minister, Israel Katz, has said that what he said last week stands. That an attack by Iran on Israel will bring an attack by Israel on Iran. And certainly, what the prime minister is saying that together we will win implies that that is still a possibility. And the defense minister has also left the door open there. What I'm struck by, as we stand here right now watching the dynamic play out at the moment, within the narrative that emerges from officials in Israel. Overnight, we understood that there had been a security cabinet meeting that had then determined that they would leave the decision of how Israel would respond to the war cabinet. And the implication was a war cabinet would be meeting in fairly short order. [04:05:00] Well, we haven't heard anything about, A, the war cabinet meeting or if they have what they've determined there's a broader cabinet session expected later this afternoon here in several hours. So, that sort of implies that whatever public position Israel is going to emerge and take over striking back or not to Iran, this is sort of getting a little more thought and a little more time put into it. But I don't think anyone should be under the misguided apprehension that Israel doesn't actually want to strike back. That's the expectation.",

And now we understand from the White House that President Biden is telling Israel clearly that the U.S. does not support, would not support any kind of retaliation against Iran.So, how does Israel balance this unprecedented attack and they've -- they're feeling for a need to respond with what is being said here in Washington.",

So, that is a very clear warning from Iran.Look, I think -- you know, what President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke about last night or early hours of this morning. We know that they have huge differences. They have huge differences over the war in Gaza. And despite President Biden's pressure on Israel to curtail the killing of Palestinians in Gaza, some more than 33,000 now to get more aid into Gaza, it has taken a long time and an extreme amount of pressure to bring that about. So, to think that Prime Minister Netanyahu might bend to President Biden's wishes and will that Iraq -- that Israel doesn't escalate this by retaliating against Iran. We don't know, of course.

A real effort by Tehran to compartmentalize this and perhaps hope that this is it and leave it at that. But of course, that is for now Israel to decide.Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi, thank you so much for that reporting. I want to get to -- straight to White House Reporter Kevin Liptak who joins me now. Kevin, a very busy evening at the White House. Multiple sessions in the situation room. We saw the President surrounded by his top national security officials.

      "sentences": "Yes, I think there were some tense moments in the situation room last night. And remember, Alex, President Biden had to rush back from his beach house in Delaware in order to get to those, you know, real-time monitoring devices so that he and the national security apparatus were able to watch this in real-time.Of course, President Biden is in something of a tenuous situation here. He is hoping to prevent a wider conflict from exploding in the region while also demonstrating stalwart support for Israel and its defense against Iran. And of course, this does come at a moment of heightened tensions between himself and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But I think in the statement that the president put out last night, he is trying to make clear that there is no daylight between himself and Israel on this particular issue of defending the country against Iran. And in the statement, the president said, I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel. The president goes on to say, I've told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity defend -- to defend itself against and defeat even unprecedented attacks. Sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel. And so, I think reading between the lines of that statement and also talking to American officials, President Biden is essentially telling Netanyahu here to take the win. That they do view its response to these Iranian reprisals as successful. They don't think that Iran's drones or missiles hit anything worthwhile in Israel. The vast majority were shot out of the sky. And President Biden is essentially telling his counterpart that this should be considered a win. The other important thing that we have heard from officials is that President Biden told Netanyahu that the U.S. would not participate in any offensive operation against Iran. So, essentially drawing a line on what the U.S. is willing to do going forward, and certainly what American officials are going to be looking for Sunday and heading into the next week is how Israel will respond to this attack. And certainly, that has been a topic of discussion since even before these drones were launched yesterday. Now, President Biden in the statement does say that he will convene a meeting with members of the G7 later on Sunday to discuss the diplomatic efforts to contain this crisis in the region. And he also notes that he hasn't seen any attacks on U.S. forces in the region. But that he will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our own people. Alex.",

Tried to make it clear that the past number of months of Israeli efforts at degrading Iran across the region and pushing back against the Axis of Resistance has been achieved from Iran's purposes.Iran has directly attacked Israel, which was a bit of a surprise from my take. I think this really changes the nature of Israel and Iran's confrontation, which for the past number of decades has been very shadowy and gray, as is oftentimes described.

And if Israel does respond to what it sees as a serious escalation, Iran has attacked Israeli territory for the first time ever directly.

They've been more than happy to have their proxies going after Israel and going after U.S. interests throughout the region for the past six months.But do you think that Iran does now want to expand its role and have more of a direct role in this conflict, or does it still want to, sort of, lurk in the shadows?",

There has been a direct strike on Israel, and I do expect Israel to counterstrike.What was quite interesting is, as you mentioned, that immediately after the strikes were launched in the middle of the night, Iran did say the operations are over. And they tried to draw a line on where they are. But -- and it's important to note that Iran's attacks were very calibrated. It took over two weeks to plan this operation. They picked their targets relatively carefully. There was no loss of life, very minimal damage, and Israel's deterrence capability succeeded. There was an international coalition that worked alongside the Israelis to make sure nothing got through. So, this is potentially built as much more of a success for Israel than it is for Iran. But Iran can tick the boxes of showing strength, changing the nature of the adversary relationship with Israel, and at the same time, try to walk back into its defensive position.",

He said, we condemn these reckless and unprecedented attacks by Iran and its proxies. And we call on Iran to immediately halt any further attacks, including from its proxy forces, and to de-escalate tensions. We do not seek conflict with Iran, but we will not hesitate to act to protect our forces and support the defense of Israel. So, we see U.S. officials are not yet breathing a sigh of relief here. There is still, the potential for a massive regional conflagration if either side chooses to escalate here. And we see in that statement from Secretary Austin, as well as statements we've seen from the president and the secretary of state, kind of, walking this line between not supporting Israel in any sort of offensive move, but also making clear that they will defensively stand by Israel. So, Alex, we expect to see a flurry of diplomatic activity to try to deter any, sort of, military response on either side. The secretary of state said he would be calling partners in the region and around the world in the coming hours and days to discuss this. President Biden will be convening his G7 partners to discuss the situation. And there is a meeting later today of the U.N. Security Council that was called by Israel to also discuss the situation.
