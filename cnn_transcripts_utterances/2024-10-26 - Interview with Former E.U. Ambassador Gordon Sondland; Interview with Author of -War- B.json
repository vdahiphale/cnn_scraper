He warned that Trump would govern as a dictator if elected, saying that he consistently praises authoritarian strongmen like Vladimir Putin. And he's even crossed that third rail, praising Adolf Hitler. Now Kelly's warnings about how Trump would set the military on his opponents as he calls them the enemy within are the latest in an alarming litany of allegations from other former White House officials.
