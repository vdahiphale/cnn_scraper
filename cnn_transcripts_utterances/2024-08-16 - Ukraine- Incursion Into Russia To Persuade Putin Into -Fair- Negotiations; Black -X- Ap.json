But I think one of the things that's been so interesting to see throughout the course of the day is that those ceasefire talks that have been going on in Qatar, while Iran is not at the table there and is not involved in those talks, Iran obviously looms very large at those talks.You can see that by the fact that Qatar's prime minister called the foreign minister of -- of Iran on both days just to keep him up to date as to what exactly was going on in those ceasefire talks. Now, many of the parties who are part of those -- those talks, they hope that they can prevent Iranian retaliation if indeed there were to be significant progress or possibly even a ceasefire agreement, and of course, also prison, hostage release as well. The Iranians have said that to them the two things are not linked. They say that that retaliation could still happen, and it could still happen at any time. At the same time, of course, the Iranians also watching very closely what goes on at those talks. One of the things that the Iranian government has said is that they also don't want to escalate the situation to obviously, some sort of wider conflict that could involve not just Iran and Israel, but, of course, the U.S. as well, guys.",

Frederik Pleitgen -- Frederik Pleitgen again from inside Iran in Tehran tonight, thank you so much for that reporting.Ukraine is pushing ahead with its military offensive into Russia with aides to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying the cross border incursion is designed to push Vladimir Putin into what they call a fair negotiating process. BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST Zelenskyy confirmed to CNN that Ukrainian forces captured the Russian town of Sudzha in the Kursk Region. CNN, chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, gained some of the first access to that region. CNN was accompanied by the Ukrainian military who reviewed the video without sound prior to release for operational security reasons. We should point out the Ukrainian government had no editorial control over the report. Nick shows us the intensity of the fight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, not even the statue of Lenin is unscathed here, this Ukrainian assault so persistent. And Russia, despite its sense of history, it's sort of passed as being so impregnable, completely unable to push the Ukrainians out here. The sound of small arms fire we can still hear so clearly there is a bid for the Russians to push back, but simply isn't working, and the humiliation for Putin endures.You can see the damage that's been done to this street here. From the intense fight, the range in. Still clearly active fighting happening here, and there's still the question is, where are the drones? Where are the Russian drones that have made Ukraine's life hell on the front lines for months, simply nowhere to be seen? Well, there's constant artillery as well. Clearly a fight still underway for this, to become deeply symbolic for Ukraine's totally surprise assault into Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You know, congressional district one this year in North Carolina is going to be really important to help get Don Davis over the line and making sure that we have a Democratic majority in the United States House to ensure that these policies can become reality, versus what we're seeing from Donald Trump right now, which is trying to raise tariffs and raise prices, raise inflation more right on consumer goods in the United States right now.I mean, we're seeing an economy, a pre -- a presidential economy, that's trying to bring back and that has brought back manufacturing jobs in North Carolina, over 6,000 that have come back to places like Hickory, North Carolina in the western part of the state that used to be known right for manufacturing furniture and the number one capital in the country for that. We're now one of the number one producers for fiber in the country. And so recreating rural economies is something that you're going to see over the next four years as well from the investments that this federal administration has made. You know, one thing that I credit this administration for is that they have not just been prioritizing 2024 as an election cycle, they've been prioritizing the next 50 years in places where they've not had a future set for them. And that's really amazing to see I think, the fact that we are recreating, we're having a rural renaissance right now, and we should be talking more about that, I think.",

I love the fact that she talks about taking on landlords right now, taking on corruption when it comes to rent prices, I think especially for young people that are experiencing that at this level. You know, we want to see that aspect taken on. In the state legislature right now, in North Carolina, for an example, there is a ban on a rent cap in any city. So you've got the state legislature fighting with local municipalities on being able to do that.We do need federal legislation that helps alleviate that burden for state legislatures, but also for local cities to be able to do what they need to do right now in their own communities. It's about giving autonomy back to the places that need it, that are being overrun, quite frankly, by folks that are making legislation that's actually not living in the communities that they're in right now that are struggling with these policies. But I also think that you're going to see excitement from folks, you know, I'm from Person County. Right now, we've got someone serving in local government who works at McDonald's, and I loved when the Vice President today talked about in her speech how she came up their working class background. She worked her way through college, right. And we do still have people. She worked with folks that were working those service level jobs, that had families at home. And right now, when the city that I'm from, you know, one of our city council women, Shana Outlaw (ph), works at McDonald's right now. She does not make $15 minimum wage yet. But she's also a mom, and she's got four kids at home that she provides for. And I think that she's speaking to a population right now that Donald Trump and, quite frankly, MAGA Republicans don't believe exist in this country at this moment in time.",
