At least 20 people are reported killed and more than 150 others wounded. Hospitals are struggling to deal with the volume and types of injuries coming through their doors. Witnesses say the aid distribution site was hit by what sounded like tank or artillery fire. Israel's military denies it was responsible for the attack and says it's, quote, \"assessing the incident\". Separately, the Palestinian health ministry accuses Israel of attacking an aid distribution center at al-Nusriyat refugee camp on Thursday. Health officials say eight people were killed. Israel's military did not immediately comment. One of the volunteers at the distribution warehouse says people were handing out supplies when they were attacked.

Central Command says forces destroyed nine anti-ship missiles and two drones in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. Earlier on Thursday, Iran-backed Houthis fired two ballistic missiles towards the Gulf of Aden and two more towards the Red Sea. No one was injured and no ships reported any damage.

One had burns to his face, another later had his leg amputated, according to the Philippines' government. Most of the 23 crew members were Filipino and arrived back in Manila this week.

One of the sort of nominal candidates running against Putin actually told CNN's Matthew Chance that he is aiming to come second. So, I think that gives you a sense there.But this is about Putin consolidating his power at home and getting at least the appearance of a mandate, which now that we're deep into the third year of this very costly war in Ukraine, is absolutely crucial for the Kremlin. And that is ultimately why this matters. If he secures this mandate, he can then continue with that war in Ukraine. There are questions, of course, around whether this could lead to another round of mobilization. And the war in Ukraine in itself is about consolidating Putin's power on the world stage. He said it this week. He said, if we stop now, we'll be a third or fourth rate country. No one will take us into account. I think that is a crucial insight into the thinking of Putin. He wants Russia to be up there with the superpowers of the world alongside the United States. Now, the other reason that we care in the shorter term about this election is because we may, as you alluded to that, get a sense of how strong opposition feeling is in Russia or how brave the Russian population is to show that opposition feeling in the face of the mounting repression that we've seen, especially since the start of the war. Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has called for people to turn out at noon on Sunday at polling stations and either vote or spoil their ballots or simply just stand there. And the Russian authorities, which have basically outlawed all non-prearranged forms of protest, have made it clear that they would see this as illegal. So, that sets up potential tension.

We, according to CNN's Jim Sciutto, came relatively close to a dangerous incident in the autumn of 2022. And it seems to be waxing again right now.Some of it looks like image making, potentially pre-election, Putin flying a nuclear capable strategic bomber several weeks ago. But other parts of it seem to be in response to comments from the French President Emmanuel Macron about opening the debate on putting Western troops on the ground in Ukraine, the expansion of NATO now to include Sweden. In his State of the Union address on February 29th, President Putin said that, you know, in any case of any sort of potential interventionists in this war, the consequences would be tragic. He said we have weapons that could hit their territory. And we saw that step up again this week, saying he would be ready to use nuclear weapons if the existence of the Russian state was at stake, though he said he didn't see a need for that yet. That is, of course, in the Russian nuclear doctrine. They're allowed to use a first strike if there's an existential threat to the existence of the state. And now we see chatter, a public meeting from President Putin on Thursday talking about Russia's plans when it comes to the nuclear sphere in space. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  This sphere is important. We've gotten used to having skills that other countries do not have. But this sphere needs to get special attention from us for it firstly to develop and secondly to be used in the future in order to fill the tasks that require this technology. (END VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN:  So, this is a posture, of course, from President Putin, but it does back up declassified U.S. intel that came out in the middle of February that suggested Russia was preparing an anti- satellite nuclear system in space. It wasn't clear how far along that road they've come serious enough for the U.S. to do that and declassify that intelligence.

In this third flight test, which lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, right on the border with Mexico, or as SpaceX likes to call it Starbase or the gateway to Mars, because this is the rocket that SpaceX hopes will someday land the very first humans on Mars will someday be used to perhaps even colonize Mars.But first, NASA is hoping that SpaceX will be able to deliver on its contract to land the first NASA astronauts on the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So there are some big hopes for this starship rocket. What we saw was a successful stage separation of the super heavy booster and the Starship rocket spacecraft on top it then flew for 49 minutes. And along the way, it beamed back these incredible HD live images. Thanks to some Starlink terminals that were on board, starship itself. Then we were able to see on entry as it was appropriate watching the splashdown site this incredible footage of starship like hitting the atmosphere and creating the plasma, this red glow around the spacecraft. I, id never seen in anything like it. I don't think anybody had really ever seen anything like it. And then Starship broke up likely just above the Indian Ocean, falling short of its ultimate goal, which is a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. But I should note that the overall objective, the primary goal of this mission was for Starship to reach orbital velocity or orbital speed. It did that and then some. This splash down in the Indian Ocean was always kind of like a dream case scenario. In order to get your FAA license, you have to say what the ultimate target would be. And so that was really the case here for folks that say, is this success or a failure, you have SpaceX, of course, calling this a success, but so is NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and so as Blue Origin, one of SpaceX's primary competitors headed my fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. So far more went right, than went wrong on this third flight test. And now, SpaceX says they have four more Starships ready to fly. They're hoping that the FAA can move quickly to work through this fairly routine mishap investigation and then granted, its next launch license. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington (END VIDEOTAPE)",
