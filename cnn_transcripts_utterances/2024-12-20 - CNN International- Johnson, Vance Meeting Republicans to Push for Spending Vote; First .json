It is 09the East Coast. I'm Erica Hill, joining you from New York in for Becky Anderson, today. This is \"Connect the World\". Ahead this hour, the U.N. says 100,000 Syrians have returned home since the Assad Regime collapsed as U.S. delegation arrives in Damascus. New federal charges for the suspect in the murder of the Healthcare CEO and Apple really feeling the heat after its new AI news feature, back fired, generating false information. The stock market here in New York set to open in just about 30 minutes. And so far, if we take a look at the futures, whole lot of red there on a Friday morning, maybe not all that promising. They've been hit, of course, perhaps, by fears of this looming government shutdown. So, there you have a future that's a sea of red. We'll see how that goes throughout the trading day. Meantime, at this hour in Washington, crucial meetings underway, yet another government shutdown looming. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President-Elect J. D. Vance meeting with Republican lawmakers. Johnson says he does expect a vote on the House floor for what would at this point be a Plan C bill to keep the government running after midnight tonight. This third attempt comes after the House, of course, rejected that Plan B bill just last night. That reaction there after Republican Congressman Mark Molinaro, who you saw smashing the gavel, appearing to break the gavel as he tried to bring order to the chamber, after a fierce debate. That failed Plan B bill, of course, came to the floor Thursday night after President-Elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk had worked in tandem to tank a bipartisan bill that would have funded the government into next March. Their moves sparking outrage and also a new nickname for Musk from Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): The Musk Johnson proposal is not serious. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Everybody agreed, and then it was blown up by Elon Musk, who apparently has become the fourth branch of government. REP. ROSA DELAURO (D-CT): President Musk said, don't do it. Don't do it. Shut the government down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It seems as though the Republican members of the House have conceded their responsibilities to the co-presidents Trump and Musk, and we don't have a separate legislative branch. There was an agreement that was made, and that's what the American people wanted. They wanted Democrats and Republicans to sit down and work this thing out. We did just that. We hammered it out for a long period of time and came up to an agreement, only to have at the last moment, co-president Musk start tweeting, then follow thereafter the president-elect, I guess he is following Musk now saying that killed the deal.

But what was also clear yesterday is they did not have Democratic support to lean on, so whatever they pass, at least at this point, from what offers are on the table, they're going to have to do it just among Republicans.

But in this case, they don't really know what the concession is. If it's, in fact, raising the debt limit. Republicans don't want to do that, so it's not clear what the strategy was here.

We are also learning from the Defense Department it turns out the U.S. has around 2000 troops in Syria right now. That is more than double what was previously disclosed. My colleague, Fredricka Whitfield, spoke with Alex Marquardt in Washington about these developments in just last hour. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The U.S. cut off diplomatic ties with the Assad Regime back in 2012 and now we are in this incredible transitional moment in Syria. And so, you have these top U.S. officials who have traveled to Damascus to meet with this, this umbrella militant group that overthrew Bashar Al Assad some two weeks ago, Hayat Tahrir Al Sham. We believe that this group of American diplomats has met with its leader, Ahmed Al Sharaa, the group and its leader are considered terrorists by the United States. Sharaa has a ten million bounty on his head. So, this is really quite remarkable, and we believe that they will have spoken about the future of Syria. The U.S.'s desire to see an inclusive government, a representative government, one that does not allow terrorists to be harbored inside Syria. Of course, HTS and Sharaa will be pushing for sanctions to be lifted on Syria, for them to -- for them to be redesignated, for those terrorist designations to be lifted. And then Fred certainly, a central focus of that conversation will be the location of Austin Tice, the Journalist who was detained and disappeared some 12 years ago. And in addition, Talif, who is expected to speak any moment now, you have Roger Carstens who is the top U.S. Official on Hostage Affairs, who is also there. And then, notably, the U.S. has also named a new senior adviser for Syria for this moment Daniel Rubenstein of Former Ambassador, Former Special Envoy to Syria under President Obama.

We know the U.S. government has been in direct contact with that group, HTS for -- to try to look out for Austin, as all of these prisons have been opened up. The Tice family understandably desperate for any news about their son. Some two weeks ago, they said they believed that he was still alive, that he had been treated well. We know that Debra Tice's mother had sent a letter to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, because President Assad of Syria is now in Russia, and he told reporters yesterday that he would speak to Assad about Tice try to learn what he could. And we did hear in that letter, Debra Tice saying that she was ready to go to Moscow or to anywhere to wrap her arms around our precious Austin and bring him safely home a truly desperate family looking for their son, Fredricka.

I think, while engaging with the group and its leader is useful at this stage, and will be important making sure that there is a unified position. And that message and that position is directly communicated with the group is essential. Because there is one sort of side of things that is related to the narrative and positive messages that the group is sending. However, when it comes to the implementation of those sort of promises. It's the situation is slightly different. When you look at the current transitional body that is appointed by the group, it's mostly, if not all. All of it is basically managed by individuals either who are part of the group or directly linked to the group, which makes, gives the group an extensive sort of control and influence over what's happening right now in Syria.

And that's what's most worrying, because people were thinking they were reading something directly from the BBC, and actually, there was another case for the New York Times. So, some of these headlines that were published by Apple include Luigi Mangione shoots himself. Made it seem directly coming from the BBC, and then actually a second one last month, this was pointed out by a pro-publican reporter that Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, had been arrested. Now, what seems to have happened here is that the AI, this Apple intelligence, got confused, because for the Netanyahu case, the International Criminal Court had issued an arrest warrant. But Netanyahu himself had not been arrested with Luigi Mangione case, it's possible they may have gotten confused with maybe the school shooter in Wisconsin. But no matter how or why, it got confused when it was presented to the user on their Apple iPhone, it made it seem as though had the BBC logo, had \"The New York Times\" logo. It made it seem that was the actual story itself. Now the BBC has complained, and they have asked Apple to fix this. Apple so far is not commenting, and the publishers I should note they have no control over this summary. It's not like they can input what they think the summary should be. It's the AI that's taking this itself.

Now why is this dangerous? Other than just, you know, people getting fake news is because what if, instead of another news story, it was saying something like, there's an active shooter in New York City, where we are right now, that could instill panic. People could react to that news. And that's why you're seeing places like Reporters Without Borders trying to urge Apple to just get rid of this feature itself.
