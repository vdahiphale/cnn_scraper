And it is a crucial day in the U.K. where millions of British voters are heading to their polling booths to cast their ballots in a general election. That will decide their next government. They have until the polls close at 10 P.M. local time, which is 5 o'clock late afternoon Eastern Time. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife voted earlier in Mr. Sunak's Yorkshire constituency in the north of England. Labour leader Keir Starmer and his wife also cast their ballots in London, as well, also voting in London. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, joined by his wife, as well. CNN's Nada Bashir is standing by from us in London. So Nada, just walk us through what you're seeing, so far. What can you tell us?",

Polls opened at 7 A.M., andthere's still a few hours to go before, of course, polls close at 10 P.M. local time, 5 P.M. Eastern Time in the U.S. But, of course, there are tens of thousands of polling stations like this one up and down the country. So, people have had the whole day to go out and cast their ballot. Now, of course, we are expecting those polls to close at 10 P.M. at which point the count begins. And for those parties across the country that are competing in this election, what they are trying to secure is a majority. There are 650 seats in the House of Commons, up for grabs, 650 constituencies. Unlike in the U.S, of course, and in some other countries, here in the United Kingdom, voters are casting their ballot for their local member of parliament, their local representative. And each party is looking to ensure and secure that their members of parliament are winning in these local categories, in these local constituencies, in order to secure that majority for the leaders of the parties. Of course, later on be declared the new prime minister of the country. Now, of course, when polls close at 10 P.M, that is when the exciting or interesting bit begins, of course, because that is when the counting begins. And many people will be staying up overnight to watch that vote- counting process, seeing the results come in constituency by constituency. And we are expecting to see that counting take place into the early hours of Friday morning. Now, there will be early exit polls throughout the night, giving us a sense, perhaps, of where the country may be swinging, which parties may be in the lead. But, of course, it won't be until Friday morning that an official result is announced before the successful party is able to declare itself the winner and form a government. So, still, some time to go before that begins. But, of course, there is still also time for people to vote. We've seen people arriving at this polling station. There are tight restrictions around what we can and can't say, of course, because polls are still open. So, there are restrictions around what we can report. We've seen other media outlets, of course, as is often the case in U.K. elections, focusing on the pets arriving, for example, at the polling stations. Of course, that tends to be a bit of a tradition here in the United Kingdom. But the weather is good, so we have seen many arriving. It's unclear what the turnout is just yet. We won't be expecting to see any figures around the turnout until later on tonight. But, again, lots to get into tonight, lots of debate, lots of analysis, and that will certainly all be unfolding when we begin our special coverage once polls close.",

      "sentences": "Well, it is difficult to see, and ultimately it will be a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas inGaza that could potentially unlock a calm on Israel's northern border to try and reach a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. But for now, what we are watching in northern Israel as well as in southern Lebanon is, once again, an escalation in the cross-border skirmishes that we have witnessed between Israel and Hezbollah over the last nearly nine months. Yesterday, Hezbollah firing a hundred rockets towards Israel. As you mentioned, Israel also killing a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. And today, we are watching Hezbollah's severe retaliation for the killing of that senior commander, firing more than 200 rockets at northern Israel, at the Golan Heights specifically, I should say. It appears to have sparked wildfires. Several hits appeared to have been identified in the Golan Heights as a result of those rockets, as well as several drones that were also fired by Hezbollah towards that very same area. Israel overnight, and continuing into today, striking multiple Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, as well. And so, we are watching quite a significant escalation between these two sides, one, of course, that we have been tracking very closely over the last several weeks. So far, it is difficult to see both exactly what could potentially trigger an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, but also what might potentially appease the tensions between these two sides and lead to a de- escalation on both sides in terms of this cross-border fighting that we have been witnessing for months now.",

The White House now admits that Biden saw a doctor in the days after his halting and weak debate performance. But officials say it was just a brief visit to check on the cold that Biden was suffering, not a full check-up. Biden is trying to fend off questions about his mental fitness and whether or not he should abandon his campaign for re-election altogether. Biden is due to preside over independent state festivities in Washington today, including delivering a speech. And he has a major interview scheduled with ABC News on Friday as he attempts to calm Democratic fears about his campaign. Let's bring in CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz with more. So, Arlette, we know what President Biden is saying publicly. But privately, how torn is he behind closed doors about whether to stay or whether or not to go here?",

Now, publicly, the president, in a call yesterday with campaign staff, insisted that he is staying in this race. He said in a pair of interviews this morning that he's focused on just keep moving forward. And the White House, of course, has said that he has no plans to drop out. But at the same time, the president has privately acknowledged to at least one key ally that he is aware of just how critical the coming days will be to the future of his candidacy. Now, the president will be speaking here at the White House a bit later this afternoon for these fourth of July festivities. He's spending the day with his family, who I'm told remains all in on him staying in the 2024 race. But there are also a number of key tests facing Biden in the days forward. He will hold that major interview with ABC News, something that his allies have encouraged him to do, to sit down for interviews, to hold more press conferences and have these more impromptu informal settings to show Americans that he has the stamina and ability to serve into a second term. Biden will also be traveling to the battleground states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days, putting him directly in front of voters. And this morning, there were two interviews that Biden taped yesterday that aired on black radio stations across the country. And in one of those interviews, the president tried to take his message directly to the people, saying that he understands how important the black community will be in the upcoming election. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D):  The vote of the black community matters intensely, intensely. Look, it would make up a significant portion of the American population. Who's going to represent you except folks like me? And we're not going to be able to represent you if you're not showing up, in fact, to vote. It matters. Your voice has to be heard. Lots of close elections the last couple of years, and every vote counts.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, this is a moment to celebrate the nation's independence, and it comes at a time when Biden has really made the fight for democracy, preserving and protecting democratic institutions, a key hallmark of his campaign. He sent an e-mail to supporters a short while ago where he said, \"I give you my word as a Biden. As long as I'm president, we're not walking away from our ideals, our alliances or our democracy.\" Of course, President Biden now is also in a fight for his own political survival following last week's debate.",

And as you can see behind me, the winds were powerful enough to carry a boat across the bay and make it crash here by the old pier and now, it's partially sunk. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said he believes the country is now entering into what he called the second phase of the disaster and response efforts after Hurricane Beryl dumped rain and brought hurricane-force winds to the island on Wednesday. Holness told CNN, storm surges have damaged coastal infrastructure in some areas. The prime minister also said that some 500 people have been displaced and are now staying in shelters. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, the eyewall of Hurricane Beryl brushed the southern coast of Jamaica last night with hurricane conditions occurring throughout much of the island. It continued raining on and off overnight. We have seen downed power lines, boats that were not properly secured and were sunk like the one right behind me and debris all over the island.

Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet, letting this Democratic drama play out. Meantime, we're beginning to see the first indication from Republicans that replacing President Biden could lead to a messy fight. CNN's Stephen Collinson joins us live now from Washington. So, Stephen, here's the thing. If Biden stays in this race, despite what people are saying, despite people telling him to drop out, if he decides to stay in this race and then come November he loses, what will that do to his legacy?

And then, when you think about the fact that he's been part of our political lives in the U.S. for, what is it, half a century? Since 1973, I mean, it's taken him a lot to get into that chair and I can understand why it is very difficult for him, despite what his advisors are saying, for him to just sort of give up.",

Remember, in 2016, there was some anger in the family that President Obama saw Hillary Clinton more as his likely heir than his own vice president, Joe Biden. When you talk to people around these two presidents, Biden and Obama, the tension actually is still there between these camps all the years later. At the same time, however, it is a personal decision, but the president is the president of the United States. He's the chief executive, and his biggest duty is the well-being of the country. And he has to think outside himself. There have been occasions in American history, from George Washington to Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson, when presidents were contemplating when is the right moment to step down. And in a way, the decision to cede power is as much about democracy and fulfilling democracy as running for office and winning the presidency. You have to find the right time. And even though the president would always seek to get a second term, because that's how presidents judge themselves, if they can win and then win again, and that's how history judges them in many ways, they have to pick the right moment to leave.",

If he then sort of hangs about, you know, long after a lot of people are telling him to leave, then that obviously changes if he loses. I can't tell, Stephen, which way this is likely to go. Yesterday, I was convinced that there was so much pressure on the president that he was probably at some point going to have to cave in. Then we had the meeting with a lot of Democratic governors who said that they addressed their concerns to the president, but were very defiant in the fact that they are sticking by him. And on top of that, President Biden is saying, listen, I'm not going anywhere, guys, sorry.

The problem is that he went into this debate down on former President Trump. It was close, but he was clearly losing this debate. He needed to use the debate to turn the situation around. Instead, he's in a much worse position than he was before. He's validated many of the concerns that Americans say they have about him being able to serve a second term. So, how does he close the gap now between himself and former President Trump? What happens? And I think that is the thing that is on the minds of many Democratic congressmen, for example, who are very worried about losing the House and the Senate and the White House, and then ending up with an era of total Republican dominance. And that, particularly in the wake of the threats that Trump is making about what he'd do in a second term, is something the president may not be able to overcome.",

If Biden is still the Democratic candidate, what incentive is there for Donald Trump to give him another chance? And added to that, if Biden isn't the candidate, the Democratic nominee will certainly be wanting a chance to stand beside Donald Trump and debate him. Again, the former president may not have that great incentive. So, it's going to be really interesting to watch the tactics of the debates as much as anything else in the next few weeks.",
