Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world to CNN's breaking news coverage of \"Israel at War.\"It is 11:00 p.m. Saturday night in Israel one week after Hamas slaughtered 1300 people in a terror attack inside Israel. Israel's military said it's preparing for, quote, \"the next stages of war,\" and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered that message himself to the frontlines earlier today. This is video he posted online of that exchange. Along the border with Gaza, more than 300,000 Israeli soldiers with heavy equipment -- you can see some of the tanks right there -- are awaiting Netanyahu's orders of ground invasion into Gaza. It could come at any time. Israel is ordering more than a million civilians to evacuate northern Gaza for their safety. Today, the State Department is urging Palestinian Americans in Gaza to move closer to the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows ever more ominous. The United Nations says water is running out, putting two million people at risk. The United Nations also says Israel's blockade must allow fuel deliveries to water plants and other facilities, saying, quote, \"It's a matter of life and death.\" Let's begin our coverage at this hour with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's in Jerusalem for us. Jeremy, I'm going to be speaking with the IDF spokesman in just a few moments, but it just seems eerily quiet in Gaza. It seems quiet where you are. But of course, things may be changing dramatically in the coming hours.",

It is going to be much, much wider, and that it is going to involve, quote, \"coordinated strikes from air, sea, and land.\"That is the latest update from the Israel Defense Forces in just the last few hours as they telegraphed, perhaps in the clearest terms yet, that a ground operation inside of Gaza of significant scale is indeed in the offing. When exactly that takes place, we do not yet know, but this latest statement from the IDF says that there will be a, quote, \"emphasis on significant ground operations in the next phase of this military response.\" At the same time, it's very clear that they are taking a very deliberate, a very strategic approach to the build-up that we are seeing along the Gaza Strip. More than 300,000 reservists have been called up. We have seen tanks and artillery beginning to be positioned in key locations around the Gaza Strip, and beyond that, of course, the IDF is also ordering civilians inside the northern half of Gaza to head south. That is provoking, of course, very difficult humanitarian conditions inside of Gaza, but the IDF says that it is intended to try and minimize those civilian casualties, which we have already seen dramatically increasing in recent days as Israel has ramped up its aerial bombing campaign of Gaza. What we are also hearing this evening from Israeli officials is a clearer indication of what the goal is here. We have heard a lot of fire and brimstone from the Israeli prime minister and other Israeli officials talking tough about destroying Hamas, and tonight, the National Security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi saying that Hamas will not be the ruler in Gaza after this operation, after this war concludes, saying that Hamas will no longer be the sovereign following combat operations in Gaza.",

We appreciate it. If you don't mind, if I could just pick up on what Jeremy Diamond was just talking about a few moments ago and help us sort out what is happening at the Rafah Crossing. My colleague, Wolf Blitzer, spoke with the Egyptian foreign minister just a short time ago and the foreign minister insisted that that crossing is open as far as they're concerned on the Egyptian side of things, but that is not what we are hearing. Perhaps you can help us sort this out. What is going on -- what information can you provide? LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Yes, the -- what I understand that Hamas is doing is -- all humanitarian efforts to alleviate the situation. They have been obstructing and actively stopping Gazan civilians in the north from going south as we have directed them to do. And I have also seen reports, this isn't 100 percent confirmed yet, that they're doing the same thing in the south. And at this time, I think it is abundantly clear that Hamas bears responsibility for everything in the Gaza Strip, first and foremost for the humanitarian situation, and they could change the situation very dramatically and very quickly. They only need to return our hostages and surrender unconditionally and the humanitarian situation in Gaza would be improved almost overnight.",

And currently, we are striking Hamas from the air. We are hunting their commanders. We're striking their facilities.

Again, important to emphasize, none of the civilians are our enemy. It's only Hamas that we are looking for. We are not trying to punish anybody or to inflict undue damage. We are focusing our military effort against Hamas, their leaders, and their supporting infrastructure and the combatants. Those are the ones we are after.

But as long as there's friction, as long as Hamas exists and has fighting power.As long as Yahya Sinwar is alive and his lieutenants and their commanders are alive, then we still have a fighting capability, and the end of this war will be with a dead Hamas leadership and with a dismantled military capacity of Hamas.",

And so, you know, statements were made by senior Israeli ministers that I think, you know, as they get into the excruciatingly challenging thinking around conducting a military operation in an immensely, densely packed small area, you know, I think everybody is sort of being more prudent perhaps than they were when they were looking at just the God-awful bloody apocalypse that we all witnessed a week ago.",

In other words, that says, hey, we're seeing these tactical movements in this particular location. Be aware of that.

He said that the current level of exchanges of fire between Israel and Lebanon is, in his words, \"below the escalation threshold.\" He went on to say that he hopes that Hezbollah doesn't bring the destruction of Lebanon. Now, keep in mind that prior to this current outbreak of fighting, on a variety of occasions, Israeli military and political officials have -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- essentially said that if Hezbollah engages in another war with Israel, Israel will bomb it back to the Stone Age. But he said that -- as I said, the level of exchanges is below the escalation threshold. He went on to say that all eyes are on the north and added, not just eyes. We know, Jim, that the Israelis have deployed tens of thousands of additional troops to the northern border in anticipation or just to make sure there isn't another outbreak of fighting beyond what we're seeing here.

In just the last several minutes, the White House here in Washington announced that President Biden did speak with the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today. It sounds as though -- let's bring in Bill Cohen, he served as secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton. He's the CEO of the Cohen Group. Secretary Cohen, great to see you as always. We appreciate it. It sounds as though, if some of these calls are being made, the leaders are speaking to one another in these final hours before some kind of incursion begins, it sounds as though perhaps the leaders who are obviously involved in all this are checking some of the boxes. Netanyahu was down at the border earlier today, telling his forces, get ready for the next stage. And then he's on the phone with the president, and the president's on the phone with the Palestinian leader. That sounds as though some of the final pieces of the puzzle are dropping into place before we see some action. WILLIAM COHEN, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I think it also signals that President Biden and Secretary Blinken had been reaching out to Mahmoud Abbas. Because if they're going to destroy Hamas, the Israelis cannot afford to have Hamas as its neighbor dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Israel is not going to allow their country to become a Hitlerian crematorium. That's vital for them and the world to understand. But we also have to understand, it's one thing to destroy Hamas, which must be done, or at least their leadership and their infrastructure. The other thing has to be done is to build up the Palestinian Authority in real terms, not only economically, diplomatically, but also say we're really talking about arranging some kind of a compromise here that will give you a livelihood and a separate identity and separate state. If you just destroy Hamas, then who do you deal with? The Palestinian people have legitimate grievances. They have to be addressed. But they're not going to be addressed through Hamas. And that's why I think these calls are going out to say, we're going to reach out to you, whatever happens here, we're going to reach out to you.",

And they're going to be conducting street-by-street, house-by-house types of raids looking for Hamas. What might the Israelis get dragged into? Or do they have to put that to the side because taking out Hamas is just that important to them at this point.",

They have to be concerned about Iran.Right now, their focus is get the hostages out if they can, but to say, we're coming in to destroy Hamas's capability of waging war against us as they did this past week. So, they will do what they have to do. The danger is the longer their either occupation of Gaza or their going and killing a lot of soldiers and innocent people, then the reaction worldwide is going to turn against them. They understand that, but they have no choice. Even if world opinion turns against them, they're saying, we are not going to relent here. We are not going to go into a second Holocaust. We didn't survive the Holocaust in order to come to a state that's supposed to be our protection where we can live in freedom. We're not going to let you turn that into a cemetery or crematorium. They're determined to go in if necessary. But the longer it goes on, the more demonstrations are going to take place in the United States, whether it's strong anti-Semitism in Europe and also in other parts of the world. This is going to be tough for them, and we have to make sure the United States stands by them.",
