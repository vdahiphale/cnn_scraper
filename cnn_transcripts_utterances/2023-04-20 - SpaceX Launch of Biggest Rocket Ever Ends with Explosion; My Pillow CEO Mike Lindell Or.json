But that launch cleared the launch pad and this area erupted in cheers as the rocket ship cleared the launch pad and we saw it go straight up for several minutes. And so that was a spectacular sight. And it was about that three-minute mark where we started anticipating that -- getting the sense that something wasn't going quite wrong, that this was not the best case scenario.And from what we've been able to gather so far, that booster unable to separate from the rocket, and that's what caused the disassembly, the explosion there. And what is stunning, though, is that you could see the smoke trail going east out over the Gulf of Mexico. And at some point, just with our eyes, we kind of lost sight of it. But you could then here a second round of intense rumbling and explosive sounds. I'm guessing that is probably the point where things went exactly wrong. From our vantage point here on the ground miles away, impossible to tell, but we're hoping to gather more information to determine exactly why the separation wasn't able to happen. Was it caused by crews here on the ground or was it something technical onboard the rocket ship? That is something we don't have an answer to him will continue to monitor. But by all accounts, many people, at least the people who are, you know, aficionados of watching these types of space programs, everyone kind of viewing this as a success. Even Elon Musk, John, on Sunday night was preparing people for a catastrophic failure. He was hoping at least saying publicly that he was hoping that the rocket would clear the launch pad so there wouldn't be some epic firework explosion there on the launch pad, which would be a costly process of rebuilding all of that infrastructure there at the star base. So, anyway, so it's just absolutely stunning sight to see. And just to kind of give people a sense of what it was like to be here on the ground, John, seconds after the rocket ship cleared, the top of the launch pad is when you could feel and start to begin hearing the rumbling of these 33 engines. And you could feel yourself shaking, vibrating from the from the thrust of all of that, and that was -- everybody I've talked to here this morning felt that same experience, which is simply just stunning.",

Do you think that timeline is still achievable now?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST:  Yes I'm still trying to figure out how many stars to give this Uber ride. But is it five for the good test or -- but put that aside, this rocket was never designed to be recovered. They were going to do a lap around the Earth, drop it into the ocean. So, in that respect the pipeline behind it really hasn't changed much. They've got a production facility there and they're cranking out these Starships fairly quickly. You know, what Michio is saying is significant, a fully the reusable rocket twice the thrust of a Saturn V. Everything is changed by orders of magnitude here as far as the amount of payload you can get into space and the cost diminishes as well. So, it really is a game changer.

And even in this day and age and the fact that half dozen or so then were out on the way up, that's asymmetric thrust, probably too much asymmetric thrust for it to handle and that's what caused the tumbling to begin and who knows what happened after that. We'll find out soon enough. But this is how you get there. You have to test and, you know, we get to see it. It's kind of -- it's a little bit scary.

And so I think NASA is playing a good game. It's basically saying they're going to spread the money out.And just remember that even though even though Elon Musk sometimes exaggerates on the timeframe, usually, his long-term projections are correct. For example, in Japan, he's already selling tourist tickets to go to the moon. There's Japanese billionaire who the entire rocket and he fully expects to go to the moon. These are these tickets are being sold already. In fact, it's sold out. And so the point of raising is that even through Elon Musk is part showman, of course, he is, of course, selling stocks and so and so forth, the basic thrust of what he's doing is in the direction of history.",

So, here is what an attorney for that cybersecurity expert now has to say about this decision. He says the lawsuit in verdict marked another important moment in the ongoing proof that the 2020 election was legal and valid and the role of cybersecurity in ensuring that integrity.

We do have an additional threat of tornadoes today, but let's go back to what happened last night, because this is astounding aerial footage taken from one of our affiliates, one of the helicopters, and this is a rain shelf, the super cell thunderstorm and the top portion of the screen. It's likely that there's a tornado embedded within that.But this is what makes these tornadoes so dangerous, because often when they produce what is called a wedge tornado, not saying that there is one here, but they're often wider than they are tall, so the potential to have a tornado that's over a mile wide, leaving that path of destruction is very real with these larger super cell threats. So, here's our threats for today. This is the latest information just updated from the Storm Prediction Center. That is a slight risk where you see that shading of yellow. It basically extends from outside of the Chicago suburbs all the way to the Gulf Coast. But I'm highlighting these areas across Central Illinois as well as Central Texas. That's where we have our greatest probability of tornadic activity today, the main threat being large hail and damaging winds, but we cannot rule out a tornado. We know these storms have already produced tornadic super cells and currently the radar quiet, but I think once we once we start to destabilize the atmosphere, get that sunshine, we start to make things a little bit more volatile in the atmosphere and we'll see those thunderstorms pop up once again today.
