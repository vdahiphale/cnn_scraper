      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Two days, two candidates, one historic debate. Primetime Thursday, a sitting president takes on his predecessor. Of course, the question for voters, should President Biden or Donald Trump lead the nation for the next four years. Behind closed doors, President Biden is huddling with advisers at Camp David. Sources tell CNN that several top Democrats are warning that a shift in messaging is essential at this point, and that Biden needs to talk less about his policy record and go directly after Donald Trump. Of course, that's according to some of the sources we're talking to. For his part, Trump's debate prep appears to include posting on his Truth Social account, consider this rant that says, quote, drug test for crooked Joe Biden. I would also immediately agree to one. That's from the former president, end quote. It's the latest bizarre and baseless suggestion from Trump and his allies that Biden will need some sort of performance enhancing drugs for the CNN showdown. We're covering both campaigns this morning with CNN's Kristen Holmes and Kevin Liptak. Kevin, let's begin with you. There's a new ad from the Biden campaign. What's it say?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it does give you kind of a preview of the economic message that they're going to focus on the debate. Because, as you mentioned, and as is typical, the president and his team are getting a lot of incoming from Democrats. They're concerned about the president trying to take too much credit for his economic record. Remember, this is the whole Bidenomics approach that they've tried to adopt over the last year. And the issue that they're running into is that it hasn't necessarily sunk in with voters, despite the record job gains, despite economic growth, many Americans just don't feel all that strong about the economy.And the concern is that President Biden, as would be natural, wants to take credit for some of these gains. But these Democrats who are talking to the campaign really want him to go on the offensive, avoid taking a victory lap and really try and ramp up the contrast with former President Trump and what he says are policies that would be inflationary, things like broad based tariffs, things like lowering the corporate tax rate. We did get a little preview of how they might frame this in an ad that they put out today. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's having phone calls with allies, talking to senior advisers, going over the policies that they hope that he is going to be focused on, on Thursday. That includes the economy for some of the reasons that Kevin laid out, that the American people tend to favor Donald Trump when it comes to talking about the economy. They also want him to focus on immigration. They believe this is a key issue for Americans across the country, and, again, it is something that Donald Trump pulls ahead of Joe Biden in.But this is really not your typical kind of drilling when it comes to debate prep. There is no one sitting there playing President Joe Biden. There is no one sitting there playing the moderators, Jake or Dana. Instead, it is really just conversations about what exactly Donald Trump should answer for, for some of the questions that might be particularly hard. Now, Trump yesterday did an interview in which he said some of his answering of questions counts as debate prep. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  How are you preparing? I'm preparing by taking questions from you and others, if you think about it. But I'm preparing by dealing with you. You're tougher than all of them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's the author of the Supermajority, How the Supreme Court is Dividing America. Michael, thanks so much for being with us. You know, it has been the case in the past that incumbents sometimes perform poorly during their first debate. What do you think? I mean, obviously, you heard Kevin and Kristen there a few moments ago talking about all these expectations and where the bar is being set. The Trump team first might have been setting the bar too low for Joe Biden, and now they're conscious of that. Where do you see things heading into this debate?",

They're surrounded by people who tell them everything they say is brilliant. When they walk in a room, a Marine band plays Hail to the Chief, they're often just not ready to hear their policies or administration criticized face-to-face. Bill Clinton knew about this jinx. He practiced very hard and prepared very hard and did better. I think it seems like President Biden is doing the same thing up at Camp David. It helps to be away from all the friendly advisors who have lots of advice. I think both Biden and Trump, of course, they're both old. They both have expectations they can surpass. Trump can surpass expectations by just not being the way he was last time. I think where, where they will do well, either of them, is in talking about the future and what they want and the contrast on policy, less on kind of the theatrics of it.",

You know, some of the questions that people care about, of course, immigration, the economy, I think the public this year also cares a great deal about the health of democracy. And that's going to be a challenge for Joe Biden, who said that this is a major issue for him to raise this. It's also something that Trump has things to say about, and I think it's also something I would encourage the CNN moderators not to rush past that issue, because I think this year it's really something people care about and polls show it's a very high concern.",

I don't know that a debate is necessarily the best place to do it. I think that the contrast with the opponent and, again, both for Biden and I would guess for Trump too.

He showed great deal of vigor. I think debates are different. They're more intimate setting. Biden thrived in the give and take of the room in Congress. Trump thrives in the give and take of his rallies. At least he displays a more distinctive persona. You know, Trump has expectation issues too, that he will very possibly be trying to surpass by not being as bombastic as he was four years ago.

It shows three men covered in blood being kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova Music Festival. The group that released this video says it is trying to ratchet up pressure on Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in calling any suggestion of a ceasefire without releasing hostages, quote, an unprecedented national failure.Barak Ravid joins us now. He's a CNN Political and Global Affairs Analyst and Political and Foreign Policy Reporter for Axios. He's been following the situation obviously very closely. Barak, what about this video?

In the meantime, Julian Assange is almost a free man. The WikiLeaks founder is on his way to his home country of Australia after accepting a plea deal that will let him avoid prison time in the U.S. This is just the latest twist in a nearly 15-year long saga involving one of the biggest breaches of U.S. classified material in history.

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, Jim, look, this is maybe the last chapter and what has been a for some intelligence officials, a deeply personal saga that has gone on for more than a decade, as you pointed out. Of course, in 2010, when Julian Assange's WikiLeaks first began publishing what prosecutors said was reams of classified data that he had goaded then Private Chelsea Manning, an intelligence army intelligence specialist, into illegally taking and then providing him to publish.The concern, of course, was that this was going to expose sources and methods, right, the crown jewels for the intelligence community, how they obtain information. And in particular, officials were really worried that this was going to endanger the lives of people in Iraq and Afghanistan who were working with the U.S. military, who were working with the U.S. intelligence community. It also was right off the bat, an incredibly controversial case, as I'm sure you remember, because there were, of course, people who believed that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks should be afforded the same First Amendment protections that you or I do. And, in fact, there were revelations that came out of some of those documents that were newsworthy, including information about a U.S. helicopter attack, a military helicopter attack in Iraq that killed civilians, right? So, right off the bat, hugely, hugely controversial case. The U.S. intelligence community did do a damage assessment here. They ultimately came to believe that their worst fears had not been realized about the damage that might have been done, particularly to the lives of human assets. But it remained to really important for U.S. officials to try to come up with some kind of deterrence here, right? Like they didn't want another WikiLeaks copycat toe to try to come to the fore here. Obama administration, the DOJ Obviously didn't move to charge him. The Trump administration in 2019 did. We are told that for Justice Department officials, it was really important to get to this guilty plea for felony, right, particularly related to the Espionage Act. So, what this deal does is it is essentially going to allow Assange to avoid further jail time, right? It's essentially going to credit him with the time he spent in the U.K. jail, but it gets the Justice Department what it wanted, which is a felony charge, assuming a judge, a federal judge approves it on Wednesday.",

And Netanyahu in that talk show seem to be walking it back and withdrawing this proposal and a day later, you know, he needed to reiterate in a speech in the Knesset that he is still committed to this proposal. But Israeli officials told me that this, you know, this dismissal by Netanyahu, this initial dismissal by Netanyahu, the proposal created a lot of damage because it basically sent the message to Hamas and to the rest of the world that Israel was not genuine in its proposal.",
