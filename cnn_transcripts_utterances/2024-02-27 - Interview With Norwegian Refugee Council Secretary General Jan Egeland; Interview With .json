I could see many hundreds of trucks lined up at the Rafah Crossing when I came today in Kerem Shalom.

The Hamas militants have food and they are in tunnels. They have nothing to do with the people that we aid. The chaos, yes, around the aid line is becoming worse and worse because there's so little aid coming in. Today, I'm pretty shaken actually from what I saw. The minute we crossed the border from, you know, orderly and sparsely populated Sinai, you see the aid trucks going full speed down the road, being chased by gangs of youth who jumped the trucks and before our eyes, loot mattresses, blankets, food, et cetera, to the desperate people outside who want to get some aid.",

There's no other way to describe it, which again shows that the Karni crossing, which is also from Israel, Israel could fix this. They are the occupying power.

That you can't necessarily say you can be a strong democracy if you're not helping it flourish elsewhere in the world. So, that is a big part of it.

And what they said, was not really. And of course, over time, as the Taliban was sweeping through the country, you know, that timeline shifted or, you know, declined and shrunk, but the decision was made. And the military was thinking, look, speed is safety. We got to get out as quickly as possible. So, they were on a faster timeline than even the White House suggested. And the people of the State Department that were thinking, hey, we need to reform this program to bring the Afghan allies of Americans home. They didn't have the time or worry with all to do it because they were worried about the diplomats in Kabul and calling allies to get people out. So, it was a miss. We cannot deny that. It was a miss that they really didn't prepare for the Taliban. And there was already public reporting, as I note in the book. There was already public reporting about what the Taliban was preparing to do and how quickly they could do it. Not that there were questions about the Afghan military's ability to withstand that onslaught. So, there are genuine questions to ask of the Biden administration of whether or not they miscalculated in thinking that it would not take so long, or two, that it would take a lot longer for the Taliban to do what they did. And I should know, you know, Biden, to this day, believes it was still the right decision to leave. He asked no one to resign, no one offered to resign. And if you'll ask them today, they still hold by those views.",

But the book reveals thatthat relationship was really, really bad, screaming match bad. At certain points, Biden was basically telling Zelensky, why don't you believe the intelligence we're showing you, that we're showing our allies, the Russians are coming, you need to prepare. And recall that there were military assessments, one of many, but the stark one was that Kyiv would fall within 72 hours. And throughout all these months of Biden and Zelenskyy chatting, Zelenskyy never believed that this was going to happen. He believed that they would be -- that Putin would be too stupid to do that, that it made no sense, that the Ukrainians didn't have intelligence to show that. And you did have Biden saying, look, you've got to start protecting your capital, you've got to start protecting your country. In the end, Zelenskyy was able -- and his military and his team were able to defend Kyiv and were able to defend many parts of Ukraine, and nothing sharpens the mind like seeing Russian tanks roll into your nation. But for many months, the Biden administration today would still probably tell you behind closed doors that, sure, a lot of time was missed for preparation for Ukraine. Although critics would note this of the Biden administration, there are those who would say the U.S. should have sent weapons a lot sooner to Ukraine to prepare their military for a greater defense and perhaps sanction the Russians even before an attack. And this is actually one of the reasons why Zelenskyy wasn't so confident in the American assessment. Because he would tell Biden, if you really believe this is happening, why aren't you, the U.S. and European allies, flooding my military with weapons? If you really believe an invasion is to come, I don't see you guys panicking as much as you should be.",

Recall that during that period, the U.S.and the West were negotiating with the Russians, in genuinely good faith. You know, Putin was putting out these arguments that it was because of NATO expansion and, you know, Ukraine tilting westward as the reasons for why he was considering doing this. Now, there are some ahistorical issues there that are a lot to get into. But the U.S. said, fine, if that's true, let's talk it through. Let's solve this at the table and not the battlefield. And so, that was part of it, is that to then pump Ukraine full of weapons might have damaged that diplomatic process. Obviously, it didn't work. Putin still invaded and he did what he did. But that was the general bet, is that if you help Ukraine too soon, if you arm them too soon, then Putin's going to have no choice but to go in sooner.",

And Netanyahu, who is not a popular figure, is being supported in that campaign. And his far-right government wants to root Hamas out. And again, you've got the public behind him. So as much as Biden, you know, knows Netanyahu, deals with him, the domestic context in Israel makes it a lot easier for Israel to rebuff American swazure (ph). What the Biden administration would say here is, look, you know, we're doing our best to support Israel's right to self- defense and push the Israelis to allow as much support for the Palestinians as possible in this case. They're trying to have it both ways, but it's leading to a lot of messaging muddle. And at this point, it's very clear that they are struggling to get Israel to do exactly what they would like Israel to do. And so, they're trying to find new ways to get Netanyahu to follow an American playbook.",

We should note that one of the big criticisms of the Bidenadministration is that they significantly ignored the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and let that to fester during their time in office. Now, I should note that in the months before the October 7th attack, as the U.S. was working with Israel and Saudi Arabia to have a normalization of relations, a key component of that was to improve the Palestinian situation, give them a pathway to a state, allow more humanitarian aid in, give them a sense of belonging. And that was pushed pretty strongly by the U.S. and they would not accept -- they would not endorse a deal, a normalization deal without it. But for many, that was far little too late. That they should have been focusing on this issue from the beginning instead of letting that wound fester for many years. And one of the criticisms of both, I should say, the Trump administration and the Biden administration, is that they did this as a bank shot, right? The Trump administration didn't think about the Palestinian issue when they were doing the Abraham Accords. That was wholly ignored. And while the Biden administration continued the Abraham Accord push, they left the Palestinian issue for far too late and it was a side bit. And so, they were -- their criticism is their goal of, if we do normalization with Arab states, it would make it easier to help Palestinians. Well, that may have been true over time. It's certainly not true after October 7th. And so, that bank shot strategy did not work.",

But there was a sense that basically the plan -- only plan A and the only plan is to get something through the House. And so, the amount of European officials who asked me what a discharge petition is, would astound you. That's how close they're paying attention. One thing I even heard, and this is from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and also Senator Brian Schatz, both Democrats, they talked about a story Zelenskyy told them, which is of a Ukrainian soldier in the trenches on the front lines taking artillery fire, but scrolling on his phone for any signs that the package would pass the House. That's where we are. That's how gloomy the picture really is. And no one could necessarily articulate a way forward.
