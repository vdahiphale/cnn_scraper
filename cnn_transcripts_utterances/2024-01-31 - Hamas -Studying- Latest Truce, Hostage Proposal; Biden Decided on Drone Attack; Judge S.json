But on Tuesday, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to press on until Israel's original war aims were achieved, saying he will not release what he called, quote, \"thousands of terrorists\" as part of any deal. Meantime, the families of the six remaining American hostages in Gaza met with U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday night. Earlier, he met with Qatar's prime minister, who is in Washington to discuss those latest negotiation efforts. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv for us. We've been talking now, Jeremy, for about 24 hours about the framework of this deal, of course, it sits out present with Hamas leadership as we speak. This latest iteration, as I understand it from a diplomatic source, who is familiar with the details of this deal, it doesn't include a guarantee for a permanent truce or cease-fire. Now while we shouldn't give up hope of course, it does seem unlikely at this pace, at this point, that Hamas will agree to this, doesn't it?",

Thank you very much indeed.Bated breath after U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he has decided on a response to a recent drone attack that killed three U.S. troops and injured dozens more. This happened near Jordan's border with Syria over the weekend. And U.S. officials are blaming Iran-backed militants. Iran itself, its part, is denying any involvement. Mr. Biden hasn't yet said what the U.S. response will be or when it might happen. Well, meantime, the U.S. is signaled out for the most powerful Iran backed militia in Iraq. Kataeb Hezbollah is likely to have carried out that deadly drone attack on Sunday. In what was a surprise move yesterday around this time, the group itself said it will suspend military operations against U.S. forces in the region. The Pentagon replied saying, quote, \"Actions speak louder than words.\" All of this, of course, as the U.S. and Iraq are expected to begin talks on the future of U.S. troops in the country amid public calls from the Iraqi government for Washington to withdraw. There's a lot to unpack here. I couldn't have a better couple of guests to do that for you. CNN senior political commentator, Adam Kinzinger, joins us from Texas. He is a former U.S. congressman and a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air National Guard, who also served in Iraq. And a regular guest on the show, good friend of the show, Vali Nasr is a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University, today in Paris. Good to have you both. Adam, let me start with. You. Have a listen to what President Biden has had to say about his administration's response to what we now come to call the tower 22 (ph) attack (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the first deadly one. We've made it very clear we will show restraint -- I think pretty incredible restraint, to be honest with you -- up until you kill our troops and that happened. So I think obviously a significant response against the militias in the region. The real question will be, do they go after Iran at all? I doubt it will be targets in Tehran. I think you may see maritime assets. You may see drone part factories That's a possibility. But let's keep this in mind. This is not in a vacuum. This isn't the first time Iran or Iranian backed militias have attacked our troops. I was in part of Task Force 17 in Iraq, which actually went after Iran and Iranian backed militias in Iraq. And close to 400-500 troops, American troops, were killed by Iran. So this has been an ongoing thing. I think it'll be a significant response.

In other words, they're not foreign Iranian troops working in Iraq that would take direct orders from Tehran. They do have local interests. They do have their play. They played a game in local politics. They also have their own vested interests. So yes, they cooperate from Iran. Iran would have to push a lot to get what it wants. But it's no different than the fact that the United States provides enormous amount of support to some allies. Doesn't mean that all the time it can decide what those allies will do. So some of these Iraqi groups are more under Iranian control than less.

And then we come back very strongly and say, there is certainly going to be a response. What happens? It doesn't inflame the area. Maybe it will but Iran is now all of a sudden in what seems like a bit of a panic because they recognize, when the United States makes a decision to do something, it can do basically whatever it wants from a military perspective. And so I would argue this, like, yes, it is a very dangerous moment. It's a very dangerous moment because Iran has continued -- we were attacked by an Iranian made drone.

And let's not forget that, when the United States last time really went aggressively against Iran and killed IRGC commander General Soleimani, Iran responded with dozens of missile attacks on an American base, which was miraculous no Americans died and we didn't end up in a war at that point in time. So we shouldn't overestimate the fact that Iranians will back off. Secondly, whether you look at American allies or you look at Iran and its allies, they're all asking the same thing, that the United States ends this war, that the root reason for this escalation that we've seen is the war. The United States cannot right now do that. It actually much rather speak about either the hostages or what happens after the war ends, rather than how it's going to end the war. And let's not forget, things calm down completely; when we had eight days of ceasefire, all the militia stopped fighting. The Houthis, Hezbollah, et cetera. And if this deal happens, it will come about. But there is a big gap between -- the way the United States looks at this, which means it wants everybody else to stay calm until Israel finishes its war in Gaza. And the rest of the region, which wants this war ended yesterday. And that gap cannot right now be closed by the United States for very obvious reasons. Israel is not ready to end the war. Hamas is still there. And the region is not willing to give Israel the time and the space to do this.

And so the pressure is on today. You saw parents filing into this hearing room today, carrying pictures of young people who presumably have been harmed by social media platforms. And so I think the pressure is on for lawmakers to do more than just talking here. And for the social media CEOs to really explain what they're doing to keep young people safe. I think there are a number of reasons why this hearing might be different this year than in the past years that we've heard these kinds of concerns brought to Capitol Hill. You have a number of legislative proposals that are more serious this time around. You have the Kids Online Safety Act, which SNAP has already endorsed. And I think you'll hear these other CEOs face pressure to endorse as well. What senator Lindsey Graham said at the opening of this hearing, I thought was really interesting, is that this is one of the few areas where there is bipartisan support among lawmakers to do something about this issue. I think we're going to hear the CEOs here talking about some of the existing youth safety measures that they have, ways for parents to observe their young people's use of social media platforms. But the critics have said that that doesn't go far enough and that it puts too much pressure on parents and on teens to have a safe experience on these platforms; whereas the platforms themselves need to be doing more and perhaps need to be changing their business model and not monetizing these young users in a way that puts them at risk.",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The Red Sea is a crucial international trade route for goods and energy. We hope to avoid tensions in the Red Sea and call for an end to attacks on civilian vessels. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  Disruption in the Red Sea follows disruption of Ukraine's wheat exports after Russia's invasion. It also follows chaos in the shipping industry during the COVID pandemic, another reminder of just how sensitive global supply chains can be to unpredicted shock -- Paula Hancocks, CNN, Abu Dhabi.

The Fed widelyexpected to hold benchmark interest rates steady. What could prove far more impactful to markets is what the Fed chairman Jerome Powell has to say in a news conference that follows the announcement. Let's explain.

      "sentences": "Becky, the Fed is preparing to make a big shift in policy and it's a shift that really everyone is going tofeel the impact on. Remember the Fed has been hiking interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, trying to get inflation under control by making it more expensive to borrow. And that, of course, has lifted the cost to get a mortgage or to get a credit card loan or carry credit card debt right now. And all this has really impacted consumers. But now inflation has cooled off enough where the Fed is preparing to finally give borrowers a little bit of a break by lowering interest rates for first time since 2020. And that expectation of a rate hike has helped to fuel the rally on Wall Street. U.S. stocks down today. But this is after a series of record closes for the market. And the question though, of course, is when, when is the Fed going to start cutting interest rates? Now we know it's not going to be today. There's almost no chance of a rate cut at today's meeting. But during the press conference, Fed chair Jerome Powell, he could  drop some hints about a rate cut at the next meeting in March. The market is pricing in about a 50-50 chance of a rate cut in March. Another question is whether or not there's a little bit too much optimism on Wall Street about a rate cut. And I think that what Jerome Powell says in the next few hours is going to go a long way in shifting the perception on Wall Street about whether or not rate cuts are something that's going to happen this spring or if it's maybe something that we can expecting later in the year, such as the summer.",

I think he's going to get asked about what it will take in the next few weeks and months of economic data to seal the deal on a rate cut. But we know Powell has been through this before, right? And he's going to be smart. He's going to leave himself some wiggle room because, to your point, Becky, this is not an easy call. This is not an easy job for central bankers, because, if they move too quickly to start cutting interest rates, they could end up fueling inflation, right? If you make it cheaper to get a mortgage and cheaper to borrow, to get a car, well, you're going to actually boost demand. And could that then cause another wave of inflation? They don't want that. But the other risk is that they wait too long, right? If they keep slamming the brakes on the economy, eventually that's going to slow the economy into recession and they don't want that, either. So it is a very difficult call and they need to sort of telegraph markets when rate cuts are going to happen.",
