One, on the front lines of Europe. In Normandy, alongside those ceremonies to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-day, President Biden will meet directly with President Zelenskyy. And they'll discuss the state of play in Ukraine, on the ground and in the air, and discuss how the U.S. and other allies can continue supporting Ukraine. Biden has recently authorized Ukraine to begin using American made weapons to strike inside Russia over the border, which National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called common sense. When Biden returns to Paris, he and President Macron are going to be having a conversation about, again, how they can continue supporting Ukraine and shore up more funding both from other European defense budgets, as well as Russian assets that are frozen in the continent. That's going to be a key deliverable at next week's G-7 Summit. But, Kasie, zooming out here, as President Biden is trying to project strength overseas, it all confounds him at home, where voters have given him low marks and are becoming frustrated with his handling of the myriad foreign policy issues that he's been presented with. Take just the issue in the Middle East. Twenty-eight percent of voters surveyed by \"The New York Times\" and Sienna approve of his handling. Here in Paris, pressure is building on Biden and allies to reach resolutions to both the conflict in the Middle East and in Europe. Kasie.",

Trump's lawyers want Judge Cannon to throw out the case. Trump has attacked, of course, just about every judge he's encountered in his legal battles, except this one, Aileen Cannon, who he happened to appoint. The former president has frequently praised her in public, describing her as smart and highly respected.

In terms of how the family's reacting, you know, it's incredibly heavy. They - they all have different reactions. Ashley Biden, Hunter's sister, was, you know, wiping tears throughout the morning and then actually left in the middle of the opening statements yesterday - or, sorry, not during the opening stands, during the first - the first testimony. Jill Biden tried to look stoic when she was there. And you could tell that Hunter's wife was - was sort of - was sort of angry, was sort of defiant. Now, this is only going to get more fraught today because today we are expecting to hear from Hunter's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, one of Hunter's, ex-girlfriends, who he was with around the time when he purchased the gun, and - and Beau Biden's widow, who was romantically involved with Hunter, Hallie Biden. We are expected to hear from potentially all three today. And Hallie Biden and Kathleen Biden are subpoenaed for the prosecution. And Abbe Lowell, Hunter's attorney, indicated that Naomi Biden and Jimmy Biden are going to be witnesses for the defense. So, really, it's Biden versus Biden in this - in this case.",

They write this, quote, \"congressional Republicans, foreign leaders, a non- partisan national security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment. Now, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.

I don't think the story is very good for Donald Trump either. It talks about his mistakes and flubs and - on the trail. But look, this is a challenge for Joe Biden. No question. Polling shows that Americans do believe he is too old to be president. And he's just going to have to really defy those challenges on the trail because his accomplishments, you know, speak to a presidency that got a lot done in four years. And so I think he's just going to have to drive that point home on the trail. And in the debates.",

And that also feeds into whether they think there's something there or not.So, for example, if you get on the phone with a reporter, there's a tricky topic and you start kind of freaking out or getting very defensive, that tells most reporters that they're on to something here. If you brush it off, they - they really read how you react to these things. And I think the White House reaction, I can't speak for the reporters here, fed, we're onto something here, and caused them to chase more.",
