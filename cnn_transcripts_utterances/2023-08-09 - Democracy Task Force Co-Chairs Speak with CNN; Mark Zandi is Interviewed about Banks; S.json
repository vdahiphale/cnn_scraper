They're going to make a First Amendment claim, this was all speech. They're going to say he just relied on advice of counsel, so he did nothing wrong. And that he truly believed that he won.

And, as a consequence, Jack Smith brought charges that -- against the former president that would not allow for a First Amendment defense. And he did that in this way.The former president now stands charged with criminal offenses of conduct. The indictment makes crystal clear that the former president was not being charged in any way whatsoever with his speech. That is, his calls for the march on the Capitol and all of the multitude of other speech acts that he committed on January 6th, and even before then. You know, the way - the way to think of it -- the way I think of it, Poppy, is that the other offense for which the former president could have been charged, and many thought might be charged, was with insurrection against the United States of America. That would have entailed, at least potentially, a charge involving the president's speech. But Jack Smith chose not to bring that particular charge under 18 USC Section 2383, most likely to avoid the First Amendment claim that the president was going to make to begin with. As to the advice of counsel defense, Poppy, of course, you know, standing alone, any defendant would have that potential defense.

Stocks fell yesterday after Moody's downgraded several regional banks and warns that it could do the same to six larger banks. Now, the U.S. banking industry, you'll remember, was shaken earlier this year by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic, one after the other.Joining us now is chief economist at Moody's Analyst, Mark Zandi. Mark, good to see you. So, is this the reason that these banks have been downgraded, is that the same reason we saw the problems with those three banks earlier this year? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MODDY'S ANALYTICS: Yes, Victor, I can't comment on the ratings, but I think it's pretty clear the banking system is under a lot of pressure, similar to the pressure that existed back in March. You know, at root it's the Federal Reserve's very aggressive interest rate hikes that's raising the cost of funds, the deposit rates that banks use to fund their loan growth, and, therefore, it's undermining or weakening their profitability. And there's other issues. You know, credit quality, which has been very good, is starting to weaken. (INAUDIBLE) delinquency and defaults on credit cards and commercial real estate loans are starting to rise. Loan growth is weak. You know, the economy has turned softer because of the higher interest rates. And the banks themselves have tightened up under - under -- on their standards for making those loans.",

In - this, to a large degree, is by design, right? The Federal Reserve is working really hard to slow the economy's growth rate down. And one way they do that is though, you know, putting pressure on the banking system so that the banks pull back on their lending. And that's exactly what's happening.",

Now, this year, so far, as of today, the 9th of August, nearly 94,000 people have reached -- migrants and refugees have reached Italy alone.
