      "sentences": "Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.We want to start this hour with breaking news that you heard exactly an hour go right here on CNN. The judge in Donald Trump's election subversion case in Georgia has now ruled that the district attorney, Fani Willis, who is prosecuting the case, can remain on the case, but his ruling states that that can happen only if the special prosecutor that she appointed withdraws from the case. The defense had claimed that Willis financially benefited from that relationship with Nathan Wade, who you see on your screen here. Let's start this hour with Ryan Young, who is following this for us from Atlanta. Ryan, of course, we had been waiting weeks for this decision. It is now out. Walk us through the ruling. RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good Morning, Rahel. Look, this is so much to this at this point. Like you said before basically the judge has said Fani Willis can stay, Nathan Wade has to go, and as we went through all this, you can see the fact that Nathan Wade not only had a relationship with Fani Willis, but at some point it came into question about whether or not the financials matched up. And both Fani Willis, Nathan Wade admit to taking several trips with each other. This happened between October 2022 and 2023. Some of these trips were very expensive and at some point Fani Willis started paying him in cash. Well, in court, the conversation started to come up about whether or not that was improper. The judge basically says there's a lot of about this that doesn't seem right. And if you're a prosecutor, you want the public to believe that you're running above board. Maybe that didn't work out the way, but Fani Willis gets to stay in this case. So many people were wondering whether or not this prosecution would move forward. I can tell you this for sure. If she was removed from this case, more than likely this prosecution would not be able to move forward in the way that people wanted to. Now, we know that Fani Willis' office wanted to try to prosecute this case before the November election. Already with Nathan Wade maybe being pulled off this, it may slow that down because you still have to do jury selection. Some of the things that we also been going through is the fact that we know for a fact that at this point Nathan Wade was paid $650,000 and so Donald Trump's group and organization and lawyers were trying to say that because of those benefits that Fani Willis was directly able to financially benefit from that. She says she uses cash and you can understand why she was apparently so angry about this. When she was in court two weeks ago she was basically saying she should not be the one on trial. So when you pull all this back, all this conversation, especially here in Fulton County, people now know this judge, Judge McAfee, has moved forward by basically calling a lot of this into question. But at the same time even saying that they use poor judgment. But Fani Willis gets to stay. We also know she's not going to step in front of the cameras today. They've already made that decision before this judgment came out so at this point, we have to read through this and see some of the parts of this, how they move forward in terms of prosecution in this case?",

He says while respecting the court's decision, we believe the court did notafford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade, including the financial benefits. Testifying truthfully about when their personal relationship began as with Willis. And so you understand there's still so much question about when this relationship started and when you put all this together, this really gets played out sort of all incorporated at the same time in the public eye. Nathan Wade was going through a divorce. It sounds like it was quite messy at some point. So people wanted to just sort of figure out when the relationship with Fani Willis started. Did it start before he was hired or after? They contend that it started afterwards, and then he was supposed to be paid a certain amount of money. But because of the overtime in this case, $650,000 was paid to Nathan Wade. Then obviously, Fani Willis makes a certain amount of money and then they started traveling together. One of the trips to Miami and Aruba was over $5,000. She said she paid for her half in cash because she never wanted to be beholden to a man. So all this has played out in Fulton County. And as you can understand, people were wondering what was going to happen with this, but the judge, he said over and over again, he wanted to do something that not only would he follow the law, but he wanted to make sure that he called it like he saw it, and that's why you can see there are some very strong language in this about how he feels, what was going on in that DA's office as we're going through this right now -- Rahel.",

Ryan young, so good to have you today. Thank you. Let's continue the conversation now and bring in David Weinstein. He's a former state and federal prosecutor in Miami.

And he's answered that question for us. And so that's why Fani Willis is on the edge of this dilemma now. You know, she can stay on the case, but the person she selected to move it forward has to be removed. And the judge's rulings did call into question a lot of decisions that were made that led to this appearance of impropriety. Rahel, you have to remember in the system itself whether you're representing the state, the government, or the defense, you want to make sure that you are appearing to be who you are. Defendants are very zealous advocates on the party of their clients. But for the prosecution, you have to stay middle of the road. You have to do things that don't call your integrity into question. And that's what happened here. And while it was a small victory for her because she's allowed to stay in the case within his opinion, the judge made some very poignant and pointed remarks about her actions and what she did. And he gave her an out. He said you can stay on the case, but the person you selected to lead this case, he has to go or it's going to rise to the level of a far greater problem for you.",

Is there any likelihood that this happens, this trial goes to trial before November, before the election?",

It was going to come real close to November before the case can go to trial. But simply removing one prosecutor, although he was the lead prosecutor, there are a team of other prosecutors. It's March. They can step in. They know what the evidence is, they know what their burden of proof is. It's not so much that the prosecution is going to need more time. They claim they were ready last year when some of the defendants demanded a speedy trial. And so I don't see that being an issue for when this case goes to trial.",

Thats just my opinion. But I think that given the ruling this court made and the impact it has on the jury pool, and as you mentioned, the court of public opinion, she needs to step back and take a strictly managerial role on this.

For more on this I want to bring in CNN's senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz, who joins us live from Fort Pierce, Florida. She is there because Trump is facing another criminal case there. But let's just talk about the politics of this case for a moment, Katelyn.

      "sentences": "Right. And Rahel, each of these cases, the defense strategy very simply has been delay, delay, delay as much as you can. They're gettingthat in at least three of the cases right now, potentially, this case as well. There's a monster list of opinions that Judge Cannon here in the classified documents federal case against Donald Trump still has to rule on. Those are getting backed up. We don't have a trial date here in New York. There looks like a delay coming to the March, late March start date for that trial. That might be a month or two, something like that. And then on top of that, there's that case in D.C. We're waiting for what the Supreme Court does related to presidential immunity and Donald Trump as president after the 2020 election on those conspiracy charges related to January 6th. So all of those delay questions are hanging around this but there are other questions too about what happens here in the coming months as those delays happen. And one of the things that Donald Trump's team has clearly done, not just in Fulton County with Fani Willis under oath having to testify about her relationship personally with Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor, is that they've tried to put the focus back on the prosecutors in all of these cases, asking for hearings where that potentially there could be questions raised about how these cases were charged, how they were brought, who the people are behind them. Donald Trump, over his time, not just as a candidate, as a president, but now as a criminal defendant, much of it has been about questioning the system. And that is what he's doing now, not just in this Fulton County case, but in all of the cases, including the one here in Florida where we were just in court yesterday for five hours.",

And you've got lots of testimony from various witnesses, including some of the defendants who have now pled guilty and have agreed to cooperate. This is an extremely strong, overpowering case. And this was one of the few avenues that Donald Trump had to try and derail it, the other avenue that he's pressed in all four of these cases is to try and delay because he knows that once a jury is sworn in, testimony is taken in. All four of these cases, he's going to be convicted. The odds are way against him of being exonerated for sure. And his only hope there is hoping to get a hung jury in one of those cases.",

The judge says that if Willis stays, well, then the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who you see here with whom she had a personal relationship, well, then he has to go.

There is going to be an additional delay because it gives Trump a chance here as in the other cases to stretch any verdicts passed in November 5th election day. That is all good for Trump.",

I'm just like you, I'm oppressed by the system which, you know, is kind of laughable, but a lot of people buy it. And so that is what Trump will do. That's how he will twist the results. Immigration is a separate thing entirely. But of course it produces millions of votes for him. The economy produces millions of votes for him.

The judge in the case, Scott McAfee, this isthe Georgia election interference case in Fulton County, mincing no words in this ruling where he decided and ruled that the digital attorney, Fani Willis, can remain on the case. But in this ruling came very strong language. He wrote, in part, \"The court therefore concludes that the prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the state selects one of two options. The district attorney may choose to step aside along with the whole of her office and refer the prosecution to the Prosecuting Attorney's Council for reassignment. \"Alternatively, SADA Wade can withdraw allowing the district attorney, the defendants, and the public to move forward without his presence or renumeration distracting from and potentially compromising the merits of this case.\" Obviously referring to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor here, who Fani Willis had appointed to the case. Let's discuss this further and dive deeper with Michael Zeldin. He is a former federal prosecutor. Michael, always good to talk to you on these huge legal days. If I remember correctly, you thought this might be the case that Fani Willis would not be withdrawn from this case. Talk to me about your reactions to this ruling.",

So in some sense it advantages the case. Willis, if I were in her position, I would not be the public face of this case anymore. She was never going to try it. But she sits there, glowering in court, and making press statements. I think if I were her, I would recede into the background and try to get the temperature down in this whole matter. The good news is her office can stay on the case if she elects to get rid of Wade, which she will, of course. And that the case can now proceed.

She says in her election campaign that she is going to make it right with respect to thepeople of Georgia and Donald Trump's interference with the free election. She gets elected on that platform. And in part, she indicts Donald Trump. She brings on a prosecutor who then she has an affair with, when she's caught having that affair, which is not illegal by any means, she is accused of malpractice, in a sense, and is asked to leave the case rather than respond in court initially to that. She goes to church and a largely African-American church and accuses those who are asking him to step aside for this appearance of race and other allegations of impropriety, personal impropriety on her part. And the judge said, look, you know, you're the elected district attorney in this jurisdiction you shouldn't be in churches making political comments. You should be in court responding to requests for discovery and other matters, and then you show up in court and you start attacking the people who are bringing these legitimate charges. They had a right to bring these motions. And you come in here, you pranced into court. You started accusing them of bad faith and bad behavior and pretending that there's not anything that she's done wrong. And the judge said, look, enough of this, you can't go to church and make these comments. You can't come into this court and berate the lawyers and call them the criminals and not her. And that's just unbecoming. And so that's where we are. And so he's saying you can't do but stuff. It's unprofessional, it's unbecoming. It's beneath the dignity of this office and essentially cut it out. And in fact, we'll see whether or not she's referred to the bar association for some sort of sanction with respect to her license. But he says it didn't rise to a conflict under Georgia law. Instead, it created an appearance of conflict. And to get rid of that appearance, you've got to do one of two things. You and your whole office are going to go or this prosecutor that you brought on, that you had this unfortunate sexual relationship with during the course of this prosecution has to go. Take your choice. Well, obviously, he's going to choose to get rid of him and now I'm saying she should step back and let somebody else be the face of this case.",

So people can't talk about this publicly. I saw your last segment. There was a conversation about whether or not she should sort of move into the shadows, so to speak, and let this case play out. What we do know is there will be no news conference today to address all the things that happened. Something else that stood out to us was the fact that the judge was also talking about the poor decision-making. On page nine, if someone was looking this up, without sufficient evidence that the district attorney acquired a personal stake in the prosecution or that her financial arrangements had any impact on the case. Defendants' claims of an actual conflict of must be denied. This finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony. There was even talk about how she testified there in court, and sometimes it got quite contentious in that courtroom. I can remember Fani Willis sitting there in court and basically say, I'm not the one who's on trial, these people who broke the law, in her words, should be the one who's on trial. So you put all this together, is played out in Fulton County, the eyes of the world were paying attention to this and this racketeering case that had so many people involved, and you have to remember this is where Donald Trump was brought in to the jail. There was a mug shot taken. So many questions about how this moves forward. And all this to stay, you can understand, Steve Sadow has come out with a statement from Donald Trump's lawyers and basically he says, while respecting the court's decision, we believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade, including the financial benefits testifying on truthfully about when their personal relationship began, as well as Willis MLK church speech where she sprayed the race card and falsely accused the defendants and their counsel of racism. So you can understand the impact of this because there's so much conversation, especially in Fulton County where people are paying attention to this case as this moves forward, obviously, we're trying to get all the people who are involved in this to get in front of the camera to talk to us about their opinion. But you can see Scott McAfee with his decision. Fani Willis gets to stay if Nathan Wade leaves. So, so much more to play out. Who takes the mantle next?
