So, like this, we don't have to have troops on the ground. Having Donald Trump call the shots, having Donald Trump as president is a recipe for spillover.Donald Trump's only role would be to -- because we don't have any leverage. Right now, we don't -- we're not providing aid, so we can't pull back aid. What leverage does Donald Trump have to influence Ukraine at all? What we would end up seeing is Donald Trump withdraw from Europe in general, embolden Russia, probably all those restraints that we're seeing with regards to the Baltics and Poland would start to ease and we could see those troops pour into Ukraine because the fact is that these countries would much rather fight on Ukraine's territory, stop Russia there than on their own. So, there is no path. It is an absurdity. Frankly, somebody who would say this would come -- sound like a fool. But Donald Trump makes these pronouncements that mean nothing because there's no leverage, no influence to do this. And if anything, he would be advancing the interests of war and direct U.S. involvement in the region because of his bad policies.",

The Huskies are now the first team to win back-to- back championships since the University of Florida's streak back in '06 and '07.Joining me now to discuss as Rachel Nichols, the host of \"Headliners with Rachel Nichols\" on Showtime and Paramount+. Rachel, great to see you again. You know, at the beginning of that game, I thought Purdue was going to give UConn a run for their money. Zach Edey was looking good and it was just -- UConn is just too tough. They just wear everybody down. RACHEL NICHOLS, HOST OF SHOWTIME'S \"HEADLINERS WITH RACHEL NICHOLS\": Yes. I mean, they've been so dominant all season through the tournament. They came into the game with a point differential of 18 points per game. I mean, that's just bonkers. So, Purdue know -- knew what to expect. Getting out to a hot start was really -- it's only a shot, but it certainly wasn't going to guarantee anything. Connecticut just overwhelms teams because not only are they incredibly deep and talented, it's just all the little things we always hear about in sports, right? They play like a team. They have great chemistry. They're really all out aggressive defensively. And just -- there's no mistakes. They're a very intelligent team.",

Not only is the interest in college women's basketball just absolutely skyrocketed, you're going to see that carry over into the WNBA.The Indiana Fever have the number one overall draft pick this coming summer. They are expected to nab, of course, Caitlin Clark. And the Las Vegas Aces, who have, up until now, been really the most dominant and popular team in the last few years knew there would be such interest when the Aces team played Caitlin's fever team this coming summer. Caitlin Clark was still playing for Iowa last week when the Las Vegas Aces booked a 20,000 seat arena for their matchup later this summer. She hasn't even gotten there yet. She hasn't even been drafted, and opponents are already knowing she's going to sell out buildings all over the country.",

You were just talking about the men's game, right? And we've had so many conversations about the idea that so many of these players are one and done, they go straight on to the NBA after barely a year at college. You don't have the time to form rivalries, the things we love so much about sports in this NCAA tournament. You don't have the time for stars to then mentor other players.And so, you don't have these teams that made us so happy maybe 20 years ago when we were watching this stuff. Well, the women still have all of that because especially of the name, image and licensing money that is now coming into the sport. For some of these women, it is more profitable for them to stay in college longer than it is to go to the WNBA where they might get a salary. And I think that creates, you know, times where, say, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese of LSU, we were all waiting with bated breath to see what would happen when they faced each other again, because they had that great game last year. So, we're getting these moments in women's college basketball. You just don't get any more on the men's side. We're all conditioned to want them, right? We all want that magic March Madness feeling.

The secondary area is the one that's over into eastern Texas and it's really starting to spread that moisture into areas of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi.We already have several flash floodings underway as we speak. More are likely to be added as we go through the day today because a lot of these areas are just going to keep getting rain in the same spots. So, you have a pretty wide swath of a flood potential throughout the day today. The target point, obviously, going to be across Eastern Texas, Northern Louisiana and Western Mississippi. But it's not just flooding. We have other threats as well. The potential for a very large hail. Yesterday, we had reports of baseball size hail that again is possible today, but also damaging winds and the potential for tornadoes. Tomorrow, the same threats exist, but we start to see that shift a little bit farther to the east. Jim.",
