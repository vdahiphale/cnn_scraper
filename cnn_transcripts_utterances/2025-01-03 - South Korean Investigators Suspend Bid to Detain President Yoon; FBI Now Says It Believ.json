Investigators arrived at the official presidential residence hoursago, trying to execute an arrest warrant against impeached President Yoon. They say he refused to cooperate with the investigation into suspected abuse of power and orchestrating a rebellion, which can potentially carry the death penalty. The charges relate to the short-lived martial law that Yoon imposed last month, but investigators say the presidential security prevented them from actually reaching Yoon. For more, we are joined by Mike Valerio, who's in the thick of the -- the thick of the crowds there, and he joins us live from Seoul. Mike, can you bring us right up to speed?

Well, they have up until Monday morning, Paula -- We're talking about investigators and prosecutors -- to potentially bring in suspended President Yoon Suk-Yeol for questioning related to his declaration of martial law, which happened one month ago tonight. It happened December 3rd into the early morning hours of December 4th.So, in our background behind us, just steps away, these are all, Paula, supporters of suspended President Yoon Suk-Yeol. And they are gathered here. You see all these American flags, too. American flags seen as a symbol of democracy and the rule of law, especially for so many conservative supporters of Yoon Suk-Yeol. They're saying, hey, we are here to support the president. And what is happening, the effort by prosecutors and investigators to bring him in, that -- stressing from their point of view -- is illegal, and they are here to support Yoon Suk-Yeol. In fact, the suspended president sent out a hard-copy letter as he's been inside his presidential compound for the better part of almost three weeks, Paula, telling his supporters come out in droves, prevent this from happening. Prevent me from being detained; prevent me from being arrested. And what we see all around us are hundreds, if not the low number of a few thousands, of people answering that clarion call to protect the president. So, this was a standoff that started around 6:20 local time. So, it lasted for about seven hours. And essentially, for our viewers watching back home in America and joining us throughout the world, this was -- Yoon Suk-Yeol, the suspended president of South Korea, is the equivalent of his Secret Service, saying to investigators, we're not going to give our guy up. We are not going to give suspended President Yoon up, because we are charged with protecting him. So, it was a back and forth for seven hours. And the prosecutorial -- prosecutorial and investigative team said just before we came on the air with you that they're going to stop for the time being, suspend their attempted arrest. They could try again between now and Monday -- Monday morning, or they could get a new warrant, because I'll tell you, there are still thousands, if not millions, of people across South Korea who want Yoon Suk-Yeol held accountable for declaring martial law on December 3rd into December 4th -- Paula.",

This standoff right now is really highlighting the challenges that South Korea's legal and investigative and court system is facing when it comes to this unprecedented nature, this unprecedented incident where they're trying to detain and question and even arrest a sitting South Korean president. Now, you know, the whole issue right now is between investigative agencies. There are several involved right now. And Yoon and his lawyers and conservatives are claiming that the current investigative agency that had issued the warrant, that had is executing it, does not have -- is not in their jurisdiction to do so. Yoon and his legal team has also claimed that it's -- it is unlawful for investigators and prosecutors to prosecute a sitting president without having had the constitutional court rule on the national assembly's impeachment of him. And so, he and his lawyers are claiming that the court, the constitutional court, first has to make a ruling about his fate and then pursue an investigation, if that's the course that they're going to take. And so -- but, you know -- but at the same time, and that's a very narrow, you know, if we -- if we magnify focus out a little bit, right now, it's really a political battle between the left, the progressives and the right, the conservatives. Also, it's not just about bringing justice, or it's not just about holding the South Korean president accountable, which is clearly, of course, the key and important issue. But it's also about a politics of which party will -- can and will govern and rule the country. But it's also a fight for that lead -- the head of the opposition party, Lee Jae-Myung, who also is apparently trying to avoid his own trial so that he can run for president in an early election next year.",

Now, authorities have revised the death toll to 14 in that horrific terror attack in New Orleans. We have some disturbing new video that shows just how frightening the situation was. It shows 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar speeding down Bourbon Street. You see it there, in that white pickup truck. Pedestrians obviously out celebrating the new year, but then having to scramble to get out of the way. The FBI has released new pictures of Jabbar walking around the French Quarter in the hours before the attack. One shows a blue cooler with a long handle, which investigators say contained one of the two improvised explosive devices that were planted in that area. Now, another video obtained exclusively by CNN, appears to show Jabbar putting a white pole with a black top into the back of the truck. Police say an ISIS flag was attached to the trailer hitch during the attack. Now, the White House says so far it has seen no evidence of foreign direction or involvement in the New Orleans terror attack. But the FBI is focusing on the suspect's apparent interest in ISIS.

Now, both Israel and Hamas have blamed the other for talks stalling in recent weeks. Indirect discussions are ongoing, even as official negotiations have been deadlocked for months. Now, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the renewed efforts for negotiations, while adding there is no time to waste for those still being held captive in Gaza. Meantime, Palestinian officials say an Israeli strike in Southern Gaza killed 11 people, including the head of Gaza's police and a top deputy. Gaza's Interior Ministry accused Israel of attempting to undermine law and order, while the Israeli military accused the police deputy of being a terrorist in coordination with Hamas. The location of the strike, Al-Mawasi, was previously designated by Israel as a humanitarian area, but has repeatedly come under attack anyway. [00:50:02] Elsewhere, a local hospital and relatives say an Israeli drone strike killed at least eight people working at a petrol station in central Gaza. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees is calling on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as winter sets in. UNWRA warns that frigid temperatures and heavy rain are threatening lives. Several people, including at least five infants, have died from the severe cold weather in recent days. Details now from CNN's Paula Hancocks. A warning: her report is graphic and may be disturbing to some viewers, but it's also a reminder that this is the reality for Palestinians in Gaza.

His twin, Ali, is fighting for his life in intensive care. His father says, \"I came from the North, from Beit Lahiya, because of the Israeli bombing, only to come here and watch them die from cold and hunger.\" Juma (ph) is one of at least five babies to have died from hypothermia in Gaza in recent days. As funeral prayers are recited above two tiny bodies, children look on: trauma buried in eyes that have seen almost 15 months of horror. Ali is fighting sepsis. His doctor says he is in critical condition. \"They live in a tent,\" the doctor says. \"In this freezing winter weather, even adults suffer from the cold. So, imagine the severe threat to young children.\" Juma's mother folds up clothes he will never again wear. She shows a heating device given by a U.N. agency the day before he died. She never had the chance to wrap him in it. Since Juma's death, conditions in Gaza have only worsened. Storms and torrential rain making surviving in makeshift tents almost impossible. This man from Jabalya camp stands outside his flooded tent. He says it collapsed under the weight of the rain. His family's' bedding is soaked. As children walk by, he says, more water comes in. This barefooted boy tries to dig a mud defense for his family's tent, but the sheer volume of water makes most barricades worthless. Despite the heavy rains transforming streets into rivers, drinking water remains scarce, causing chaos at the stations when the water trucks arrive. Some try to see the fun side of the rain. Shoeless children run in between the waterlogged tents. But the misery is acute. This newborn baby, Salah Mahmoud al-Fasi (ph), froze to death on Christmas day. The cruel irony: she died in a tent in al-Mawasi, an area Israel has designated a humanitarian zone. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
