The whole make America great again is about -- there was this era that was wonderful, as 1950s, and I'm going to bring you back there. He's now using nostalgia about the Trump administration just a few years ago, everything was perfect. So, he's trying to own both the nostalgic past and a future he can bring you to, which leads Biden -- which started with the president and no place to go. And so if you're a Democrat, don't get just thrown off by the motions here. He's got a rhetorical strategy. We've got to figure out a way to take that narrative away from him.

Phil, you alluded to the same thing. I think it was a missed opportunity for the president in terms of what Van is saying is correct. Biden says this correctly all the time. Don't judge me against the almighty. Judge me against the alternative. And to Van's point, voters are going to look at Trump and they're going to look at the alternative, Biden. If you look at the numbers right now, and the current president's numbers suck. They're terrible.And so what explains Trump's strength? It's Biden's weakness, right? And so I think voters are going to make -- they're going to make that comparison. And I think last night was a missed opportunity for the president -- for them former president to say, look, Kaitlan, we're never going to agree on January 20th -- I mean, on the 2020 election, we're not going to agree on January 6th, but let's talk about some things we might agree on. We need a stronger border. We need to stop fentanyl. I mean, everyone today in America is watching the border crisis happen in real-time, and they're thinking we need to fix this. This isn't working correctly, right? And so Trump really missed an opportunity to really address those types of things.
