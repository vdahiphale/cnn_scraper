Police also in riot gear.There's also video on social media showing men and officers fighting. This comes as police are investigating a knife attack in Dublin. Several people including a 5-year-old girl were apparently hurt. A man in his 50s is currently detained. We'll of course stay on top of this story and bring you the very latest. Elon Musk is facing a growing crisis at Twitter. More than a dozen advertisers, including some of the world's largest media companies, have cut ties with the social media site that's now known as X. This comes after a damaging report showing an unnerving amount of antisemitic and pro-Nazi content being shared on the site, including tweets from the CEO himself. But rather than apologizing and ensuring his advertisers that he takes their complaints seriously, Musk is now suing the media watchdog that released that report. This is not the first time that a tweet has gotten the billionaire in trouble. A recent college graduate is now suing Musk for defamation. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has that report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

One of Musk's lawyers telling me last night that they expect this case to be dismissed, but really, this lawsuit really lists page after page, instance after instance of where it appears that Musk is repeatedly, over the course of many months, engaging with conspiracy theorists on his X platform, and sometimes appearing to engage or even amplifying racist or antisemitic conspiracy theories.

We have no information about his well-being or whereabouts. The last we've heard, about three weeks ago, he was alive, but it was indicated that this was for a specific timestamp and the situation is just so fluid, had what was known three weeks ago can't be relevant now, which is why we will keep pushing for the release of all the hostages, irrespective of their gender, their age.

And for this past seven weeks, we moved from optimism to a pessimism, and we are sometimes faced with the realization that perhaps it won't be a happy ending here.

That day cannot happen with Hamas being behind the border. Our family grew up to terror. I grew up in Sderot on the border. My growing up experience, living with rockets and terror attacks, so was my sister, but I still insist that we have to be optimistic and hopeful about the future, while being realistic how we can achieve it and achieving it right now is ensuring the release of the hostages, and ensuring that Hamas can no longer play a part in the realization of the hopes and dreams of both Israelis and Palestinians.",
