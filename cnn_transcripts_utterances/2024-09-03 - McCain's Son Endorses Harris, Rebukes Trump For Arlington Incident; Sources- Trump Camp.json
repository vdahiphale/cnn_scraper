Plus, giving up. New reporting into OUTFRONT that the Trump campaign is all but deserting a state that Trump once thought he could win. And we'll tell you which one and why this matters tonight. And a former top aide to two New York governors charged with acting as an agent of the Chinese government. Who is she? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, an endorsement for Kamala Harris driving headlines tonight and it comes from someone named McCain, Jim McCain, who has served in the military for 17 years. He is the son of the late Senator John McCain. And Jim McCain is speaking out against Trump's altercation the campaigns altercation with an Arlington Cemetery staffer who attempted to stop Trump's team from filming in the area of the cemetery where recent U.S. casualties are buried. And McCain, who has just returned from a seven-month deployment to the Middle East, minced no words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM MCCAIN, SON OF SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: It's a violation because these rules are set in place. They're joining the military because they feel it's the right thing. And the least we can do is when they're gone, if they -- you know, when they're in Arlington, is to respect the rules and regulations that are in place, like not politicizing the fact that these men and women are there.

But what's interesting, Erin, is that Harris is now embracing cutting red tape and cutting taxes, principles that have traditionally been espoused by Republicans. And this, of course, is coming just weeks after the right it has been subjecting her to broadsides that her first economic rollout where she called for more government involvement in the housing market and in grocery pricing was too populist, including critiques from former President Trump himself on Truth Social called her policies soviet style and urged his supporters to vote for him if they wanted more cash and less tax. Now, advisers to Harris that I've spoken with say that she does believe that some Trump era tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations should be allowed to lapse and that money should be used instead to fund other more targeted programs for average Americans. But Erin, of course, this all comes against the backdrop of that high stakes conversation next week with Harris hunkering down in Pittsburgh, during the later part of this week, to prepare for that debate, which is now just one week away -- Erin.",

And yet Donald Trump's still retains the support of a lot of folks in the middle military, a lot of veterans' families.He was very pleased this weekend to see Kamala Harris kind of engage on this because he immediately followed it up by posting statements from a variety of the Gold Star families involved who had lost loved ones in Afghanistan. He believes, and I think this is not an incorrect strategy to say, look, people have already decided if they liked me or they don't like me, who I need to win are the people that don't like me personally, but think I'm better on policy. They think I would have been better if I had been president when it came to something like Afghanistan.

There are some voters going, okay, she's more of an unknown. I want to see what she's all about. It's really interesting to me, by the way, that even though she took a lot of positions that were pretty far to the left back when she ran for president in 2020, she's really tried, I think, on economic policy to have a couple of things that are these signals to the center. I want to cut red tape. I want to cut taxes. It's really interesting.

Look if you don't like Donald Trump, I promise if you vote for me, I'll have some policies you like.

It doesn't have any advertising and an internal polling seems to suggest that Trump could actually lose the state by more than he did in 2020. Now, the Trump campaign says that this person is speaking out of turn, that the Trump campaign has a robust operation in New Hampshire and they intend to fight there. But when I talked to other Republican operatives in the state, they said that this volunteer is painting a pretty clear picture that's really illustrated of what's happening there. One of them, Mike Dennehy, he's a longtime Republican operative there. He has been a strategist, the presidential campaigns. He told me quotes, if the election were held today, Trump would lose by six to eight points. He's got to win the race. So you have to shift resources and I can absolutely fully understand that point of view. It's just hard to make the case for him to spend his resources there.
