CNN senior national security analyst and former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Juliette Kayyem joining us now. You know what really stuck with me is, you know, we were talking to Kimberly Dozier the people she spoke with insight, Israel said that this is their 9/11, which also speaks to the surprising nature of these attacks. And of course, the big question is, how did Israel miss this? I mean, this is obviously a huge intelligence failure. Is that your assessment?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and this is the sort of space I work in in terms of sort of counterterrorism or preparedness, just to call this an intelligence failure, I think sort of is too easy. I mean, of course, there's the intelligence failure in the sense of how did Israel not pick up such a planned attack. I mean, they infiltrate these groups, they pay off members of these groups, they do everything that one would want to do to protect yourself as a nation, when you have an internal or close by terrorist threat. And they have a pretty good sense of incursions.But this is a well-planned attack air, sea, land that they -- what we know right now is they didn't pick up. We may learn later that there was some hints of this or people were trying to get the military to pay attention. So there's that piece on the intelligence piece. What I also can't believe knowing the professionalism and the and the resources put into Israel's defenses is, is the breakdown in defensive is in on air in land on sea in terms of technology, anti-drone weaponry, and defense. It's just -- it is to say that the system unfortunately broke down for Israel is I think what we're going to learn in terms of their defenses. It's not their fault. Of course, they should not be attacked by a terrorist group, but it's just those of us who know, the apparatus both on the pre-side the intelligence side and the response side. This is not what we would have expected to see in Israel. And I think that's why you're seeing these responses about the intelligence failure and the equivalent to 9/11.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I don't even know if the priority right now for Israel is necessarily to quell the violence. I mean, they're going to have to -- Netanyahu is essentially promised a ground war that is what they have prepared for that is what they're building up to use Egypt and other countries.I'm trying to calm it down. This is not 2021 when the last time there was this kind of incursion or similar incursion, this is much bigger. Netanyahu government is more conservative. His hold over it is based on, you know, sort of a more militaristic responses is not one in which he's going to address with diplomacy first, or trying to calm it first. So I think we have to anticipate this is a scary time for Israelis and pretend for the Middle East generally. I mean, in the battle, you know, if you look at the intelligence part, the war part, and in the backdrop is with some very hopeful efforts in geopolitics that the White House was brokering with Saudi Arabia for a long term solution to this issue related to the Palestinians. I can't see how that's on anyone's front burner right now. And whether though -- those diplomatic resolutions that might have come to more concessions to the Palestinians, greater land use offered by the Israelis to the Palestinians, I don't see how anyone is thinking of that right now. So the consequences of this our journey of life and also of geopolitics.",

      "sentences": "Got it. Yes, absolutely. And of course, the security posture of Israel right now has to be extremely, extremely vigilant. Because again, we don't know what happens next, what exactly was planned. We spoke with the IDF spokesperson. And of course, you know, the North is a concern, if there's an attack or there's some kind of coordination with Lebanon, of course, Syria is also up in the air.But in addition to that, the infiltration routes, I mean, this is something as they're trying to save these hostages and get that situation under control, where you have civilians who are under siege who are barricaded in their own homes, you also have to prioritize finding these infiltration routes from the ground at least.

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. And that is -- that's the ground war part of this, you know, in Israel, right, you should -- you're -- this piece of it right now, this sort of hand to hand, you know, door to door combat is ongoing right now. I don't think we can make that clear enough to viewers, this is not some sort of excursion, you know, by bombs over and we wake up and it's over.The second piece, of course, is Israel and the population are much more civil defense oriented than then we are certainly. They've, you know, they all serve in the army, but also the population in terms of their readiness is just very different in terms of their training their expectations. So you have a population that also is very scared right now, but also has been trained, knows where to go, knows the resources to protect themselves. So you're going to have different pieces of this in terms of the Israeli response. I've worked with Israeli Civil Defense Emergency Management, this is the piece where they then, you know, sort of begin to trigger the civil population to protect itself from what could be future attacks assuming that it's not over that Hamas was more organized than just this first launch which was spectacular and all the horrible ways I mean it and unexpected.",
