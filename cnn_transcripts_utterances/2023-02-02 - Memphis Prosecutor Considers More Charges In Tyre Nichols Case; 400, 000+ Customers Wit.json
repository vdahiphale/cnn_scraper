One of the big questions we have after what happened to Tyre Nichols is why did police pull him over.We were initially told it was because of reckless driving though later the police chief said after review, there's no evidence of that. So, will this additional video and audio that's not been released yet give us insight into why he was pulled over? Yesterday, the district attorney told Wolf Blitzer that a lot of the video that we haven't seen yet happens after the beating already took place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's also unusual that the arresting officer is not the one that authored the incident report. Normally, that's what would take place, the person who was actually involved in the arrest, and it would have been reviewed and signed by a supervisor. [11So, what kind of culpability is there with a sergeant or other supervisor who may have reviewed the report and signed it? Did they know that the information contained in the report was inaccurate? That's all part of this ongoing investigation. Remember, the DA is looking at it from a prosecutorial point of view. Internally, the department is looking at it from a more administrative internal discipline point of view.

What is it? What is the dynamic at play that officers feel comfortable when they know their body-worn cameras or on talking about something, talking about this in this way?

But having said that, there are cases in which it's as if people forget they have it on, they don't care or what have you.And it is mind-boggling that it's on camera, but thank God it is on camera because now we can uncover the truth in terms of what took place.
