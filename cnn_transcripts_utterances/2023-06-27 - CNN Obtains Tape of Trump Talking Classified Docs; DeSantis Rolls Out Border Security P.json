He is speaking to two people working on an autobiography for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and the former president knew he was being recorded, his own aides were making a recording of this meeting, in addition, the folks working on that autobiography.But even though he knew he was making a record of this conversation, the former president was, as you can hear on this tape, surprisingly casual when talking about some of our nation's most sensitive secrets. He admits that this information that he is sharing with others in the room, who do not have proper clearance or any clearance at all. He acknowledges this is classified information, that he could've declassified it when he was in the White House, but that he no longer had the power to do so. Now, in public, the former president has repeatedly said that he did not have these documents, that it is not actually that document that he is referring to in this tape. One interesting quote that you hear on the CNN version of this tape which was not included in the indictment is that the former president said, these are the papers. And so, he is insisting that in fact, whatever he appears to be showing other people in the room are the papers that he alleges will vindicate him in terms of Mark Milley's comments about Iran. Now this tape is expected to be a central piece of evidence for the special counsel. Another aspect of the tape that was not included in the indictment is former President Trump and least one of his staffers, mocking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server. Now, that's, of course, not really pertinent to the criminal case, but in the court of public opinion, it does appear to be hubris. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The organizers of the rebellion could not fail to understand this. They understood everything, including that they resorted to criminal acts to divide and weaken the country, which is now confronting a colossal external threat, an unprecedented pressure from outside. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator):  Two factors played into my decision to turn around. First factor, we wanted to avoid a Russian bloodshed.

So, that's the justification there.[05:10:01] They don't mention Yevgeny Prigozhin by the name. There's still some confusion around whether the charges against him for organizing the rebellion still stand, or will as the Kremlin spokesperson suggested on Sunday night, be dropped. Significant though, we also get news via state media from the ministry of defense, that Wagner is preparing they say, to hand over their weaponry to the ministry of defense. This is something that Prigozhin and his audio message on Monday said that they have been planning to do, by June 30th, before that alleges strike, he accuses Russia of doing on the Wagner camp, which he says was the trigger for his so-called march for justice in Russia. So this appears to be Wagner reverting to that plan to actually hand over those weapons. Significant, because it does smack of some kind of dissolution of the group itself, even though Prigozhin in that same audio address said that -- he talked about how the president of Belarus, Lukashenko, have offered a way for Wagner to continue its work in a legal jurisdiction. So, this is a crucial question going forward, what will in fact be the status of the Wagner group?",

Belarus is essentially functions as a sort of subsidiary of Russia, is extremely close and I've grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine.He said it was painful to watch, the events which took place in the south of Russia. And he says in no case should you make a hero out of me for his role in that, or Putin, or of Prigozhin in fact because he says, they missed the situation and thought it would resolve. But it didn't. So, an interesting admission now of how things spiraled beyond perhaps what they were expecting. One thing that he did not see, a crucial elephant in the room, the whereabouts of Prigozhin himself, he's been told that he could now relocate to Belarus, we are still watching and waiting to see if that happens.",

Let's bring in CNN military analyst and former member of the joint staff at the pentagon, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. So nice to see you this morning. What do you make of the news that the Russian officials say they are dropping insurrection charges against the Wagner group, and that heavy military equipment will be handed over to the Russian military? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, good morning, Christine. I would say that means Putin has won, at least this round of the battle between the Wagner group/Prigozhin, and Putin. So, it seems as if what the Russian administration of Putin's folks are doing, is taking control of the Wagner group.

That is a significant challenge to Putin's leadership. And it means that although weakened, Putin is going to lash out as much as much as he can against the elements of Wagner or anybody else who tries to mount some kind of rebellion like this. This is something which has happened a lot of in Russian history in the past, where a group will demonstrate the dissatisfaction. They will be subsumed temporarily by the state, or whatever organization runs the territory at that point in time.

The second is that they erroneously focused on intra right-wing fighting. So they were focused on the groups going against each other rather than the groups unifying and going after politicians.
