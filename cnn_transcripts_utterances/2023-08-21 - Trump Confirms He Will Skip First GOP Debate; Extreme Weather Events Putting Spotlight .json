So, a Chris Christie or an Asa Hutchinson may not have as much opportunity for breakout moments because their goal was to go at him directly.For the rest of the field, they have not been wanting to take him on directly. So not having him there actually lets them go forward with that strategy. I would argue, looking at the numbers, it's not a strategy that seems to be working all that well for them.",

I would note, according to polls, three-quarters of Republicans want to see Donald Trump on the debate stage. They think, if you qualified for the debate, you should show up.

And part of that is because nobody is taking him on.Look, every indictment that comes down, the Republican base is looking to all these Republican leaders to say, is this a big deal or not. When all of these Republican leaders with a few exceptions say, no, not only is this not a big deal, this is an attack on Donald Trump, it's a violation of his rights, all that kind of stuff, of course, they're going to believe that and they're going to rally around Donald Trump. Because in their mind, their leaders are telling them that this is a witch hunt against Donald Trump. I think the winning strategy is not necessarily for a single person on the debate stage, but if they all would actually go after Donald Trump, you could begin to change people's minds. They're not going to do that. What you're going to see -- this is going to be kind of funny to watch -- is they will all be eager to prove how tough they are, how fierce of a debater they are. And they're going to do it by debating other people on the stage and ignoring Donald Trump. With the exception of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson. It will be funny to watch them try to be tough without actually taking on the person they need to.",

The question is, are you auditioning for a role in a future Trump administration, in which case, my actual advice would be, drop out and endorse Donald Trump and try to kiss up to him even more, or are you actually running for the job of president? If you're running for the job of president, you have to win. How do you win? It's not going to be by kissing up to the frontrunner. He's the frontrunner. It's going to be by taking him on, hoping some of those arguments break through. And ultimately, we'll need some consolidation around those that are, I'll call it the anti-Trump candidates.",

Hilary's historic landfall marked the first time a tropical storm hit that region in 84 years.Just the latest extreme weather event to strike the planet. This month, deadly wildfires swept across Hawaii, killing at least 114, many hundreds still missing. In July, earth recorded the hottest month ever. The string of weather-related disasters is putting a spotlight on the role that climate change is playing. Daniel Swain is a USLA climate scientist who studies how climate change affects extreme weather events. Daniel, just listen, it's difficult for folks to understand. And I know that climate is not weather. However, climate certainly affects weather and we're seeing evidence of that virtually every day. Can scientists like yourself, doing the research, connect the dots between an event like this and the changes we're seeing as a result of climate change? DANIEL SWAIN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UCLA INSTITUTE OF THE ENVIRONMENT &amp; SUSTAINABILITY: Well, you're absolutely right that climate is not weather, but also weather is directly affected by climate and, therefore, by climate change. We are seeing increases in certain types of extreme weather events in a warming climate. Some are more linked than others. Extreme heat, of course, perhaps the most obvious link. But also extreme precipitation events is maybe the next most obvious connection between a warming climate and extreme weather. Of course, the main impacts from this event we just saw unfold in California, with this Tropical Storm Hilary, was an extreme precipitation and flood event.",

And the most direct answer is we don't know yet because this is not a topic that has been much researched.The question is very different in California than on the eastern seaboard are hurricanes are much more common and ocean temperatures are supportive of hurricanes. We don't expect water temperatures off the coast of California will warm enough to support hurricane development, say, right off the Santa Monica pier. But it is possible, or at least plausible, that warming ocean temperatures will make it a little bit easier for those storms that form further south along the coast of Mexico to weaken less quickly as they approach California from the south, on occasion. It will still be rare, but slightly less rare. And the precipitation that might occur when we see events like this with much -- would likely be much more intense in a warming climate because climate change increases all kinds of extreme precipitation events.",
