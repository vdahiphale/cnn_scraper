But here's President Bide riding a bicycle.Donald Trump always played golf when he was in the Oval Office. Barack Obama famously got on a basketball court and saw it at the White House. And if French President Macron needs a sparring partner, I might suggest outgoing Senator -- Utah Senator Mitt Romney. Here he is, boxing former heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield for charity. If Romney's busy, I'm only a phone call away, Mr. Macron. I think he'd honestly win, but what are you going to do? All right, thanks everybody for being with us today. Thanks for joining us.

      "sentences": "So, we have new CNN polling out this morning and the state of the race today is staring directly at the blue wall, Michigan and Pennsylvania, two battleground states that Joe Biden flipped in 2020, two battleground states where voters right now do not appear happy with their choices.Less than half say they're satisfied with a Biden-Trump rematch. And when you dive in, you see in Pennsylvania there's a dead heat between the president and former president, both with 46 percent support. The good sign for the Biden campaign, Biden appears to be holding advantage there with women voters, voters of color and independents. The Biden campaign is likely feeling quite differently about the view in Michigan right now. Among registered voters there, Donald Trump has an eight-point advantage and seems to be gaining ground with younger voters and independents. CNN's David Chalian has much more for us. David, a smart man named David Chalian flagged this morning that roughly a quarter of voters in both of these states say that they are not locked in to their vote quite yet. Why is that so important to talk to us?",

      "sentences": "Which makes sense, right, because we are still seven plus months away from the election.So, it's important because, A, as we know with polls, this is a snapshot in time. But when voters tell you, yes, I could change my mind, it kind of proves the point that there is work to be done here for both the Trump and the Biden campaigns with all these months ahead of them to seal the deal. But I want to go inside a little bit some of the demographic slices underneath those horse race numbers that you just provided. Look here in Pennsylvania. If you look among independents, you see that Biden is at 46 percent, Trump at 36 percent. He's plus ten among independents. Back in 2020, according to the exit polls, Biden was plus eight in P.A. among indies, so within range. Women, he's plus eight with women. Back in 2020 in the exit polls, Biden was plus 11 in Pennsylvania among women, again, within-range. So, as you noted, pieces of the Biden coalition here seem to be coming back to him in Pennsylvania. That is a different story when you look at Michigan. Michigan, again look at these same demographics slices, Biden is minus ten to Trump among independents. Well, back in the 2020 exits, Biden won independents in Michigan by six. Women, it's roughly even here given the margin of error. I would call that a three-point split, 48- 45, roughly, even split among women between Trump and Biden. Biden, won women in Pennsylvania by 14 percentage points in 2020 in the exit. So, there is clearly pieces of the Biden coalition in Michigan that are not yet sort of returning to the norm of where they were in 2020.",

      "sentences": "It's such a good question. We do track it all the time, and it has been sort of a reliable indicator for decades in politics, especially for incumbents, right, who are running for re-election.Look at Joe Biden's approval rating in Pennsylvania first. You see he's at 40 percent approval, 60 percent disapproval. That's basically where he's been nationally as well on average. But, again, in Michigan, we see something different. He's at 35 percent approval in Michigan, 64 percent disapproval. It is a tougher electorate in Michigan for him now, and specifically in basically all the polling that we've seen after October 7th, and the Israel-Hamas issue, how it's particularly playing there. But, Kate, the question is, is Biden the factor in this race? According to these polls in these two battleground states, Trump is the factor. Trump is the factor for both Biden voters and Trump voters. Look in Pennsylvania, you see Biden voters overwhelmingly say they're voting against his opponent. 61 percent say that of Biden supporters, not for Joe Biden. It's the complete reverse for Donald Trump. We see a similar thing in Michigan. Donald Trump, whether you're a Biden supporter or a Trump supporter, is the driving force in this election, and that may be good news for Joe Biden, of course, who is trying to keep Donald Trump front and center in America's minds.",

So, depending on how many members are here today, that's about in the 280, 290 range.Now, there has certainly been a lot of grumbling on both sides. We heard it all day on Capitol Hill yesterday. Top Republicans, though, they do expect the votes. They will have the votes this morning to pass this bill in the House, but even they admit that it will be close. And you heard this deep frustration from far-right members, Chip Roy, saying he -- describing the bill as a failure of leadership. Now, when and if it passes in the House, and then it goes to the Senate, there it is going to face a tough slog. Any one member can object to passing the bill quickly, and that could slow things down and delay voting all day today. And, of course, Kate, you know, time is not on their side. They have until midnight tonight to get this done, and certainly a lot of possibilities for it to get off track. Now, all of this will kick off in just a few hours after huddling this morning. Republicans and Democrats then will go to the House to vote around 11:00, 11:30 A.M. Eastern. So, a lot up in the air this morning, Kate.",
