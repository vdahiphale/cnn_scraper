The Lakers were hosting the Warriors last night who are still without Steph Curry. In the second quarter, Dennis Schroder is going to throw the alley-oop to LeBron who's going to throw it down. LeBron, though, actually had a really bad night shooting in this game. He went five for 20 from the field -- just the sixth time in his career he shot 25 percent or worse when taking 20 shots. But he did save a camera in the fourth quarter. Look at this. He collides with the camera guy going for the loose ball and he grabs the camera from falling. The Lakers would win this game easily 124-111. They're now a game and a half out of the Play-In Tournament. All right, the 76ers, meanwhile, with a wild comeback against the Grizzlies. Philly was down 11 with under six to go. Joel Embiid coming up with the big block of Ja Morant right here. Look at that. P.J. Tucker then, with 40 seconds to go, is going to get the ball over to Tobias Harris who hits a three to give Philly the lead. Moments later it's going to be a mad scramble for a loose ball. James Harden is going to come away with it right here and he's going to get it up to Embiid who takes it down the court for the emphatic slam. The crowd's going nuts. The 76ers get the great comeback win 110-105. We had a scary moment during yesterday's Europa League match when a fan ran onto the field and punched Sevilla FC goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic. The six-foot-four goalie, though, turning the tables and pinned the fan down to the ground until security could take him into custody. Dmitrovic stayed in the game after that incident. All right, and finally, one of the victims of the Michigan State campus shooting receiving a warm message from one of his favorite athletes yesterday -- 76ers star James Harden, who we just saw in that highlight. So a bullet severed John Hao's spinal cord leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. Harden donating to John's GoFundMe, sending him some game-worn sneakers, and he chatted with the 20-year- old from his hospital bed.

Rana, this morning on this grim anniversary here we know that since the invasion countries have placed more than 11,000 sanctions on Russia. More than 1,000 companies have exited the country.Russia's economy has taken a hit but it has held up better I think than some of the predictions a year ago. What's happening? RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMY ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, just as you say, Christine, it's all about oil. You know, Russian oil is being purchased by China. Basically, everything that the West isn't buying now the Chinese are buying. As you say, oil imports are up 45 percent. Overall imports from Russia to China of everything are up about 40 percent. So the slack has simply moved to Asia. Now, that doesn't help you if you're a Russian consumer. Russian individuals are living day-by-day. The consumption in Russia is down 30 percent. Not easy to be a citizen living there right now. But the country overall can keep pumping, keep selling, and keeping fighting this war, quite frankly.",

It needs about $70 a barrel in oil price to make its budget. It's selling that for half right now. So, no, it's not sustainable. But, you know, autocrats don't think a lot about normal economics. This is a political war. It's run by petrol politics. It is interesting to me though that China -- even though it's buying a lot of Russian energy and in some ways helping to fuel the war, it's also coming in now and saying to Putin hey, we want to see an exit plan here. They're putting forward a plan for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The Chinese are starting to exert some diplomacy there.
