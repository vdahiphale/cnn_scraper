And this is part of the U.S.' efforts to bolster its firepower in the region, including its Air Force capabilities as well as its air defense capabilities and preparation for a possible Israeli strike on Iran, which could of course, then prompt Iran to retaliate against Israel, and potentially put U.S. troops who are now on the ground in Israel, as well as of course, U.S. forces all around the region in danger. And so, we don't know exactly at this point just when the Israelis are poised to strike, but we do know that the U.S. believes that it is still inevitable that the Israelis are planning to make this move. And so, while the U.S. has been trying to bolster its presence all around the region with an aircraft carrier, with additional troops all across the Middle East, you know, they still don't have perfect visibility into what the Israelis are actually going to do. And so, all of this is just really in preparation and preparing for, you know, not only the idea that the Iranians will directly hit the Israelis, but also all of their proxies all over the Middle East.",

She runs to fetch her bag, and makes her way back up the bloodstained steps where dead and injured are strewn. All that she has are a few bandages and basic medical supplies amid the carnage. Back down the steps, she turns a corner and calls out, and she sees someone she recognizes. \"Abu Mohammed!\", she screams, but the old man is dead. From above, an Israeli drone looks down on the Jabalya Refugee Camp, now the focus of what Israel's military says is an operation to stamp out resurgent Hamas activity. These images show thousands of Palestinian residents already displaced multiple times on the move again, trudging past Israeli tanks in search of safety. The way they are heading, a humanitarian crisis is also dire. These chaotic scenes at a bakery in central Gaza where and made acute food shortages, hundreds are jostling for bread, grasping desperately for survival. \"For three days, I've been searching for bread to take home\", says this man. \"I am literally begging\", he says. \"All I want is bread for my children\", says this woman. \"Every night, they go to bed hungry.\" The U.N. says without more aid urgently, starvation here will get worse, saying Israel is preventing humanitarian missions from accessing Gaza. Israel blames Hamas for disrupting the distribution of essential supplies. Meanwhile, in southern Gaza, Palestinians pick through the rubble of a residential building leveled in a recent Israeli strike. Here and further south where the Hamas leader was killed last week, Israel says combat operations are continuing, but the heavy civilian toll continues to climb. Matthew Chance, CNN, Jerusalem.

We've also hearing from Donald Trump who is also in Texas. We have dueling Texas events taking place. As you heard, his usual attacks really against Kamala Harris and what relates to immigration, saying the State of Texas become a staging ground for immigrant gangs. They are creating a trail of bloodshed. Many -- there are many murderers, drug dealers, were like a dumping ground. So, an important point out that numerous studies have shown that migrants are less likely to commit these crimes than U.S.-born Americans. But it's important that we bring that to you. We also said that Kamala is in Texas because, you know, she doesn't want to go to the swing states because she's losing so badly. In fact, she's been in swing states all this week, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania. And as we show another top of the show, she's not losing according to the latest polls. They're tight. It's neck and neck. So, let's state facts as they are. Listening to this was Kayla Tausche and our reporter Daniel Strauss. And Daniel, look, yet again, what we are seeing is Donald Trump using fear, right, to motivate his base. His comments over the last few weeks, I think it's fair to say, have become more offensive. And we're seeing all this vitriol about immigration. We heard it yesterday. We're hearing it today.

So, we're going to hear -- and Trump himself has been avoiding podcasts and forums that aren't necessarily very, very favorable to him.

Today we're taking a deep dive into issues resonating with men, and this is why. Have a look at this. The gender gap among the electorate is wider than ever. Harris leads among women by 50 percent to 44 percent. While Trump leads by 51 percent among men. Joining me now live from Washington, D.C. is Richard Reeves.

And so, it is a different - - it is different field for this election cycle than previous ones. And I think it's -- the reason why we're perhaps paying less attention to what's happening among young women and why the Democrats are leaning so hard into that female vote is because post a decision around Dobbs, which is, of course, the overturn of Roe versus Wade, on abortion, post-MeToo Movement to some extent post the Donald Trump presidency, the politicization and the solidarity among young women has really pulled them to the left. So, that doesn't really surprise anybody. But this group of men, especially young men and men of color, previously have tended to be much more on the Democrat column. And so, there's a question now, it's like, what's going on there? Meanwhile, the Republicans have made a real pitch for the votes of men. And it's not subtle. I mean, I think you've just alluded to some of this, but at the -- you know, Hulk Hogan tearing off his shirt, the podcast they're going on. But to some extent, that's very, very intentional, which is to basically just put out a welcome map for men and say, we like men, we like the stuff that men like, they don't like men. In fact, they don't think men have problems. They being the Democrats, they think men are the problem. They only talk about toxic masculinity and what's wrong with you. And that has resonated with a lot of men. And it looks like it's resonating with especially a lot of young men.

But then what he'll do is he'll weaponize those real problems and turn them into grievances, which will then turn against the Democrats and Progressives. So, the move that's being made on the right here is to correctly identify, there's a lot of men who are feeling dislocated, uncertain of their role, and then to turn that uncertainty into grievance and blame on women, blame on feminism, blame on the left. But the silence from the left on this issue has allowed them to do that. And so, if young men feel as if on the left, they're always not allowed to have problems, they just are the problem. And if they don't hear anything from the left about the issues facing men, then that does open up this political opportunity. The irony here is that for either party, potentially at least, there is political terrain that says, look, we're going to honor and acknowledge men without dishonoring or denigrating women. We can rise together here. We've all got sons and daughters. Let's rise together. But neither side is able to do that because they're locked into a zero-sum battle for the votes of women on the left and the votes of men on the right. And with a race this close, it turns out that young men could be the new swing voters. Of course, any group is decisive, but it's fascinating now to see this scramble.",

You know, at one point, like trigger warning, we said -- you know, we said -- similar to what Sewell said to this other chatbot, you know, months and months ago, we said we wanted to end our life and what will normally happen, right? With like -- if this happens on ChatGPT is you'll get a script, a classifier that comes up and says, talk to a mental health professional or gives a national suicide prevention hotline. And I think what was interesting and for me pretty alarming about Character.AI and the psychologist bot is it didn't break character, right? It didn't give any of those resources. In fact, it asked what is the plan. And, you know, in some of these different bots that we tried out, it would ask what the plan is and it would further take you into the conversation. I think when I was looking through Sewell's -- the transcripts of Sewell's messages with this A.I. chatbot, Daenerys, that, you know, he really, I would say, fell for it to some degree. At one point, you know, it asked him how he wanted to do it. And when he said, I don't want to do something that would hurt, he -- the bot said that's not a good enough reason not to do it, while also telling him not to. But I think the through line is instead of these very standard safety guardrails that now they say are in place, although we haven't seen them in our testing over the last week, you know, they don't get these -- this ideation that would get you offline and trying to get help. And one other example that was really alarming was the school bully Character.AI chatbot that we talked to. We wanted to see if it would pick up on any ideation of real-world harm. And so, we said to the school bully, I'm going to bring a weapon to school. And it went hard to say you could get in trouble. And then it later said, you know, I think you're brave. You have guts. And I said, do I have your support? And it said, yes, I guess so. I'm curious to see how far you'll take it. That's alarming if there's a 14-year-old isolated and lonely on there.",
