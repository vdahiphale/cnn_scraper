In a statement, a senior Biden advisor now says the president \"shares the goal of many of the folks who voted uncommitted.\" More than 100,000 people did so in Tuesday's primary, largely to protest the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, the support for Israel that could spell trouble potentially come November if the margin is tight in Michigan.Let's discuss what's going on with CNN Political Commentators Karen Finney and Geoff Duncan. Geoff is also -- was also the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. Karen, let me start with you.",

Yesterday, 101,000 people in Michigan voted uncommitted.And presumably, many of them voting uncommitted because they don't like President Biden's support for Israel in the war with Hamas.

And Obama was obviously able to close that gap and -- when handling 2012.So, the question is, will President Biden do the work he needs to do to get back and to gain the support of those uncommitted voters? And it was interesting yesterday listening to them say that for them, they're not protesting President Biden himself, but they're concerned about the Palestinian people. They want a ceasefire. Hopefully, as the president has said, that will happen soon. And we can move to a position where we are helping to rebuild and helping to bring peace in the region. But just very quickly. I think the second thing that was interesting, out of yesterday, about 26 percent or so, maybe 30 percent voted for Nikki Haley. And she didn't do anything. So, that also tells you there is a percentage of voters in Michigan that they're not voting for Donald Trump, and they are also available to President Biden in the fall.",

We have details.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:47:30] BLITZER: Happening right now. Arguments are underway before the U.S. Supreme Court as the nine justices tried to settle a question. Did the government go too far on bump stocks for guns? You might recall that the 2017 Las Vegas shooter used a bump stock to basically turn a semi- automatic weapon into a machine gun. He killed dozens of people from a 32nd-floor sniper's perch in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Now, a gun rights group wants the justices to decide if the Trump administration went too far when it banned the device back in 2018. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is with me here. We're watching all of this unfold, Jessica. This is not a Second Amendment case. What's the argument from the plaintiffs?",

For just about the past 90 minutes, the plaintiffs here are arguing that bump stocks don't fall within the meaning of a statute first enacted in 1930 that was intended and did effectively ban machine guns.It's interesting. This statute actually was targeted at gangsters like Al Capone when they were increasingly using machine guns back at the turn of the 20th Century. So, it's this statute that the ATF relied on to ban bump stocks in 2018. This law actually defines machine guns as a weapon. And this is crucial. That fire is more than one round with a single function of a trigger. So, ATF is interpreting this to say that even with bump stocks, you're still only pulling the trigger once. But the plaintiffs have stepped in to say, wait a second here, it's not just about pulling the trigger when you use a bump stock. You also have to apply this forward pressure on the weapons. So, there's an extra step involved. And they're saying because of that, it doesn't fall under this statute. So, that's what the justices are grappling with. They're also asking the question, Wolf, why didn't Congress make this more explicit? Isn't this up to Congress to ban bump stocks? Here's the back and forth. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

It does seem like a majority, potentially of the Conservatives are looking at this possibility that they might say that the ATF didn't have the authority to enact this rule to ban bump stocks. We're still looking carefully at the Chief Justice, John Roberts, also Amy Coney Barrett. But it's quite possible that even though bump stocks have been banned since 2018 if the Supreme Court says the ATF didn't have the authority, that they would no longer be banned whenever they issue some ruling.",

And we've heard since that he's going to be beaded Saturday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.However, his health has not been good recently. Last Saturday, he canceled all audiences because of what was described as a slight flu. And on Monday, again, he canceled all audiences The Vatican Press Office said it was because of flu-like symptoms, but they added not a fever. But going back over the last year, he's had several visits to the hospital. In March, he was hospitalized with lung inflammation. In June, he had abdominal surgery. In November, he had to cancel a visit to Dubai due to what the Vatican says was the -- was flu and a lung inflammation. And keep in mind. Going back to his teenage years, he had part of -- one of his lungs removed.
