And that's where U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is right now, hoping to jumpstart hostage release and ceasefire talks involving Israel and Hamas. He met just a few minutes ago with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister. He'll also meet with other Arab officials later today.They're expected to discuss aid to Gaza, how to achieve it, and, quote, a lasting peace and a potential pathway to a Palestinian state as well. This comes after U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Sunday. The source described that call as constructive and said they addressed a number of issues regarding the war. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more now on the discussion between the two leaders and other U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Biden on Sunday spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a call that was primarily focused on a hostage deal, that, according to a source familiar. Now, this call lasted just under an hour and was described by the source as, quote, constructive. Of course, U.S. officials have been working around the clock to try to reach an agreement that would allow for a temporary ceasefire of about six weeks and also the release of hostages held by Hamas and for more humanitarian aid to get surged into Gaza. Senior U.S. officials have been traveling to the region over the last several months to try to advance these talks. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to the Middle East on Sunday, where he, too, will be involved in these conversations as well as conversations about getting more aid into Gaza. Now, the president and the Israeli prime minister also touched on other issues, including, for example, Iran's airstrikes against Israel and Israel's airstrikes against Iran. The first time they've discussed that since that occurred earlier this month. And about Rafah, that's an area where Israel has said that they would potentially launch an operation. It's also where there are over a million Palestinians displaced. And according to a White House readout, it said, quote, the leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position, that position from the U.S. being that an operation at this point would be untenable. Of course, those conversations are ongoing. Now, what happens after this call and the results of it are still unclear, but what we will be monitoring in the weeks to come. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This would be a departure from what U.S. officials have been saying for some time. But either way, he certainly has his work cut out for him. You mentioned those new pictures that we saw him meeting with the Saudi foreign minister. He's also going to be meeting directly with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. And he will take all of this information that he's gleaned from these Arab leaders and take it to Israel, where he will present it to them. And surely a lot of what he's going to be telling the Israelis is the need to not go into Rafah and to dramatically increase the amount of aid going in there -- Max.",

Twenty people were killed in airstrikes just overnight.President Biden, you heard Priscilla Alvarez talking about the call between Biden and Netanyahu, where the U.S. has made clear its position that there should be a clear, credible plan to get civilians out of the way. And there's been plenty of doubts cast by U.S. officials as to whether that's even true at all. And of course, the U.S. has been hammering on aid as well. Weeks ago, you'll remember that President Biden had a first conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the wake of the killing of the World Central Kitchen staff in Gaza. And there was a time where Israel really came out and made clear that it was going to ramp up aid into Gaza, and it did. But now, if you ask the U.N., those numbers have dropped well below the target of 500 trucks per day. Perhaps then it's not a coincidence that, given these calls happening, given Secretary Blinken's trip, given the fact that we know that he's going to be checking in with the Israelis on how things are going, that the Israelis have again announced new efforts to further step up aid, including getting more through a crossing into northern Gaza, more by sea and that floating pier that it's helping the U.S. to build, and also more coming in through Jordan and through Israel en route to Gaza as well -- Max.",

They have killed in the last six and a half months 33,000 Palestinians, wounded 77,000, two-thirds of whom are women and children. They have destroyed over 60 percent of the housing. They have destroyed the health care system. They have destroyed the infrastructure, no electricity, very little water.

They have been clearing debris in this area, trying to reach survivors, trying to pull out some bodies, sending them to hospitals.

There had been recent calls for the government to do so, but it did it at the absolute 11th hour of that. There's been devastation all across the country. Kenya's longest and largest river, Tana River, also burst its banks, rendering some roads impassable, and some people have drowned in different parts of the country.
