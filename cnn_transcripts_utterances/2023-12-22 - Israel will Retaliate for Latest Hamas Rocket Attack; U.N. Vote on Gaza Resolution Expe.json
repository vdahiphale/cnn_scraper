Meantime, Gaza -- in Gaza, doctors describe unbearable conditions as nearly constant Israeli bombardments continue. Here's CNN's Will Ripley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another day in Israel, another round of rocket fire, Hamas targeting Tel Aviv with a barrage of rockets from Gaza, Israeli media reporting some 30 rocket interceptions by the Iron Dome. No injuries or major damage. The Israeli military warning Gaza residents it will retaliate with more airstrikes, aimed at areas already reeling for more than two months of brutal bombardment. U.S. intelligence agencies warn Hamas's credibility and influence has grown dramatically in the more than two months since the October 7th terror attacks, as global outrage grows over Israel's military response.

So one of the reasons why the Security Council is taking so long to vote on the cease-fire resolution is a disagreement over the inspection process for humanitarian aid entering Gaza.A spokesman for the U.S. delegation to the U.N. told CNN, \"There are still serious and widespread concerns that this resolution as drafted could actually slow down delivery of humanitarian aid by directing the U.N. to create an unworkable monitoring mechanism. We must ensure any resolution helps and doesn't hurt the situation on the ground.\" OK. So that was the reason on Thursday for the delay, and yes, inspections may be a legitimate concern. But they seem to be almost tangential in the bigger picture. So on the day before that, you know, the reason for a delay were U.S. concerns about the wording of the resolution that called for a cessation of hostilities. There's a delay, after delay, after delay. And all time time, 266 are being killed on average every day in Gaza, and half of the Gaza population is actually starving, according to the WHO. So maybe at this point, there's a need for urgency here which is lacking at the U.N. Security Council?",

Their view is clear, and that is the only thing that's going to work overtime is working with and, at certain moments, pressing the Israelis hard. There would have been no humanitarian assistance into Gaza, not a scintilla, because Benjamin Netanyahu and the current in Israel would denied any aid to Gaza. Only as a consequence of the Biden administration's efforts do you have any aid coming. And that's the same with hostages. There would have been no hostage releases without the intervention of the president. So here we have a situation in which the Israelis clearly play a critical role in determining what goes in. And I think the administration understands that and is trying to figure out a way to meet their sensibilities, as well as facilitate and expedite aid.

Because gun ownership in the U.S. is a constitutional right, while in Europe and the Czech Republic, owning a gun is allowed and controlled by government legislation. The Czech Republic has relatively liberal gun laws compared to therest of the European Union. To obtain a gun legally, a person needs a firearm license, which requires a medical examination, a weapons proficiency exam, and no previous criminal record. It's incredible to think those are liberal gun laws. There is also, though, a crucial amendment made to the Czech Republic's charter of fundamental rights, back in 2021, which legally guarantees the right to defend one's own life or the life of another person with a weapon. So get that right to bear arms sort of thing. And it turns out the shooter in Prague, legally owned multiple fire alarms. And over the years, the Czech Republic, I guess, has seen more gun violence than the rest of Europe.

They're saying yes, you can have a gun. We're going to put these restrictions on them. And these are real restrictions. I mean, the medical examination, the training, no criminal record whatsoever. These are in significant restrictions. But I think the -- what the Czech Republic is going to have to look to is are those restrictions enough? The quantity of guns in terms of ownership. You know, do you want people owning, you know, eight, nine, or ten guns depending on how many this -- this gunman had. And then, you know, thinking about how permissive does the society that does not experience a lot of mass murderers, but compared to its neighbors, is -- is more violent or has a potential to be more violent.

In a call with CNN on Wednesday, Whelan said he's afraid for his safety after being assaulted by another inmate in a Russian prison camp last month. The U.S. Marine Corps veteran is serving a 16-year sentence after he was accused of being a spy, which he vehemently denies. More now from CNN's Brian Todd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): American Paul Whelan, wrongfully detained in Russia for five years, now faces new dangers in Russian prison camp. Whelan tells CNN he's being targeted by an official at the remote camp in the Mordovia region where he's being held. Whelan says the official is retaliating against him, because the official was admonished following an assault on Whelan by another inmate on November 28th. We spoke with Whelan's sister about his latest account.",

He says prisoners, on the official's behalf, asked him for 1,100 dollars in protection money, the exact amount that's in Whelan's prison account. Quote, \"Prisoners would not have known that unless they had been told.\" Then he said of the prison official, quote, \"Having no luck with obtaining the money, he ordered me to move to a different barrack, which would expose me to criminal behavior, as well as the potential of assault.\" The White House calls Whelan's latest accounts troubling and says it will address this with Russian officials.",

One is that, from a purely operational perspective, October the 7th, this truly awful attack, was wildly successful. And since then, Hamas has been able to use the hostages that it took that day to successfully -- LILLIS (voice-over): -- negotiate the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas has essentially been able to cast itself as a defender of the Palestinian cause. This kind of lone armed force fighting back against Israel, seen by some communities as a brutal oppressor. We can see a couple of the indicators that intelligence officials are tracking in the public space. There are protests in Jordan, where Hamas's name has been chanted. There's been some polling data that shows Hamas's popularity in the West Bank rose after October 7th. And there have been public warnings from both U.S. and European officials of a heightened risk of potential lone wolf attacks by extremists inspired by Hamas. Some officials that we spoke to are deeply concerned that Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza, which has led to a stream of images of civilian suffering that have gone viral. That that -- that those images are only going to exacerbate this dynamic, and further legitimate Hamas, and potentially radicalize others, both inside and outside of Gaza. Even though, of course, we know that Hamas is hiding itself amongst civilians, and carried out unspeakable atrocities on October 7th. Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary, summed up some of those concerns earlier this month. He said, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.",
