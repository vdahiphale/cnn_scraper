I mean, he is a young man.So, no, I don't think this is the way to. I mean, but this was the most decaffeinated we've seen Vivek. I mean, he has been a very hyper candidate through all the debates and other. But the most animated he got tonight was on January the 6th, and pushing this idea that was an inside job. I mean, it wasn't inside job. I mean, the head of the federal government at the time was sort of encouraging it, I mean, if you want to go down that road, but not. But that was the most animated. Everything else, he was very decaffeinated. He was very subdued. And, you know, look, I'm reminded by watching him tonight, there's a marketplace for conspiracy theorists in our politics. He knows it. And that's why he's doing it. That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I think, has a following out there, because he's been a conspiracy theorist. So, why is he doing it? Because there's a market for it, not enough, but there's a market for it.",

It's all platitudes and cliches and spreading of conspiracy theories and hawking books and hawking podcasts and saying very little, really not answering anything. COLLINS: And what did you make of his demeanor? Because as Scott noted, he came out not as rambunctious as he did even the last debate. I mean, at that debate, he told Chris Christie to go eat a meal in a disagreement. He called Nikki Haley a fascist. He compared her to a Dylan Mulvaney ad.

I have always admired her reporting because she is a badass and she is fearless, especially her desire to be on the ground where the biggest and often most dangerous news is breaking. There she is. And tonight is no different. Thanks to Clarissa, CNN is the first western media outlet to get access into southern Gaza and report in Gaza, rather, and report independently. She has footage you won't see anywhere else. And this is the first time she's talking about it since returning. Clarissa Ward is CNN's chief international correspondent.

But the doctor who was showing me around didn't even flinch. He turned to me and he said, this is our everyday, this happens about 20 times a day.And then minutes later, he gets a phone call saying, the first casualties are coming in. Because this field hospital that the United Arab Emirates has set up near the southern border is literally, Gayle, the only hospital with empty beds in Gaza. And so what's happening is that these casualties will be rushed to one hospital. They will tie some kind of a makeshift tourniquet. They don't even have tourniquets left, most of these hospitals. And then they get brought to this field hospital, which is state of the art, which has MRIs, which has supplies coming in on a regular basis, although it is still a challenge every single day. And so this has become part of the fabric of daily life for ordinary Gazans. It's not something you can ever truly get used to, particularly when you see the scale of the suffering, when you see the fact that it's women and children who are largely bearing the brunt of it. But there's a sense in Gaza right now that nobody has time to even take a breath. You just have to keep going, keep moving, keep trying to save lives to the best of your ability. And I do think it's important to underscore as well, Gayle, that for the people of Gaza, we get to leave at the end of our visit. They do not. They have no way of going out and they have no safe place to go to. And they are facing a level of bombardment that does not have a precedent in modern warfare. It is truly a catastrophe, Gayle.",

It is totally overwhelmed. It was never built to deal with this capacity. When you approach that border, you just see miles and miles of trucks lining up, hundreds of them, that are laden with this aid that is so desperately needed. And even when they manage to cut through the bureaucracy and go through the various inspections and get into Gaza, the problem, according to aid workers, is they can't actually distribute the aid to where it needs to go because the bombardment is so ferocious, because it is so dangerous to make road moves around Gaza at the moment. And so, essentially, these aid workers are completely hamstrung and the ordinary people are very much cut off from the basic necessities, whether it's food, whether it's medicine. I talked to the doctors again. They said, we're getting injuries in here and illnesses that should be relatively easy to treat. But by the time they reach us, we're looking at severe cases of sepsis, of infection, simply because the hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza are completely overwhelmed. The bottom has fallen out in the healthcare system. And so you're seeing things that should be easy to deal with turn into life threatening diseases, illnesses and infections.",

We did feel relatively safe. We were only on the ground for a matter of hours. But as a war correspondent who's been doing this for almost 20 years now, and particularly as a mother, you never get used to seeing children who have been maimed, who have been disfigured, who have lost their entire families. We spoke to the aunt of an 18-month-old called Amir, who doesn't know yet that both of his parents and his siblings were killed in a strike that has left him literally broken. That is not something that ever gets easier to process. And I can honestly say I don't think we've ever seen it quite on this scale as what we are seeing take place on the ground in Gaza right now.",
