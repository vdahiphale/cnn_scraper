The Biden administration has warned the group multiple times that there would be consequences for the repeated drone and missile attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. For weeks, Biden has been hesitant about ordering direct strikes due to the prospect of escalating the crisis in the Middle East, but Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said last night that action had to be taken. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY:  There had been multiple warnings to include, early in January, a statement by many nations saying that there would be consequences. Clearly, none of us want to see an escalation of conflict. No one wants to see the tensions rise in the region but it's unacceptable to see the kind of behavior that we've been seeing. And so, again, tonight was intended to disrupt and to degrade their ability to launch those attacks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So I think -- we tend to think of it -- oh, it's the Houthis and some random rebel group, and why are we expanding our efforts.But look, 12 percent of world trade goes through this area. Thirty percent of global maritime trade goes from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the Suez Canal. So this was having a direct impact on all of us -- on the global economy as we started to see. And the option for the, sort of, carriers -- the ones that were the shipping industry was to go south to the Cape of Good Horn, which is incredibly dangerous and adds weeks. So the impact on what we would just call the free navigation of oceans was having a tremendous -- was being harmed by what the Houthis were doing. So then you had this escalation over the last three weeks. I wrote about this for The Atlantic December 24 that this thing was getting out of control because you had this escalation the Houthis weren't answering. So the attack last night was in response to the largest attack by the Houthis the day before, basically making it clear that they were not listening to the message that the multinational consortium was telling them. And it was essentially to downgrade their capabilities -- radar and missile capabilities so that they could not target the ships. One hopes that this doesn't escalate it. But there's a -- I have to say, like, there's a pretty large global consensus, whether the countries will say so or not, not to mess with -- not to mess with the Suez because it's just all of our economies are depending on it.",

I think that the administration certainly will probably wait to see how their capabilities are downgraded.The Houthis don't really have global reach. It's the Iranians that have the global reach -- who support the Houthis. The Iranians, so far, not going to applaud them -- but, so far, have also not wanted the conflict in Gaza and Israel to extend to include great nation- states. In other words, they -- we're hearing stuff about Hezbollah. Certainly, their support for Hamas. But they have not taken overt steps to make an Iranian-U.S. conflict more likely than not because they have their reasons, too. They certainly know that a global regional conflict is not something that they want to -- that they necessarily wanted to rely on what the Houthis are doing.

This has been a slow roll conflict since the Gaza and -- since the Israeli attack in Gaza. And the reason why is because the Houthis have been saying oh, we're only doing this to support the Palestinians. That's -- you know, that's not true. They are attacking boats and ships that have nothing to do with the conflict. These are not Israeli ships. These are ships from all sorts of backgrounds. And so, this conflict and the plans for the escalation that we saw last night had been already thoroughly vetted, already planned for. And now, he's able to -- because he's not under general anesthesia -- sort of lead this. I'm of the school -- I've seen this enough -- that yes, he made a mistake.

He attacked the judge and the attorney general, and the judge ultimately was forced to cut off his courtroom rant and tell his lawyer, quote, \"Control your client.\"Let's bring in CNN political reporter Alayna Treene. Alayna, good morning. It's always great to have you. This is not the first time that Judge Engoron has had to tell Trump's lawyers hey, control him. Obviously, this was the kind of final day here. What do you make of how he handled this because he wasn't initially supposed to talk in court at all? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco):  No, that's right, he wasn't. And the judge seemed to change his mind and allow him to speak while in court yesterday. But look, Donald Trump did what yesterday -- excuse me, did what we've seen him do many times. He didn't want to talk about the facts of the case. He actually said -- when the judge said please keep this to the facts of the case, he said well, I dispute those facts. I think that what we're talking about here goes outside the facts. And he did use that monologue inside the courtroom to make somewhat of a political speech. And that's what he did last time when we saw him speak in the court -- the courtroom last year. He kind of used the opportunity to go after the judge, to go after the attorney general. To claim that the entire case is a witch hunt against him. The same type of rhetoric you're hearing him use outside the courtroom as well as on the campaign trail. And I think the thing to keep in mind with Donald Trump is really, how he views these court appearances that he's doing. He is choosing to take himself off the trail. He did not have to be in court yesterday. He was in court earlier in the week in D.C. He didn't have to be in that court either. He is choosing to show up and attend these hearings and trials and he's using them as a political campaign stop. His team really does see his political strategy and his legal strategy as largely being one and the same. And Donald Trump has really been eager to try and use the courthouse -- use his legal issues to continue to convince voters of his argument that he thinks that he's a victim of political persecution.",
