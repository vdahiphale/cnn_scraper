And you see here live pictures of the House floor where you see some lawmakers going to the floor, saying their final say before they move to a vote, and this vote should unfold and we should have a final count in the House in the next half hour or so. The key here is that Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, he needs two thirds of the majority of present people today, present lawmakers to vote with this bill. That is a very tight margin, and he is only going to get over the finish line with support from Democrats.Now, House Republican leadership, they have expressed confidence last night and this morning going into the vote. They expect this to pass, but it is going to be very close. So, they are going to watch each and every vote counted on the floor this morning. Now, there has been some grumbling among House Republicans, saying that this bill was rushed too quickly. They had to waive that 72-hour rule. A lot of people saying that they didn't have time to read all of the pages of this over 1000 page spending bill, this massive spending bill. But again, time is very short. As you see there on the screen, starting to take the vote, move towards the vote here this morning, Rahel. So, we'll see the outcome in the next half hour or so.",

They can basically slow down the process considerably, and that matters because they are trying to move towards getting all of this passed before midnight tonight to at least avoid a partial shutdown over the weekend. So, we will see once the House passes that, what the landscape is over here in the Senate?There is, though, an eagerness, as you know, for senators to get out of town.

Right now, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is about to head home. He wrapped up his Middle East trip by meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A short time ago, demonstrators gathered outside the Secretary's hotel, calling for his help and facilitating the release of hostages.(VIDEO PLAYING) Blinken and Netanyahu met against the backdrop of strained relations between the U.S. and Israel. And in just the last few minutes, the Israeli Prime Minister posted to social media, doubling down on his position that there is no way to defeat Hamas without a major military operation in Rafah. That, of course, is a point of major contention within the U.S. Let's bring in CNN's Jennifer Hansler, who joins us from the U.S. State Department.

Yesterday, he was in Egypt, meeting with a coalition of Arab foreign ministers to talk about the path forward in Gaza once the conflict comes to an end. But, the end of that conflict feels a very far distance away, especially coming out of these meetings in Israel. We expected that these meetings would be tense, would be tough. The U.S. has said all along that it really takes this in-person diplomatic pressure to get the Israeli government to move on any of the requests that they are making, be it humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza, be it protecting civilians.But, as we see from the Netanyahu comments coming out of this meeting, it seems that these requests have once again not been heeded, at least in this public comment from the Prime Minister who is doubling down on the idea that Israel will go into Rafah where a million and a half people are seeking refuge with or without U.S. support. We are waiting to hear from the Secretary himself on how these meetings went. But, at this point, it does not seem that Israel is shifting its positions at all, despite this ongoing U.S. pressure, despite the fact that we are seeing tensions coming to the fore between the Biden administration and the Israeli government. We heard the Vice President today double down on the idea that there is no way for the Israeli government to carry out an offensive in Rafah. There is no way for safe -- civilians to be safely moved out of that zone. So, we'll wait and see if there are actually any concrete solutions, any concrete steps that came out of these tense meetings today.",

They said that the passage of this resolution would have been a clear sign that the Security Council does back these efforts to bring the hostages home and to gain what they are calling a sustained and immediate ceasefire.So, to see Russia and China veto this resolution, it does put a damper on these efforts. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, though, she said earlier that, for their part, the United States will keep at it, will continue to work toward a deal alongside Qatar and Egypt, who are the main interlocutors in these negotiations, and they will work with any Security Council member that is seriously interested in adopting a resolution that will help make that deal possible.

So, as you see here, you see the votes, yeas and nays ticking up. So, we will of course let you know when that gets formally passed through.But, one other thing to keep in mind this morning, there seems to be a little bit of theatrics going in. We heard from Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene. She essentially said \"stay tuned\" when she was asked about some murmurs of potentially an effort to deploy a motion to vacate to vote on that, that for Speaker Johnson, and that is a direct shot potentially at Speaker Johnson, and many conservatives there really furious with how this bill came to be. They feel like he negotiated too much with Democrats that this bill was released in the dead of night and it certainly was released at 3 a.m. early yesterday morning, many conservatives saying they didn't have enough time to read this bill, which is 1,012 pages long. But, those just a sideshow right now the thing that matters is the votes there that are being counted on the floor of the House, and they're continuing to vote as we speak. So, we will certainly bring that to you once that gets passed through. But, House leadership, Republicans expressed confidence going in this morning that this would get through. But, it is going to come down to a few votes, and Republicans certainly need Democrats to vote with them this morning. And then, of course, when and if it gets passed over here in the House, it then goes to the Senate, as we've been talking about this morning where that is a big question mark, a big TBD, how quickly they can get that through before the midnight deadline tonight.

He starts this race as an underdog. He has been losing in the average of national polls for months and months, and his campaign really needs to find a way to turn that around if he hopes to beat President Trump in November. But, what we've seen is that, historically, Pennsylvania has been a somewhat more Democratic-leaning state than Michigan. And we know that Biden has some specific weaknesses in Michigan, where there is a large Arab American vote that has been displeased with the way he has handled the U.S.'s involvement in the Israel-Gaza conflict.And so, his team knows that he has got a lot of work to do to win back these voters. But, I don't think they have a clear plan for how they plan to do that, except to continue to beat up on Donald Trump.

So, in Pennsylvania, Biden leads among women, voters of color, college graduates, independents, and it's about even with voters under 35. In Michigan, Biden lags Trump's significantly with independents and young voters, and he is split evenly with women, and his lead with people of color narrows in Michigan. Nathan, what are your thoughts about these takeaways? NATHAN GONZALES, EDITOR &amp; PUBLISHER, INSIDE ELECTIONS: Well, the big warning sign for Biden and Democrats in that, in what you just laid out, was among women. Being tied among women in Michigan is the -- is not going to work for Biden. He won -- according to the exit polls in 2020, he won women in Michigan by 13 points. If he is dead even with women now, it's -- the ballgame is over. And Michigan and Pennsylvania are must wins, I would say must wins for Biden. Trump, there is a path without Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Biden has to get there. And I think that's why you're going to hear Democrats talk about access to abortion, within that, IVF and other issues, to try to increase and make sure they have a healthy margin among women because that's where Democrats have opportunity.",

One thing we saw in this poll was that among Biden backers, some of that was just trying to get -- trying to keep Trump out of the White House rather than necessarily being fully up for Biden. And so, that might explain why Biden is out with this new digital ad, asking the famous political question, are you better off? And I think we have part of it. Are you better off than you were four years ago, trying to draw the contrast about COVID, about some of his policies. What are your thoughts about that strategy?

I mean, what we do know is that voters are looking back on the Trump presidency quite favorably. In some polls that I've seen, approval for Trump and his presidency is 10 or 15 points higher than any kind of approval rating that he enjoyed when he was actually in office. So, people are certainly looking back on the Trump presidency with sort of rose-colored glasses. You see the Biden campaign trying to reset that perception.But, one of the issues that I think they may have is that we saw, even when he was in office, voters broadly did not blame Trump for the pandemic. They did not think it was his fault. They didn't necessarily like his handling of it. But, it's so far in the rear view now, and there were so many, I think, also criticisms of the way that Biden handled the emergence from the pandemic, that I wonder if that will continue to be a winning issue or if anybody really wants to revisit and re-litigate it. I think they have a similar problem when it comes to economics and jobs. A lot of the job gains of the Biden years, people see as a sort of mechanical bounce back from that COVID depression, not as a result of anything he did. So, of course, he is going to make this argument, things were terrible in 2020. They look a lot better now.

I mean, one thing you continue to hear from voters, even though it has been quite some time since Donald Trump was a private citizen on TV, acting as a businessman, voters still do think of him that way. Voters still think of him as someone who has been economically successful. So, clearly, the Biden campaign trying to dent that image, pointing to the cash crush, the crunch that Trump faces, both personally and with the civil judgments against him, which he faces a Monday deadline to come up with quite a lot of cash for that, and also in his campaign where his fundraising has suffered. And traditionally, it has been an important advantage for campaigns to have a fundraising advantage.But, we also saw going back as far as 2016 that Trump's ability to command voters' attention is so formidable that he doesn't necessarily need to reach parity on things like hiring campaign staff and running TV ads. So, clearly, the Biden campaign is trying to get under his skin and trying to register this contrast with the electorate. Whenever I talk to Democrats, and I'm not saying that I necessarily believe this is true, but there is a persistent feeling that voters have not tuned into this race, and that their primary need is to just to get people to pay attention and understand the reality of a potential Trump comeback. So, they're trying to put that on people's radar, trying to get people to accept the real contours of this race in a world where most Americans wish that this were not the presidential contest we were having.",

So, there is still a lot of work to be done, hard work to be done, but we're determined to try to get it done. We also talked about the imperative of surging and sustaining humanitarian assistance for the people in Gaza. 100 percent of the population of Gaza is acutely food insecure. 100 percent is in need of humanitarian assistance. There have been some positive steps taken in recent days to improve the situation, but it's not enough. And we talked about what needs to happen to get much more assistance to many more people more effectively. We also talked about Rafah. We share Israel's goal of defeating Hamas, which is responsible for the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And we share the goal of ensuring Israel's long-term security. As we've said, though, a major military ground operation in Rafah is not the way to do it. It risks killing more civilians. It risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance. It risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security and standing. So, we're looking forward to having Israeli officials in Washington next week to talk about a different way of achieving these objectives, objectives that we share, of defeating Hamas, and ensuring Israel's long-term security. It really requires an integrated, humanitarian, military and political plan. As I said, we'll be talking about that next week, going through the details of what we see is the best way forward. We also had an opportunity to talk about the longer-term trajectory. What needs to happen once the conflict in Gaza is over? The conversations that I had with our Arab partners over the last couple of days, and that we had here in Israel as well. We're determined that Israel succeed and making sure it can defend itself, that October 7 never happens again, that it emerged from this, strong, secure, integrated in the region with a future of security and peace, not only for Israelis, but for Palestinians, and for our other friends in the region.

The resolution, of course, also condemned Hamas. It's unimaginable why countries wouldn't be able to do that.But, I think the fact that we got such a strong vote, despite the veto by two of the permanent members of the Security Council, again, is evidence and demonstration of the commitment, the conviction of countries around the world and notably on the Security Council to see about getting the ceasefire and getting the release of hostages now. That's what the resolution said. That's what it called for. And I think it showed that a strong commitment to that from many, many countries.

Let's go back to Capitol Hill now where we have been tracking that vote in the House of Representatives on the spending bill. Let's bring back in Sunlen Serfaty, who has been with us all hour following this vote. All right. Sunlen, where do we stand?",

That has been really in the shadows of the conversation up here on Capitol Hill today. What this means for Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, a lot of Republicans, conservative Republicans were not happy with the way this was negotiated, not happy that the bill was released overnight, Thursday night, 3 a.m. yesterday, that they just frankly haven't had time to go through this bill. And they said that's important. Of course, they want to read every line, and they feel like he negotiated a little too much with Democrats here.So, there is murmurs of the resolution, a motion to vacate, which in essence is what happened to Speaker McCarthy, and Marjorie Taylor Greene making some moves this morning to do that.

And it seems like there was not much appetite to give him that time, the fact that Marjorie Taylor Greene file this resolution. One thing to watch very closely and getting a little procedurally here is, if that's a privileged resolution or if it's not a privilege resolution. If it's privileged, that will require the leader to hold a vote on that motion to vacate within two legislative days. If it's not privileged, then they have a little more wiggle room. So, that procedure is important because that's going to define exactlyhow much this mucks up the works, in essence, up here on Capitol Hill, or if it's just a firing shot.",

You look at brands like Hoka and On Cloud running, those brands are really squeezing Nike right now. So, Nike sales last quarter grew just two percent. Hokas grew 22 percent. And even Joe Biden is wearing Hokas. They have a lot of stability. People think they're kind of ugly, these Hokas, but people really like them. They're good running shoes. And so, that's hurting Nike.And so, what Nike is going to do is that it's going to pull back on some of its classic shoes like Air Force 1s to try to create demand for new products. So, Nike really needs to come up with some new innovation, some hot new shoes, to try to get people interested in the brand again.
