We have seen images of the destruction at those particular naval areas. And so the impact has been significant. We have heard from Israel's prime minister as well, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that they're intending to change the face of the Middle East, pointing out that the collapse of Syria, as far as he is concerned, is due to Israel's activities, weakening Iran, weakening Hezbollah, and this is the repercussion of that. It has been criticized, though, significantly. You mentioned there, Rosemary, the Arab League criticizing these moves. You have a number of the Middle East nations here, some of them accusing Israel of carrying out a land grab and taking advantage of the instability in Syria and taking advantage of developments.

And I think that's what we're watching in slow motion here. John Tower was rejected as first president of Bush, as secretary of defense of nominee, despite being in the Senate for 24 years because of a pattern of impersonal, you know, intemperance with alcohol and women. And it does go to question about whether someone can be compromised. It's also whether their experience leads them to be able to manage the world's largest bureaucracy in a dangerous time.
