Florida governor Ron DeSantis will announce that he is running for the Republican nomination for president in the 2024 race.What is unique about his announcement we're told by his political team is that he will be sitting down to do so with the owner of Twitter, Elon Musk. He'll be doing that on Wednesday night. That is certainly not typical and not typically how someone would announce their candidacy. But it goes with what we have been told about what this likely campaign would look like. Which is that it won't be typical. It won't be traditional. They want to really push the envelope and do things in a unique and different way. And it certainly fits the bill and that situation. We also know that DeSantis will be gathering his biggest donors and bundlers here in Miami on Thursday to really amp up that fundraising game and make sure that they turn in big numbers right out of the gate. He's really going to set all of them loose to raise as much money as they possibly can to really give him big numbers right out of the gate. And also, on Tuesday night, we saw this video from the Florida first lady Casey who was re-tweeted by her husband. It's essentially a hype video. And then at the end it has a code for people to text to the word launch. So again, all of these pieces coming together for something that we know has been in the works for months now. That has been talked about so much. But now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially getting in the 2024 race and we'll start to see how that shapes up with both his Republican rivals -- chiefly among them, former President Donald Trump and the sitting president, Joe Biden.

You can't really see it. But the center of the low itself just north of Guam. So, some of the strongest winds will move right and right over the southern island of Rota, and the heaviest wind will sit right over Guam in this case. I think that's what's happening.The center of the low, winds gusting over 160 miles per hour. It's starting to pick up speed a bit, moving northwest now at eight miles per hour, regardless, it still crawling. So, that's also a big factor in how much rain we're about to get and the damaging wind threat that's about to happen with the storm surge that'll likely pull in. So, that northerly track, starting to take hold. Don't pay attention to the line. I want you to pay attention to the cone. There's still room for wobble. So that determines where landfall will likely be but once it moves past the islands, it'll restrengthen and become likely another super typhoon. So, there's that wind, shifting now to more of the westerly side of the island. With that being the case, we'll likely have higher storm surge than what we originally thought would happen. So, the numbers now increased from 1 to 4 feet on the westerly side. Still dealing with over 20 feet of storm surge a possibility, worst-case scenario on the eastern side. Most likely 6 to 10, now that we've seen that shift more of the onshore flow to the westerly side. We've already lost our data. Some of the centers, like Anderson Air Force Base, gone. I can't even give you wind reading. But gusts over 98 miles per hour, coming in to where the radar once was. We've also lost radar data as well. But heavy rain is still expected to come here within the upcoming hours. It'll stay right over the southern part of the island. That's where we can pick up over 20 inches of rain. Isolated higher amounts are possible. Especially within the eyewall. We can have seven inches per hour within the eyewall as it starts to come on to shore. And that's within the next five days time. So again, some of the heaviest of the rain starts to move in here within the upcoming hour. We do not have a landfall at the moment.

But it has been searched by divers back in 2008, almost a year -- a little less than a year since Madeleine McCann went missing. This was actually funded by a private lawyer in Portugal who said that he got a tip from underworld sources, quote, unquote, that a body had been dumped there. What they ended up finding was animal bones, some cord, a sock, some plastic bags. They searched for at least seven days.But this was not an exhaustive search. This is a massive reservoir. So, they concentrate there certain areas where -- is likely they were maybe to find something. But they also said there is virtually no visibility. And so, they had to just kind of rely on whatever they could feel under the water. This time around there are boats. There are divers on standby.
