Just ahead on today's show, crucial callimportant new development in the Ukraine war Chinese President Xi and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy holding talks on the conflict for the very first time. Zelenskyy describing the phone conversation as long and as meaningful as well we'll have a live report on this just ahead for you. Plus, the Sudan crisis; a tense 72 hour ceasefire in the war torn country winding down more last minute evacuations and fears of a biological lab accident. We are live in Sudan with the very latest as well. And financial fears U.S. regional bank of First Republic mulling emergency steps to stave off collapse. It's shares tumbling almost 50 percent Tuesday and is down again pre market today. How exposed is the global banking industry to new shocks? We'll be discussing that as well. First Republic strap drama helping pressure U.S. stocks in the previous session with all the major averages down more than 1 percent but a firmer picture for U.S. futures today. Solid results from a tech giants Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet helping the market mood however Europe is firmly in the red. Here in the U.S. shares of gaming giant Activision Blizzard, tumbling almost 10 percent pre-market after the UK ruled against its multibillion dollar merger deal with Microsoft. We'll have more on that in just a moment. We begin though with the latest on Ukraine. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy says he's had in his words, as I mentioned, a long and meaningful phone call with China's President Xi Jinping saying that he hopes it will give impetus to the development of Ukraine's relations with Beijing. CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is in Kyiv. So Nic, do we have any more details on what specifically the two men discussed?",

      "sentences": "We have a little bit of detail. They both seem to be putting this in a very positive light. Bothleaders say they're exchanging diplomats, the Ukrainian sending an ambassador to Russia, the Chinese sending an envoy here to Ukraine. This envoy, it will be interesting to be noted, perhaps on the Ukrainian side that this particular envoy spent 10 years as China's Ambassador in Moscow but the language that's being used here very, very diplomatic. President Xi saying that he neither wants to watch the fire from the other side nor pour fuel on it nor profit from it so I think the sense here is that this is an opening of a diplomatic opportunity between the two countries remembering that just a month or so ago, President Xi was in Russia meeting with President Putin. Both these leaders have met many times in the past. They've already had five phone calls this year. So this phone call between President Xi and President Zelenskyy the first since Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine is significant, but their positions are still very far apart. President Xi when he was in Moscow said essentially, you know, we'd like to help negotiate a solution. And here's our proposal. Well, Ukraine's Western backer said nowhere in China's proposal, did it mention a tool, Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. And Ukraine's current position on its peace plan is that you Russia should withdraw and get out of all Ukrainian territory to the pre-1991 borders. So on the surface, it would seem that both sides, although there's an air of improved diplomacy here, and not really any closer on the big gaps in their differences on the way they view the situation. And a word from Moscow on this, they say they've taken note of China's involvement here to further its efforts in negotiations. But they also see they don't see any likelihood of that bearing fruit in the near future. And I think that's the sort of political diplomatic reality. But when President Xi visited Moscow, President Zelenskyy goes follow up to that was essentially, if President Xi has a peace plan, then it would be great if he spoke here with us in Ukraine. So this is a step along that path.",

You know, Ukraine is going to be a massive need for rejuvenating and regenerating its industry as an economy here once the war is over. That's over the horizon at the moment, but that would be the long term view of the Ukraine. So I think of Ukraine. So I think that will be part of the picture here. What can be achieved in the short term? Well, it will at least allow at a diplomatic level, a closer and more intense exchange of what is really happening in the war, because in Ukraine, the feeling is very clearly that President Xi only gets fully President Putin's view and narrative on what's happening. So any chance that Ukraine has to put their view across, and if you will undermine or show the inconsistencies in Putin's view and Putin's illegal invasion this will be something Ukraine will want to exploit.",

What it is a laboratory that is contains bio hazards among them. We know from the W.H.O. are measles, polio and cholera now, measles and cholera are pretty endemic in Sudan. There will be pockets of people carrying cholera in Khartoum, as we speak, obviously, if this laboratory were compromised, if there was a release of these pathogens into the population that would be a disaster. But it isn't something that would be utterly catastrophic globally. What it would be though, is it would reintroduce potentially polio to a population in which it's been eradicated or officially eradicated. There are still pockets, I understand, in West Africa of polio. But essentially, that is a disease that has been done away with by decades of inoculation. Measles still exists than cholera in a town in which there is already a chronic shortage of water, clean water is only available to people with access now to wells in most of the city. It is getting increasingly dirty, the hospitals are already overwhelmed. So where there to be cholera epidemic as a comment or cholera spread as a result, either of the existing pathogen being in a population or worse still from a release from a laboratory, then it would obviously be very disastrous. And think about cholera is it can get a grip on a vulnerable population such as the population at war very, very quickly. We've seen that many times in the past, particularly during African civil wars, notably the most catastrophic outbreak being in what was then Zaire many years ago, Zain. So that is the issue. But on top of all of that, there is ongoing violence. There is also a controversy between the different attitudes to the evacuations of national groups. So Britain, for example, is conducting or planning to conduct something like six flights to try and evacuate British nationals after quite a lot of criticism in the British media for the critics view failing to properly look after their citizens. The United States is saying to its 16,000 citizens to remain in place because they don't think that the ceasefire at the moment is permissive enough to be able to conduct evacuations. But in Saudi Arabia, some 2000 people have now been landed in Jeddah on a ferry as a result of being able to get overland to the Port Sudan now that looks to be the best way out for most people. The problem is that is itself a dangerous route Zain.",

U.S. President Joe Biden is set to welcome South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol at the White House. You just relist to the Marine Corps Band playing there. This is the south lawn where we expect a traditional state arrival the two leaders will listen to a Korean choir, and they will both make brief remarks later in about an hour or a few hours rather from now. There'll be given a joint news conference and tonight the Biden's will host a state dinner for President Yoon and his wife as well. The state visit comes under the banner of the Washington declaration and of course we will bring you all the pomp and circumstance live when it begins next hour. Right, China's giant panda Ya-Ya is on a long journey home. She was loaned to the Memphis Zoo two decades ago with fellow giant panda Le-Le who actually died in February. Now China says that she'll be back soon. Anna Coren has more for us from Hong Kong.
