We will take you live to Southern Turkey. Research efforts are ongoing after last week's devastating earthquake. More than 36,000 people now confirmed dead, with Turkish Authorities arresting dozens of property developers accused of negligence plus, mystery in the skies U.S. fighter jet shooting down three unidentified objects and North American airspace in just three days. Latest incident happening Sunday over Northern Michigan officials being pressured to reveal more we are live in Washington with the latest. And NATO Secretary General warning that Russia has long feared military escalation in Ukraine has already begun. The Ukrainian leaders warning of massive Russian attacks ahead Moscow claiming frontline gains as well. All that and much more but first hope amid the rubble in Southern Turkey rescue efforts are intensifying. One week after that devastating earthquake that has now claimed the lives of over 36,000 people. And the 178th hour of the rescue, a 25-year-old woman is recovered alive. That's what we're looking at here. It's one of the latest in a just a series of incredible stories of survival. Also a baby rescued after 108 hours this made me here. Official say he's resting and he appears to be in good health, at least based on that smile on his face. And the stories of hope calm as anger grows over the government and President Erdogan's handling of the crisis. Turkish Authorities have ordered the arrest of a number of property developers accused of negligence that's after tens of thousands of buildings collapsed. Turkish Police also dealing with online threats in the wake of the tragedy. They have arrested 14 people accused of posting fake information and that spreading panic. Police have also shut down sites demanding money from citizens or posing as charities. Jomana Karadsheh joins me now from Turkey. Jomana, of course, you have been on the front lines there since the very beginning. What's the latest there?",

But they say this was different, you had a large number of people coming in at once, something they've never dealt with. And these are hospitals that are on the verge of collapse. The whole house infrastructure in the country, after years of bombardment, by the Russians, and the Syrian regime has really left them, ill-equipped to deal with something like this. And in addition to that, you've had aid that has been slow to come in. And then you've had the complexities of aid coming through the Turkish border after the airstrikes. So you had hospitals, and then you have the White Helmets. Those are, you know, the teams that are known for their heroic rescues during the Syrian war, they would dig people out of the rubble of bomb buildings. But when it came to this, they urged the world to send them the equipment, they needed to try and search for survivors to try and get people out. They needed machinery, they needed just about everything that we see, for example, here in Turkey that is being used to try and get survivors out and they didn't get that. And this is again, saying that they feel completely abandoned, completely left alone and forgotten. And now aid is starting to get into Syria. Over the past few days, you've had U.N. aid convoys going in, but people there would tell you this is too little, too late. And, you know, we've heard from the Senior U.N. Official who was at the border with that convoy went across saying that it is understandable and they agree that the Syrian people feel like they had been abandoned that the international community has so far failed Syrians. And now is the time to act to try and fix this and try and get them the aid they need. But people there told us that it's too late, they have lost the people that could have saved if that aid had come earlier, Rahel.",

And the next hour on \"Connect the World\" will also see your special report on how people are coping in Syria. So for all of our viewers around the world, be sure to tune into that in the next hour. And as you have heard, the long running civil war has been complicating relief efforts in Syria. The World Health Organization is currently waiting for final approval to send aid deliveries into Northwest Syria. Top WHO Officials are in Aleppo with humanitarian aid, but they're unable to bring that aid to rebel-held areas, at least not yet. The U.N. has been able to get trucks full of supplies into Northwest Syria. However, they are asking for more border crossings to be opened so that more aid can be sent to the rebel-held areas faster. Nada Bashir joins me now. So Nada, as Jomana pointed out very well, there is a very complex series of issues for Syria. Walk me through the relief efforts in Syria, as far as you know.",

Now, talking about Turkey, it has to be said this is an incredible response. We have seen people working around the clock for the last week at a distribution centers like this one, to provide that vital humanitarian. Since thousands of people in Turkey, left homeless, following that earthquake, many more still desperately in need and of course, over the weekend, we did see those remarkable, miraculous rescues of survivors still, beneath the rubble. Even today, in the early hours of the morning, we are still seeing survivors being pulled out of the rubbles that had given many in Turkey a sense of hope, and they could still find survivors. But as this begins to shift from a rescue effort to more of a recovery effort that is the sad reality that people here in Turkey are facing us as our people in Northwest Syria. But the real focus now is now shifting towards how they can help those who have survived? They've been left homeless left and a huge amount of vulnerability and it is eight centers like this one, you can see how busy it is. And I've seen the last hour we've seen two trucks now, leaving the center filled with humanitarian systems with aid with blankets, electrical heaters, food, and all the essential items that someone made homeless might need and respond to this center. It's quite incredible to see the trucks beeping very loudly the crowd here the volunteers cheering, clapping as another truck full of aid leaves the building and this is going to continue happening.

Beijing has also pointed out that the U.S. flies, reconnaissance planes and sends warships near Chinese sovereign territory in the South China Sea alone saying that there were at least 64 of these kinds of operations in January alone. All of this kind of underscores the fact that the tensions are mounting between these two capitals. You've just heard about three unidentified objects being shot down by U.S. jets over North America Friday, Saturday and Sunday of last weekend. Well on Sunday, a Chinese state news outlet said that there was an unidentified object flying in the air off the coast of Shandong province, and quoted Chinese officials saying they were preparing to shoot it down. And urging the public to take pictures of the debris collected debris as possible evidence that has set the Chinese internet which is highly censored on fire with lots of speculation. As of Monday today, we haven't gotten any updates from Chinese Officials about what they suspect this object to be, where they think it's from, and at what altitude it is operating.

And it seems like Putin and his generals are just willing to throw Russian soldiers at these defenses. And they haven't in at least that region made much ground at all, despite those heavy losses to the north of that zone in Bakhmut. In the villages around that heavily contested-area the Russians do appear to be having more success through the conventional forces and private military contractors, according to them. The big question now other than whether Ukraine can withstand these assaults in the east, Rahel, is whether they can actually get what they need? You've had Ukrainian Commanders telling us that they are at times running short of artillery shells, in particular, the NATO Secretary General dealt with that specific issue, saying that there's a long lag time between making those requests and actually producing new artillery for the Ukrainians. And that will be, I think, a very important part of the discussions between Defense Ministers of NATO region over the next day or two, to try and figure out how to maintain the support for Ukraine. There's been a lot of talk about sophisticated weapons systems like tanks, and like fighter jets, but they need the basic artillery, particularly that its old Soviet era artillery shells to continue their fight, Rahel.",

So when we heard in 2021, that we were having high inflation. The Fed came out and said don't worry, it is transitory meaning it's short lived, and it will be reversed. We hear the same thing about recession. If we fall into a recession, I want to stress it's a capital I and a capital S. If we fall into recession, it may not be short and shallow.

What is the path ahead look like to you? EL-ERIAN: So, Chair Powell basically used the word disinflation 11 times. And this inflation is this notion that the rate of increase of prices not only comes down, but certain prices actually fall, which is what's happening. So that is the scenario for the Fed that we're going to have a very orderly reduction in inflation. I suspect we're more likely to see sticky inflation about 4 percent. I must also add there are certain people who think we see a U shaped inflation that inflation gets on a higher trajectory towards the end of the year.

So the hardest part, believe it or not, is cognitive is the ability to keep your mindset open, and look at multiple scenarios because that's what we are facing. This is a very, very uncertain, not just uncertain, but unusually uncertain, because we also have longer term issues. We have the energy transition. We have geopolitics.

It is building after building after building; some of them that are still standing are damaged beyond repair. And a lot of them are crushed like pancakes on top of each other.

It's been six days I'm waiting here with my twin standing in the cold. She says she's been asking anyone who will listen to dig her husband out but for six days she says officials kept telling her they needed permission from the government to stir on her building. I want my husband back even if he's not alive. She may have accepted his death but can't go on without seeing her husband's body removed from this hells cape. My life, my blood, my everything, my best friend in life he left me with my twins here alone SIDNER (on camera): While she waits for the realities of her husband's death here in this area where you see enormous piles of rubble. These are different buildings, but you can't really distinguish them because there's just so much destruction. There have been signs of life. A child was found here alive after a week in the rubble. SIDNER (voice over): Nurses comfort the girl who they think is three or four years old. She's dehydrated and in shock but alive. This is the moment she was rescued her exhausted little body pulled from under the seemingly endless mountains of rubble in Hatay. She was rushed to the makeshift hospital setup in the parking lot of the actual hospital that was evacuated after the earthquake.

That was the beginning of World Central Kitchen and especially in earthquakes. What I saw Port-au-Prince was destruction was thousands and thousands of people that many, many buildings destroyed. But this is like 20 Port-au- Prince. This is like 20 earthquakes. This is the magnitude of what the Turkish people are going through. This is like 400 to 450 kilometers long earthquake. And they didn't only have one, they had two. And many of the buildings that collapsed also, they didn't collapse on the two earthquakes, but they collapsed on their aftershocks. So what we're seeing is obviously one of the biggest events we had in the last century. And overall, with all these destructions of these deaths, I want to really say that the Turkish government we the different emergency organizations, they have an all the help that has come from around the world. They are doing actually the best they can to cover the suffering of everybody without homes or people with homes. But that right now, this is - to understand why they are way afraid to go into a building even into areas that they've not been so affected by the earthquake.",

And so they're afraidto go back in because it hasn't been deemed safe.

I mean, we are already able to go in the last day is very much all around the different areas hit by theearthquake, and everything, use the story of repeats town after town after town. Obviously, they are trying to do as many here next to one of these camps where people are staying. They are building them as quick as they can. But we need to understand that these tens of thousands and thousands of families that they are going to have to be moving into those stands and then is everything not too far away a USBC hospital that came from the Spanish government. I feel that in these events, they always go to help with - and the hospital this morning as soon as they opened they had 300 people and these without anybody knowing that the hospital was already open. So from the health care issues from food from blankets, I've been in the mountains a night the temperature for everybody to understand is being under ten under 20 Celsius degrees. This is why right now everybody doing food, especially at night. You try to make sure that you don't only do food to cover those needs, but that the food is hot like soups and where people with that suit. They don't only fill up their needs, their physical needs, but these are moments that their hands can be warming up in these very cold nights of northern part Turkey.",

You will see a big fire and around that big fire will be the families, the families waiting, hopefully, for finding their loved ones alive. And then you will see in the early hours of these response people, normal people restaurants or hotels that they will come up sometimes so as far away as Istanbul use in their car with a big pot of soup Shorba (ph) as they call it here. Different soups like for Hana soup, the soup of beans for soya leaves, and soup is been what has been winning this cold days. So at World Central Kitchen, we are only one of the many other people and organizations doing the best we can to cover those food needs. So we are serving things that are local, why? Because when we arrived, we identify the restaurants that were open, that they were safe that they could cook. And what things we began serving in the early days Kebabs. I mean, we landed in Adala is almost the Capital of Kebab. Kebabs is some of the items we began serving. When in emergencies, you show up some of the best response always happens normally with local people and local restaurants and local chefs, but happens with local food. This is very much the types of food we've been trying to do here in Turkey.",

Two young Canadian entrepreneurs have set out to change that with a solar powered watch in today's \"Global Connections\" Solios on a mission to make watches with the lowest possible carbon footprint. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SOLOMON (voice over): It took these two entrepreneurs a trip around the world to make a product that would not only help transform the market back home in Canada, but in the watch making industry itself ALEXANDRA DESABRAIS, CO-FOUNDER, SOLOIS: It makes more sense to move towards more durable practices and verbal consumption habits.
