Well the Troy police did not identify the suspect in Woll's murder. And it's unclear what charges the suspect may be facing -- Boris.",

They were so concerned, in fact, that they raised the issue with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He has really been in the middle trying to hear at all of his members, balance all these competing viewpoints in his diverse caucus.

That has some doctors concerned that people who need it may not be able to afford it.CNN medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, is following this story. And you know, Meg, when I first learned about this drug I was so excited. I thought, this is so great. I know so many women who have had postpartum depression, but man, that is a hefty price tag.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam, I think doctors are pretty concerned about what that will mean for access. And you know about one in eight people who've recently had a baby get postpartum depression. This can set in really in the weeks or months after pregnancy, but also in the late stages of pregnancy. And it can really be severe or causing sadness, loss of energy, even thoughts of self harm. And so doctors were really excited, as you were, when this new drug was approved over the summer. And now is just starting to approach becoming available at the end of the year.It's a new way to treat postpartum depression. It's the only drug that's approved to be taken as a capsule, so orally, for PPD. You take it once a day for 14 days. Now the problem of course is this price tag we just learned about yesterday. It's almost $16,000 for this two week course of treatment. We don't yet know about what insurance coverage is going to look like. But some doctors told me they're worried that patients perhaps will have to try cheaper generic antidepressants first. And if those don't work, then maybe they get to try this medicine. We'll have to see how broad the insurance coverage can be. But the concern is that when a drug has a high price point that can lead to inequities in access -- Pam.",

The companies that make the medicines Sage and Biogen, have said that they hope the coverage is broad and equitable and that there won't be a high copay. They're also planning to provide copay assistance or free drug where it's appropriate.But when you have a high drug list price that can make it more difficult just across the system. And so that's why doctors are so concerned about this. Especially when you have a new drug that works really quickly and that's one thing these older antidepressants don't do.
