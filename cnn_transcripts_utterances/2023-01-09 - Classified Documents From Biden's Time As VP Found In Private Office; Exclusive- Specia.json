The attorney general now asking a U.S. attorney to investigate.Also breaking this hour, a major development in the DOJ's investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. We are learning that special counsel Jack Smith's team has subpoenaed Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani and more on what Smith is zeroing in on. This is reporting that you will hear first OUTFRONT. And new audio into OUTFRONT revealing the dire state of Russia's hospitals full of injured soldiers. An intercepted call that wasn't meant to ever be heard by you. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. Classified documents from Biden's time as vice president have been found at one of his private offices in Washington, D.C. This is according to a source. The documents were found by President Biden's attorneys last fall, and then turned over to the National Archives, which has referred the matter to the Justice Department. And we can tell you tonight that the Justice Department is now investigating this. Now, just to be clear here, Biden, of course, was required by law to hand over all official documents and classified documents when he and President Obama left office. This is a significant development tonight. And it comes at the same time that the Justice Department is investigating Trump's handling of sensitive material at Mar-a-Lago. So the big question tonight is how does Biden's handling of classified documents compare to Trump's? Here's what we know so far from what the reporting we have so far. Biden was not asked by the National Archives for any documents. His attorneys found them, and they immediately notified the Archives. Trump, of course, was asked by the National Archives for documents, attested to handing them over but didn't. The DOJ issued two subpoenas related to the documents even after a subpoena we know Trump personally directed an employee to move boxes that contained classified materials. And, of course, the FBI had to search his home and office to find documents. Biden's documents, we're told, did not include nuclear information. As for Trump, we know the FBI explicitly sought to locate classified documents related to nuclear weapons when they searched Mar-a-Lago. As for where the documents are found, Biden's found in an office, as I mentioned. Most of Trump's sensitive documents were found in his home at Mar-a-Lago. And of the documents found, here's what we know. Biden had fewer than a dozen. Some reportedly did have top-secret designation. As for Trump, all the documents he returned voluntarily through subpoena were seized in the FBI's search thus far, more than 300 were classified, 92 secret, and 25 top secret. Back in September, Biden was asked about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What do we know? This is going to be a political nightmare for the Biden administration. They didn't want this to happen. So, whatever it was, it is politically an unforced error. It is politically something that the Republicans and Donald Trump are going to make hay in. I think one point that my sources have been saying, which Evan mentioned is important to underscore, and that is the difference in cooperation. The lawyers, when they found them, they immediately called the Archives and had the documents picked up. And also, obviously, there were very few documents. There were fewer than a dozen documents, I am told. And, finally, let's remember two things about Donald Trump. The Justice Department is looking at obstruction with him. The long period of time he refused to hand these things over. The number of documents, and let's not forget how he magically wanted to say he had declassified everything.",

He oversaw the probe looking into whether Hillary Clinton improperly stored or transmitted classified information to secretary of state. So he knows more about this than anyone. And also with me, the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, also, of course, expert on classified information. So, both of you, thank you. David, let me just start here with the fact that, of course, you've got top-secret files in this, highly sensitive classified information. From what you understand -- and this question, the fact that there's this Trump situation out there, just looking at the situation as it is for Biden. Could he be in trouble for this? DAVID LAUFMAN, FORMER CHIEF OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S COUNTERINTELLIGENCE SECTION:  Well, yes, he could be. It's going to depend on the relevant facts. Look, the Department of Justice and the FBI typically engage in logical investigative steps to get a handle on a variety of pieces of information. How classified documents came to be there, who was involved in it, why were they sent there, how many classified documents were there, what level of classification? Here we know that some of them are top-secret code word. That's pretty concerning. Who had access to them while they were there? Was this just a colossal mistake, or was there intent on bringing them there and keeping them there? Was there willful retention of classified documents in a place they weren't authorized to be? So, we don't know the answers to these questions yet, at least most of them. But the attorney general's done the right thing by giving this investigation to the FBI and not just to any prosecutor but a Trump- appointed prosecutor in Chicago to insulate his findings from potential political criticism. Now we have to give some room and breathing space to the department and the FBI to complete this investigation.",

David, how much weight does that carry? If Biden wasn't aware they were there and the minute that they stumbled upon them, they call the Archives. Whereas in Trump's case the archives asked, they were not forthrightly handed over. Subpoena one, subpoena two, FBI search. Trump personally directs an employee to move boxes. There are documents that are found in his home, his personal quarters. Does the differences here or the differences that we understand at this point to exist, do they matter?",

And no aggravating factor perhaps is as large as whether there is concealment or obstruction of justice in a case where classified documents are found in a circumstance like this.So, everything we're hearing tonight runs contrary to the notion that there was any kind of concealment or obstruction to the contrary based on the reporting tonight, President Biden's lawyers brought to the attention of the National Archives, they have fully cooperated. We'll have to wait and see what led to the depositing of the classified documents in the first place, what was the nexus between former Vice President Biden -- then former Vice President Biden to this document.",

His investigation is going to be determined based on the facts and the law as are presented to the prosecutors. And, you know, our system of criminal justice doesn't work along the lines of, well, he did it too so you should let me go. That's not a factor. The factors are the law and the facts. And that's what, you know -- in the former president is facing some very negative facts and some very tough laws in his own investigation, and what happens with the Biden investigation legally should not have an impact on that.",

We do know from federal election records that he received about $140,000 paid to two companies of his for travel. Those were paid from Donald Trump related groups. And, so, this subpoena, it did come a little bit more than a month ago. And it also comes at a time where prosecutors are asking for lots of documents, not just of Giuliani. But we have also heard about special counsel's office prosecutors subpoenaing others related to payments, asking them for information about the Save America PAC and other financial interests and payments that were being made as Donald Trump was trying to push back against Congress against his loss of the presidency. And so, all of this information is still being gathered. We don't know exactly how this is going to work out with Giuliani.

And then we realized that the scope is broader, we were looking at all the things that led up to January 6th, in a month or so before that.This is an expansion along those lines. The special counsel's not just looking at what happened on January 6th, not just what led up to the riot, the attack on the capitol, but now what happened with the money around those activities and were funds collected by the former president and his allies in a way that may have been fraudulent, were funds collected for one purpose but then used for a different one? So, Rudy Giuliani would certainly be right at the heart of that activity, as someone who may have actually received payments from these accounts, but also as a person who was engaged in that behavior and that activity of trying to overturn the results of the election through any means necessary.",

But, however, what they do make very clear in the White House counsel's statement is that once these documents were found, the counselor's office was notified and then immediately notified the archives. By the next morning, the archives had picked those documents. White House officials also mostly appearing to do what they've done throughout the course of the president's time in office, stay very far away from ongoing investigations. They don't want to have any involvement or any perception of any involvement. So it's probably unlikely you're going to hear them weigh in, in any way, shape, or form. We kind of saw that in live form from the president just now down in Mexico City. And we talked to officials, they made clear, the president's focus right now remains on that highly anticipated bilateral meeting with the Mexican president. It's something he's been preparing for over the course of the last several weeks. The first sit-down in Mexico between those two presidents since 2014.

In three weeks of fighting, the U.S. suffers more than 3,000 troops killed in action. That's about half of what the U.S. suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan over two decades. America's global position is damaged for years. China loses 90 percent of the amphibious fleet and 52 major surface warships and the air force loses more than 160 combat aircraft. Crucial to this outcome is the stockpile of precision guided munitions. Taiwan would need more U.S. supply harpoon anti-ship missiles which may be in short supply because these missiles have been sent to Ukraine.
