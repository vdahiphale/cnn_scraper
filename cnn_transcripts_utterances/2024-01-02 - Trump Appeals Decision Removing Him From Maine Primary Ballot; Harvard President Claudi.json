And we expect other legal challenges, from his team, any minute now. Plus, a senior leader of Hamas, killed in an explosion, near Beirut, Lebanon, Hezbollah warning Israelis this kind of action, inside Lebanon's borders, won't be tolerated. Could this lead to another front, in Israel's war? And Claudine Gay is officially out, as Harvard's President. Her resignation, following mounting accusations of plagiarism that began after her controversial testimony, on Capitol Hill, about anti- Semitism, on Harvard's campus. Kaitlan Collins is off tonight. I'm Brianna Keilar. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump's legal team, appealing the decision, by Maine's Secretary of State, to remove the former President, from the state's primary ballot. Trump, of course, was also booted off the primary ballot, in Colorado. And we're still waiting on that appeal. We're going to have more, on this breaking news, in just a moment. But it's all unfolding just 13 days, from the Iowa caucuses, where Republican voters will have their first say, about who they want their party's nominee to be. And if you think these court battles are getting in the way of Trump's quest, to win back the White House? Think again. Not only did he nail down an endorsement, today, from the second highest-ranking Republican, in the House, Majority Leader, Steve Scalise. But polls show his base is growing more loyal as the criminal charges stack up. According to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, GOP voters are now more sympathetic, to those who stormed the Capitol, on January 6th, and more likely to absolve Trump, of responsibility for the attack, than they were right after the insurrection. Joining me now, we have Senior Political Correspondent, for The New York Times, and CNN Political Analyst, Maggie Haberman; Trump's former White House Communications Director, Alyssa Farah Griffin; and former Trump campaign adviser, David Urban. Welcome to all of you. We are officially here, in a presidential election year, now. Maggie, tell us, how does Steve Scalise's endorsement, of Trump, and also the support, of almost all of the House GOP leadership play, into his strategy, for the primaries?",

But it makes it very hard, for anybody, who is trailing him, to break through. It just creates another news cycle that is all about Donald Trump, for Republican primary voters.

And Donald Trump is a bit of a master, of pivoting bad media cycles in his favor. He's done that. If the attention is going to be on him, he's going to find a way, to work, in his favor, with his base. And to the point of the Scalise endorsement. He has elected Republicans, solidly in his pocket. So, that means he has an echo chamber, and amplifiers, who are going to go out and back him. He's got the vast majority of Republican endorsements that you can have.

I think we all forget that we see a lot of Donald Trump, because we cover this. And Republicans see a lot of Donald Trump, because it's their primary. The general election electorate has not seen that much of Donald Trump. He has not been on Twitter. He does not hold press conferences. He does not really do media interviews, the way he used to. He is not on Fox News, the way he used to be. And so, there hasn't been a lot of Donald Trump, in the public eye, the same way. There will be, once he is in a general election. He's been trying to massage his position, on abortion, to be essentially everywhere on it. He's the person, who is most responsible, other than Mitch McConnell, for Roe v. Wade ending, with the appointment of Supreme Court justices, and a supermajority. And yet, because Donald Trump, once upon a time, was pro-abortion rights in it, he is seen by a segment as moderate. And I think he's going to continue to try to push that. I don't think that his constant discussion, about the election, and his lies about the election, and his claims about January 6th, 2021, and the attack on the Capitol that day, I don't think that that's especially helpful to him, in a general election.

They see a very porous border. They see crime on the rise in cities. They see brackets around their 401(k)s. And they're unhappy. They're disaffected. And they -- and they yearn, believe it or not, for those days, during the Trump administration, when there was a low unemployment, inflation was non-existent, and immigration was -- the border was secured. And so, I think they're looking at that, nostalgically, right now. We'll see if that plays forward.

You are going to hear that a lot. Now, what he has said previously, in addition to that language, and he's been saying it all year is, some version of, \"I am your retribution.\" He has made very clear that he is going to use his time, in office, to go after President Biden, and his family. He is going to radically change the federal government. He is going to erode the post-Watergate norm, between the Justice Department and the White House. I mean, among other things, he has a very radical plan for immigration. All of this fits into his description of the country, in turmoil. I think, to Dave Urban's point, there are a lot of people, who are looking at specific policy aspects. They look at the border, right now. They look at inflation. And they are very upset. And they are hearing him casted, in these terms, as some kind of incredibly grim match. I think you're going to hear him continue to say that. What he will do with that presidency is not necessarily what that means, in terms of final battle. I think his view, of what he wants to do, with the White House, yes, there are policy pieces.

And he argues, the Secretary of State, she was biased, and recused her -- and should have recused herself. Then, he argues, even if Maine properly followed its procedures, I was not given proper due process. He argues, this was a sort of abbreviated quasi hearing, and I wasn't given enough of the protections that you would need, in a hearing, like this. And then, finally, he argues, even if all those things I just said are not true, the President does not count as an officer of the United States, under the 14th Amendment, using some sort of legalistic linguistic gymnastics.

So, the Israelis decided this, from what I hear from Israeli officials, to notify the U.S., as the operation was taking place. And this is not something that just happened today, and within one or two hours, this operation went underway. This was weeks in planning, according to what Israeli officials are telling me.",

And this could lead to this cycle that gets us to an escalation, and to a regional war, which is very dangerous. On the other hand, some Israeli officials say that both the issue of the hostages, and the issue of tensions, on the border, with Lebanon, could actually -- that this assassination could actually improve the situation. Because while in the immediate term, it will escalate things? In the more interim, it will basically send the message, to Hezbollah and to Hamas leadership in Gaza, that it's better off cooling off tensions with Israel, and going for a hostage deal.

And one of them was from an undergraduate, who was on the Honor Council, who said that if a student was brought before the Honor Council, they would be disciplined. So, that -- that's, from my understanding, talking to Harvard professors today, that's something that really drove, I think, this question that could she stay with authority in the position. So, that -- that's real. But if you take that one -- the tile of Claudine Gay, and you kind of pull it back, and look at this mosaic, there are a lot of African- American leaders, tonight, who feel like there is a -- it's a trendline that's very disturbing, that there's something happening, when particularly Black women are headed into academia, and they're taking on positions of leadership. We saw what happened to Nikole Hannah-Jones, down at UNC, when she tried to go there. And she had her professorship taken away. We saw what happened to Kathleen McElroy, at Texas A&amp;M, where she had to return to University of Texas, because they rescinded her offer. They actually paid her a lot of money, to make that go away. So, there are people, who feel like there's a trend that's happening, that the affirmative action case, the venture capital fund, that couldn't invest in, on women leaders, African-American women leaders, who wanted to start companies. There are all these things that are happening, in the American mosaic that are disturbing, about DEI, and whether or not we're going to have people of color, who are in the leadership of the country, as we become a more diverse country.",

And it breaks my heart that her race is becoming the focal point, over a resignation that had nothing to do with it. She was not being pressured to resign, because she was Black. I will remind you, Liz Magill at Penn, a White woman, resigned. Scott Bok, pressured to resign, a White man, at Penn. Sally Kornbluth, a White woman, at MIT, is being pressured to resign, again, not because of the racist-right. But because everyone, from the White House to Democrats, to liberal academics have acknowledged there is a real problem here. And to me, while I think there are credibly important conversations, to be had, about race and sexism? I think this particular one really diminishes the deep pain, that Jewish Americans are feeling, right now, in the face of attacks, on their college campuses, where they no longer feel safe, and feeling like they don't have support, or even like there is an indifference, to their pain, and that one-time allies have decided that they're no longer supporting them.
