It is now 6 a.m. Sunday in Israel and in Gaza, sunrise about 45 minutes from now.Israel is promising that a new phase in its war on Hamas is coming. It is likely it will be a ground operation. Troops have been amassing for days now near the Gaza border. Israel hit Gaza from the air again on Saturday. Officials say a Hamas commander who played a key part in last Saturday's attack was killed. We are closely watching the evacuation of northern Gaza. The IDF has told more than a million people to head south. U.N. officials warned that such a large-scale evacuation could lead to a humanitarian disaster. There's also an important development tonight from the Pentagon. A second U.S. carrier strike group led by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower is sailing toward the Mediterranean. This is designed to show support to Israel and send a message to Iran and its proxies including Hezbollah and Lebanon not to get involved. The State Department tonight says the number of U.S. citizens killed in the attacks has climbed to 29. Fifteen Americans are still unaccounted for. CNN's Oren Liebermann has live at the Pentagon. Oren, you've been standing by there all night. The latest news is this second carrier strike group headed toward the Mediterranean, why?",

But that's exactly what we'll see here in the coming days. The USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group, which consists of cruisers and destroyers, is already in the eastern Med. and arrived earlier this week.Meanwhile, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group left the east coast of the U.S. today and should get there in a couple of weeks. So it's a major statement. As you point out, the purpose of all of this essentially firepower and these warships is not to get involved with the fighting in Israel. Israel doesn't want that and the U.S. doesn't want that. The purpose is to be part of making sure the fighting itself remains constrained to Gaza and to Israel and doesn't spill over Israel's borders into what could quickly become a regional escalation. In that sense, the recipient of this message sent by the strike group is one of deterrence directed at Iran and specifically Hezbollah in Lebanon right on Israel's northern border. There has been some back- and-forth fire across that border, but it hasn't escalated beyond that and still -- and remains at essentially a contained level. The goal is to keep it there, John.",

      "sentences": "John, it seems that we're closer than ever. It's very much a question of when rather than if. And we've been discussing the potential for a ground invasion ever since Hamas launched this devastating and brutal terrorist attack on Israel that's killed more than 1,300 people just a week and a day ago.And, of course, Israel's been striking from the air, from the land and from sea. Since then there was a brief incursion by Israeli troops as a kind of reconnaissance mission inside the Gaza Strip before the weekend. But clearly now we seem to be getting closer. Israel saying that it is soon going to be starting a significant military operation that it's just waiting really for civilians to get out of harm's way. We of course saw that evacuation order to people of Gaza City in the northern part of the Gaza Strip on Friday, which people living there account for almost half of the strips, 2 million or so people. We've seen people heading south despite Hamas' calls for them to stay and not pay any attention to Israel's warnings. But of course Israel telling them to move south to get out of harm's way. But we've seen also evidence that some of those people moving south have also been hit in some of those strikes by Israel. But of course there are many, many dangers laying ahead for a ground invasion, not just to the lives of Israeli soldiers. There's the potential for more of them to be kidnapped as well. Let's not forget that Hamas is holding more than 100 people from Israel and other foreign nationalities as well. That will very much complicate the situation. There's a danger for many more civilian casualties inside the Gaza Strip. And there are already more than 2,000 who have died so far. There's also danger for further escalation in the north. We've seen low-level, if you like, skirmishes, rockets being fired by militants from southern Lebanon, from the Iran back to Hezbollah, into Israel, and even from Syria. So there's danger for escalation. As we're hearing Oren talking about the U.S. warships and the eastern Mediterranean, I suppose partly to try to dissuade any additional escalation there in the north. We've also seen rising violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank as well, where more than 50 Palestinians have been killed so far. So there's very much a danger for escalation. There's a danger to Israeli soldiers, their lives and for being kidnapped, and also, of course, dangers for the civilian population of Gaza too. John?",

Many have moved south but are now stuck at the Rafah Border Crossing that is right on the border between Gaza and Egypt. That is the only crossing that Israel does not directly control. It's been closed for some time. It was closed Saturday, even though some Palestinian Americans said they were told it would be open. CNN spoke to a Philippine national who was stranded there all day with her family. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HIND AL-KHOUDARI: There were a lot of people. We're talking about more than 15 or 20 families that hold different passports and everyone was calling the embassies and they were telling them that they don't know if they're going to cross today or not. The Egyptians said that they wanted the crossing to be for humanitarian cause and not only for evacuating foreigners.

STEVE SOSEBEE, WORKS WITH PALESTINE CHILDREN'S RELIEF FUND: My thoughts are with the over two million civilians in Gaza, half of them children who have no protection, anywhere in the Gaza Strip. My own staff there, over 40 young people with children of their own trying to survive with no safe havens, no place to go. Some of them trapped in the north were unable to leave to the south due to the lack of transportation or the lack of security on the roads there. My thoughts are with the collapsing health system and the lack of food and water, the sewage flowing into the streets and the diseases that that's going to cause for people who are already at risk. My thoughts are with the overworked and stressed-out health medical doctors who are trying to provide treatment for thousands of injured civilians, many of them children. The dwindling supplies, the electricity that's going to run out, that it has already run out or in the hospitals going to run out when the generators run out of diesel fuel and the lack of food.

More than 20 ,000 Americans reached out to the State Department in Israel to the State Department since last week.

These are all questions that officials are still trying to sort through.Now there are 15 Americans unaccounted for but of those it's unclear how many are hostages.

It's very interesting to see what's happening with Saudi Arabia that was in the midst of a process of possibly normalizing relations with Israel. And there is little doubt in my mind that one of the reasons why this attack happened now is because Hamas and probably Iran wanted to derail that process of normalization. And, you know, if they succeed in doing that, this will be a victory for Iran, which is something that Saudi Arabia does not want. Saudi Arabia and Iran recently established diplomatic relations, but they don't trust each other. And the last thing Saudi Arabia wants is to see a victory for Iran in this conflict.

I have spoken with so many friends who work for members in leadership and also friends who work for just regular members in the conference. And I've asked, guys, what's the plan here? If not Jim, who else do we look to?Some have circulated, Mike Johnson out of Louisiana. Some have stated the current speaker pro temp as a possibility. But none of those individuals can get to 218. And so when I've asked my former friends and colleagues, what's the plan? They all say, Sherm, we have no clue. And if anyone says they do, they're not being honest with you. And so I think this is a very precarious moment for the Republican Party. And I will tell you, when it comes to maintaining the majority next year, I don't think Republicans are going to be able to do it. I think Democrats have a solid message to the American people to say, these folks can't govern. Look how long it took them to choose a speaker.",

He gave away way too much in order to get the support that he needed after the 15th round of votes back in January. That's what put him in the precarious position that he was in, where he was able to be ousted by just one person calling for a motion to vacate.So what I think is the fundamental problem, John, and let's remember this. I really think it's important for viewers to remember. There are 139 members of the Republican Conference that voted to not certify the 2020 free and fair and legitimate elections that Joe Biden won. What does that mean? That means that there are 139 members of the House of Representatives that are pretty much in the extreme MAGA camp of the Republican Party. That seems to be completely disconnected with the reality of where common sense, independence, common sense Republicans are. And it has become impossible for anyone to really straddle those two pieces of voters, right? Those two buckets of voters, because if one bucket of voter supports you, the other one won't. And that, I think, is a fundamental problem, not just of the Republican Conference, but of the Republican Party today in order to win a general election.",
