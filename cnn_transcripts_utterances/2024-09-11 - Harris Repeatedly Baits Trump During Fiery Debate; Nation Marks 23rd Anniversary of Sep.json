The New York Times, Kamala Harris craftily exploited her opponent's biggest weakness, not his record, not his divisive policies, not his history of inflammatory statements. Instead, she took aim at a far more primal part of him, his ego.And from the former speech writer for President Reagan and George H.W. Bush, John Podhoretz, quote, he cleaned his own clock. And when he didn't, she cleaned his clock. And when she didn't, Muir and David, he means Davis, cleaned his clock. In the end, his clock was cleaned. He smudged her clock face a little. This is some of what transpired. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala Harris, let's have a good debate.

They said that this is Trump, he had been talking about this all day, so do with that what you will.But, look, what I'm hearing from Donald Trump's advisers, I was texting with them all throughout the debate, I also was in the spin room last night catching up with a lot of them, and some have privately acknowledged, particularly I'd say people close to Trump, his outside allies, they note he took the bait, he fell for some of that goading that Kamala Harris had laid out for him, and ones that, I will remind you, and we talked about this all day yesterday, that his campaign had been the most concerned about. They had prepped him behind the scenes over the last few weeks not to fall for that, not to fall into the trap of getting more aggressive, of going on different rants of attacks. They wanted him to be more restrained. Clearly, that was unsuccessful. But they also argue -- you know, they're arguing that the moderators were more biased against him. You saw a lot of his surrogates, including people like Tulsi Gabbard, Brian Hughes, Trump himself said this, that it was a three- on-one debate. Of course, we know that when they blame the moderators and attack the networks, it ends up being a -- it ends up not really being a winning argument. A key thing as well that I heard is, people were frustrated that he didn't steer the conversation back to the policy issues that matter. And particularly, when he fell for some of those attack or that goading and that baiting from Kamala Harris, it was on immigration, one of the issues that he does much better on, that they believe he polls better on. Same with the economy. He could have needled her more. They don't think she did well enough on the economy or answering questions about her changing her position, some of the flip-flopping, but they thought that a lot of people I talked to, that it was on Donald Trump to do that. And so, I think, you know, we'll see what they end up saying today, as much as they are trying to claim that he won the debate. Sara?",

But that is what it is all about for these families, remembering those who were killed not only here, but also in Pennsylvania at the Pentagon and also the people that have suffered in the aftermath. You know, about more than 300 firefighters have died from, you know, 9/11-related illnesses, and there are many more who are still suffering from cancer because they responded, because they raised your hand, as you mentioned, Kate.So, this is a day about remembering where our country was at that moment and where we are going and where we have been.
