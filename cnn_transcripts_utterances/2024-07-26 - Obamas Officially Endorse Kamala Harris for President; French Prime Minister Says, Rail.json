I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this morning with Kamala Harris winning her biggest endorsement yet overnight, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama officially pledging their support to Harris' presidential bid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY:  I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We call to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Governor Josh Shapiro considered a strong candidate as her running mate will also be on hand as Harris enjoys the momentum, the endorsements and fundraising.She is accusing former President Donald Trump of backpedaling on their upcoming scheduled debate. Last night, his campaign withdrew the commitment to debate until the Democrats' nominee is formally decided. Meanwhile, a new poll shows. A Trump Harris race is too close to call at this point, according to New York Times/Siena College survey of likely voters. There's a difference of only one percentage point. That's well within the margin of error. Let's begin this hour with this new endorsement from the Obamas. CNN's Kayla Tausche is over at the White House. Kayla, this endorsement is not a shock. Obviously, we knew it was going to be coming soon. But it is another huge boost to the Harris campaign's momentum right now, which is surging.",

But, certainly this is a major deal, a major momentum shift for Vice President Harris, day five of her campaign. And the Obamas saying not only that they support her candidacy but they're planning to head out on the campaign trail with her, to lend their political firepower directly to her and her effort out on the trail. Now, this as the campaign itself has been embarking on thousands of events across the country this week, and we expect 2,300 more events over the course of the weekend. But the campaign is calling a weekend of action, Jim, and a handful of those events happening across battleground states today, Jim.",

I mean, this is the end of really One of the most extraordinary weeks in Vice President Harris' political rise. There's no doubt about that. This is the bookend to that.Again, this is not a big surprise, but it gives content going into the weekend that, yes, the Obamas are there, not just Barack Obama, perhaps more importantly for popularity reasons, Michelle Obama, clearly. She is a single really a single figure in the Democratic Party, but even beyond that in terms of her reach. So, I think that is important. But also important, what the former president said, he said, Democrats are underdogs. And that really pops a bit of the balloon and injects some reality into this race now about 100 days before Election Day, because Democrats are slightly behind. I mean, if you look at the paths to the nomination, former President Donald Trump still is in command of this race. [10:05:00] Many would say it's his race to lose, and he certainly could. But this race is joined. But having the Obamas on board, it injects, you know, some energy. Obviously, we both cover the Obama White House. I've not seen anything as really exciting since then for Democrats all week long here. It's kind of the modern day version of what we saw back in 2008.",

You're talking about the many hundreds of thousands of people who have been trying to make their way to the French capital and the many millions of French people who've been hoping to get around the country for their summer holidays.What we know for the time being is that these attacks took place at about 4:00 A.M., highly coordinated, and very strategic, because they affected essentially all of, or a huge part of France's high speed rail lines. And they took deep knowledge of the system itself. First of all, no one was harmed. They took place at points far from where people lived, but methodically chosen that they would cause maximum disruption. So, lots of speculation about who might be behind it, but, clearly, the timing is no coincidence. We're just hours away now from the opening ceremony. One of the most ambitious, Jim, probably ever to be held insofar as it's six kilometers of the Seine River, a huge security operation here in Paris. And Paris 2024 organizers have been telling us for weeks that they feel that they're pretty well ready for anything. They've secured huge, huge parts of the French capital. It is some 45,000 policemen, 18,000 soldiers out in the streets of the French capital today. But what they couldn't have foreseen were these series of attacks. Now, we've just heard from a spokesman for French Railways, who says that beyond the disruption to many millions of ordinary French people and people trying to get in and out of France, it is one out of four Eurostar trains, for instance, that is canceled over the course of the weekend. There were some athletes impacted since four trains carrying athletes were due to arrive in Paris, two made it, two still have not, Jim.",

British pop star Charlie XCX pledged her support in this post, referencing her latest hit album, Brat. That sparked a slew of viral videos produced in the style of that album.

Millennials and Gen Z are not very attracted to MAGA at all. Instead, the problem for this administration in this race has been that these younger voters weren't particularly attracted to Joe Biden either.And you would see in the polling over the course of this whole year, younger voters saying over and over again, we want somebody else, we want somebody else. We don't want these same old, got two old white guys over and over again. Not just any old white guys, the same two old white guys who ran last time. You'd see that over and over in the polling. And I think that what this polling shift signifies is that these young voters just wanted somebody else.
