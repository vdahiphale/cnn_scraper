So, I think what we will most likely get, if and when we receive the House Ethics Committee report, is more detail about the investigation and the background. But frankly, we should also be asking the second question, what makes you qualified to lead the most important law enforcement agency in our country that's tasked with keeping the American people safe? And if President-elect Trump says he wants you to be attorney general to go after his political enemies, how will you prioritize keeping Americans safe given that directive from the president-elect? BOLDUAN: I want to play - you are - you also are on the Senate Ethics Committee, the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, so you know both sides of everything that is going on here in terms of the Gaetz investigation, you know, and how an ethics committee operates, the rules of engagement and the power that they have, and also with your perch on Judiciary. I want to play for you what that attorney that you're talking about for the two women, who spoke to the House Ethics Committee, what they said about Matt Gaetz speaking to Erin Burnett last night.

It was more than anything that they want lower prices. They want a stronger economy. They want more opportunity.And I'll remind you, President-elect Trump's victory nationally was not an overwhelming one. It was 1 percent of the American people. In fact, if about 240,000 people across Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania had voted for Vice President Harris instead of former President Trump, today we'd be talking about plans for the inaugural balls and Vice President Harris' cabinet picks. This was a close loss. And a key piece of that close loss was the average American believing that Donald Trump would do a better job on the economy. What we're not talking about today, Kate, is his proposal for double digit tariffs, a new national sales tax on every imported product, and what that will do to our economy, to inflation and to the prices Americans pay. While the nominees he's put forward really look more like a casting call for a reality TV show or a UFC fighting match than a cabinet, it is distracting us from the most important policy positions Donald Trump is developing, which have to do with the economy and the costs for working families and with foreign policy and what he may or may not do with regards to Ukraine.",

No one knows exactly what President-elect Trump will do when he comes into office, but he has over and over said he would resolve this war in one day.

Forty-five well-known pro-democracy activists have been sentenced to up to ten years in prison in the city's largest national security trial ever.Let's get over to CNN's Ivan Watson. He's got a lot more on what all has happened. What is the latest here, Ivan? IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. Well, you had judges here in Hong Kong that imposed combined sentences on these 45 defendants that add up to more than two centuries behind bars. Actually, more than 245 years. So, this was a huge court case. The 45 were convicted of the crime of conspiracy to commit subversion. They were accused of being part of a scheme to ultimately bring down the Hong Kong government. What did they actually do? Well, back in 2020 they held an unofficial primary. They were trying to get candidates together to contest citywide elections for Hong Kong legislature. And that, the prosecutors argued, was part of this nefarious scheme to try to destabilize the government. A little bit of context here. I've been living in Hong Kong for ten years. Five, six years ago, there were concerns that the democratic freedoms here were backsliding a little bit, under pressure from the Chinese national government. Since these 45 people were arrested, independent newspapers here have all been shut down. The opposition political parties, everybody is either arrested or has fled into exile. Unions have been disbanded. And you can't even protest in the streets, which used to be part of the fabric of this city. In fact, there was one woman outside the courtroom today who tried to hold up a protest sign. She was immediately grabbed by police and put into a police van. So, these freedoms disappeared in this city over the course of the past four to five years. And the roundup of these 45 activists was a big part of that process. The Hong Kong government, the Chinese national government, they argue that this crackdown was necessary to restore stability here. The U.S. consulate has put out a statement condemning these convictions and calling on the Chinese government and Hong Kong authorities to cease politically motivated prosecutions of Hong Kong citizens and to immediately release all political prisoners.
