Voters are set to elect their first female president and a top contender is former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a protege of the outgoing president while her rivals Xochitl Galvez is supported by a coalition of opposition parties.This race part of the largest set of elections in the nation's history with more than 20,000 positions on the ballot nationwide. There have been disruptions, long lines and delays plagued some polling stations, while authorities say voting was suspended in one town because of violence there. This has been a bloody political cycle, one marred by multiple assassinations and violence. One local candidate was killed just hours before voting began. CNN's Gustavo Valdes joins me now live from Mexico City. Good to see you again, Gustavo. We were expecting results about 30 minutes ago or a pointer tell us more about what we know so far, and what it all means for Mexico. GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We don't know what it really means Michael because without any explanation, the elections officials decided to postpone that press conference in which we are expecting the results. The initial, very initial preliminary small percentage of the vote counted, give Claudia Sheinbaum, an advantage and our colleagues in Herrick headquarters are showing that they are getting ready for a celebration. Thousands of them are already in Mexico. Sokola, which is the main square here in Mexico City. But there's nothing official. Earlier on the head of the party Morena came out and he claimed that they had won not only the presidency, but also the eight governorships that were in play, but also Xochitl Galvez, the opposition Galvez came out and she didn't quite claim victory. But she said that they had won because of how well they performed all over the country. So we have to wait. Either way, it seems like Mexico will have its first female president. This is a historic moment, voters we talked to said that even though that wasn't the main reason for them to come and vote. They were proud that their country would somehow also change that image of being macho country that women are finding their place in politics. And they were very excited because of that.",

Lopez Obrador has been pushing for a controversial reform, which would effectively see the Supreme Court elected by popular vote instead of selected through a non-electoral process. So, we'll see if Claudia Sheinbaum wants to make good on that promise to push through with that.

She comes from a part of the left that's tended to be much more critical and skeptical of the military.Now, so far, she's basically copied AMLO's proposals. You know, I have to to the word on this, saying that she will keep the military in important roles in public security, but she's given one or two signals here and there, that perhaps she will rethink this. So, I think we need to see we need to give her some time, see what happens.

      "sentences": "After President Biden conveyed Israel's ceasefire proposal to the world and then followed up with a helpful graphic in a tweet, there were inevitable reactions from across the political spectrum. In Israel, first and foremost from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he took the rare step of issuing a press statement on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday, in which he said that Israel would never agree to a cessation of hostilities, something that comes in phase two of the three-phase ceasefire proposal until such time as Israel's war objectives have been met.He said that unless Israel's conditions for cessation of hostilities were met, it would not agree to a ceasefire. Now, these conditions are number one, to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities, number two, to get all the hostages who were abducted by Hamas on October the seventh back into Israel, and number three, to ensure that the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to Israel. So I think what Netanyahu was trying to do was to clarify that the ceasefire proposal that he himself would have signed off on as part of Israel's war cabinet does not preclude Israel from meeting those war objectives. So the ball as far as the ceasefire proposal for now is in Hamas' caught. I think at the same time, Netanyahu was trying to preempt the inevitable blowback against the ceasefire proposal from the far right, members of his governing coalition. Those reaction blowback duly came at the end of the Jewish Sabbath, when they said that this proposal seemed like to them a capitulation to Hamas, it would be a defeat for Israel, it'd be a reckless deal. And if it goes ahead, they would pull their parties out of the governing coalition. Now, if they were to make good on that threat, that would likely lead to the collapse of Netanyahu's government, it would lead to fresh elections, which opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose so no doubt that is something else that is playing on his mind. At the same time over the weekend, Netanyahu said he was thrilled to be invited to speak to Congress by the top thought leaders, Democrat and Republicans of Congress on a date in the future. He said that he will convey the justness of Israel's causing his war against terrorism and its war against Hamas, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, I suppose to also bring on board any wavering lawmakers, particularly Democrats who may be feeling that Israel, for example, is not using U.S. weapons shipments as it ought to. At the same time, I think, Netanyahu is happy to be doing this because by being on the world stage speaking to U.S. lawmakers, he can once again portray himself to the Israeli public as the only man who can lead Israel on the international stage that he has the ear of U.S. lawmakers and the White House. And at the same time, he's the only man that can both maintain the Israel us relationship and stand up to the United States. When it's not in Israel's interests. Elliott Gotkine, CNN, Tel Aviv.

But the Japanese government still says that it has a right to practice this long-standing tradition. Now the third and final reason, which I found quite interesting was even though Japan recognizes that whale meat is not popular, right now, they think that once they can change public perception in the new future, that whale meat consumption will go up.

And with the launch of this expensive new boat, Tokoro says bills are piling up. But even if the new boat sinks him into bankruptcy Tokoro insists there is no Plan B. Internationally, whaling is criticized as a brutal and unsustainable practice that once pushed many of these mammals to the brink of extinction due to centuries of over hunting. And may still carry environmental consequences today. The things that we're learning about whales is that they're not just consumers in this ecosystem, but by the fact of them consuming so much food, they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment that actually helps to stimulate plant life growth.",
