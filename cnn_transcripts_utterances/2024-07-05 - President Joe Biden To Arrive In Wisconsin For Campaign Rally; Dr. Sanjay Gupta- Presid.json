The president will be arriving shortly here in Madison, Wisconsin, a key battleground state. And as he made his way over here, he again insisted that he believes that he can beat Donald Trump in November. The president has said there are no plans for him to step aside in this race, even as there are some calls within his party to do so. Now, the president will be speaking here at an event in Madison, and will also be sitting down for a high stakes interview with ABC News. This interview is likely to be very different from interviews Biden has faced in the past as the key focus of this will likely be his viability of a candidate. And since we spoke last hour, I took some time taking the temperature of voters who are here for this event, and really it has been a mixed response. There are some voters who said that they are seen by the president, they want him to see out this race, but there are others who have concerns following that debate performance and what it could mean for the Democratic ticket in November. I want to play you a bit of sound from one of the voters I spoke to in just the last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Sanjay, what was your reaction to the debate and what has transpired over the last week? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think it was -- it was concerning. I mean, there were some things, some signs that you'd see, I think, for anybody, that were concerning. But certainly, as someone who specializes in brain medicine, it was a -- there was a little bit more than that as well. I think many of these things weren't necessarily new, Pamela, but I think it was that they were so pronounced and so sustained throughout that debate that really made it of higher concern. I will say that the real question is, are these sort of intermittent episodes, or are those signs reflective of something that is a deeper, more concerning condition? We don't know. And that's why the testing, I think, is so critically important. Not to mention that if you get the testing, there are things that can be done about it as well. Earlier testing means earlier potential treatment if it's necessary, some of the things in particular that we noticed, and by the way, many doctors from around frankly, the world. I was out of -- out of the country last week, many doctors around the world were calling me, telling me their observations as well. People who specialize in neurology or neurosurgery, even halting speech, sort of losing your train of thought, confusion, leading to rambling at times. And also, sort of what we call in the neuro world, masked faces. Really expressionless, he seem to lose facial animation. Those are some of the things. In and of themselves, again, they may mean nothing. In aggregate, they might mean something. The only way to really know would be to do that testing. If you're my patient, Pam, if you were my father, I would urge that testing, again, with the idea that there is something that can be done about it. It's not testing just for testing sake, but then to actually take action, depending on what the testing shows.",

The press secretary saying, \"The president did have a short verbal check in in the recent days about his cold. It wasn't a medical exam or physical, it was a conversation, and his doctor didn't think an examination was necessary.\"So, that would mean the president's last full medical exam was about four months ago. What did -- first of all, what did you think, though about what we heard from the press secretary and the fact that his four months has gone by since his last full exam?",

You know, we heard about the exam, sort of the screening test, if you will, that President Trump had, former President Trump, he had this test called the MoCA, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. I think we may have an image of it, but basically it's everything from drawing a three dimensional cube, drawing a clock hand, identifying animals, remembering words, it takes place over 10 or 15 minutes or so. It's pretty quick, but it's just a screening test and a pretty blunt one.The more detailed cognitive testing, which, by the way, I went through when I was making this recent documentary, just to sort of demonstrate what it involves. It's all sorts of things. It's your blood work, but it's also things like your bone density, your genetic risk factors. Is there's smell tests, and there's lots of cognitive tests. How many words can you recite, starting with the letter T in the next 60 seconds, go. How many animals can you name in the next 60 seconds, go. You know, things like that. Really trying to get a sense of someone's processing speed, their judgment and also their memory. So, it's pretty involved to really do this. You spend time with the family, because family members are often the first to notice if there's anything that seems a little off, and you do a very detailed physical exam. So, there's a lot that goes into really assessing somebody for cognition, but also for potential movement disorders, Parkinson -- Parkinsonism, as I was mentioning earlier.",

GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): I don't think we know that yet. I think the -- I think everybody is waiting for the dust to settle from the aftermath of the debate, and I think this next week is going to be critical. Tonight, he has the interview with George Stephanopoulos. Over the weekend, he's got some travel to the Midwest where he's going to be unscripted and at public rallies. Next week, we have the 75th anniversary of NATO and world leaders are going to be coming to Washington for a major summit, which will be hosted by President Biden. He's also scheduled a press conference during that summit. So, I think the next week is going to be very telling as to how we deal with and how we categorize what happened to that debate, bad night, really bad night, but not characteristic of this president or his behavior, nor does it necessarily define how he goes about his job and will go about his job or not. So, I think -- I don't think we have the whole month of July.

And what I have warned about is that if you don't deal with that by reaching out to rank and file members of the House, Democratic members of the House, you risk people feeling they're on their own to make this decision, and you're going to have 213 silos making decisions based on their perceptions of which may or may not be accurate. So, at the end of the day, it really behooves the White House to make a more aggressive outreach with respect to members of Congress and other stakeholders, understanding that the risk is you're going to hear things you don't want to hear.

A couple names that were tossed out to us were Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The RNC keep sort of a rolling background books on all these individuals that they think could be potentially in the mix down the line. Well, if it becomes -- if it becomes in place sooner or later, the Trump campaign is trying to get up to speed on those individuals. And look, Trump himself has been predicting this situation might happen for more than a year, and now that is finally here. His campaign is just as unsure as the rest of us is where this is headed, but we have seen this sort of change in strategy in recent days. You saw MAGA Inc., a trope of pro-Trump super PAC start to target Kamala Harris, the vice president, in some of its recent messaging. And we've been told behind the scenes, they are talking through what might happen if it is Harris. And one of the things that we have heard is they will try to pin President Biden's mental acuity questions on her, and sort of make her answer the question every turn.

Some of it's quite aligned with Trump, including their positions on cracking down on immigration, as well as purging the federal bureaucracies of non-Trump loyalists. But they've also taken some outlier stances, like banning pornography and making it harder to get certain abortion medications and certain birth control medications and such, and those are some of the issues that are starting to get into the Biden campaign has tried to make into an issue.
