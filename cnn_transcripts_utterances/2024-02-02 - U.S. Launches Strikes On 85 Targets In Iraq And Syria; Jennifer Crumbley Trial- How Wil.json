Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.President Joe Biden retaliating tonight, five days after three Army reservists were killed in an attack on a base in Jordan. Major airstrikes on 85 targets across Iraq and Syria. And this is just the beginning of what will likely be a series of U.S. strikes on Iran- backed militias carrying out attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East. The president warning the military response -- quote -- \"will continue at times and places of our choosing\" -- end quote -- and trying, of course, to walk a very fine line from deterring further attacks on U.S. troops while avoiding a full-scale blowup with Iran, in a region already in turmoil over the Israel-Hamas war. And all of this comes on the day the president performed one of the most solemn duties of the commander-in-chief, attending to the dignified return of the three American soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan on Sunday. Tonight, we're covering all aspects of this breaking news. Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Ben Wedeman is in Amman, Jordan. Cedric Leighton is here with me right now. Let's begin with you, CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Lieberman. What do we know about these strikes in Iraq and Syria tonight?",

Simultaneous strikes in Iraq and Syria, seven different locations, four of those in Syria, three of those in Iraq, 85 different targets with more than 125 precision-guided weapons used across this target set.And it's not just facilities or weapon storage. It's much more than that. It's command and control, operations centers, intelligence centers, weapons storage sites. The administration very much trying to send a message here to Iran's proxies and militant groups in the region. But as you pointed out, threading a needle here, trying not to start a war with Iran, so no direct strikes in Iran itself. But clearly, the administration going after Iran's proxies in the region and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. So, carrying out this series of strikes here. Even the platforms used send a message. Heavier B1 bombers, this is much more powerful than the normal fighter jets, F-15s, F-16s. They're used to carry out these sorts of strikes. And the message, as you point out from President Joe Biden, this isn't ending right here. This essentially echoed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who said this is the start of our response. So, very much a message sent to Iran's proxies in the region that there could be more coming and it could remain powerful, Laura.",

That's a very critical element of this.Now, what's interesting about the way we did this, we've been telegraphing all along that we did not want to go to war with Iran. The administration has been very clear about this, as Ben mentioned in his reporting and Oren did as well. The other part of it, though, is the weapon system that we used to go after the Iran proxy targets in both Iraq and in Syria is the B1 bomber. The B1 bomber is an intercontinental aircraft. It can go anywhere in the world as long as it's being refueled. It has a range of 7,000 miles and it can make the Middle East without getting refueled from the United States, and it is the same kind of weapon system that we would potentially use to go after Iran. So, as Iran was watching what we were doing, they had to think, okay, is the United States bluffing? Are they moving our forces into this area or are they going to stop short? We stopped short this time, but it was a warning to the Iranians, and I think they saw it.",

If this message is not received, then what we're going to see potentially is continued attacks. I think that the Iranians, they have to take a breath, they have to look at what is happening in the region. They are exploiting right now, from my perspective, the fight between Israel and Hamas. And they're exploiting it and they're protesting and they're prodding, be it in the Persian Gulf with the Houthis or now in Iraq and in Jordan as we've seen.

Today, President Biden, he's sending out the secretary of state this coming week to the region to try to make sure that it's not in the service of war, but it's in the service of peace and security. So, opening up channels with our allies who speak to Tehran and potentially maybe even finding a route to talk to Tehran directly to calm this situation down, that's crucial.

You could identify, you could connect with it.But people who have mental health issues going on could disguise it. The prosecution mentions these journal entries. No evidence which would suggest that the parents ever saw those journal entries. So, should they be held accountable as to that? The reality is that someone, as I grew up, who made me laugh every day, his name was Robin Williams, 10 years ago, this August, he took his life. Who would ever think that a person who's so funny, so connected to us all, would do that to himself? So, now, we turn to this case. And when we look and we evaluate this case, what do we see? We see the fact that we had a family that seemed to be normal. I show you the Facebook postings of the family where they just saw a child with his parents having fun. As we look at that and as you absorb that, that's a family that is apparently normal. Seemingly, everything was okay, but it wasn't. And then we get to the issue of the parents being on notice. Notice of what? Of a child who may have written things in a journal but didn't tell them, didn't convey the issues he was having with them.

We also know that they had a target in the home and we would acknowledge and admit that as we see.Let's take a look at the actual target that they had in the home. The reality is that the purpose of having the weapon is it was a hobby of the family. The Second Amendment protects that. But if you look at what happened with the school, the school apparently was concerned because of this drawing and in light of the fact they call the mom. The mom goes to the school, and the school says that they don't have reasonable suspicion to check the bag. You can call the mother and the father to come to the school because you're concerned about a drawing with a gun, but the school doesn't look into the bag and instead hands it back. What are we dealing with when we have that level of negligence upon the school with respect to their responsibility? So, at the end of the day, I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to look at the gun in totality. If the school would have done its job, we wouldn't be here. COATES:  I want to turn back to the jury on this important point. They've raised two really compelling arguments.

And to be honest, I think that I am very sympathetic towards the people who worked at the school.Yes, it does seem like there were some things that maybe they could have done more, but we know that the counselor had that meeting with the mom because of the drawing that her son did. And if the mom decided to completely brush it off, when I used to have meetings with my students and their parents, and if I had a disagreement with the parents about what kind of course of action the students should take, I always defer to the parents' judgment, because no matter how much I cared about their student or how well I thought I knew them, I would never go so far as to assume that I knew a student or cared about them more than their parent did. And so, the fact that the school deferred to the parents' judgment, I think that most of the time, that is what you should do, and I don't think that's their fault.",

You know, who's to say that these guns weren't out before in days previous, you know, many nights and days, right?
