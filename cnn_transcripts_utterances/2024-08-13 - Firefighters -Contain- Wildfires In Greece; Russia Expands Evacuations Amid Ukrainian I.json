We are normallybroadcast out of our Middle East hub in Abu Dhabi, and I've got some reporting just into CNN. Sources tell me, Gaza ceasefire talks are not expected to thwart Iranian retaliation towards Israel. More on that coming up also this hour. Ukraine expands its incursion into Russia. This video shows more troops moving towards the Russian border. And this is the trail of destruction left by wildfires in Greece. Firefighters say, they have now managed to contain the blaze, plus Elon Musk platforms Former President Donald Trump for some 1.3 million live listeners. A look at how Social media has fundamentally changed U.S. Politics. Our top of story this hour, Russian officials are urging more residents southwest of Kursk to evacuate the area as Ukrainian troops push forward into Russia. A Ukrainian military chief says, they are gaining more ground, more than a week into what was their surprise attack on President Vladimir Putin and his military. Now, this is Kyiv's biggest incursion into Russia since the start of the war. This video just into CNN appears to show more Ukrainian forces ramping up in Ukraine's Sumy region. And here's a closer look at the volatile region near that border. Ukraine's Sumy region is in blue. Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions are colored in yellow. This is the critical area where Ukrainian troops are crossing over into Russia. CNN's Fred Pleitgen in is following this story for us from Berlin. What do you make of what we are seeing happening on the ground, and why?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think one of the things that you just said is absolutely correct. This is an absolutely critical area,both for the Ukrainians and for the Russians. In fact, the Ukrainians were, for a long time, expecting the Russians to amount an offensive from the Kursk region into the Sumy region, to try and go south and push south from there. It appears as though the Ukrainians have been a lot faster than the Russians in mounting such a thing. I think one of the things that's also worth pointing out, Becky, you just showed us that video of the Ukrainians amassing on the border in the Sumy region. They apparently managed to do that completely in secret. Even Ukraine's allies seem to have absolutely no clue this was happening. They took their allies by surprise. Obviously, took the Russians by surprise as well. Now, one of the things that we are indeed hearing from the Ukrainians is that their forces, they say, are pushing on and are trying to gain more ground. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Ukrainian troops sweeping through Russian territory. Dear Ukrainians, this soldier starts, and then, says his forces went into a Russian supermarket, but that Ukrainian stores have a better selection. Videos released of several areas inside Russia showing Ukraine soldiers taking down Russian flags and raising Ukraine. And while the Kremlin claims its forces have held up Ukraine's advances in some areas, posting videos of bombed out alleged Ukrainian vehicles, the numbers the Kremlin does admit are staggering. Almost 30 villages under Ukrainian control, more than 120,000 Russian civilians evacuated in the Kursk region alone and more under evacuation orders in Belgorod region to the south. Russian President, Vladimir Putin irate, vowing to respond while ripping into Ukraine and its Western allies. VLADMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (Interpreted): It appears that the enemy, with the help of his Western masters, is fulfilling their will, and the West is fighting us with the hands of the Ukrainians. So, it looks like the enemy is seeking to improve its negotiating position for the future. The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response, and all our objectives will undoubtedly be achieved. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): All this as Russia and Ukraine blame each other for what appears to be a major fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, an area under Russian control. So far, no increased radiation levels have been detected. Kyiv has published little information about its offensive into Russian territory, but Ukraine's President justifying the incursion.",

Whatever elsehappens, it has busted the assumption that Ukraine is on the back foot, that it can't regain the initiative. But, I will say this, it is still -- we mustn't lose sight of this, losing ground in Donetsk province in eastern Ukraine. In fact, in the last couple of days, we've seen Russian forces move to within 15 kilometers or so of a very important town in the east of Ukraine called, Pokrovsk. And I say this not to take away from Ukraine's remarkable achievements in, inside Russia, in the last week, but to point out that these are all trade-offs. These have come at a cost. And so, Ukraine has changed that narrative, but it must be very careful that the result isn't a loss of territory inside its own soil, and what ultimately could turn out to be heavy losses inside Russia as well. It's got to consolidate these gains and understand the right time to pull back and the right time to cash in the chips that it's gained in the last five days.",

I mean, there is more coming into Ukraine from both thewest and very specifically, from the U.S. In a recent piece in your publication, The Economist, it was written that the delivery of the F-16 can be seen as a morale boost rather than a strategic game changer, right, but with numbers building up slowly, it may take time before the F-16s can have much impact. A recent report by the CSIS and other Think Tank argues that Ukraine needs many more aircraft than have so far been promised. With two and a half years into this war, the U.S. in particular, is seeing pushback domestically for its support. Does Ukraine -- are we seeing, at this stage, evidence that Ukraine feels more empowered, and with this new equipment, can be projecting more strength going forward?

I know that some peoplewould want to see these new systems coming in and offering some kind of decisive change on the battlefield, but in truth, the F-16s ought to be seen as a long-term replacement for Ukraine's aging and depleted fleet of Soviet-designed aircraft MiGs and Sukhois. The fact of the matter is, these F-16s are not going to be flying American- style over the front lines swooping over Russian troops. I think what they're going to be doing in the main in the first months of their existence, at least, is to be providing air defense over Ukraine against Russian drones and missiles. They'll be sitting back tens of kilometers away from the front line shooting down these Iranian made drones and other cruise missiles coming in over the border. And that's a very valuable mission. But let's make no mistake, it doesn't mean they're going to be providing air cover right on the edge of the border, allowing Ukrainians to stream into Russia again. We've really got to keep expectations in check of what these planes can achieve.",

And so, you could see this kind of operation as a way of pre-empting some of that, and saying that, first of all, Ukraine still has options. And second of all, that simply freezing the lines as they are is not an acceptable solution, because, look, Ukraine is in charge of Russian soil as well. So, this is, I think, absolutely a way for Ukraine to say, it can strengthen its hand in any talks that occur. But to come back to that point at the beginning, Becky, that only works if Ukraine's gambit pays off. We are about a week into this. Ukraine's been fantastically successful. It's caused chaos. It's humiliated Putin. But, in order to bank that, in order to translate that into political gains of the kind we're discussing in future talks, it has to show that it can either stay on that territory or withdraw with the bulk of its forces intact, and without costing itself too much in terms of lost territory in Donbas. So, all of those things have to happen over the coming days, and that's what I'll be watching for very closely.",

Now, of course, America has a remarkable intelligence collectionapparatus that will have seen some anomalous movements along the border in Kursk, inside Ukraine, but Ukraine, from what I and my colleagues understand, practiced some very impressive operational secrecy. Senior commanders in Ukraine were told of his operation very, very close to the beginning of the operation. Junior soldiers were told immediately as it began, and they were not told of specific aims and objectives, only that they would be entering Russia. Equipment was hidden inside the foliage of the border areas to avoid Russian satellites and reconnaissance drones. And I think one of the lessons Ukraine has learned from that failed counter-offensive last year is that secrecy and surprise are absolutely essential if ground force is going to be able to move and maneuver without being spotted, detected and struck.",

But that, frankly, is the least of our worries at this point in terms of whether or not those talks will happen because of that potential for regional escalation that you were just mentioning. The key question now, as we are, you know about 40 hour -- 48 hours away from those potential discussions in either Doha, Qatar, or in Cairo, Egypt, talks that both the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have framed as critical to trying to finalize a cease fire agreement. The real concern is whether that Iranian retaliation that they have been promising for nearly two weeks now, whether or not it will actually materialize before those talks can happen, and should that retaliation happen. Will it be significant enough to trigger regional escalation? Will it be significant enough to knock those talks off the calendar on Thursday? The United States, yesterday, we heard from John Kirby, the National Security Council Spokesman, who shared the Israeli assessment that an Iranian attack appears to be likely to come in a matter of days. He noted that the U.S.'s expectation is that they will go to these negotiations on Thursday, but he did acknowledge the possibility that that Iranian retaliation could potentially knock those talks off the calendar. So, this is an incredibly tense moment in the region because of the threat of that Iranian retaliation, because of the threat of what it could mean for this region at large, and also because it could stymie potential progress in those cease fire negotiations, which is, of course, much needed at this moment in the region.",

But, there have been events, over the course of years, where violations of that status quo have led to escalations in tensions. And today on, what is a Jewish holiday, the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av, of which is a morning holiday meant to commemorate the destruction of the first and second holy Jewish Temple in -- on that site. National Security Minister, IItamar Ben-Gvir, not only going to the Temple Mount, but also bringing several thousands Jewish worshipers who appear to be praying at that site in violation of that status quo agreement. And in addition to that, Ben-Gvir said, that it is our policy, quote, to allow prayer from Jews on that site. And that, obviously, marks a violation of that status quo, one that was not only acknowledged and outraged by the Palestinian authority, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, but also by the Israeli Prime Minister's office itself, which said that Israel's policy on the Temple Mount has not changed, and said that Ben-Gvir's visit was a deviation from the status quo. And so, it is being pretty widely condemned this visit by Ben-Gvir in Israeli politics, in particular, because there is such an acknowledgement, and there is such an understanding that we are already at this kind of boiling point in the region, and a visit like this that is intended and clearly viewed as being provocative is certainly not helping to calm things down.

That's a fairly easy argument to make, so it's slightly mystifying in the way that Trump hasn't been able to make it. I thought it was very interesting though.

Well, Vice President, Kamala Harris will deliver her first economic policy speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday, her campaign says, she will focus on her plan to lower costs for middle-class families. It comes as Harris has been hitting the trail, of course, in the battleground states, reintroducing herself to voters since ascending to the top of that Democratic ticket.

And the numbers are staggering, as you said. They predict that by 2050 deaths from cancer among men worldwide will nearly double, go up 93 percent to more than 10 million. Cases are expected to go up 84 percent to 19 million. They're going to be even more pronounced in men over the age of 65 that increase in deaths from cancer. Now, a lot of this is driven by population growth, particularly population growth among the aging population, and the rise is going to be even more pronounced in lower income countries. As I mentioned, we already know that men are more likely both to get cancer and to die from cancer, and that's for a few reasons. One is, they're more likely to smoke and to drink alcohol. They're more likely to have jobs that expose them to carcinogens in the workplace, and they're less likely to get cancer screenings. Now, in terms of the types of cancer that the researchers are watching here, lung cancer is expected to continue to be the top cause both of getting cancer and dying from cancer for men in 2050, and if you look at the smoking rates, more than 30 percent of men worldwide smoke compared with less than 10 percent of women. The largest increase in cases by 2050 is expected to be from mesothelioma, which is a cancer that's associated with asbestos exposure.

The skeletons of a man anda woman were discovered in a villa buried in a volcanic eruption almost 2,000 years ago. It's thought that they were trying to seek refuge there. The woman had gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as jewelry, with thousands of people in the once thriving city, caught off guard and suddenly buried when Mount Vesuvius exploded back in the year 79 AD. Well, a Bosnian businessman has taken one of Vincent Van Gogh's most famous paintings and turned it into a nature park. It's a sprawling natural recreation of Van Gogh's The Starry Night in the town of Visoko. The man behind the park says it is an idea that he has been working on for 20 years. He's used different shades of lavender bushes, herbs and water features to emulate the colors and the textures in the painting. The park will focus on art programs and promoting central Bosnia's cultural heritage. Isn't that fabulous? And while tourists may be throwing one, two or even three coins into Rome's famed Trevi Fountain, there is an ancient feat of engineering rushing below as they wish. We sent CNN Ben Wedeman deep underground in Rome to find out more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For centuries, cool, crystal clear water has cascaded from Rome's Trevi Fountain, once a vital source of water for residents, now a must-see for tourists flocking to the Eternal City. Most perhaps unaware that this masterpiece of Baroque art is fed by an ancient aqueduct. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): The secret lies far below, down a corkscrew staircase 25 meters or more than 80-feet below the surface, to an underground aqueduct, the Romans called Aqua Virgo, Virgin water. Some Roman historians say the name came from a young woman who showed parched Roman soldiers where water bubbled to the surface east of the city. We wade through those waters with Marco (inaudible), whose job is to make sure Rome's aqueducts continue to flow. In Roman times, he tells me the water was much higher, designed to bring as much water as possible to Rome. At its height, ancient Rome had more than a million thirsty inhabitants.",

Today, its waters feed the Trevi and other fountains, and irrigate many of Rome's parks. It's the task of Acea, Rome's water and electricity authority to prevent harm to the monuments that make this city unique. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): We have a variety of treatments to eliminate salts and calcium to make the water as neutral as possible to avoid damaging the fountain Marco says.
