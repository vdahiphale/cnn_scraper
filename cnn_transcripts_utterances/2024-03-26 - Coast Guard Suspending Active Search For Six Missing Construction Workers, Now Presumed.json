Forty-two percent of all bridges are at least 50 years old.And so experts say, once again, this is an opportunity not only to take a look at protection for bridges, whether it'd be in the water, but also maybe that means updating them as well in terms of their infrastructure.",

So conditions are getting worse out here tonight. With our second camera, you can kind of see the boat - the ship behind me. It's partially illuminated by its own lighting there, but there are still rescue and recovery boats all around the Dali, the name of the tanker, the container ship that crashed into the bridge just over my right shoulder there.All day long, we've been seeing that kind of activity, rescue recovery boats buzzing all around the point of impact. You could see the tangled metal and the concrete from the supports draped over the bow of the vessel. They're still there. What we were told this morning as we deployed out into the water was I spoke to a marine construction official here who's going to be part of the salvaging and reconstruction efforts. He said it's going to take days just to get the heavy equipment they need to get in place here to begin the process of just taking apart the remnants of the bridge. They're going to have to cut those big remnants into smaller pieces just in order to remove them. That's going to take floating cranes and a lot of other heavy equipment just to do all that. It's going to take several days just to get that equipment in place. So it kind of gives you an idea of just the logistical challenge that's going to be involved in salvaging and removing all of this wreckage from the water. And, as Pete mentioned, a dangerous job. I mean, a lot of this - a lot of the wreckage is still underwater, getting to it and getting it pulled out is going to be very dangerous. They have suspended the rescue operations, not believing they're going to find any of those six individuals alive. But then comes the very challenging task of trying to get this boat moved and it's unclear when that's going to be, whether they're going to have to remove a lot of the containers from the vessel in order to move it. And then, of course, as we've just mentioned, trying to remove the remnants of this bridge in order to get reconstruction going again and to get this port operational again, Anderson.

Water depths in and around or under that bridge vary from 40 feet in some places to in excess of 60 feet.So as you go deeper, the divers are exposed to colder temperatures. They have zero viz and as you look at a lot of the photographs, especially what you have on scene, imagine what you're seeing there also being the case underwater. So there's a lot of steel underwater. There's bridge deck underwater. There are a lot of hazards down there. And we'll reach depths where the divers are literally feeling their way around.

So hopefully there - and I think the chief alluded to it, they are going to map this out the best they can using technology like side-scan sonar, because the key to a successful search or recovery is to narrow down that area to the best you can before you put divers in, because the last thing you want is your recovery to turn back into a rescue mission after one of these divers.

But again, that's why these guys get paid the big bucks. They're going to be fine with the temperature. The depths are not extreme, 40 to 60 feet. That's very workable. But it's so unstable.

In a December statement, Combs responded to the claims in all the lawsuits, saying, \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\" Cassie's attorney responding to Monday's searches and the investigation. \"Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that will hold Mr. Combs responsible for his depraved conduct.\" Another lawsuit filed in February by a former employee, producer Rodney Jones, who goes by the stage name Lil Rod, accusing Combs of, among other things, sexual assault. The musician was not at either home at the time of Monday's searches by federal agents. His whereabouts are still unknown. (END VIDEOTAPE) CAMPBELL (on-camera): Anderson, we're learning that a member of Combs Inner Circle was arrested yesterday. 25-year-old Brendan Paul was taken into custody on drug charges. Authorities alleged that he had cocaine in a personal bag. He was arrested at a Miami airport. That was happening while federal agents were at Combs home. Now we're attempting to reach out to him for comment. He was in lockup overnight, but has since been bonded out. But this does raise interesting questions about who else in Combs orbit may find themselves in legal jeopardy, depending on what federal agents found yesterday. Again, no criminal charges yet against anyone related to those searches. But the agents who were doing those searches, as we've been discussing, their focus is on human trafficking, which of course is a very serious crime.
