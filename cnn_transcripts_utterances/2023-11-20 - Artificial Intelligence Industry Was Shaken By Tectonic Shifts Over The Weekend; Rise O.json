Tonight, on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, what happened over the last few days could actually change the shape of the future. For you? For me? I mean for everybody, really. You've heard about this guy named Sam Altman, right? The leader of one of the world's most influential artificial intelligence companies who was suddenly fired over the weekend in a move that pretty much nobody had seen on their bingo card. Altman is the leader of OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, and was suddenly out of the company. Now, it was somewhat mysterious, and they said he was fired over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. Whatever that means and pertaining to what specific thing, we just don't know. But just two days later, Altman was hired by Microsoft, where he could be even more powerful to run a brand-new division with all the many, many, well, all the resources of one of the world's biggest tech companies. But the saga might not actually be over because employees at OpenAI, they're not pleased. They are threatening to head for the exit en masse if Altman is not brought back. And this is not your average business story about one wealthy guy going to a different company to be even wealthier. This is really about technology. It has implications for the future of our humanity. I'm not really overstating it either. In a moment, I'm going to talk to Kara Swisher, who knows this story inside and out and just talk to the Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, who hired Altman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SATYA NEDELLA, CEO, MICROSOFT (voice-over): Every technology ever invented was both a tool and a weapon.

Sort of like the first internet company, the first email company, whatever. And they -- like Google or something like that. And so, a lot of people felt like under Sam's leadership, things were going well, but the board did not and fired him quite suddenly. I think everybody was surprised, including Microsoft, which owns 49% of OpenAI.

And so, we'll see what happens.But it's really -- they call it alignment issues and it was very unspecific. And so, you know, if you get fired and they're just saying it's an alignment issue and then had never told you about it or warned you about it -- there was definitely tensions between the board and Sam, but it's not specific, and it's a very non-transparent board that will not say what they did.

It's unclear that other companies could come in, I guess, or the founders could find other ways to fund it.But the money required here and the computing power is vast and that's why OpenAI hooked up with Microsoft. Now, others didn't like that. Elon Musk was one of the original founders of OpenAI. He left. Sort of in a huff about it. Created his own company called Grok. You know, he could come in here in some way. Some other people could. Anything could happen.

The Eighth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals brushing aside decades, literally decades of precedent, on who can bring cases over discrimination based on race, potentially hobbling Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The court ruling now that only the DOJ itself can bring lawsuits, even though challenges brought by groups like the NAACP and the ACLU have been pivotal in protecting access to the ballot over time. The case at issue centers on a challenge brought by the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel to the state's House map, arguing it did not give Black voters enough representation. Now, Arkansas is one of seven states immediately impacted by today's ruling. Joining me now to discuss is the mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas, Frank Scott Jr. Mayor, thank you for joining us today. I mean, we're less than a year away from a presidential election. We obviously have the census data that was used to try to establish more maps for greater representation. And now you have this, private litigants who cannot bring cases under Section 2. What is your reaction to this? MAYOR FRANK SCOTT, JR., LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS: It's a clear bad decision as it relates to public policy, overall progressiveness within these United States of America. Little Rock stands at the crossroad of civil rights, as you understand. We were the first to help test the Brown vs. Board of Education as it relates to educational civil rights. And here again, we find ourselves at the same crossroad again as it relates to the dilution of minority voters within the state of Arkansas. Very grateful for the descending vote by Judge Smith, and what he shared was right. It takes private residents and citizens to stand up for themselves and not to solely wait on the protection of its government agents.",

Mayor, listen to this. He said -- quote -- \"Over the past 40 years, there have been at least 182 successful Section 2 cases. And of those 182 cases, only 15 were brought solely by the attorney general.\" And so, if that means 15 out of 182, I won't do the math at 11 o'clock at night, but that means that there was a lot of success in spite of and instead of the DOJ.

We have to rely upon also the private citizens for right of action. And that's the hallmark of the pillars that built the wall of civil rights.
