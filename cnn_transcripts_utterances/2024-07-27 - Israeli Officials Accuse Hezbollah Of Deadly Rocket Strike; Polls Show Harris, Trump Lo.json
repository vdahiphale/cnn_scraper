I'm Jessica Dean in New York and we begin with breaking news out of the Middle East.The Israeli army calling it the deadliest strike on Israeli civilians since October 7th. Officials say at least 10 people were killed by rockets fired from Lebanon. It's the biggest escalation yet in what has been a simmering conflict across Israel's northern border. Officials say the rockets struck a football pitch in the Golan Heights, a contested territory going back several decades now. Journalist Elliott Gotkine is joining us now, and Elliott, Hezbollah has denied anything to do with this attack, which did kill children. Israel not convinced by that. What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Jessica, since Hezbollah started firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas on October 8th, Israel says that it's fired more than 5,000 projectiles towards Israel. And so it's supposed understandable that Israel would make Hezbollah the prime suspect. Indeed, Israel says that the rocket that killed the teens and young adults, and the death toll now seems to be 11 according to Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the IDF, that that came from a village called Chebaa in southern Lebanon.It's about a couple of kilometers north of the border. And according to what Israel describes as reliable intelligence information, Hezbollah was behind it. And as you say, this was, according to Israel, the deadliest strike on innocent civilians inside of Israel since October 7th. And I suppose the big question now is what will the response from Israel be? And then what would Hezbollah's response be to that? We've already heard from Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, saying in his words that we are approaching the moment of all-out war in the north against Hezbollah. And certainly there are some of the more right-wing members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition demanding that Israel now go to all-out war with Hezbollah. But certainly that has not happened thus far. It's been almost 10 months and counting and it's clear if this is what is going to move what's been a simmering conflict into one that boils over. So certainly we will now be awaiting the response from Israel to this attack -- Jessica.",

And as you say, talks set to resume on Sunday. I don't think this attack on Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights is going to impact those talks.They're due to resume in Rome with Bill Burns, the CIA director, and his counterparts from Israel, Qatar, and Egypt, attending as well. It seems there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved. Everything from the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be freed from Israeli jails in relation to the number of hostages being freed by Hamas, to the kinds of prisoners that Israel would release, whether Israel would have some kind of a veto on those particular prisoners, and also whether Israel would still be able to remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor, which is the border between Rafah and Egypt, which Israel has thus far been insisting, it must control to prevent weapons from being smuggled from Egypt towards Hamas. So there are still a number of issues to be resolved. And I was just checking back on my notes before and I see that as long as it was February when if you recall President Biden in Michigan when he was campaigning chomping on an ice cream and saying, he hoped for a hostage deal to be done by that weekend. We are now several months further down the line, still no sign of that deal being done. There is some optimism that we are inching closer, but we've been here so many times before it's I'm afraid pays to be cautious and certainly a lot more things need to be resolved before that deal can get over the line -- Jessica.",

And it's an interesting argument because he is someone who's actually been very critical of cryptocurrency in the past. He has likened it to a scam. He has said it was not money. He said that the dollar is the actual currency of the world, not cryptocurrency. And yet he has just taken the stage here behind me where he is trying to convince this crowd, trying to win over this audience.

GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Very concerning. It really is. And, you know, absolutely Israel has the right to defend itself. But, you know, I've always been worried. This is what I've been worried about and why I thought that we needed to get a ceasefire as quickly as possible in Gaza because the biggest headache was in with Lebanon in the northern border of Israel. I'm very concerned about a war escalating there, which would lead to thousands of innocent Israeli and Lebanese citizens dying possibly in another war there. I've been trying to know that the United States had several individuals over and tried to try to negotiate to prevent any escalation from there. Brett McGurk, (INAUDIBLE), as well as Secretary Burns of the CIA, I hope that they could intertwine and there's some kind of negotiations to take place. But it's very concerning and very upsetting.",

And Dressel is now going to be taken home his eighth Olympic gold of his career. He's never won any other color of medal and will have more opportunities to do so. Snoop Dogg was in the stands alongside Dressel's wife, Meghan, and their baby boy, August. Now that is a memory of a lifetime.

And the defending Olympic champ, Australian Ariarne Titmus, the so- called Terminator from Australia, ending her crown in dominant fashion, winning gold by about a full bodies length in a time of 3:57.49 seconds. McIntosh took the silver, Ledecky, the bronze. Team USA snagged their first medal of these games earlier in the day, thanks to Sarah Bacon and Cassidy Cook, who won silver in the women's diving synchronized three-meter springboard competition. It's the first Olympic medals for both divers and the first American medal won in the event since 2012. Cassidy Cook, Sarah Bacon, longtime friends. Their nickname is Cooking Bacon.
