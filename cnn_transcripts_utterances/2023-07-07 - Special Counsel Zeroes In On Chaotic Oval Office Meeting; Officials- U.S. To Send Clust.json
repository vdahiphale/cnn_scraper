And undoubtedly, this meeting in the White House was dramatic, outrageous, bananas. Choose your word here. Here's what prosecutors would have to show in order to charge this as a crime.First of all, that any of the people in the room, especially the lawyers, understood that the plans of action that they were offering were not legal, were not constitutional, and they knew that in good faith. And second of all, you'd have to show that the objective here, what they were trying to do, was something illegal. So that could be a couple of things. One, if they're trying to block or delay the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, that would do it. And second of all, more broadly, if they're trying to defraud the United States of a free and fair election, then that would be criminal.

And a few even said he acknowledged, he knew that he lost the election. Those are very important pieces of testimony. So if you can piece that together and make the same showing as to Donald Trump that he knew that this was illegal, he was somehow conspiring or collaborating with some of the lawyers in the room and he had an illegal objective, then you can charge a crime.But as you can see, John, I think the point of this is not cut and dry.

And for the first time, it's expected to include a controversial weapon banned by most countries. We're talking about cluster munitions, and they're canisters, that when -- that carry dozens, even hundreds of smaller bombs or submunitions that then scatter along a wide area of a target. The U.S. no longer uses them, but the government has a stockpile, and Ukraine has been requesting the help as part of their counter offensive against Russian forces. CNN's Jim Sciutto has more on this, he's joining us now. It's good to see you, Jim. So Ukraine has been requesting these bombs to help them on the battlefield. Talk us through the functions of cluster munitions first.JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, let's be direct here. It's a devastating weapon, and it's anti- personnel weapon, which means it's designed to kill soldiers on the battlefield. That's really part of the intention here. And the U.S. and its partners would not be sending this weapon to Ukraine if they didn't believe there was a need for it. Perfectly reasonable debate as to whether that need counteracts the other dangers. But they believe there's a need. And the reason they believe there's a need, Kate, is because the Russians are so well dug in to these defensive positions in eastern Ukraine. Multiple lines of trenches, minefields, and so on. And it's hard to break through those lines. And that's one reason why we've seen slower progress than many Western assessments expected in this Ukrainian counter offensive. So to help Ukraine break those lines, that's what this weapon is about here. It's a devastating weapon. It might be essential to Ukrainian forces as they make these moves, or attempt to, but it raises a lot of other questions, frankly. BOLDUAN: It absolutely does. And the Pentagon is facing tough questions about this. We've heard, you know, we've heard the Pentagon spokesperson kind of fielding those questions. How does the United States mitigate the dangers when we know one of the dangers is we've seen evidence of it, Jim, is that particularly children can face grievous injury years later when they come across these things.",

And there were fears at the time, I expressed them myself that working women might be set back a generation as a result of these kinds of disruptions that we saw in 2020.And yet somehow, American working women have emerged stronger than ever before, at least financially, coming out of this pandemic, and it's not exactly clear why. I think it's some combination of a more highly educated workforce and women with college degrees are more likely to be working than those without college degrees. And we see a shift in the demographics there. It's also the rise of remote work, I think, which, again, disproportionately benefits people with college degrees. Whatever the possible explanation behind this, I think this is actually a great story to celebrate. Women are more than punching above their weight in terms of holding jobs and applying for jobs. Men, on the other hand, a different story. They still haven't recovered the ground lost early in the pandemic. But women are doing quite well in the labor market.",
