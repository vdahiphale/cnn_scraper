      "sentences": "We are starting this hour with breaking news out of the Supreme Court, special counsel Jack Smith now responding to Donald Trump's legal team about the federal elections case, the special counsel pushing the High Court even more now to take this matter up quickly.Let's get right over to CNN's Joan Biskupic. She has all the details that truly are just coming in right now. Joan, what are you picking up?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jack Smith, the special counsel in the Donald Trump election subversion case, has just submitted another filing to the Supreme Court, doubling down on the imperative to the Supreme Court to take up this case now, rather than wait for another court to handle it.The question is whether former President Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for election subversion arising from the 2020 election right as we head into the 2024 election. And what he's trying to do here, special counsel Jack Smith, is counter what Donald Trump's lawyers said yesterday. They said, Supreme Court, there is no need to take this case up hastily. Let it go to a federal appellate court first, which is, Kate, the normal processes. It's -- yesterday, Trump's lawyers said that Jack Smith had not made a sufficient case on this. But, today, in this 11-page filing, special counsel Jack Smith tries to reinforce how the rule of law is at issue, how Donald Trump's actions back in 2020 need to be resolved. And here is a line from that, Kate. \"Enforcing federal criminal laws that prohibit such conduct\" -- this is related to election subversion -- \"is vital to protecting our constitutional processes and democracy itself.\" What he has stressed in his initial filing, Kate, was how much America's rule of law and the democratic order depend on the court resolving this issue of whether the former president can be tried at all, needs to be resolved, as I say, sooner rather than later. And just to remind our viewers, a trial judge earlier had said that Donald Trump should not be immune from criminal prosecution. Donald Trump is appealing that. He is appealing that. He wants courts to intervene, but he does not want the Supreme Court to hear it until a lower court hears it, in part because for -- he wants it on the legal side to go through the normal processes. But, frankly, as a political strategy, it could also mean delay and delay until we're really smack in the middle of the 2024 election cycle, if not having the 2024 election behind us. So the Supreme Court now has everything in front of it that it needs to decide, should it take it up and expedite this case so that the nation has an answer to whether former President Donald Trump is immune from trial, or will it say that this is an issue that should remain in the lower court, and it will be months, Kate, until we get a final answer from the Supreme Court, which is the only bench that can finally and definitively answer this question.",

Trump's team in their filing that we just also just got overnight, his team argued that the case should -- quote -- be -- should be -- quote -- \"resolved in a cautious, deliberative manner, not at breakneck speed.\"And you can see, obviously, the two completely opposing takes on this, which one would not be surprised at. Is it unusual, Joan? This is the first ask from the special counsel that the Supreme Court take this up in an expedited way. Then you have the response from Donald Trump's legal team saying, no, stay out of it for now, please. And now you have the special counsel coming back again. The response to the response, is this unusual?",

      "sentences": "Well, no, and actually, Kate, let me just say -- I'm so glad you asked that, because I will give you a little P.S. on why this is kind of intriguing.Normally, that's how things happen with cases. You have the initial petition, you have a response, and then you have a reply. But Jack Smith, in his initial petition, said, I will waive my right to a reply. He was waiving his time period for filing like in a couple weeks. He said, I don't need that. I want you, Supreme Court, to decide this right now. Let us know if you're going to intervene. You will have all the filings as of last night. But what he did is, knowing that the court had not yet given an order, he dropped us in before lunchtime today, saying, P.S., consider this also. It's 11 pages. He had every right to do it, but I think what he tried to do was counter, again, what Donald Trump's lawyers were saying, just as you so properly stated, that what Trump's lawyers are saying, look, there is a process for this, and the process involves going to an appellate court first. Do not do this hastily. Do not do it at breakneck speed, using their word there, Kate. But what Jack Smith has come back -- and, again, I should stress that Jack Smith is speaking on behalf of the United States government, the Department of Justice, saying, no, the kind of conduct at issue here needs to be put to trial, and it needs to be put to trial as soon as possible. And right now, everything's been on hold because Donald Trump is saying he cannot be tried because he should enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution. He says that these actions that are in dispute occurred as part of his official work when he was president back in 2020. And Jack Smith is saying, no, that cannot be that he should be shielded. And this has never been tested, Kate, the question of whether a former president or even a sitting president should be immune from a criminal prosecution. And he's asking for complete immunity here. It's a very big question. And, as I say, only the U.S. Supreme Court can answer that definitively.",

I want to read really quickly just a little bit of what Jack Smith told the justices in court papers, because I think this really hits up the crux of things. \"The public interest in a prompt resolution in this case favors an immediate, definitive decision by this court. The charges here are of the utmost gravity.\" You have been following this case as it's been going through the trial proceedings or the case proceedings up to this point. Is this as urgent as you have seen things? And to sort of piggyback off of what Kate said, is it unusual to see another filing on top of or after the defense filing, when we would, in theory, be awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court?",

And so the Supreme Court could do what they want.Now, I will leave it to Joan to be more of a prognosticator on exactly when the justices might take some action this. But it is before them. The Justice Department has made their arguments twice now as to why this case should be taken very quickly and resolved. And the other thing about timing here is, they point out in this filing that not only do they want the justice -- or the Supreme Court to take this case quickly; they want them to take it quickly so that it can be resolved this term of the Supreme Court, which would theoretically end in July or beginning of summer. And so that shows you they want this to be maybe not resolved by March 1, but they definitely want the Supreme Court to be addressing it before the end of the term.",

They're dealing with this by phone, by memo, trying to figure out what's the best way forward. I'm sure it's not going to be an easy 9-0 decision here, frankly, because this court is not 9-0 on most issues anymore. And -- but I would expect, by the end of tomorrow, before the holiday weekend, that they would decide it. And if they don't, that shows you how much they're struggling with it., and we wouldn't get something until next week or soon into the new year.

This was just from moments ago. You can see what looks like police, rescue teams, emergency crews searching the balcony of a building. This is near and around where we'd seen a lot of activity with emergency vehicles. You can see them with their flashlights on the balconies there. This clearly is still an unfolding scene. We have also learned from Prague emergency services that 10 people were killed and 30 people were wounded in this shooting. Police say the gunman has also been killed. Now let's get over to CNN's Melissa Bell. She's gathering more details that are coming in. Still early hours, still unfolding, Melissa, but what more are you learning?",

As you said, Kate, they're looking for what weapons, what else might have been hidden there. We know that the shooter himself has been killed, eliminated. We'd heard initially killed, now we have had confirmed to CNN by police sources. We know nothing of who he is, what his motives may have been for the time being, but clearly extremely troubling scenes there in Prague. Dusk is just falling, night is falling. And you can see the entire perimeter of that university, Charles University, in the very center of Prague, that has been completely cordoned off. This, Kate, is an extremely busy tourist center within the very center of Prague, just opposite Prague Castle, a busy campus as well. And what we have begun to see over the course of the last hour is stills coming in as well while this was still an active shooting scene of some of the students who climbed out of windows to hide on windowsills away from him, so extremely violent scenes that went on for a while, 10 dead, 30 wounded. I think it's important to remind our viewers that these sorts of shootings are exceedingly rare here in Europe. We are not in the habit of having regular mass shootings. They simply don't happen terribly often, so very shocking scenes. We await more on what might have driven this person, the perpetrator, to carry out these killings. We don't know whether he was a student. We don't know whether he was Czech. We know nothing about him at all. But he has managed to kill 10 people, wounding 30 others, so extremely violent scenes there at Prague university until the police could take him out, Kate.",

In this situation, Trump, of course, and his legal team is asking the High Court to stay out, to not intervene, just as his team is also likely to ask the very same Supreme Court to soon intervene in another case he is now up against, the case coming out of the Colorado Supreme Court removing him from the presidential ballot.
