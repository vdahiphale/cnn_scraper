Hello, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. The president calling it his greatest service to this country in this position and his connection to the military, obviously, comes to the fore. His son, Beau, served in the Armed Forces for more than a decade, including a tour of duty in Iraq. Kevin Liptak has been listening to the president joins me now live in Washington. Kevin, this is always a very personal and meaningful subject for the president of the United States. Talk about what we heard today.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think it is certainly the president referencing his son, Beau. And referencing the PACTAct, which he links directly back to his son. Remember, this is a bill that the president signed that made it easier for veterans to receive care if they were exposed to toxic chemicals. And that speech his announcing an expansion of the conditions that would be included in that act. So certainly a personal moment for the president. But he also acknowledged in this speech that this would be the very last time that he stands there at the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery and delivers this kind of speech. And he says that it was the greatest honor of his life to lead you, to serve you, to care for you, and to defend you, to really acknowledging that this is a moment of transition for him as he departs office. And it was interesting he opened the speech by quoting a Lincoln second inaugural address that he delivered in April 1865, talking about the needs to bind up the nation's wounds. And President Biden returned to that sort of theme in the speech over and over, talking about the nation, you know, at an inflection point and saying that this is the moment to come together as a nation. And I think in this speech, the implication is that service to veterans and caring for veterans is something that can receive bipartisan support, even in a Trump administration. And returning to this theme that he so often talks about, that the nation hasn't always lived up to its ideals, ideals like equal under -- equality under the law. Those kind of constitutional bedrocks that he certainly was intending to run on as president and saying that we haven't walked away from them. So interesting context to that now that we know that we are in for another Trump presidency. And I think President Biden trying to both burnish his legacy when it comes to veterans' issues, but also calling for a degree of unity as we enter what is, by all accounts, something of an uncertain period of time going forward.",

Well, now to the day's other news, a flurry of announcements and reports over the past few hours is giving us a real sense of what Donald Trump's government will look like. And as you might imagine, it is filled with the people who have been his staunchest allies over the past couple years. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's aggressive stance on immigration, is expected to be named deputy White House chief of staff for policy. Now, speaking of immigration, Trump says Tom Homan will be his border czar. Homan was acting director of immigration and customs enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, Trump's first term and has talked about building a large force to carry out mass deportations. And New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has been tapped for the high- profile job of ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik rose to prominence with her forceful questioning of college presidents about anti- Semitism on campus. So, let's bring in CNN's Steve Contorno with more on the Trump transition. And, Steve, as noted, we're starting to see Trump's campaign themes and promises really take shape through these appointments to his administration.",

      "sentences": "All right. Steve Contorno, thanks so much.One of the biggest questions about Trump's incoming administration is not who he picks for big jobs, but what he does with rank-and-file government workers. Trump and his allies have looked into reclassifying thousands of seemingly routine government positions allowing Trump to fire the people in those jobs and replace them with partisans who will be loyal to his agenda. He has promised to reinstate a 2020 executive order known as Schedule F, which would give him the power to fire civil servants that he calls the deep state. By some estimates, 50,000 government employees could lose their jobs when Trump takes over. CNN's Renee Marsh has been looking into what current government employees are saying about this. Renee, what are you hearing from them? Because this has been a topic that I've heard a lot about over the course of this campaign, especially among longtime employees of the federal government who view themselves as nonpartisan. RENE MARSH, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We are in a dystopian hellscape. So that is the sort of messaging that I'm hearing from these federal employees. I got that one via text message just last night. And that is the mindset of many of the federal workers who I'm speaking to who are anticipating Donald Trump's return to office. And to be clear, Bianna, what Donald Trump is promising for federal workers is unlike anything we have seen in our lifetime. He's proposing reverting to a structure of government that existed 141 years ago, when political parties gave government jobs to their supporters. And that's what has these federal workers who I'm speaking to so anxious and so scared about this plan that we know as Schedule F, which, as you mentioned at the top, would give Trump the power to start these mass firings of nonpartisan career employees perceived as disloyal, who might get in the way of his policy actions at these agencies. But as you point out, his plan for the federal workforce is no surprise. He repeated this plan to voters on the campaign trail and called federal workers agents of the deep state working against him and his agenda. So some of these employees who lived through this first Trump administration. They say right now, they are feeling that they are experiencing PTSD. One of them saying, we are absolutely having conversations among ourselves about whether we can stomach a second round. But, Bianna, to put a finer point on this, it's not just mass firings. We also expect a second Trump presidency will mean mass transfers of these senior executives and relocation of agency offices, something that he did last term, and it forced many to retire or step away from their post. Because if you're working in Washington, D.C., and all of a sudden you're being transferred to Boulder, Colorado, that's quite a decision that you have to make. And so by default, many of those people ended up leaving.",

But as it relates to Schedule F and the fear that federal employees may have, it really is, as she said, no surprises. Trump talked about this. He talked about being a dictator from day one. He's going to have his team in place. Looks like they may proceed with recess appointments for his cabinet. So that means you're not going to have the normal hearings for new cabinet members. It may take weeks to happen, maybe some bumps in the road with a -- with a couple of them based on, you know, what their background might be. But, in fact, if the Senate's out of session, the president can just name so-and-so to take that spot, and they're in for the rest of the year. Without a hearing, without a vote of the Senate, it would be done, so that he'll have his whole team in place literally on January 20th, when he takes the oath of office, so. But I have to say, bottom line is, it is not a surprise. I mean, I don't know his new chief of staff. She has pretty high marks from the people that I've heard from, Republicans as well as Democrats, in fact. But as it relates to Tom Homan, who's going to be the new border czar, and some of the other people that he's named, they're very hardcore loyalists. I know Elise Stefanik pretty well. She was elected to the House. She served in the House when I was there. She's our new U.N. ambassador. She's going to be terrific. She's going to be talking about the American position, rallying, building a coalition of her counterparts there in New York. I think that's really an outstanding pick for him. She's going to be a strong voice. She showed that both in the leadership in the House as well as serving on Education and Workforce Committee.

Going back to some of the comments he's made recently on \"60 Minutes\" when asked what mass deportation would look like, would it include separating families? His answer was, well, families can be deported together if necessary. He went on to say there's not going to be a mass sweep of neighborhoods. He's not going to be building concentration camps. But he did say that it would entail large scale, even targeted raids at places of work and employment. Talk about the implications of that. Is that something that you would support?

I mean, it's not like willy-nilly you're going to hire 1,500 new border agents without getting an appropriation through the Congress that actually funds them that pays their paycheck. You're going to have to work legislatively to get some of these things done. So I would like to think that maybe the arrangement that James Lankford had. He's the very conservative Republican senator from Oklahoma. And he struck a deal with a lot of parties in the Senate last spring that would actually bring some bipartisan resolve to the immigration issue, including the border wall, security, a number of different things. You'll recall that President Trump said, no, I don't want that legislation because I want the issue. He had the issue. He won on the issue. And now maybe it's time to come back and see if you can't put those same players together and get a comprehensive bill that makes some sense that, frankly, I think a majority, a strong majority of the American public would support and would provide that pathway for Dreamers.

You know, there's no indication yet that this is something that Trump would support, certainly not in the very beginning of his term, with the war in Gaza still roiling and those issues being kind of a top, you know, more of a top priority. But if you look back at the Trump administration's actions in Donald Trump's first term, and you look in particular at Trump's 2020 peace plan, it's all there in terms of supporting Israel's annexation of settlements. It's a peace plan that proposes no territory swaps between an Israeli and a future Palestinian state. Instead, it would recognize Israel's annexation of those Israeli settlements as long as Israel freezes further settlement activity for four years from the date of the plan's release. Now, Netanyahu, at the time, interestingly, indicated that he was going to start the process as a result of annexing those settlements, but he ultimately shelved those plans. And that may ultimately be the kind of critical point here, is that Netanyahu, when previously presented with this opportunity, has declined to do so. Now, a lot has changed, and it's possible that this is something Netanyahu could support now. One thing is clear. Bezalel Smotrich made explicitly clear that he is taking this action because he believes that Trump will support it, because he sees what he describes as an important opportunity for Israel in the wake of a Trump victory.",

Now, this is -- this could be an operation that we see unfold in the coming days. We have seen already the Russians trying to push forward, probe, take back some of that territory without much effect. But we did hear from the top Ukrainian commander, General Syrskyi, who said that they are -- that their Ukrainian forces are keeping what he called Russia's shock troops at bay, their best forces, he says. And there's an estimated 10,000 to 11,000 North Korean forces who are backing up those Russian troops. Now, some of them are specialized, according to the Ukrainians, artillerymen, snipers. But at the end of the day, Bianna, so much of this war is impacted just by magnitude, the size of forces, bodies. And the Russians have long had more bodies than the Ukrainians, who are suffering recruitment issues. And now they're being backed up by the -- by the North Koreans. So they could provide a significant, you know, substantial defensive line behind those Russian forces as the Russians try to claw back that Kursk Region, which could prove to be very important in peace discussions, settlement negotiations, which are, frankly, all the more likely when President Trump comes into office, Bianna.",

For example, at COP26 in Scotland, there was an agreement to phase down coal. Last year in Dubai, there was an agreement to transition away from fossil fuels. You need all the big emitters on board for something like this. So I think the prospect of President-elect Trump returning to office and reneging on these key agreements could create a permission structure for the other big emitters to also soften their climate pledges And this is the year when climate change has been front and center on many people's minds.

Some of them videoed chanting anti-Arab sentiments, tearing down Palestinian flags. The Dutch police had decided to put extra people on the streets the next night, but nowhere near enough. And that's for a couple of reasons, really. What we saw overnight on Thursday were very violent attacks, hit-and-run attacks, as they were described afterwards, on individuals, not in and around the stadium. In fact, everyone sort of left in a peaceful manner. It was later, and in isolated parts of the city where Israelis were hunted down, and that's something we've heard again from the mayor of Amsterdam who's been speaking about the investigation that's ongoing. The fact that it now seems that there were WhatsApp groups, messaging groups, to help people find the Israelis and allow for these attacks. That's something that she announced the other day. So one of the questions now for the investigation will be, how long those coordinated attacks have been planned for, who was involved.
