Thick plumes of smoke was seen rising from charred buildings covering entire city blocks.And that's just one of many places where fighting has been reported.

Two years later, Ted -- a few years later, Ted Kennedy challenged Jimmy Carter, he lost. And in '92, President George H.W.

Now, we don't know exactly how far advanced Ukraine's military maneuvers are here. And there are some restrictions as to what we are allowed to tell you without ramifications.
