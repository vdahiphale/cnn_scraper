MANCHESTER:  Right. So he's talking about immigration? They're oftentimes saying that other countries dump, you know, their migrants into our country. Of course, a lot of people read that differently. You have Kamala Harris sort of spinning that, not -- not saying those words, but talking about immigration more positively saying we're sort of light in the world that while there needs to be safeguards on the immigrant process, you know, America welcomes immigrants. But, you know, those comments definitely allow the Harris campaign to really create a contrast, her campaign, sometime -- most of the time has a lot more of a positive spin on that, on -- you know, just her rhetoric in general, talking about a campaign of joy, campaign of positivity.

We're going to warm into the lower 80s for places like D.C., New York, all the way to Atlanta, of course, a cools down by the time people trigger treat after sunset, about 6:45 this evening, along parts of the East Coast. But the broader look here is just that it is so warm, we're setting record highs across the mid-Atlantic and Upstate New England, Upstate New York, I should say. But the West, that's a completely different story. So if you're out in Colorado, the great basin into the West Coast. So that's going to be a big temperature change, at least from what were experiencing on the East Coast. And you can see the progression of that cooler weather. Were dropping about 20 degrees from yesterdays daytime high in places like St. Louis so were cooling off cold front responsible for that is also sparking off a few showers and thunderstorms, some of which could be on the strong side today, across the mid-Mississippi River Valley. Here it is the latest radar. Some of this lightning associated with some thunderstorms that were severe for overnight. But the good news is many of them didn't really produce the tornadic activity that we had concerned about yesterday.
