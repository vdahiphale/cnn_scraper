Plus, motion denied twice. Two judges rejecting Donald Trump's attempts to have his trials thrown out. And the important lesson that Donald Trump says he learned from Richard Nixon. All right, 6 a.m. here in Washington and in New York as the sun rises here on the East Coast. Beautiful sunrise in New York City this morning. Good morning to you. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Happy Friday. We made it. This story this morning, President Biden demanded it, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be responding this morning. The Israelis agreeing to open the Erez Crossing to allow aid into Northern Gaza from Jordan, as well as Israel's Southern port of Ashdod. On Thursday, the president told the Israeli prime minister there will be consequences if he doesn't come up with a concrete plan for protecting civilians in Gaza. Here's what White House official John Kirby told CNN about that Thursday phone call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And frankly, aid organizations can have the measure of security that they can operate it on the ground safely, and they won't be targeted, or they won't be accidentally struck. And then lastly -- and I talked about this earlier -- we need to see a pause in the fighting. We want to see a ceasefire tied to getting the hostages out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also this morning, the IDF is expected to release its initial report on the strike that killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a short time ago, calling for an independent investigation. Our panel is here. Let's bring in Evan Osnos, staff writer for \"The New Yorker\" and Biden's biographer. Republican strategist Sarah Longwell is here. And CNN political commentator Karen Finney joins us, as well. Thank you, guys, for being here on a Friday morning. Evan, I want to start with you, because this has been very every much about Biden, the man, in his decision making around how to try and influence the Israeli prime minister to do more, especially in the wake of the killing of these seven aid workers. The World Central Kitchen workers. And we are, of course, waiting for this report we expect this morning from the IDF. How do you see what -- and how do you understand Biden's personal feelings, U.S. policy, and what we've seen as a result of this phone call, which is this claim that they are going to open more avenues for getting humanitarian aid in? EVAN OSNOS, STAFF WRITER, \"THE NEW YORKER\": Yes, it's been a pretty remarkable week. I mean, really on Monday, the attack on World Central Kitchen, on this convoy, has had a galvanizing effect on the politics of this war in a way that really almost nothing has before over the last six months. There are people who are concerned about that. They say, why is it that we have 32,000 deaths in Gaza, but it was ultimately the death of seven aid workers that changed things. But that's the nature of moral sympathy is a fickle and sometimes cruel thing. And the truth is, Joe Biden responded to this moment in a way that was different than what had happened before. And he responded, I think, partly because he sensed that this moment was ultimately different. This was a time now when Benjamin Netanyahu would acknowledge that it was so clearly the IDF's fault in this case; that this was a mistake. This was wrong, and that that was an indisputable opportunity to change the nature of how the United States was pressuring Israel. For a long time he hasn't been willing to do it. He believes there is a moment. And when you take it, then you strike and that's what Biden did now.",

But again, when you have someone like Jose Andres out there saying it, it has a much, you know, broader audience who's actually tuning in. And the second thing I'll just say briefly is I want to give credit to those Americans who had been voting -- the administration may not like this, but who'd been voting uncommitted. Because I think it also says their voices are being heard. Netanyahu is a political animal. He understands that the politics here in the United States are shifting for President Biden. And I'm sure that's part of what President Biden conveyed to him yesterday. And understanding that his own leverage and ability to kind of just let this go is very much diminishing.",

So the lead \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial this morning is critical of Biden. It says, \"Biden exploits a tragic Israeli mistake.\" They say that what -- the pressure they've been putting on is the worst thing the president could do to free the hostages, for example. They describe it as Biden taking on-- you know, taking this opportunity to address his own kind of political challenges here in the U.S. I'm really interested in how you understand this in terms of Republicans' support for Israel has been very unwavering and, frankly, Democratic support has been, too, until this war has started to unfold. But now you have President Trump. There's been some reporting that he thinks that this war should be over, because there is this kind of isolationist wing inside the Republican Party that really -- you know, they're very focused on not having Americans be involved in overseas conflicts. \"The Journal\" editorial page is kind of like the old-school conservative way of looking at the world, right?
