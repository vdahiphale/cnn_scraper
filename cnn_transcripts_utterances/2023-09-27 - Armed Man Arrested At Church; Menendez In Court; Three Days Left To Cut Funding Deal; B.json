A gun pointed at a church spire on a computer screen and a Bible on fire. Authorities say they caught the suspect while he was in a church's vestibule, ready to strike as congregants had just sat down in the pews.CNN's Brian Todd is joining us now. Brian, this is an incredible moment, the ability for these police to stop this from happening. We so rarely hear that. It is always a tragedy afterwards. What are police telling you on how they were able to do this?",

This was just seconds away from happening according to the Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis.Now, to take you quickly through the sequence of events. It starts early Sunday morning when a person in Maryland, in the state of Maryland, who either knew the suspect, Rui Jiang, or knew of him, noticed some very disturbing and threatening posts that he had made on Instagram. Well, this person calls the Anne Arundel County, Maryland, police department and reports it. The Anne Arundel County Police, having information that this man lives in Fairfax County, they contact the Fairfax County, Virginia, police immediately. the Fairfax County, Virginia, police go to his home, find that he is not there, find that his car is not there. They have information that he could be targeting this church, the Park Valley Church, which is in Hay Market, Virginia. That's a good hour away, west on Route 66, from where his home is. So, they contact -- the Fairfax County Police contact the Prince William County Police, who converged on the church immediately. As they're converging on the church, that's when the church security, right about that moment, pretty much confronts this man in the vestibule, in the large lobby area of the church, and - and takes him into custody. Now, yesterday, we caught up with the pastor of the Park Valley Church. He kind of took us through the steps of where this man moved inside the church. He went into the lobby. He then went into the sanctuary and took a seat on the top row of the sanctuary. He was told he couldn't sit there. He went back into the lobby and then was confronted by a church security person who was incidentally an off- duty Prince William Police officer. And that's when the Prince William County Police got there. It was literally seconds away from possibly happening, Sara. And when we talked to Pastor Barry White of the Park Valley Church, here's what he had to say about their suspicions about this suspect as soon as he entered their building. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, our safety team immediately thought that there was a problem.They began to shadow him. He went into the auditorium, went into a door upstairs that he shouldn't have gone into, was confronted at that point by our safety team. They said, you know, you don't belong in this area -- because there's a big sign that says do not enter basically. He left that area, went down the stairs, came out into the lobby, was met by two of our safety personnel here. (END VIDEO CLIP) TODD: And that's also the moment when the Prince William County Police converged on the scene. So, Sara, it was just extraordinary. Three law enforcement agencies in two states coordinating just beautifully. And if somebody had dropped the ball or mistimed something just a little bit, you could have had a mass shooting on your hands. One other quick thing, Sara. The pastor said there were about 1,000 people inside the sanctuary when all this happened and about 300 children on the premises as well.",

As you mentioned, a tech CEO just named to Forbes \"30 under 30.\" She was a rising star known by many in this particular community. And what we know about the circumstances there is she was initially reported missing Monday morning. Then hours later police found her body, dead from blunt force trauma, as we understand. And the suspect, Billingsley, does have a history here. He pled guilty to assault in 2009, 2011. In 2015 he pled guilty to a first degree sex offense and was sentenced to 30 years in prison but then was released in October of 2022. As officials told the \"New York Times,\" he was released under mandatory supervision. And officials, during the press conference, even seemed a little taken aback at how someone like this, with a history like this, could have been released at such an early point in a long sentence. And it's part of why the police are telling the community that this isn't just someone who is armed and dangerous, but someone who has the capacity to act. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
