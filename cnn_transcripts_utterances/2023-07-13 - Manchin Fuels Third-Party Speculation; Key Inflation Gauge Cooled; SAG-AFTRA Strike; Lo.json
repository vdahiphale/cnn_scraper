JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): No, no, this is nothing about a third party, this is not about running, about any office at all. It's about a dialogue for common sense, which is very hard to have here, finding commonality. And we're going around the country basically talking to people that want this commonality and common sense approach to how we fix problems. It's not happening here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it -- what they're talking about is a unity ticket. Putting up a Republican and a Democrat, or a Democrat and a Republican, in whichever order, to be an alternative if Biden and Trump are the nominees of their representative parties next year.The challenge with this is, Democrats are concerned about this because they believe it siphons more votes from the Democratic side than from the Republican side because Trump voters are loyal, they believe some Biden voters aren't as enthusiastic. It's hard to know. You can argue this several different ways. We look back to history. Ross Perot, for example, in 1992. Did he help Bill Clinton and hurt President George H.W. Bush? Perhaps. You can also look back in 2016, Jill Stein was the Green Party candidate. So, there is worry. And Senator Manchin there has not said, a, if he's running for re-election in West Virginia. So he's going to New Hampshire Monday night with this No Labels group, causing some - raising some eyebrows in terms of what exactly he's up to.",

My guess is there will be plenty of reading of the tea leaves on both sides from now until probably the week of August 23rd, when that debate happens in Milwaukee. But, look, I think this is something he might be wise to skip because he is, by and away, the frontrunner in this party. But he does not always play to conventional strategy. Can the former president sort of, you know, turn away the oxygen and the attention from that debate? So, we'll see. But huge for Chris Christie to get on that stage. Mike Pence still hasn't qualified yet. So that will be a big question. Can he get 40,000 donors in 20 different states? It's harder than it sounds.",

It's becoming a bit of a trend here, right? So, let's start with the Producer Price Index. This is the inflation index where the producers of goods and services, right, not to be confused with the CPI, or the Consumer Price Index. So this index increased 0.01 on an annual basis. That is better than economists were expecting on a monthly basis. Also increasing 0.1 percent. That is better than economists were expecting. It's the lowest level, guys, in three years for PPI.Here's why this report really matters because what we see in this data tens to give us a sense of what we can expect to see with consumer inflation, with consumer prices, the things that you and I and all of us spend. And so the sense is that if it's falling here it should continue to fall in consumer inflation, which, of course, when that report yesterday we saw, right? Let's go talk about jobless claims. So this is the most real-time indicator of what's happening in the labor market. This comes out once a week and it gives us a sense of how many Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. We were expecting this number to actually tick up slightly, but it ticked down to 237,000. That ticked down 12,000, I want to say, from the week prior. Continuing claims, that is the number of people who continue to file for unemployment benefits, that ticked up slightly, but was pretty much in line with what expectations were. Guys, this is a sense of -- in a labor market that we had been expecting would start to soften. We're not really seeing that. Perhaps marginally, but we're not really that. This is a labor market that continues to defy expectations and continues to be strong, at least right now.",
