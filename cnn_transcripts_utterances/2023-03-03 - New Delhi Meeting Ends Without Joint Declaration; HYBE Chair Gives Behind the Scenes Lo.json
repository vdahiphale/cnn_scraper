Chinese services data posting the fastest pace of growth in six months and this follows solid manufacturing numbers earlier in the week too. The SHANGHAI COMPOSITE has gained over 7.5 percent this year. The South Korean KOSPI doing even better as you can see they're up 8.5 percent as investors hope to profit from a robust Chinese rebound. And our Richard Quest is in Seoul and we'll bring you his interview with the South Korean Prime Minister in just a moment's time. Topics discussed include hopes for post lockdown economy's recovery and the need for better leadership on the global stage South Asia of course the setting for the meeting of G20. Finance Ministers in New Delhi Foreign Ministers excuse me sharp divisions apparent over Ukraine with China insisting that the G20, ignore security issues and focus elsewhere. And meanwhile, grim news from the town of Bakhmut in Eastern Ukraine heavy fighting continues control of the city now hanging in the balance and that is where we begin today's show. The Head of Russia's Wagner group says his troops have Bakhmut \"surrounded\" and he's calling on the Ukrainian President to withdraw his troops. But Ukraine still insisting it's holding its ground. Russia in the meantime has also damaged a key bridge used to supply the city. A local official telling CNN they hope to repair the bridge soon. Alex Marquardt joins us live now from Eastern Ukraine. Alex, what do we know in more detail about the situation there?",

We know that there were some 4 to 5000 civilians who were still in the city; we were actually going with a team that meant to evacuate some of them earlier today. And then that mission was called off because of what happened at that bridge. There is only one main supply route that Ukrainian forces are able to use in and out of Bakhmut. We were there just yesterday, we saw Ukrainian forces bombing up and down that road and armored vehicles going to and from the front. That road now broken off because of this bombing of the bridge it has been severed, we understand from a soldier who is inside Bakhmut that the bridge was hit by a large missile, that means it is going to be very difficult for Ukrainians to --, for them to evacuate civilians for them to pull back if they if they need to. That order to withdraw certainly has not been given, at least for now but it does mean things are going to be much harder for Ukrainian forces if they want to get to the front or come back from it. They're going to have to use dirt roads or cross open fields that are very difficult. It is very perilous. It certainly exposes them significantly. We did hear from the Head of the Wagner forces, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who says that Ukrainian forces are surrounded on three sides that does line up with what we understand. He said he called on President Zelenskyy to withdraw his forces to save his men's lives. That in a day or twos time that those men will be surrounded Ukrainian forces certainly standing their ground they're putting up a very strong fight. No sense right now that they are withdrawing. I spoke with troops in a nearby town just yesterday saying they need to keep fighting for Bakhmut. They need to hold Bakhmut because otherwise that next town where we were in Chasiv Yar that would be the next target for Russians. They would have a deeper foothold in Eastern Ukraine, Julia.",

Today, we heard a statement to the effect of China doesn't want to do anything to add fuel to fire, perhaps viewed as implied criticism to the west. As you mentioned, China is not supporting this Foreign Ministers statement by the G20. In fact, today, it made a point of saying that the G20 should focus more on security issues or other diplomatic issues. I should say no, not so much security issues go back to its original focus. Let's take a listen to some remarks we heard earlier today from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing.

Terrified parents watch helplessly as their children fall prey to mysterious ailments. CNN communicated with witnesses and survivors of some of these incidents at mostly girls' schools across the country. It was a terrible situation. Girls had been falling on the floor and were crying. Some were unable to walk really didn't want to leave one another. They wouldn't let us go home; they forced us to stay inside. There was a bitter smell. There was a smell outside too. Then I felt sick. Many of the students who spoke to CNN reported smelling noxious odors. This as Iranian authorities' explanation has been shifting, but state media is now referring to the incidence as poisonings. Some parents' worry these are targeted attacks on girls meant to prevent them from attending school. Many of the attacks have been in the religious heartland of Iran. Yet the Minister of Education has said that most of the cases were caused by rumor and there is no problem. The reported poisonings began a month and a half after process erupted across Iran, led by women demonstrating against the country's repressive conduct and clothing laws. CNN cross reference local media reporting with testimony from victims and eyewitnesses to tally the number of incidents. State media have reported incidents at nearly 60 schools since late November. CNN has spoken with eyewitnesses in dozens of these cases in one school in the regime Heartland have come at least three incidents were reported to CNN, the latest this week.
