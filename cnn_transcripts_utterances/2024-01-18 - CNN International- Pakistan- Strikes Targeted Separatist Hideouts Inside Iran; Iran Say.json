      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Pakistan launches strikes inside Iran, saying it targeted separatist militants inside the country. We will have the very latest from Islamabad. Then, we'll have a live report from Ecuador where a prosecutor leading the investigation into an attack on a TV station has been killed. Plus, Rishi Sunak might be celebrating a success as his controversial Rwanda asylum bill makes its way through the UK House of Commons. But, the British Prime Minister still has some hurdles to overcome before his promised \"stop the boats and start the flights\" becomes a reality.Beginning with an unusual flare up in tensions between two neighbors, earlier today, Pakistan launched strikes inside Iran using killer drones, rockets and other weapons to hit what it said were separatist hideouts in Siestan-Balochistan province. Now, Pakistan says it took maximum care to avoid collateral damage. Iranian media report at least 10 people were killed in the strikes, including three women and four children. This comes two days after Iran fired missiles inside Pakistan, targeting what it says were Sunni militants. CNN Producer Sophia Saifi joins us live from Islamabad. The area we're talking about is often described as lawless. But, there has been an agreement between the two sides in recent times, but that seems to have broken down.",

      "sentences": "I guess. Max, it's been a very friendly relationship that both Iran and Pakistan have had, and that was somewhat tested when Iran went ahead and took out those strikes deep within Pakistani territory on Tuesday night. Pakistan claims that those strikes led to the death of two children and three more injured. Now, at the same time when Pakistan went ahead and did those strikes this morning, on Thursday morning, Pakistan time, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs came out and said that these were only Pakistanis that were targeted in these strikes that went out towards Iran.Pakistan has a vast border with Iran as well. Pakistan's military has finally put out a statement ever since the Iranian strikes took place on Tuesday night. Pakistan's military hadn't said anything. That's finally ended. Pakistan's military has come out and said that they were targeting Baloch separatists who operate, according to the Pakistani military and the Pakistani state, on the other side of the Pak-Iran border within Iran, and that they were specifically targeting the BLA, the Baloch Liberation Army, and the Baloch Liberation Front, which are two groups that have been known for the deadly attacks here in Pakistan only in the past year as well. So, Pakistan also ended that military statement with a line that it would be prudent in the future that both brotherly, friendly nations continue to have dialogue and correspondence when it comes to maintaining bilateral ties. So, it's an election year for Pakistan. Elections are due to be held in about two and a half weeks from now. There is a lot of tension already within Pakistan. A lot of Pakistanis are actually quite disappointed from what we're hearing from the Pakistani public with Iran striking Pakistan because there has been a lot of sympathy towards Iran's activities in the Middle East and to the groups it supports. So, we're just going to have to wait and see whether this tit-for-tat situation is an end, or whether this escalates further from what's going on into the Middle East and will now bleed potentially into South Asia.

They plan to hold a public event in Tel Aviv later this hour, pleading for the release of Kfir Bibas. It's not clear if he is still alive. And medicines have now arrived in Gaza for Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians. That's according to Qatar which mediated the deal between Israel and Hamas. Doha's announcement comes just hours after the IDF says it doesn't have the ability to guarantee the medicine reaches the Israeli hostages. On the ground in southern Gaza, Reuters is reporting that at least 16 people have been killed after a strike hit a home in Rafah overnight. Let's go to Tel Aviv speak to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. Thanks for joining us, Jeremy. What more do we know about the aid reaching Gaza and those medicines for the hostages?",

This comes hours after the Iran-backed rebels struck a U.S. owned ship in the Gulf of Aden, and the U.S. announced it is re-designating the Houthis as a global terrorist organization, looming over the U.S. strikes, growing fears that the Israel-Hamas war could escalate in the region. Our National Security Reporter Natasha Bertrand is live for us in the Pentagon.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Max. This is the fourth round of strikes that the U.S. has carried out inside Yemen in just under a week, three of which have been unilateral, not in conjunction with American allies, and the U.S. appears to be taking pre-emptive action more often now. According to Central Command, they launched Tomahawk missiles last night against 14 Houthi missile launchers, and those missiles from the U.S. side were launched by warships as well as by a guided missile submarine. And according to Central Command, the reason why they decided to take out these missiles that the Houthis were preparing to launch is because they say \"they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time.\"And so, the U.S. argument is still that they are carrying out these strikes in self-defense. The Houthis, for their part, say that they're going to continue launching these attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea. And in recent days, they have been increasingly targeting, and in some cases, even hitting U.S.-owned and operated ships in the Red Sea. And so, the question now is, is this tit for tat going to continue, because the U.S. last week in this massive strike campaign against the Houthi said that they carried out alongside the UK. It only took out roughly a third of the Houthis' weapons capabilities. And since then, they have kind of been going ad hoc, taking out different weapons that the Houthis had been preparing to launch against targets in the Red Sea. But, is that a sustainable approach? And that is the question that the U.S. Military is grappling with at this point, especially given that the Houthis say they are not going to stop these attacks until the war in Gaza is over, Max.",

It's also not a victory for the Prime Minister. He has been facing a significant internal rebellion on this issue. So, why do this press conference?

Then if it went back to the House of Commons, let's say in March, even if it got Royal assent, then it will take quite a few more months to actually put into practice.But, the problem that loads of people have with this legislation is essentially going to ask Border Force agents and people who work in immigration to be forced to make a decision sometimes between what a minister tells them to do, what the European Court of Human Rights tells them to do, or resign. So, it's going to put them in a really difficult position here, and that's part of the problem that people have with this legislation.",
