And a US official saying that one Hamas command post is under Gaza's main hospital.Also tonight, day one of the former president's defense in New York's civil fraud case, with Donald Trump Jr. taking the stand, calling his dad a, quote, \"artist with real estate.\" We begin though, keeping them honest, what the former president is now saying about his opponents and how his allies are reportedly planning to target them. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. By now, it is no secret that the former president lies nearly all the time. What's also becoming clearer, though, is that when he talks about what he would like to do to people he perceives as his enemies, he's often not lying. There's new reporting to that effect tonight and coupled with several other recent reports that suggests that he meant what he said over the weekend when he said this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And one of them is the fact that some of these groups, some of the units that went to the south and to the east had enough material, had enough food, had enough weapons and gear for several days. They weren't planning to just run out and get some hostages and come right back out again.And some of the maps that have been described to us indicate that some of these units were planning to go or were potentially able to go as far as the West Bank. They were halfway there already. They went 15, 20 miles into Israel. Another 20 miles, they would have been at the West Bank border. You can imagine what that would mean symbolically to link up with the other Palestinian faction and to perhaps draw them into the fight or make that part of this effort that they were putting together. Didn't happen, but they were clearly at least thinking about that. The other thing on this psychic blow to the Israeli population about their own security, about the capabilities of the IDF, the capabilities of the intelligence services in Israel. Can you just talk about what you have learned about in preparations for October 7th, how Hamas was able to avoid the surveillance and tapping of communication networks?",

And the preparation for this goes back probably a couple years because since 2021, Hamas hasn't really engaged with the Israelis. They've been sort of talking, you know, about building and about making things better for people inside Gaza, but not taking in sort of rocket fire, which some of their allies did, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and others would occasionally fire missiles or fight with Israelis on the border.Not Hamas. Hamas seemed to be retreating from this, you know, kind of bellicose position that they've had for the last couple of decades. And that was important for the Israelis. And we talked to Israeli officials who said, we -- Hamas seemed to know what we wanted to hear. They wanted to hear that Hamas was not interested in war anymore. They're interested in development. And we were -- Israel was going to help them with that. And so they were quite surprised and just looking back at it now, really see that they were fooled by this, that Hamas played them very well. And all the time that these sort of overtures of peacefulness and just, you know, walking away from war, they were planning the whole time. They were studying what they were going to do. They were -- they're drawing up the maps and getting drone footage, in some cases, to some of these kibbutzim they ended up attacking, all the time preparing for a really big attack, while convincing the Israelis they had nothing like that going on.",

So there was a -- there still seems to be something of a firefight going on very close to the hospital at the front of the hospital. And I asked the commander, why is there such a big hole in the back of the hospital and he said, look, we got here five days ago, the doctors were still there, there were patients still there.He said, the IDF we couldn't check because there weren't doctors there. The IDF helped the doctors evacuate with the patients. They got away safely. But the only way said for the IDF to get into a hospital was to punch a hole, look like by a tank shell in the back of the -- in the back of the hospital. And that's how we claimed in and got into the basement, which is what he wanted to show us. Look, you know, he was at great pains to show us not just the hospital there, but tunnels that they'd found and the house that he said had to belong to Hamas commander. Look, we come into this as journalists, right. And we go in and we ask questions, and I asked the questions that, you know, some people are going to say is this really for real? And he's like, no, this is what we found. So we can see the solar panels on the roof of the house that he says belongs to Hamas leader. We can see the cables and we can see them run into a junction box. And we can see them run from the junction box into a well-made tunnel shaft that goes down below us. And the top spokesman for the IDF said, look, we've got a robot down there, it's gone down some of the tunnels that are beneath us here. One of them runs towards the hospital. So their point being, and they hadn't proven that link, but his point being that here is a Hamas commander, there's got a tunnel shaft that's got electricity and communications cables running into it that's right next to the hospital. And then into the hospital where he showed us weapons and ammunition that he said Hamas had there. Again, you're asking, we're asking the tough questions. And I think we were getting straightforward answers. But again, this is such a contentious issue about the damage to hospitals, about the civilian casualties. When you go into this environment, you really want to press and make sure that you are getting the fullest amount of information you can. What we couldn't do was reference it against any civilians that live there, or any medical staff because there was nobody there.",

It comes from Dr. Tom Potokar with the International Red Cross who has been treating patients in Gaza at an undisclosed hospital. He recorded these messages for us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. TOM POTOKAR, CHIEF SURGEON, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS: So just coming out of the operating theater this morning, we operated on a two-year-old who had 28 percent burns all over his body. We've just operated on another lady who has 14 percent plus full thickness burn. Whilst we're doing this operation in our theater, Palestinian theater, I just got a call to say that his wife's brother and father house have been hit. And they just found out that they'd all been killed in a strike this morning. This afternoon, we operated on a young child, 13-year-old with traumatic head injury, results of explosive blast, big defect in the back of his skull with some bone missing, an exposed brain that required careful debridement. And then a large flat from his scalp to cover the defect. I'm pleased to say some of the patients have now recovered a little bit, those with the more minor burns, which is reassuring, but we still have many, many, many patients. So another very busy day. Paul, our orthopedic surgeon has been busy in the orthopedic theater. Helping Palestinian colleagues manage some of the cases currently. Particularly, these cases that are complicated blast injuries with extensive tissue loss and bony injury. Unfortunately, today, we had to amputate the hand just proximal to the wrist of a six-year-old child who had had very, very deep burn injuries. We were trying to save his arm. We've managed hopefully to save his limb up until the hand but unfortunately a hand was basically charred and was the cause of ongoing infection which was making him very unwell. He's still in a very critical condition now. Still many, many burns that we're dealing and with dressing changes. Our local Palestinian therapists are doing a great job getting these patients up and out of bed. So still relentless, still bombardment every night. One very close, half past one this morning that whistled over the top of the building we're in. Still patients arriving, still inundated with internally displaced people. So not really getting any better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For instance, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who sits on the Judiciary Committee asked, quote, \"Is there a place where you can file a complaint against a justice who sorts out the ridiculous complaints from the legitimate ones?\" None of that is answered in a code that runs eight pages and is derived from one to which lower court judges are bound. The court also lists no specific restrictions on gifts or the code, no specific restrictions on gifts or travel, real estate deals. It says justices should, quote, \"make a reasonable effort\", unquote, to stay informed about the financial interests of themselves and their households\". It says justices should not knowingly be, quote, \"a speaker, a guest of honor, or featured on the program of a fundraising event\". The code also says the provision on recusal, quote, \"should be construed narrowly\". The code comes months after ProPublica began reporting on the justices finances including and its reports were that a Republican megadonor Harlan Crow had paid for expensive trips and more for Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas said the rules at the time didn't require such disclosures. ProPublica also disclosed that Justice Samuel Alito did not disclose a luxury fishing trip back in 2008. He said the criticisms were not, quote, \"valid\". I'm joined now by our Senior Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic. So Joan, do these guidelines, do they go far enough to satisfy the understandable criticism that's been leveled? JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: No, they don't, Anderson, but we've finally got at least a written code. So it is the first step in what members of the public, Senate Democrats, watchdog groups, you know, hosted media commentators had been pushing for. So it is a first step. And, you know, the Chief Justice John Roberts had really been struggling behind the scenes to first even get a majority to do something. And in the end, he was able to get unanimity. And I think it's because of the kind of atmosphere you just referred to there in terms of the news stories, the constant drumbeat of can't they have some sort of written rules the way lower court judges have. But the key thing is exactly as you said, there are no enforcement mechanisms in what they've presented. And also no way for anyone in the public, on the Hill or elsewhere to try to lodge a complaint and have it actually aired in some way. So it's, again, the justice is saying, you know, trust us, but I do want to say that at least they've taken this first step. Now, they adopted much of what was in the lower court code, but they added certain things that actually kind of, I think, were intended to blunt some of the criticism that they have. You mentioned that they say that if there any actions might undermine the judiciary, they added the word knowingly there, saying that sometimes justices don't know whether their conduct might undermine the judiciary or promote integrity, they just don't know. And with sharp disagreements, as the document said, they just needed to make sure they put in, that they would only find -- they would have to be knowingly disregard the judicial integrity and impartiality. So they kind of gave themselves a couple outs in this document, including Anderson, and another one, they said, you know, how the court receives lots of amicus briefs, friend of the court briefs that are filed often by business groups, and individuals who have connections to the justices. And they said in the cases of these, quote, \"friend of the court briefs\" that are filed to backup certain parties in the case that even if the justices have relationships with any of those individuals, they don't need to recuse. So, again, no enforcement and some new provisions written in that I think were intended to blunt criticism that they've already been receiving in certain instances.",
