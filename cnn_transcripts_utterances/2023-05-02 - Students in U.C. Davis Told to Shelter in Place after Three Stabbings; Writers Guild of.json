This small college down, obviously, on edge, this small, usually laidback college town on edge this morning as police still try to find a suspect. Now, the first attack was Thursday. A man known as the compassion guy, David Breaux, was 50 years old, was found dead in a park according to the mayor. Breaux was a well-known figure in the town, would often walk up to people asking for their thoughts on compassion. Then Saturday night a 22-year-old computer science student was stabbed and killed in another park just about a mile-and-a-half away, riding his bicycle back from an undergraduate awards ceremony. This young man, Kareem Abu Najm, was due to graduate in about six weeks. His father told the local station KCRA that the family had moved to California in 2018 from Lebanon. He says we came here hoping for safety. So Monday night, that was the third attack. A woman says she was stabbed through her tent in what police are calling a known transient camp. Now, the suspect from that Saturday night murder that police are looking for, they describe as 19 to 23 years old, five-foot-seven, light skin, long curly hair.

If it happens, millions of Americans would lose their jobs and their benefits.

But even more catastrophically is that you could have a global financial crisis because the relative safety, the risk-lessness of U.S. debt is what basically underpins the entire global financial system. And if all of a sudden we look like unreliable borrowers, that has kind of these cascading effects through other financial markets. And that would be bad.

So, we'll see. I mean, Twitter, it's a social network. And I pretty much avoid the social networks.
