The goal here is political protection. But so far, the backlash is bipartisan.Plus, I will not be intimidated. What words from Attorney General Merrick Garland, who is testifying on Capitol Hill? Right now, he's pushing back on Republicans who baselessly accused him of quote, weaponizing the Justice Department against Republicans. And guns, drugs and explicit photos. The first witnesses on the stand right now in the Hunter Biden trial. And we have new details on the prosecution's case and how personal and uncomfortable it's likely to get to the president's son. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We begin with breaking news. New details right now on President Biden's announcement today that he will effectively shut down the southern border to asylum seekers coming into the U.S. illegally. That would happen if daily illegal crossings hit a certain threshold. Now, it's Biden's most aggressive crackdown yet on illegal immigration and issue that has bedeviled his president's presidency. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins me now from the White House. Priscilla, I know you have all the details. Give us the top lines on this and the political implications.",

We're now learning from senior administration officials that they anticipate invoking this authority and using it later today. So, in effect, this is going to take effect pretty quickly. Now what it does? It shuts off access to asylum for migrants who cross the border illegally, when that duty thresholds of 2500 is met. We've been there. In fact, homeland security officials told me that just yesterday, they encountered over 3500 migrants crossing illegally. This would be turned off when those numbers dropped down to 1500 a day.Now, unaccompanied migrant, children are exempt from this. There are also some other exemptions for unique circumstances. And the idea here would be that these migrants would be turned back to Mexico or deported to their origin country. Now senior administration officials acknowledge that they anticipate getting some lawsuits on this from either side of the political spectrum, Republicans or Democrats. They're prepared for that. But this is essentially taking a page from former President Donald Trump's playbook. In fact, in 2018, he tried to use this exact same authority to shut down the border. Now when pressed about that senior administration official said, this is totally different because they do have exceptions because they do have a way for migrants to come to the United States legally. But there is no question here, Dana, that they are trying to prevent attacks from the former president before that first debate later this month. That they're also trying to blunt Republican attacks, which have been ongoing over the course of the president's administration. So, this is again a significant move, particularly for a president who began his administration saying that he wanted to restore the asylum system. Dana?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, I think that some of this we should see as an acknowledgement from the Biden White House, that some of their political arguments on immigration have been held. When we look back to 2020, most of that Democratic field was mostly saying that what Republicans and Donald Trump was doing were bad, and not really offering an affirmative vision. That hasn't really been able to hold for Democrats while in office.You've also seen after that Senate bipartisan compromise failed, the White House say, well, voters will blame Republicans and Donald Trump for nuking this deal. And we haven't seen that really bear out in data. To the point where we do see the White House making this action, and I think it's right to point out before the debate to be able to give the president something to insulate himself from Republican attacks. The Big Tech is also that those down ballots and the Democrats have been running away from Biden on this issue. They've been breaking in axing for harsher border enforcement. And so that shows the kind of parties' language on this issue has shifted. But to the point about the advocates, they've been upset for a while, do they feel like the top levels of the party have ceded a little ground, a little more ground, a little more ground to the right-wing kind of activist on this issue to the point where it is now the mainstream Democratic position to be enforcement first.",

Pramila Jayapal, Biden's executive order is very, very disappointing. Sylvia Garcia of Texas, I do not think that shutting the border, \"is a remedy.\" And then Hillary Scholten of Michigan, it's heart wrenching to see this is not going to come close to solving the problem. Before you weigh in on this, just to sort of put some meat on the bone of what I said at the beginning of the program, which is there's bipartisan backlash. Listen to what some of the Republicans have said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Whatever little-short measure that he's going to do here is not going to solve the problem. In fact, by some estimates, it might make it worse. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Why didn't you do this in 2021? Why didn't you do this in 2022? Why didn't you do this in 2023? Why didn't you do this last month? Or the month before? Or the month before? How many dead bodies is enough? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They were trying to get Congress to do it and they did it.LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR OF THE \"EARLY BRIEF\" NEWSLETTER: Yeah, that's right. And so, you see the split screen that's happening right now. With Republicans, it's interesting because they say it wasn't Trump. Why we rejected the bipartisan bill? It's because Brian can do this on his own. So, they tried to skirt the issue. And now they're saying, well, maybe this is not even going to be effective in Mike Johnson's words. But this is something that is providing some angst among the left and the Democratic Party because they think that the president is ignoring the base voters. The people that elected him by doing these actions to appeal to the more independent voters that polling has shown is siding with Trump and Republicans on the border. But like we've talked about, this is nothing new. Donald Trump did over 450 executive orders when he was in office against his Congress. He partially blew up some of the congressional actions there to. Remember President Obama in 2015 leading into his campaign, he signed the dreamer, the DACA executive order, that was an attempt to shore up his base.

We're waiting to hear back from two of Chesebro's attorney declined to comment.But again, this is really interesting because we have seen charges in a number of states already. We know that people will face charges in Georgia, in Nevada, in Arizona, in Michigan. Wisconsin just becomes the latest state to sort of pile on to try to bring some kind of ramifications for what several Republicans did in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. Wisconsin is also interesting because there was a civil suit there already involving several of the folks who served as fake electors in the states. 10 of them agreed in a civil suit that they essentially tried to improperly overturn the presidential election.

And there's some -- there's, you know, district by district, some members are going to focus -- are going to highlight Trump's conviction, going to highlight Republican antics against the Department of Justice.

They've done this in terms of the legal system. They've done this about media. They've done this in terms of the political process, and that is the kind of what Democrats are up against.So, sometimes it feels like Democrats are bringing a knife to a gunfight here, because it's not just that Republicans are targeting Merrick Garland, but that Merrick Garland is a proxy for a larger argument they're making to under -- to undercut the validity of the Biden administration as a whole -- about our political system as a whole. And that's what I think this election is going to be about. That's the message of Donald Trump. And so, it's interesting when we view the -- through the Capitol Hill lens, I see why Garland feels the need to say that I feel lot. I see why Democrats want to focus on kitchen table issues. But what Trump is going to try to do is bring that larger system distrust to your kitchen table.

I mean, that is I think actually exactly what the Biden campaign and any Biden ally would sort of argue, is the way to go on all of these things, right?So, for example, on the Trump being convicted news, you know, we heard the president talking about this, and you know, for the first time in that kind of political setting at a fundraiser last night, using that label of convicted felon. But actually, what was interesting was that the remarks that came right after basically mirrored what he has been saying about Donald Trump and what he represents a threat to democracy and democratic institutions for months and months and months now. So, in other words, the convicted felon label is sort of the new hook for him to get into what has been the Biden campaigns theory of the case for a long time. Now, I think, actually what is more important for Biden supporters in the Biden campaign than that label itself is whether that can sort of end up being the turning point for the voters who are still not paying attention, the voters who are tuned out, the voters who are still not sort of convinced that this is going to be a Biden versus Trump battle, whether that can sort of move the needle and get people to wake up and pay attention that we are in fact talking about Donald Trump.",
