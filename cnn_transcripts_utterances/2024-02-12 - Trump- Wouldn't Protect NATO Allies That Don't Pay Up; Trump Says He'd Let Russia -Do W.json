But, it's the comments that he made questioning the NATO alliance that are causing alarm across Europe. Plus, everyone loves a good Super Bowl commercial. But, not everyone loves a political ad in support of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We're going to discuss that. And I'll speak with independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Can the Senate pass a foreign aid bill and how is Donald Trump influencing those negotiations? All that and more ahead. Good day, everyone, I'm Jessica Dean to our viewers watching all around the world. It is 11 a.m. right here in Washington, Monday, February 12. They're just 12 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, 266 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. This morning, Donald Trump is attending a closed-door hearing in the classified documents case against him in Florida. But, the focus today is on something he said over the weekend that has stirred up a political firestorm from Washington to capitals all across Europe. Trump told rally- goers in South Carolina he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" to any NATO country that does not meet defense spending guidelines.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I came in. I made a speech and I said you got to pay up. They asked me that question. One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, well, sir, if we don't pay, and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said, you didn't pay, you're delinquent? He said, yes. Let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Faiz Shakir is a Political Advisor who managed Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign. Alice Stewart is a Republican strategist and former Communications Director for Ted Cruz, and Seung Min Kim, CNN Political Analyst and White House Reporter for the Associated Press. It is great to have all of you here. Listen, for a Monday, there is plenty to talk about. We're not short on news. I want to start first with the backdrop of what President Trump said over the weekend about NATO. And I want to play what Marco Rubio said to our Jake Tapper and now kind of set us up. So, let's listen to that first. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Donald Trump is not a member of the Council of Foreign Relations. He doesn't talk like a traditional politician. And we've already been through this. Now, you think people have to figure it out by now. He is not the first American President. In fact, virtually, every American President at some point, in some way has complained about other countries in NATO not doing enough. Trump is just the first one to express it in these terms.

One EU official saying NATO cannot be ala carte militaryalliance, cannot be a military alliance that works depending on the humor of the President of the U.S. on those days. It's not yes, no, yes, no. It depends who you are. Let's be serious. Faiz, do you think -- I'm thinking back to when I was in Iowa over the summer. Mike Pence was still in the race for the Republican nomination. He talked to a group of Evangelicals about the importance of supporting Ukraine and Ukraine aid. They booed him. Do you think that Americans are making the connection between what these officials are trying to sell in this foreign aid and to NATO? Do they understand kind of how it all connects? And does -- do they care? FAIZ SHAKIR, BERNIE SANDERS 2020 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: When you look at public polling, Jessica, you find that foreign aid has always been at the bottom of the list. People are always skeptical and concerned that while I'm struggling here at home, why are we giving money abroad? For a President of the United States, the case is always for American interests. And you have to do things that are unpopular as a President on a whole variety of fronts for the American interest. And of course, Donald Trump campaigns on America first. And here he is. To me, the greater problem of that statement is he is telling people I'm comfortable with Putin attacking whomever. That's the major problem with that. In American interest, how is that good for America? You want Putin expanding his aggression all over the world without any pushback, without any counter, without any building of alliances? That's crazy. And then you've got him attacking Nikki Haley's husband who is serving in war. I mean, if you watch Trump events, you see he goes out to Lee Green with God bless the USA and which the lyrics are, stand with people who fought for the red, white and blue. And yeah, here he is basically, In Putin's case, and now in obviously Nikki Haley's husband case. Who cares about America? Really, who cares about America?",

What are you hearing from the White House on how these comment -- obviously, we had what they said on the record, but how is this settling over there? SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS, &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is precisely the contrast that they want to make with Donald Trump. We saw all the political fallout at the end of last week after the Special Counsel's report. And they're saying -- the White House, the Biden campaign, Democratic allies are saying, look, we know Joe Biden is old, so is Donald Trump, but only one of these guys is threatening to withdraw from NATO, threatening -- or telling Russia to basically go ahead and attack our allies. With those choices, who do you want? And they feel that if they can make that case enough, they illustrate the warnings of what a second Trump presidency would be, not just in foreign affairs, certainly, but domestically as well, when it comes to healthcare policy, when it comes to abortion, they feel that is a race that they can win on despite the political liabilities are facing about President Biden's age. Now, whether they can effectively make that argument will be a test for them, certainly for the coming months. But, you see how every Democrat is really seizing on what Joe Biden said over NATO and also for Nikki Haley. I mean, this is the contrast she wants with Donald Trump heading, as you said, 12 days away from the South Carolina primary. We've all been kind of assuming at this point that's going to be a Biden- Trump race, and she does have an opportunity here to make that distinction about what kind of a Commander in Chief she would be versus Donald Trump.",

That group of Republicans, particularly in elected office, is diminishing. I mean, I assume if he hasn't already, Mitt Romney will say -- certainly say something about his NATO remarks. But, Marco Rubio, going back to what he said, is just a classic example of that. This is a guy who has legislation, not maybe a couple of months ago, saying you need an act of Congress for a President to withdraw from NATO. And yet, Donald Trump says what he says. And you saw what he said. He said -- well, that's just kind of who he is. And that's -- different presidents take different tactics.

The procedural vote exposed deep divisions within the Republican Party with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 17 other Republicans defying Trump to support this package, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The former President, running for the White House again, of course, took to social media to demand a radical overhaul in U.S. foreign aid. He wrote in part, \"From this point forward, are you listening U.S. Senate (?), no money in the form of foreign aid should be given to any country unless it is done as loan, not just a giveaway.\" For more on this, let's go to our Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju, who is live on Capitol Hill.

That includes a Republican Leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, as well as two potential successors of his, John Thune, John Cornyn, siding with him and trying to push through this $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan. It does not include changes to how the U.S. deals with migrants coming across the southern border with Mexico. Why? Because Senate Republicans did listen to Trump at that time and they killed that bipartisan deal. They forced -- the Senate essentially jettisoned that bipartisan deal, and now just simply focus on this aid package, and coming at an urgent time when Ukraine is saying it desperately needs more resources, the administration leaning on Commerce to provide those resources, and now on its way to passage in the Senate despite opposition from -- a majority of Senate Republicans, including some who say that no more aid should be given to Ukraine altogether. Expect the votes to be there in the Senate by the middle of this week. Then just look at the huge question. What will happen in the Republican-led House? The Speaker there, Mike Johnson, has not committed to putting this bill on the floor. He has tried to move forward on individual bills dealing with aid to Israel, for instance, something that actually got rejected in this -- in the House just last week. He has not committed to putting this all together in one big package. And he has listened to Donald Trump. He speaks regularly to Donald Trump. He listened to Donald Trump in o effectively killing that bipartisan border deal. Will he do the same on this massive aid package? And if he does, will House members tried to circumvent the leadership and use procedures to try to force a vote on this package on the floor?

So, you do see how -- we know that House Republicans certainly are very much influenced by the House. You look at the list of their leadership. They have all endorsed Trump. That is not the case over on the Senate Republican side. But, you see -- as Trump continues to say really strong and powerful and influential within the Republican Party, certainly you do see that influence spill over into the Senate, and again, as senators retire and a younger generation of Republicans who came up of age in the Trump era, if you will, get into office, certainly you see that impact as well.",

He does not want any kind of victory or progress for Joe Biden to take credit for when he can stall it and push it back to if he is potentially President, and he can take credit for it.

And the super PAC paying the bill gets a big chunkof its funding from a Republican megadonor, and that's raised a little controversy in itself. But, really, it's the content of the ad that's prompting anger from within the Kennedy family. JFK's nephew Bobby Shriver posting, \"My cousin's Super Bowl ad used our uncle's faces and my Mother's. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines and health care equity are in her DNA.\" Shriver is referring to RFK Jr.'s controversial statements questioning the efficacy and the safety of vaccines. And Kennedy himself is now apologizing to his family members, posting, \"I'm so sorry if the Super Bowl advertisement caused anyone in my family pain. The ad was created and aired by the American Values Super PAC without any involvement or approval from my campaign. FEC rules prohibit Super PACs from consulting with me or my staff.\" The super PAC did it. It's not my fault. I will say, I was making -- I was cooking while this was on last night, and I heard the music and it really caught your attention. But, I'm curious, what did you think when you first saw that?",
