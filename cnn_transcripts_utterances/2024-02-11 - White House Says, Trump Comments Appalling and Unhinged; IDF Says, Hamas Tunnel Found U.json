We begin this hour in Washington, where the White House is going on the offensive on multiple fronts. The administration is working to get ahead of controversy over a recent special counsel report with aides, allies and even the first lady pushing back on suggestions that the president's memory lapses have revealed a lack of mental fitness. Well, meantime, the White House is also blasting remarks made by the likely Republican presidential candidate that could alarm Europe and impact U.S. relations with NATO allies. Those comments were made Saturday at a campaign rally in South Carolina. Donald Trump said he'd, quote, encourage Russia to do whatever the hell they want to NATO allies if they didn't pay up.

He also spent a lot of time testing his general election rhetoric against President Joe Biden. He attacked Biden's handling of the southern border and he also ramped up criticism of the Justice Department's decision not to charge Biden over his handling of classified documents. He also repeatedly criticized Joe Biden's mental fitness and what Special Counsel Robert Hur described as a poor memory. Alayna Treene, CNN, Conway, South Carolina.",

They're afraid of Joe Biden.Now, this memo also goes on to make notable mentions of people like General Mark Milley and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy who have called the president alert and engaged. But, of course, this comes on the heels of that special counsel report that also mentioned the president's age and apparent memory lapses. Now, this had aides to the president fuming over the course of the week who pushed back and said the president is sharp and tireless. We also saw that anger spill into public view from the president himself who took particular issue with the special counsel, suggesting that he had forgotten the day his son died. Now, all of this is part of what is going to be a defining theme for the presidential election year, that being the president's age and fitness for office. Senior campaign officials say that the president is best when he is out on the campaign trail engaging with voters. And we have seen an uptick in traditional retail politics stops for him to do exactly that. And that is ultimately then the voters who are going to pass judgment on whether the president is fit to serve a second term. But, of course, polls show that there is still some concern here about how old he is. But, again, campaign officials and White House officials well aware of that see it as something that they can navigate and remind the American people who he is and what he is like when he engages on the campaign trail.

It's sort of more about frailty and not being as energetic, not being as dynamic. So, Trump is out there yelling and screaming. That may not be a very good assessment of his mental acuity, but that's not how people perceive it.

He's going to need to be in the spotlight. He's going to need to take questions. He's probably going to need to debate. You can't go into a presidential contest just hoping for the best. In the impromptu press conference that he held, Joe Biden said, I know what the heck I'm doing. It's not a hard and fast rule, Anna. But usually when you're in the position of having to tell people, I know what the heck I'm doing, it's a good indication that you don't. So, to my mind, you should probably stop that kind of rhetoric and show people and not tell. But it's really difficult right now.

Not only that, and this tunnel is about 18 meters below ground. Not only did it go underneath the UNRWA headquarters, the IDF says, but that there were cables running from UNRWA down into this, what it describes as a Hamas military intelligence center, and actually this data centre that it said Hamas was running directly underneath the UNRWA headquarters drew its electricity from the headquarters above. Now, it also discovered vast quantities of weapons. It says as well, UNRWA, as you say, has denied all knowledge of this tunnel existing or of this data center existing underneath. It says it doesn't have the capacity to investigate, to understand exactly what's going on underneath either. And, of course, this comes at a very delicate time for UNRWA, given the allegations by Israel that a dozen of its employees were actively involved in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th, prompting many countries around the world to suspend funding to this organization that, of course, is stretched to the limits, trying to provide humanitarian aid to all of those Palestinians in desperate need of it in the Gaza Strip.

On Saturday, President Zelenskyy appointed five more senior commanders.

His replacement, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, is under pressure to come up with a new battle plan without calling up too many conscripts. A family of five was killed after being trapped in a fire caused by a Russian drone strike on Ukraine's second-largest city.
