The House speaker, Mike Johnson, keeping up his campaign to keep it under wraps.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  I don't want to open a Pandora's Box. We're in a different era, okay? I would be concerned about opening the Pandora's Box of saying that the House Ethics Committee, with its vast resources and unlimited power, effectively, could investigate private citizens and release reports about them.

A lot of Republicans in the Senate are making clear this is an important step for them in trying to make a determination whether they think Matt Gaetz is up to the job of being America's top lawmaker.Now, we're going to be watching very closely to see whether the Ethics Committee actually goes forward with their meeting. As you noted, they are expected to hold a panel tomorrow, potentially discussing what to do about this report. There's also a question of whether or not they would vote to release it. Yes, you are hearing from Speaker Johnson that he does not think that is the best step forward, but we should note that there is some past precedent for releasing a report that is finished even after a member has left Congress. That happened back when Representative Bill Bonner had won a race for the mayor of Nashville. He had an ongoing ethics report. He resigned his seat in Congress. And then later, Congress decided to actually release that report. So, there is some precedent for it. But you see there, Mike Johnson really putting his thumb on the scale, which is an unusual step for a House speaker in saying that he does not think that that is the step that the House Ethics Committee should take. Here is a Democrat, though, the top Democrat on the committee on what she thinks should happen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. SUSAN WILD (D-PA):  We have a scheduled meeting on Wednesday and it remains to be seen what the chairman's agenda is for that. But I believe we should vote on whether or not to disclose it or not, and we'll see what happens after that. Everybody on the committee now has the report, so they've got the opportunity to be reviewing it. I believe there will be a unanimous Democratic consensus that it should be released.

For one thing, it was only a week ago that we were reporting how the defense and the prosecution talked about that agreement they had to have a bench trial instead of a trial by jury, a deal that was approved by the judge. And we heard the prosecution in open court on Monday say that they expect to wrap up their case today. The defense, meanwhile, said that their testimony is only going to take a half a day.And day two in the case was full of heartbreaking testimony, John. One of the things that we heard that was very difficult to hear was smart watch data showing the precise moment when Laken Riley's heart stopped beating. We also heard about cell phone data showing how Jose Ibarra's cell phone was placed very, very close, an FBI special agent said, to Laken Riley's phone for about 20 minutes. And then we also heard a recording from a phone call between Jose Ibarra and his estranged wife in New York, where she urges him to tell the truth. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

No secret that Trump likes low tax rates. He's proposed tax breaks on a lot, right? No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, tax relief on car loans. And also he wants to fully extend those 2017 tax cuts. Now, if that happens, you could have a $1,000 savings, according to the Tax Policy Center, for the typical family. That's about 1.3 percent of income. Nothing to sneeze at, but it's a much bigger savings for the top 1 percent of earners, $70,000 or 3.2 percent of income. So, this is going to be something that we're going to see play out in Congress, of course, because extending these tax cuts would cost $5 trillion. Now, relatedly, there's a lot of focus on what Social Security looks like under Trump because, there's some concern that those tax breaks, especially eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, are going to hurt Social Security by eliminating a key revenue stream. The Committee for Responsible Federal Budget has found that under Trump, Social Security would go insolvent in 2031. That is three years earlier than otherwise, and that would prompt a 33 percent cut across the board of benefits unless Congress acts. So, we have to watch that space very closely.",

He's called for across the board tariffs, massive tariffs on China. And we've seen that there's estimates that this is going to cost real people money. The National Retail Federation has warned that we could see price spikes on everything, from furniture and clothes and footwear, appliances and toys. And one other point on the inflation front, Kate, mass deportations, right? We know that there is a risk that mass deportations could create worker shortages, especially for things like housing, where there's a lot of undocumented workers, and also for groceries, because there's a lot of undocumented workers in the food supply chain. So, we need to watch that space very closely, because, obviously, voters don't want prices to go even higher.",
