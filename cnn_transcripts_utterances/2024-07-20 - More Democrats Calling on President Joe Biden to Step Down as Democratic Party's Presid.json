It's time to break down the big stories with some smart people.Today, we're asking, while everyone waits to see if President Biden drops out of the race, is Kamala Harris a sure thing to replace them at the top of the ticket? Then, same old, same old. Did Donald Trump's shift in his speed from reflect job to vindictive win him any new supporters? And going retro, young married couples ripping a page out of the \"I Love Lucy\" playbook in a surprising trend experts say is healthy. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, President Biden is in Delaware this weekend physically isolated fighting because of COVID and politically isolated from many in his party who want him to quit the race. But while his campaign says he is not dropping out, that's not stopping some Democrats from pushing him both privately and very publicly. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

People are going to be anxious. That's going to seem like a safe bet. But if you are going to these extreme lengths, let me tell you, if you go from Trump, call it a 25 percent chance of winning. Go to Kamala, maybe it's 35, 40 percent. If you go to someone like a Josh Shapiro, who represents a very high risk for the left of the party, but you have a much, much stronger chance of winning.
