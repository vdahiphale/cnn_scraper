And leading this hour, grim news confirmed by Israeli Defense Forces earlier today. A dual American and Israeli citizen who we've told you about in the past, a young man 19 years old named Itay Chen, it turns out he was killed by Hamas terrorists on October 7. He was only 19 at the time of his murder until this news. He was believed to be among the more than 100 people still being held hostage by Hamas. Regular viewers of The Lead know we've spoken to Itay's parents on a number of occasions. He was the second of three sons. He was a former Boy Scout, he was a fierce basketball player, especially computer basketball. Here's how his father Ruby described Itay to me back in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Senator Ernst joins us now. And Senator Ernst, this is an American kid. He was a dual citizen, but he was an American citizen in addition to being an Israeli citizen. It's just heartbreaking. What is your response? SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): It is heartbreaking, Jake. And my hope as I had gotten to know, Ruby and Hagit to and the other hostage families was that I would be part of that welcome home ceremony for all six of our American hostages. And today that hope was dashed, obviously, for Ruby and for Hagit with the loss of Itay. And it is devastating. It is the knowledge now that their son will not come home. And we will pray that we say the others returned safely. But again, this family's hopes have been dashed and dashed at the hands of Hamas during that horrific October 7 attack on Israel.",

And I wish the American public could, you know, distinguish between the two. We really do need to target Hamas and their dastardly deeds, the evil doings from October 7th moving forward, and make sure that we are holding them to account.

They're responding pretty viscerally to things he has said into his anti-establishment, beholden-to-nobody image. Here's the part that's interesting that you didn't say, indeed, a major takeaway from the focus group is that the Kennedy factor in this election should be taken pretty seriously in the swing states, where he's likely to make the ballot this fall.

This time the Los Angeles Innocence Project is representing him and they claim, quote, newly discovered evidence backs Peterson's innocence. Let's bring in trial attorney Misty Marris. And Misty, today's procedural hearing in Northern California is just the start of what's expected to be a lengthy process in Peterson's possible last chance to prove that he did not, in fact, kill his pregnant wife.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jake, absolutely. This is the very, very beginning. So right now we heard the Innocence Project that came into the courtroom. They made a motion to basically unseal all of the records relating to this case, to conduct DNA analysis of evidence at both pre and post-conviction and also to conduct further post- conviction discovery. So the next step is that prosecutors actually have the opportunity and opposition.Ultimately, the court will make a determination about what the Innocence Project is going to have access to, the breadth of the testing that they can do, and whether or not they're going to be able to unseal all of those records relating to Scott Peterson's conviction. All of those hearings are scheduled to take place in the coming months. After all that's done, then the appeal process actually begin. So we're at the very beginning of the road.",

So presumably, much of what they're looking into relates to DNA evidence and testing of evidence that were 20 years beyond the procedures and forensic testing that was available back in the early 2000s. So with this new modern testing, will something come to light, there's a strong focus on a defense theory that Laci Peterson was actually the victim of being -- seeing a burglary that the burglars were actually the ones to kill her.And there's this orange van that is central to the Innocence Projects' analysis and their motion. They say there's a mattress in the van that was not sufficiently tested, tested positive for blood, but was not able to identify whether or not it was Laci Peterson's, came back inconclusive. And so presumably, that's the focus of their case to test all of those items.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a tough argument, because remember Scott Peterson's trial, it's a five month long trial, 180 witnesses and a lot of issues relating to his credibility. Now, the defense argument at the time was, he might be a cheater, he might not be truthful, but it doesn't mean he's a murderer. There was not a lot of direct evidence, it was circumstantial evidence.So in my opinion, the only way this case actually gets overturned, is if there was something very, very dispositive with respect to DNA evidence. But even still, Jake, there's a standard, the standard is, not only does the evidence have to matter, but the evidence has to actually be likely to make the jury go the other way. The court doesn't really want to overturn jury verdict. So it truly depends on what the Innocence Project actually unveils.",
