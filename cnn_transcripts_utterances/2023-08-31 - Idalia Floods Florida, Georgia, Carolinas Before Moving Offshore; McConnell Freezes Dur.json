No one knows whether he will run again, and it's also a question whether Republicans would support him in doing so. At the time, we asked a bunch of Republicans whether they would support McConnell. They did not say if they would continue to serve him in a second term. So that is a big, lingering question. And as you mentioned, Phil, it wasn't just yesterday. There have been multiple health scares involving Mitch McConnell. He had the other freezing incident earlier this year, and he also fell back in March. He tripped; he had a concussion. He broke some ribs. And he was out of the Senate for six weeks. Now, in terms of this latest incident, his office did say he is fine. We're also told that he was calling up some of his allies, and he even attended a fundraising event for Congressman Jim Banks, who's running for Senate. And I want to read you part of the statement from his office. They said, \"Leader McConnell felt momentarily lightheaded and paused during his press conference today. While he feels fine, as a prudential measure, the leader will be consulting a physician prior to his next event.\" But Phil, still no word on what the results of that visit was or whether it actually happened. And still no word on what the underlying cause is of these really alarming freezing moments that keep happening in front of cameras and in front of reporters.

And she has struggled with her health, as well.She was out earlier this year, which caused a lot of problems for Democrats. But she has said that she would retire. So she is planning to retire at the end of her term. Versus Mitch McConnell. He hasn't said what he plans to do. I mean, in fact, ironically, the question that he froze at was a question about whether he would run for reelection again in 2026. So it is a big question.
