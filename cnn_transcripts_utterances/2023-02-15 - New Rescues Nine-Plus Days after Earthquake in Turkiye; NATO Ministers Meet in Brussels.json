Any moment now, Jens Stoltenberg is scheduled to hold a news conference with the president of Poland. We will get you that live when it happens. He earlier welcomed new pledges by allies, which include more heavy weapons and military training. His comments came to after NATO defense ministers met in Brussels met for two days of talks. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia's cruel and unprovoked war in Ukraine plunged Europe into its worst security crisis in decades. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN.

Now the Ukrainian officials have now basically cut off Bakhmut from civilians and the press. They say it's for the safety of those and not an attempt at censorship. In particular, the roads leading into that town are under -- or could be under Russian fire. So it's extremely dangerous. You mentioned that that town is down to a few thousand people, completely depopulated, during the very fierce fighting as people fled Bakhmut. The NATO meetings have been crucial, coming at a crucial time, because there's been a great deal of talk in the last few days about whether the NATO allies of Ukraine can supply the very basic ammunition between the larger caliber ammunition that is needed to withstand wave after wave of Russian attacks in that zone. So Becky, they were relatively obtuse about exactly how they're going to do that. But they do say they maintain their support for Ukraine and that solidarity is vitally important, Becky.",

They identified 43 facilities, most of which were former summer camps, now used, they say, mainly for the political reeducation of these Ukrainian children, exposing them to things like patriotic, cultural, very Russia- centric material. In two cases, in two different camps, they found that they were given specific military education, including the use of firearms. Take a listen, Becky, to what the State Department spokesperson, Ned, Price, had to say about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  The network of facilities where these children are sent is, vast spanning from Russian occupied Crimea, across Russia itself, from the Black Sea region to its far east. Putin seeks to rob Ukraine of its future by taking its children. Russia's system of forced relocation, reeducation and adoption of Ukraine's children is a key element of the Kremlin's systematic efforts to deny and suppress Ukraine identity, its history and its culture.

We ensure the protection of their lives and well-being.\" Now I should note that the report does say that, in many cases, these children were sent to these camps with the consent of their parents but, of course, consent, giving consent in the context of war is problematic in itself. There are instances that they know that children were not returned to their parents on time or at all, and that hundreds of children in these facilities have an unknown status.

She dismissed the notion that it would have anything to do with these political pressures that have been swirling around her lately; namely, we've had this controversy that erupted in Scotland over a double rapist ending up in a female prison, because of how they identified. The British government then overruled that. But that got her into some real political hot water. And there's also been investigations into the finances of her party; her husband has given a large loan to the SNP. And also any politician, who's at the front line of politics for over a decade -- and she's been leader of the SNP and first minister for eight years, deputy before. that -- can't be untarnished.

Remember, NATO was much slower in willingness to provide -- the first few weeks of the war, NATO was saying this guy's going to -- he's going to lose power.
