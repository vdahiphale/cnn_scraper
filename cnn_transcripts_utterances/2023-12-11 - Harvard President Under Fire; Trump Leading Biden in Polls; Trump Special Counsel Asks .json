A key critic and chief political rival of Vladimir Putin is now missing.Allies of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny say they haven't had contact with him in six days. Navalny is serving sentences totally more than 30 years in maximum security penal colonies near Moscow. The news of his disappearance comes just days after Putin announced his intention to run for reelection in March. Want to go now to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who's following these developments.

And it's really something that's been building up over the past couple of days, because his lawyers went to try and see him on Friday in that penal colony about 150 miles east of Moscow, high-security prison where he's being kept. And they were already brushed off back then and told that they couldn't see him. Now, today, he was supposed to appear at a hearing via video link from that penal colony. And the way that his anti-corruption foundation spokespeople tell it, they say that, originally, the people inside that jail said there was some sort of power issue, but then the lawyers asked again, and then the people in the penal colony said that he wasn't even listed as being a prisoner inside that colony anymore. Now, of course, this raised all sorts of alarms among those lawyers, and they then phoned around other prison colonies in that sort of vicinity of that area, Russia obviously a very huge country, and they couldn't -- simply couldn't find him anywhere. And so as of this moment right now, Alexey Navalny's anti-corruption foundation says simply that Alexey Navalny is missing. Now, one of the things that we do have to point out is that, apparently, Alexey Navalny, who has been under very harsh conditions already inside that Russian prison, he was supposed to be transferred to a different prison, which has an even harsher regime. It's not uncommon for prisoners to sort of go AWOL, go silent in the time that they are being transferred to another jail, but, again, right now, there simply is absolutely no information at all. And one of the things that the spokeswoman for Alexey Navalny said is, she said, he has been having some health issues over the past couple of weeks, the past couple of days. Apparently, he fainted inside his jail cell last week and then needed an I.V. This, of course, also one of the things where he's faced those very harsh conditions, a lot of time in solitary confinement. He's lost a lot of weight, so definitely a difficult situation, and now all the more concerns as his loved ones obviously don't know where he is. And, also, those who are inside his organization have say they absolutely have no idea where he is and that he simply is missing inside the Russian prison system, Boris.",

      "sentences": "It's incredibly significant. Here, for the first time, special counsel Jack Smith is going to theSupreme Court and asking them to decide a key question that is being litigated here, which is whether former President Trump is immune from criminal prosecution. Now, that is a very important constitutional question, but it is also something that is being litigated. And, because of that litigation, there are questions about whether this could delay the trial possibly even until after the election. We're talking about a trial that is now scheduled to begin in March of this year. So, here, the special counsel is saying, Supreme Court, we need you to just take this issue and decide it now, because they argue that there's a public interest in making sure that this trial goes ahead as scheduled. Now, right now, Trump has lost at the district court level on this question. He said he's going to appeal. Usually, it would go to the Court of Appeals. But, instead, the special counsel wants the Supreme Court to just take this and decide by the end of the term. Now, they use as precedent a similar situation during the Nixon Watergate investigation. And they say, look, during that case, the Supreme Court was able to take a question and do things in a very expedited manner. Now, alternatively, they said, look, Supreme Court, if you don't want to take up this question, if you don't want to decide this, could you at least tell the Court of Appeals to make their decision very quickly? So, yes, there's a fascinating constitutional question about immunity here, but, really, the true issue here is timing. And the special counsel is trying to ensure that this trial goes ahead as scheduled, even if not as scheduled, that it at least goes off before the election next year.",

That could take months and months. And they'd ultimately draft a decision there, and then it -- which would be appealed to the Supreme Court. Parties are allowed to go straight to the Supreme Court. This is an important constitutional question. It's never been resolved. And that has nothing to do with Donald Trump. It is just a complex question. It has to go to the Supreme Court. Who knows what they're going to do with it. They may -- as Paula said, they may kick it back down to the appeals court and either say, expedite it or simply just answer first this question of immunity.

When I talk to them about when this is going -- when this trial is going to happen, they do believe that the March trial is going to happen before the election, that, of course, being the special counsel's investigation into his overturning or attempting to overturn the 2020 election. But they do still think there is some wiggle room because of the fact that this was going to the appeals court, because of the fact that they believe that they can delay it. I mean, they are going to try and do every single thing they possibly can to push this past the election, because they think that Donald Trump can win the election, and he's not sitting in trial every single day. So that is very interesting in this to me, the fact that they have clearly kind of called them on their game and said, OK, you're waiting here, you pushed us to the appeals court. Now we're just going to get it over with. So that takes one element out, one of the things that actually Trump and his team were relying on, having this be a lengthy process.",

This is a major move that could have a serious impact on the former president's schedule ahead of the 2024 election. And there's new CNN polling that's giving us a clearer picture of where things stand right now in that race. Take a look. In Georgia, a hypothetical rematch shows Donald Trump leading Joe Biden 49 to 44 percent. Obviously, this is if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee. It's notable, though, because Biden narrowly won the Peach State in 2020. A similar story is playing out in Michigan, where the former president is up by 10 points. And that flip is significant, because Biden beat Trump here by a wider margin. Let's break down the numbers with CNN's Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, we will expand more on Georgia and Michigan in a moment. But, first, let's go to the polling in Iowa, because, as I just said, all of that is contingent on Trump becoming the nominee.

But if you look at these numbers, which I think we have, a 32-point lead in Iowa the former president has over DeSantis, over Haley slightly more than that. You can see the change here, 43 percent in October, up to 51 percent now, slightly over the majority. That is significant, DeSantis holding basically steady, up a slight amount and Haley at 16 percent. So, Boris, as this field is contracted, gotten smaller, that has benefited Donald Trump.",
