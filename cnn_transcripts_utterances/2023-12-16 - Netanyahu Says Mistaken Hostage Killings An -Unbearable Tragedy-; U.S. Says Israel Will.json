Sullivan also says the U.S. wants to see results on Israel's intent to avoid civil casualties in Gaza. Sullivan then traveled to Ramallah in the West Bank to meet with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. The White House said they talked about getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza. And Sullivan, quote, \"stressed the importance of enhancing the protection of civilians.\" Let's get more on all of this. Joining us from Ramallah is Dr. Mustafa Barghouti. He is the president of the Palestinian National Initiative and a member of Palestinian parliament. Good morning, good to see you. Let me pick up with what we have heard from Jake Sullivan, saying that Israel will transition to what he called a new phase of the war but also calling for more care to limit civilian casualties. Your reaction to what we heard. DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI, PRESIDENT, PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE: I think what Mr. Sullivan is saying is not enough at all. On the contrary, he's advocating the continuation of this terrible war for months to come. If we count the Palestinians who have been killed, including the ones that are under the rubble, there are more than 25,000 Palestinians killed and 10,000 children killed. Include an addition to 50,000 people injured. How many more people should die? I think this solution is not the continuation of this terrible war, which will take lives of Palestinians as well as Israelis, but to stop the war. Since the 7th of October we have been saying that the best solution is a complete, permanent cease-fire and an exchange of prisoners. Today, as you have mentioned, Israelis are shooting their own prisoners. Up until now, it's not just the last three; 19 others were killed by the Israeli bombardment. And, it is now estimated that more than 300 of them were also killed on the 7th of October by Israeli planes. The solution is immediate and permanent cease-fire and not the continuation of this war.",

Israel says the pause is meant to allow civilians to replenish basic supplies such as food and water. But it's unclear how many people in the area might be aware of the announcement. The internet monetary agency Netrocket (ph) said on Friday that connectivity in Gaza collapsed for more than 24 hours. Meanwhile, Israel's military is investigating after its soldiers mistakenly shot and killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza. The IDF says the three hostages were misidentified as a threat during a military operation in northern Gaza. A UNICEF spokesman says Gaza is now a, quote, \"graveyard for children and living hell for everyone else.\" He warns the kids there are suffering without enough food, water, as well as medicine. Our Jomana Karadsheh has more in this report although we warn you it contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These are the desperate cries of a father left with nothing but his voice, a father who can no longer protect his three vulnerable children. \"I can't survive. They destroyed my house,\" Abu Hamid (ph) says. \"I can't get food. I have no one to support me. I spent the night moving from tent to tent.\" For more than 60 days he's tried to stay strong until he could no more. His disabled children, homeless, hungry and hurting from Gaza's war. \"What do you do when your child needs you when you've got nothing left to give? \"Have mercy on us,\" Abu Hamid (ph) says. No mercy for the people of this besieged land, it seems. Rain of blessing, they used to say. Now it only brings more to spare. For those forced out of their homes, life has become this miserable existence, as rains flood their makeshift camps. It's a harsh winter that's only just beginning. Omali (ph) shows us the tiny tent she lives in with 11 others, her two daughters and grandchildren. She spent the night, trying to catch the rain that dripped through the roof of their flimsy shelter. \"This is humiliation,\" Omali (ph) says. \"I have these children without a father. I can't take it anymore. Even children now hate life,\" she says. It's just too much for parents to bear when you can't even keep your children dry, warm and clean, as diseases start to spread and the aid they so badly need now a weapon in this war. \"I want to protect my children,\" this mother says. \"The bombings and destruction are not enough. On top of that now we have the rain, cold and illnesses.\" To be a parent in Gaza is a blessing turned into torture for those who no longer wonder if but how they and their children will die. Abu Hamid (ph) says he was sitting, thinking of how he will feed his children when an airstrike hit. \"Where do I take my children?\" he says. \"I fled and came here to die? \"I gave my children my everything. Who will take care of them if I die?\" Like many in Gaza, it's not only Israel they blame. They want Hamas to stop a war for which they paid the price, abandoned, alone as the world won't stop their pain. Six-year-old Lana (ph) was under the rubble of her home for three days. \"Mommy and daddy are underneath it,\" she says. \"I just want mama. I want baba. I want my family,\" Lana cries.

What we're talking about here is the underlying intelligence thatformed the basis of the U.S. government's assessment that Vladimir Putin sought to help Trump win the 2016 election. The disappearance of this binder was so alarming to intelligence officials that they briefed Senate Intelligence Committee leadership about the situation last year and were told by one U.S. official familiar with the matter that this was not among the classified items found in last year's search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. So more than two years later, it appears this binder is still missing. But my colleagues and I closely followed the trail of this intelligence from the CIA to the White House. Trump had spent years trying to declassify material that he said would prove his claims that the Russia investigation was a hoax. And this intelligence was part of a massive collection of documents that he ordered brought to the White House. There was a sort of frantic scramble in the final days of the administration to redact them, so they could be declassified and released publicly. Now on his last full day as president, Trump did issue a declassification order for some of the materials and the FBI has published some of it on its website. But after that, things get a little murky. We don't know what happened to the binder that went missing. there is one theory that has emerged from testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, the former top aide to former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. She told the January 6th committee that she was, quote, \"almost positive\" it went home with Mr. Meadows. She said it had been kept in a safe in Meadows' office when it was not being worked on. And she also wrote about this in her new book, claiming that, on January 19th, the final night of the Trump presidency, that she saw Meadows leave the White House with an unredacted binder, quote, \"tucked under his arm.\" Now Mark Meadows' attorney strongly denies this. He said in a statement, quote, \"Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of and adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material. \"Any such material that he handled or was in his possession has been treated accordingly. And any suggestion that he is responsible for any missing binder or other classified information is flat wrong.\" So at this point the mystery of this missing binder remains just that, a mystery -- Katie Bo Lillis, CNN, Washington.

Let me show you how they get into the U.S. smugglers on the Mexican side cut the border wall. Then on the U.S. side, you see these white markings, these are repairs to the border wall. These pieces of metal are welded on to close the gaps. Take a look at this one because this is not just a freshly cut border wall. It was just repaired last week. Now I do not want to mess with the integrity of the border wall. But if I were to swing this open, this would swing and that is how migrants are able to slip into the United States. This just shows you all of these repairs, just how relentless the smugglers are at crossing people into the U.S. and making a buck -- Rosa Flores, CNN, Lukeville, Arizona. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

According to the autopsy, Perry's live-in assistant found him unresponsive in the pool of his Malibu home. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes a closer look at the report here.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Sadly, here's what we do know after reading this 30-page report from the medical examiner's office. They list acute effects of ketamine as the cause of his death, Matthew Perry's death, along with drowning, coronary artery disease and buprenorphine effects. To give you some context of the ketamine, the dosing that they found, the levels that they found were around 3,200 nanograms per milliliter. To tell you what that means, sometimes ketamine can be used in anesthesia and typically the levels there are seen between 1,000 and 6,000. So he had a lot of ketamine in his system. A couple of important points, it is still incredibly rare, even at those levels, for someone to die of ketamine intoxication. Unfortunately, he was also in the swimming pool at the time. And it sounds like that, in combination with the ketamine, is likely what led to his death. As one medical examiner told us, the ketamine probably is not what ended up killing him but made it more possible for him to drown. That is kind of what we know at this point. They do know that some ketamine was found in his stomach, which suggests he swallowed it. Ketamine can be taken in swallowing it, you can snort it, you can inject it. And there's different rates of onset. Injection is obviously the fastest. If you swallow it, it can take a half hour to an hour for it to take effect. It's possible he took this ketamine before it really took any effect. He was in the swimming pool. The ketamine caused a significant disassociation, which is what it typically does. And that's ultimately what led him to drown. He also had buprenorphine in his system, which is a synthetic opioid. We don't know why he was taking these together. But at times buprenorphine can actually be used to help dampen some of the hallucinogenic effects of something like ketamine. It's a sad story. It's just sad all around. But this is what the medical examiner has concluded, that ketamine, in conjunction with him being in a swimming pool, is most likely what led to his death. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
