The deputy head of the office of the presidency here today saying that more than 1.5 million households are currently without power, some 40% of the country's power plants have either been destroyed or severely damaged. And it's really nearly two weeks now that we have had this kind of relentless targeting of civilian infrastructure, which by the way is prohibited.The UN came out last night and a meeting of the Office of Human Rights and said that they're now really fearful that you're talking about millions of ordinary Ukrainians who as temperatures get colder this winter could be facing severe deprivation, if not life endangering conditions. So, make no mistake about it these, this new tactic is having a real impact on the ground, and Ukrainian authorities are trying to get their arms around it by asking for more help with air defense systems.

Again, that could potentially constitute a war crime, because these children don't have any agency and making that decision for themselves. And many of them even if they are living in foster care, or orphanages, or homes of some sort still have family members here in Ukraine who say that they want them back and that they never agreed to this kind of forcible deportation to Russia. It's very difficult, as you mentioned, to get any sense of the actual numbers here. Certainly, it appears to be in the thousands.We've seen Russian state TV, and the past few weeks sort of trumpeting these images of young Ukrainian children arriving in Russia to sort of, you know, Russian grandmother types with Teddy Bears who are welcoming them with open arms, but the reality is, beneath the facade, this is a very sinister tactic, indeed, but one that is very difficult also to combat.",

It details the wide-ranging pressure campaign that Donald Trump enacted throughout our government from the Department of Justice to state officials to his former Vice President Mike Pence, to try and get his way with the election. It talks about how Trump oversaw the plan to submit fake electors to Congress on his behalf.And it cites Trump as being partially responsible for summoning this violent mob to the Capitol because the committee says Trump knew that protesters in the crowd were armed and he did nothing to stop the violence for hours as he was watching it unfold on TV. So, in addition to laying all that out, the committee requests a wide range of documents from Trump, including his conversations on January 6, and whether or not he spoke to any of the witnesses that have also testified to the committee.

Had those charges dismissed. There was a judge in Miami that says the prosecutor in the case did not have jurisdiction over the alleged offense.We want to dig deeper now on this issue. Neil Volz, the Deputy Director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition joins us this morning. His group is working with attorneys to review these cases and potentially help some of those who were arrested. Neil, we're grateful that you're sharing part of your weekend with us. In 2018, you and your organization were involved in the effort to help Floridians with certain felony convictions regain the right to vote. I'm curious what was your reaction to seeing these arrests?",

But ultimately, that state is responsible for updating the -- and managing the voter rolls and verifying voter eligibility. And what these stories show us is that the system that we're dealing with is broken specifically on the front end of the process where that voter verification process takes place.The truth is, none of these people should have been arrested in the first place if the voter verification process was working properly. I mean, think about it, I'm somebody with a past conviction. If I were to go register for food stamps, or some sort of government services, very quickly, they're going to tell me I'm eligible or not eligible, and the front end of the process, and everything else takes its course from there. We're talking about something much more sacred than government services. We're talking about people's voices in our democracy, we should be able to have a standard that exists in other states where they have a voter verification process on the front end and a statewide database that works. That's not asking too much. And we believe this is the moment where we can challenge people that lead, make this a priority. We can spend money fixing this problem on the front end, rather than spending money on law enforcement and the courts and seeing our own fellow citizens in such pain. There's a better way to do this.",

With leadership and courage, we can make sure that we can follow the old adage of all law enforcement professionals who will tell you the best way to fight crime is to stop it from happening in the first place.

      "sentences": "Boris, Amara, mortgage rates are more than double what they were at the start of the year when the average 30-year was closer to 3 percent. This means that buying the same house today cost much more than even just a few months ago.For example, if you bought a $390,000 home today and put down 20 percent, that same home costs an additional $700 more every month, and that's causing buyers to sit out this market. The data this week shows that sales of existing homes in September fell nearly 24 percent compared to last year and down 1.5 percent compared to the previous month. So why are mortgage rates rising so much? Well, like many things in this economy, the answer lies with the Fed. As the Fed tries to cool inflation by slowing spending, it's been raising its key interest rate. That then impacts borrowing costs for us, consumers, including mortgage rates. And in the housing market, we're absolutely seeing a slowdown and spending. Existing home sales have fallen for eight months in a row. But what about home prices? Well, supply is still tight, so prices have yet to slow in a meaningful way. Prices are still on average higher than they were a year ago, although slowing on a month-to-month basis. So what's a buyer to do? Well, I talked to Dottie Herman she's a real estate pro with Douglas Elliman who said if you can still afford to buy, you might have better luck negotiating with the seller in this market. But the key words are, if you can still afford to buy. Boris, Amara.",
