And all of the issues that Starliner suffered while in space -- the thruster failures, the helium leaks -- did not prove to be a problem when it did the deorbit burn, pumped the brakes and reentered the Earth's atmosphere.

And so now, Boeing and NASA are going to be looking at all the data NASA needs to decide if it's going to require Boeing to conduct another crude flight test before it's fully certified to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As for Butch and Suni, they are going to be up there until February of 2025 before they hitch a ride back on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. That's essentially the backup here. But NASA administrator Bill Nelson says that's what this program is all about, the commercial crew program. Its about having a backup system, redundancy. If one spacecraft fails, there's another spacecraft run by a different company that can bring these astronauts home. So this is what the commercial crew program was designed for. I just don't think anybody thought that this backup system would be tested quite as early as it was needed -- at the Johnson Space Center, I'm Kristin Fisher, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The former president was found guilty on 34 charges of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Meanwhile, in the E.

But nonetheless, look, it's Michigan; it is a battleground state. We know that it's important. But also he's here to sign an executive order, a labor related executive order, trying to increase protections for workers and increased benefits for workers as well. But he also went after the former president Trump in a pretty significant way. Obviously, he's not running for president anymore, President Biden. Kamala Harris, who is running for that spot. But nonetheless, Biden took the time to mention Harris as part of his accomplishments but also go after the former president, even getting emotional at times, talking about his son, Beau, and about previous reporting around the former president. That's where he allegedly described those that have been captured and killed, military members, as suckers and losers. Now look, Michigan, as I mentioned, battleground state, a state that Biden only won by about 150,000 votes in 2020. And so every visit makes a difference.

He's going to be focusing all of his energy on the swing states that I mentioned, like Pennsylvania, like Georgia. I mean, Pennsylvania is obviously a must- win; North Carolina, he is putting a lot of energy into North Carolina as well. And we're seeing that this is going to be, as was already mentioned, just one of the tightest races we've ever seen. And we're really looking at the polls and how accurate they are. The polls were not very accurate in 2016 or 2020. They were a lot more accurate in 2022 and that has to do with the fact that Trump voters don't tend to vote in midterms. They do tend to vote in presidential elections and they don't tend to respond to polling. But what is looking favorable for Kamala Harris is that there's a lot more enthusiasm on the Democrat side, according to a recent Gallup poll; 78 percent of Democrats are enthused to vote for their candidate, compared to 64 percent of Republicans. And polls don't accurately capture enthusiasm or who is actually going to come out to vote on Election Day. That might be somewhere where the polls underestimate her support. And I think that's what she's hoping for.",

Authorities say at least 17 students were killed and 14 injured after the fire broke out in the male dormitory at an academy in the central part of the country.The cause of the fire is still unclear; 70 children are unaccounted for. It's unclear if the death toll could grow. Officials say some parents did not inform school officials when they picked up their children. The cause of the fire is being investigated. A Pakistani man who lives in Toronto has been arrested and charged with plotting to attack Jews in New York City. Officials say the attack was planned for the anniversary of the October 7 terror attacks in Israel. The U.S. Justice Department alleges that 20-year-old Muhammad Shahzeb Khan was going to carry out the attack in the name of ISIS. Officials say Khan discussed his plans on an encrypted messaging app but, unknown to him, he was speaking to undercover law enforcement officers. He was arrested in Canada on Wednesday while making his way toward the U.S. border. He faces terror charges in both Canada and the U.S. Two University of Pittsburgh students are speaking out after they were attacked while on campus. The students believe they were attacked because they're Jewish at a time when heated protests are taking place over Israel's war on Hamas and its impact on Gaza. CNN's Gabe Cohen reports.
