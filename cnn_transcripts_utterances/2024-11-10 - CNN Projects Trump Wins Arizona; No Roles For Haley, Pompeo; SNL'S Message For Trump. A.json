CNN projects he will win Arizona of the battlegrounds. Two big names scratched from consideration for a second Trump administration. Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo will not take part. And Saturday Night Live sends a blunt message to the president-elect in its holdup. Five days after Tuesday's presidential election, the final state has now been called. CNN can project Donald Trump wins the state of Arizona, which means, despite the Harris campaign spending a billion dollars, they did not win a single one of those seven battleground states. Of course, there was such, such focus in all of them. The total electoral count now stands at 312 for Donald Trump, 226 for Kamala Harris. This news comes as the transition process itself is in full swing for the president elect. A source telling CNN that Trump's team, though, has not submitted yet any transition agreements with the Biden administration, in part, because of the mandatory ethics agreement. While we wait for more information on who's actually in for a second Trump administration. We are learning who's out. His former rival and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join the new administration. Here's Alayna Treene with more.",

      "sentences": "President-elect Donald Trump spent his Saturday locked down at Mar-a-Lago meeting with his transition team and going through a series of candidates that he is considering selecting for top cabinet roles as well as White House positions.Now, on Saturday, he did not announce new people that will be serving in his second administration, but he did announce who would not be. He talked about not wanting his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or his former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to have any part in his second term. I'm going to read for you some of what he wrote. He said, quote, I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation. I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously and would like to thank them for their service to our country. Make America great again. Now, to give you a little bit of context on where some of this is coming from, Mike Pompeo is someone who many people in Donald Trump's inner orbit still are close to and believe that he did a good job as secretary of state. However, his relationship with Donald Trump has really soured in recent years, particularly because Pompeo had, in many ways, distanced himself from the former president after he had left office in January of 2021. I'd remind you as well that Pompeo did not endorse Donald Trump until after the Republican primaries this year, something that, as we know, Donald Trump Donald Trump viewed as not being as loyal to him. And in my conversations with senior advisers they argued that in private conversations over the past few days now Donald Trump had asked them whether or not Pompeo would be loyal to him or whether he could trust him in a second term. Now, as for Haley's part, Donald Trump has said that he appreciates that she had gotten up on stage at the Republican National Convention in July, called for unity. And also remember, she had actually been in discussions with the Trump campaign in the final weeks before Election Day about potentially meeting for a joint appearance and helping him campaign. That never materialized. But, again, Donald Trump had said he appreciated that on some level. However, I am told that the president elect still harbors a lot of animosity toward Haley for the attacks that she had lobbed at him during the Republican primary, but also that she had remained in the primary for so long. Donald Trump has remarked that he believes that she hung on longer than was appropriate. Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.",

The president-elect said to view that role as the most important in his administration. Among those on the possible list, so far, a senator, a former intelligence official, and three state attorneys general. Missouri Senator Eric Schmidt may be a strong pick.[03:05:001 He previously served as Missouri's attorney general and was also at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate on election night. Meantime, the president-elect and the current president will meet at the White House on Wednesday. It's a political tradition to hold the meeting, one that projects, of course, a peaceful transfer of power. However, the last one was not, in fact, four years ago, it was actually back in 2020, 2016, between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. Donald Trump did not host Biden four years ago as he was, of course, fighting the election results at the time, claiming, in fact, that Biden had not won. An official says Melania Trump has also been invited to meet with First Lady Jill Biden. Well, the race for the White House, of course, is over. The battle to control Congress, though, has yet to be settled. Republicans have secured the Senate, but the House is still up for grabs. Right now, Democrats have 205 seats, Republicans 213. Of course, the magic number for a majority is 218. Of course, it means Republicans are just five seats away. As you can see, there are still 17 seats that have not yet been called, including some races in California where Democrats could pick up some seats. Meantime, in the Senate, as I noted, Republicans do have control with at least a 52 seat majority. Natasha Lindstaedt is a professor of government at the University of Essex and joins from Colchester, England, at this hour. It's great to have you here, Natasha. So, when we look at where things stand in terms of that balance of power, we're waiting on those final 17 races, of course, to be called so that we know what the balance is in the House, what's interesting as all this, you know, soul searching is going on in the Democratic Party is that in a lot of down ballot races, Democrats actually did better than the vice president did at the top of the ticket, even minimizing some of the Senate losses. And we're waiting to see, of course, the final tally for house seats. Is there a sense yet of why things played out that way that the down ballot Democrats would do better?",

      "sentences": "So, it's a really good question. I think the Democrats will be going through all the data to try to figure out what happened. So, there were more elections in 2024 than there has been in a long time and incumbents nationally. All did poorly. So, this is part of a bigger trend, that there was a lot of angst towards incumbents.And Kamala Harris couldn't escape the fact that she was attached to Joe Biden was the incumbent who had a low approval rating and whose approval rating was affected by the fact that about a third of the American public believed Donald Trump's lies that the election was fraudulent. So, it was difficult to overcome that. It was also difficult for her to overcome this national perception that the economy wasn't going well, and this was repeated again and again on Fox News and other different outlets and that Donald Trump was going to fix it. There was also problems with just the Democratic brand nationally, and this is where Harris' candidacy may have come into play, that maybe there's the perception that she was far to the left, that she's from California, that she was embracing some of these cultural issues that turn off Republican and moderate or independent voters. And if you look at the down ballot races, you see that the Democratic candidates more closely are able to match what their constituencies want they weren't necessarily bogged down or tied down by whatever Biden's approval rating were and they're more in touch with their local communities. But I think the Democrats will have to look further into what happened and I'm sure they're going through the data. I think the bigger issue is there just wasn't great turnout. Democrats in the areas where they really need to turn out to be strong and we can see a huge divide in terms of how many -- excuse me, a huge jump in terms of how many people voted for Biden in 2020 versus Harris in 2024 turnout just wasn't that great.",

There's a lot of speculation about who, in fact, could end up with the nomination to be Donald Trump's attorney general.Loyalty is very important to the president-elect as we know, and as we certainly saw in that first term. We've also heard a lot about retribution and a sense of how he would like to use the Justice Department when he is back in office. What about the guardrails that are in place to prevent that currently? LINDSTEADT: So, I'm pretty concerned that we don't have the guardrails in place that we did in 2016. I mean, there've been great books written on this, that there was a lot of bureaucratic resistance to Trump's more crazy policies, that they just wouldn't implement them. He was also surrounded by people who understood democratic processes and wouldn't let him get away with some of his more extreme or insane ideas. This time around, he is going to surround himself only with those who are undyingly loyal. We see this already with the report on not wanting Mike Pompeo to be a member of the cabinet, not wanting Nikki Haley, and she surely wasn't loyal enough by his standards. And he's definitely going to want to pick an attorney general that is his personal attorney, that isn't really an attorney general for the United States, but it is focused on whatever his own personal grievances may be. Is it going after his political opponents? Is it trying to send a clear message that you don't cross Donald Trump? He wants to surround himself by those that are going to tell him what he wants to hear. And he's going to have fewer and fewer people that will push against him. And I think that's one of my major concerns.",

Good to have you with us. So, when we look at where things stand, there's a lot of question about what exactly a role would be for Elon Musk, whether or not he would have some sort of a cabinet role. It seems to be the thinking is no, that there would not then be, of course, a Senate confirmation process. But, you know, there are some other rules and regulations in place. Is there anything to sort of stand in the way in terms of a guardrail when it comes to Elon Musk helping the president-elect and Elon Musk helping his own businesses? MARK HARVEY, AUTHOR, CELEBRITY INFLUENCE, POLITICS, PERSUASION, AND ISSUE-BASED ADVOCACY: Yes, I in this administration, I don't think that there will be any guardrails in that way. I mean, even if you look to the last administration, you know, he broke taboos in terms of having members of his own family as key advisers. And I honestly think that he could put Musk in there, but I don't know that it would serve him necessarily any more than just having him come in and be an adviser. And so I suspect that probably would be the plan that he would anticipate.

Here's CNN's Rafael Romo. RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The messages appear to have been sent using free phone service and mobile data providers.
