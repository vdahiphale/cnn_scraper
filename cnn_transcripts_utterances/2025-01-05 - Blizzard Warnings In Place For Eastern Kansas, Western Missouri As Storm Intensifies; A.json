It's going to go into the Midwest, the Ohio Valley, and eventually into the Mid-Atlantic over the next 24 to 48 hours.So here is a live look at St. Louis. Again, kind of the gloomy skies. But notice here this little walkway. You've got that thin coating of ice and wintry weather on the ground there. Do not worry, this is a statue, not a live person. No one is standing out there. The temperature right now, 25 degrees there. It is very cold. A lot of these areas already have that coating of ice on the ground. Look at all of these locations. At least a quarter of an inch of ice. Keep in mind, that's not only enough to coat the roads, obviously, but also your power lines, your trees to cause power outages. And Colby, Kansas, getting dangerously close to half an inch of ice accumulation. Now, we talked about this yesterday. It's going to be that coating of ice first. Then the snow is going to come down on top of it for some of these places, which makes it even more dangerous because you simply cannot see it. Here's a look at what we've got. And we've got a plethora out there. We've got snow. We've got ice. We've got rain, thunderstorms, and even thundersleet in a few spots here. You can see places like Wichita, Kansas City, St. Louis, depending on which part of the city or suburb you live in, there's a little bit of everything mixed in all three of those cities. The winter weather alerts stretch essentially from Colorado all the way over to New Jersey. You're talking 1,500 miles of winter weather alerts from various components here that we're talking about. Now, there are two main major impacts that we are expecting with this. The very dangerous, if not impossible, travel conditions in some of these locations. And also the potential for those widespread power outages, especially in the red areas. And also this spot right here where you see the purple, that is a level 4 of 4. It does not get any higher than this. The extreme category right there near the Indiana-Kentucky state line. This is where we're looking at the potential for substantial disruptions to daily life. Again, not just the power outages, but also on the roadways. The system itself will gradually spread into portions of the Midwest and the Ohio Valley as we go through the day today. Starting off tomorrow morning, the main concern is really going to be the Mid- Atlantic. That includes Washington, D.C., places like Baltimore. Then by tomorrow night, finally, the low pressure system goes back out over the water. But you still have some of that residual moisture kind of on the back flank of the system. So it's not necessarily meaning that the precipitation itself is done. When we talk about snowfall totals, this wide swath of pink that you can see in here, you're talking 10 to 12 inches of snow. On the southern side, it may not look like the snow totals are as high, but that's because a lot of that is actually going to be ice first and then the snow on top of it. So you're going to have at least a quarter of an inch of ice in many of these places, with up to three quarters of an inch possible on the high end of that. We also have the severe component on the south side of this, where, yes, we could also have some damaging winds and even some tornadoes.",

Four years ago, you know, we all watched in horror as a mob stormed into the Capitol, erected a noose outside, you know, defecation smeared on the walls of the Capitol, the Speaker's office ransacked, legislators running for their lives, guns pulled, a person lost their life. It was absolute chaos and confusion.And so, we now know, which a lot of us didn't know, that January 6th is specified in the Constitution as kind of what had been a ceremonial transfer of power to a very serious one, where we now have to wonder on Monday, is this all going to work as it's supposed to? And so, you've got, you know, people with long guns and all kinds of security around the Capitol. But, you know, four years ago, we watched in absolute horror. I remember being on the air, and we just couldn't believe what we were watching. And I think this should be a moment of reflection for all of us that, you know, we can't take this for granted. If somebody decides, as was determined four years ago, that they want to engage in a seditious conspiracy, that they want to rile up a mob, that they want to storm the Capitol and try and stop the transfer of power, there are people who can and will do something like that.

I mean, you know, I just didn't -- I never saw that as some kind of a powerful faction fight. It was really more like people who just couldn't get along, didn't like each other, and tried to undercut each other in some really unfortunate ways that ground Congress to a halt.

And then later today, we will see him host new Democratic members of Congress here at the White House for a reception.",

Juliette, good morning. Look, we were saying a lot going on. Congress meets tomorrow to certify the election results. President Jimmy Carter's National Funeral Service is going to take place on Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. And that's where all living presidents will be expected to attend.And then, of course, on January 20th, President-elect Trump will be inaugurated. So the security posture will be quite high over the next couple of weeks. What are you going to be watching for?",

January 20th, inauguration, also is.So essentially, because of the insurrection four years ago, because of Trump's involvement in that insurrection and lack of clarity about what we could have -- what we might've anticipated in January, essentially January already was lockdown month for D.C. That means that the Secret Service is in charge, that the federal agencies are going to take leadership role to minimize the harm. From the threat environment, it's very different now. Trump won. There's no questions about the fact that he did won decisively. And for someone like me, what I'm looking at now is less the dates, we know January 6th and January 20th. And some of this talk by President- Elect Donald Trump about having a rally on January 19th, it seems unnecessary. But nonetheless, if he decides to have it, will be an additional security concern.",

I mean, in some ways, the January 19th just seems sort of, an additional burden that the president-elect might consider is unnecessary for a safety and security apparatus that needs to be focused on the constitutional moment, which is January 20th. The fact it's in a stadium is, it makes it a little bit better in the sense that it can't be secure. But it will be tremendous pressure on the law enforcement and first responders essentially that entire week.I will say there isn't -- in the threat environment, there isn't a lot going on in terms of people who oppose the president, at least in terms of organizers. There's no women's march. There's nothing major like that. But of course, the president-elect has been -- you know, has had two assassination attempts on his life. Those people's ideology is unknown -- or not unknown, but it's just it's hard to say decisively what where they're coming from. We saw also another event on January 1st, Las Vegas blow up of the Tesla truck. You know, it's clearly targeted or about Donald Trump, even though -- even that motivation seems to come from someone who supports Donald Trump. So, a long way of saying you can't -- you know, in this day and age, we can't sort of say these -- a certain ideology is leading to violence. It's just that the threat environment is higher, and the more we can do to lower it, the more beneficial that will be for the constitutional moment that Donald Trump, you know, earned, which is January 20th.",

So, compare that, say, to Election Day, where there was a lot of concern about what might happen in swing state capitals. All the focus will be on D.C. That is why President Biden is -- I mean, essentially by declaring tomorrow an SSE and January 20th, the Special Security Event, you're essentially just saying D.C. is going to be in a lockdown posture.

One of those excerpts said, time to wake up. We are being led by weak and feckless leadership only -- who only serve to enrich themselves. The day before this explosion, he sent an e-mail to some online media outlets saying that he was armed and that he had a vehicle borne improvised explosive device. U.S. officials had also told CNN that he had visited the Army Military Behavioral Health Program in recent months and was diagnosed with depression last year, but was not assessed to be a risk for violence toward others or toward himself.
