The campaign says it is sold out at 5,000 people attending.But behind all the star power is a serious concern about President Biden's prospects. And just how tight the 2024 race will be. CNN chief national affairs correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, is here with us, along with presidential historian and author, Douglas Brinkley, professor of history at Rice University. Great to have both of you. Jeff, let's start first with you. You and our colleague, M.J. Lee, write in this new piece that it is an all-hands-on-deck moment. What more did you learn about what's going on behind the scenes with these former presidents talking with the current president.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I mean, there be no two bigger political animals than Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, probably. So they read the same polls that the Biden campaign reads.And they know that this is a tough spot for President Biden. I'm told by advisers to former President Barack Obama that he has grave concerns about the election. He does believe it's an all-hands-on-deck moment. What that means is the Democrats should come together, in their words. That's probably the biggest benefit of all this. Yes, the $25 million is important. It needs to be -- run on TV ads and other things and to build the structure. But I think the biggest thing here they're hoping as to really unify the Democratic Party and get Democrats on board with President Biden. So that's the point here. And there probably also are too few people who both won reelection. Biden, of course, is trying. So there's a bit of a competitive spirit here that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama can explain the Biden challenge and his record perhaps better than Joe Biden, himself. So that could be another big benefit from this event tonight.",

We rate the State of the Union addresses in U.S. history and Biden had a great one, because it reassured Democrats. Bill Clinton has just finished writing a second volume of his memoir called \"My Life\" coming out next year. Barack Obama is building a huge presidential center with his wife in Chicago. They've been busy. But this is important. This is the beginning of Biden getting the big- time help. There are no two surrogates that are going to unify the Democrats and help Joe Biden more than Clinton and Obama. And then Michelle Obama is coming in later, working with Jill Biden. So this is a real morale boost for the Democrats. And that's a lot of money for a fundraiser.",

Perhaps some of that is because President Clinton might have a little more time on his hands. He's not engaged in as many different ventures and projects.But he's also a true political animal. He understands the country. And the loss that Hillary Clinton had in 2016 is still hangs over all of this as well. So the notion of defeating Donald Trump is the all-hands-on-deck moment for all of these. But I was talking to a former adviser to President Obama who said he believes that the president views this as the final act of there for partnership, to really try and help bring him over the finish line. So Bill Clinton also is so astute about what's going on in the country with voters. He still has a good sense of things. So you know that he's still those conversations President Biden.",

You get in there and just say anything, do anything.Biden is, by-and-large, trying to take a high road. But he's going to need help to hang in there with his polling. And I talked to Bill Clinton not too long ago and he reminded me why he does talk to Biden a lot. Because when Clinton was president, he said, you know, I used to talk to Richard Nixon a lot. Nixon knew a lot about the world and had a lot of ideas that Bill Clinton would lean on. So even though they were opposed, that's kind of a tradition. And Bill Clinton getting advice from him about politics is one of the best things you can do. And Barack Obama maybe one of the two or three largest superstars in the world. And particularly if Biden seems to look lethargic with black voters. Barack Obama, double time, tripled time, giving speeches and working with that particular demographic and hitting young people. It's going to make a real difference. So I think, from now on, you're going to be looking at Biden is representing American tradition. While you're looking at Trump as being somebody that's facing indictments, criminal charges, and as the aberration in our nation's history.",

The policies apply to federal agencies and expand on an executive order signed by President Biden back in October.Agencies must name a chief AI officer, publish online when they use AI, assess and address risks to Americans rights and safety. One way the White House is hoping to protect peoples' rights is by letting flyers say no to facial recognition scans when you go through airport security. Here now to help break this down for us is Thomas Germain, senior reporter for \"Gizmodo.\" Thomas, great to have you on. Thanks so much. Part of the White House's plan is assessing potential risks of AI. Ai is obviously new and evolving pretty much daily. But generally, what kind of risks does this technology pose in this situation? THOMAS GERMAIN, SENIOR REPORTER, \"GIZMODO\": Yes, that's a great question. People generally have the impression that computers are unbiased and they don't share some of the problems that a human being making decisions might. But in reality, they reflect a lot of the same issues that we have across our society. Facial recognition is a perfect example. There have been numerous studies over the years that show that facial recognition is less accurate when it's identifying people of color or women or children. And the reality is, is that algorithms carry the same problems that are baked into the data that's used to build them. So as a result, we often ends up with real issues of bias and other kinds of problems that can crop up when these algorithms and tools are used unsupervised.",

And in fact, we don't really.A couple of years ago, using facial recognition as an example again, there was a congressional hearing in which a number of intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice we're brought before Congress and they weren't able to answer questions about whether or not they we're using facial recognition or how often these tools were being used. Because they're not required to document the use of that information. And it's not just facial recognition. There are all kinds of different applications of artificial intelligence across a swath of different parts of public life. But for now, we really don't have any system setup to keep track of the way AI is being used and to hold our government officials accountable.",

In part, because we don't even know what artificial intelligence is going to be used for six months from now, let alone over the next decade.But we have seen regulators in other parts of the world setup really sensible, simple safeguards. For example, in Europe, there are rules where you can't use artificial intelligence for sensitive decision-making processes or -- or law enforcement, things like that, where regulators feel that it's important to have a human making those decisions instead of a robot. So far, we really haven't seen any truly meaningful artificial intelligence regulation in the United States.
