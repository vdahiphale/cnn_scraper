This is the incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto, 50.1 percent to Adam Laxalt, the Republican challenger, 47.0 percent. He started surging in the polls very late into the game. We'll see if that momentum will carry him through. The Democrat leading in that race right now though.Let's get you to Wisconsin. Democrat Mandela Barnes still trailing Republican Senator Ron Johnson. Ron Johnson, 50.6 percent of the votes. He's the incumbent. Mandela Barnes, Democratic Challenger, 49.2 percent of the vote. There is Georgia up on your screen. Everyone watching Georgia really closely. The Republican Herschel Walker there with 48.8. trailing just a little bit with 96 percent of the estimated vote in. Raphael Warnock who is the incumbent 49.1 percent of the vote. But here's, if no one gets a 50 percent in this race, that could go to a runoff. The head of elections there saying it probably will be a runoff. CNN is not declaring that yet. We still have a lot of runways to go here before we make that declaration. And let's go on to Pennsylvania now. A huge night for the Democrat there. John Fetterman is the projected winner for the Senate race in Pennsylvania, defeating the TV doctor Mehmet Oz. Standing by right now our very own of the wall -- of the magic wall here, and that is none other than Mr. John Berman. John, where are we when it comes to -- (CROSSTALK)",

You can see the four remaining states to call are Georgia, which by the way, Gabe Sterling who works in the secretary of state's office says is going to go to a rundown. I'll come back to that in just a second. Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona. In Wisconsin, the Republican Ron Johnson is ahead narrowly. We haven't called that race yet.

So, at 10.15, at 10.15, which was the first time we saw votes, Joe Biden was ahead by 218,000 votes. That was with 72 percent in. He was ahead by 218,000. That feels comfortable, but then by 5 a.m. he had actually grown it ever so slightly to 130,000.The next day though, it starts to drop, 93,000. By Thursday it's down to 68,000. Then on Sunday it's down to 18,000, less than a one-point lead, and it's not called basically till a week after that. And the reason I wanted to show you that is, yes, right now you have Mark Kelly in the lead there by 15 points. But that could shrink. It shrunk for Joe Biden as more votes came in.

This is something that one of the first things he said when he spoke to his crowd of supporters, say, I didn't expect that we would turn every single one of those counties red, but it was important to have the conversation in those counties.He also talked about being proud of what he ran on. Things like protecting a woman's right to choose, raising the minimum wage, fighting for a union way of life and protecting, or he said standing up for our democracy. But as we've been saying for the last several days and weeks now, this seat, this Senate seat in Pennsylvania was Democrats best opportunity to pick up a seat. It's a -- it's currently held by the retiring GOP Senator Pat Toomey. This was the most expensive race in the country by a long shot with more than -- with nearly $375 million spent on this race, and Democrats succeeded in flipping this seat. Now we are in Bethlehem. This is in North Hampton County. You're talking about swing county, swing states. This is a swing county in a swing state. This is a county that has generally been known as a bellwether county, one that ends up usually tracking with the statewide result. And that is what we saw again in this election. Fetterman won here this in this county by more than 6,000 votes. So once again, as North Hampton went, so went Pennsylvania. Now, how did he do it? He did have a lot of help. He had big help from big names like President Joe Biden who was here campaigning for him, as well, as former President Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris, and that big endorsement from Oprah Winfrey over the weekend. And in fact, we just learned a few minutes ago that President Biden has sent Fetterman a congratulatory text this morning, one of his many congratulatory calls.

But President Biden only went to certain places. You've seen he has been very busy tonight. Busier than some White House aides had been expecting, certainly some Democrats when it came to congratulatory calls that he was placing from the White House tonight. One was a text to John Fetterman. You can see here many calls that President Biden was making tonight. So, let's talk about all of this. You know, White House officials were saying, we are not so hopeful about the House. We'll see what happens with the Senate and with Fetterman.

Tonight, it is possible that Democrats are going to win a bunch of states where Biden's rating was equivocal or not really so good. I mean, in Pennsylvania, I think it was 46, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada all down in the -- in the low -- in the 40 percent range. And so, I think what we saw, in many ways was what I called in October, a double negative election. A majority of voters said they disapproved of Biden, and that did exert a downward pull on Democratic candidates. But the impact of that was bounded by the fact that a majority of voters, a bigger number of voters were unfavorable toward Trump. And that allowed Democrats to hold together more of the anti-Trump coalition from '18 and '20 than you would've expected from the attitudes about Biden and the economy, and certainly allowed them to dodge the worst and maybe even get a surprisingly good outcome.",

There were some printing issues with tabulation centers. It affected about 60 out of 223 voting sites. Republicans asked for voting to be extended beyond the 7 p.m. local to 10 p.m. A judge determined that there was no evidence that any voter who wanted to come and vote was denied the opportunity or that this would have any major impact on the integrity of the vote.

I'm not sure whether he can tighten enough.And in Georgia, which we haven't talked about in a while, we haven't called this race, but what we have heard from the secretary of state's office is that it is likely to go to a runoff. Raphael Warnock is in the lead but he is only got 49.1 percent of the vote. The key number here is 50. If no one gets to 50 plus one, as you pointed out, 50 percent plus one, it goes to a runoff.

As states continue to tabulate the final results, every vote must be counted as cast. Many thanks to our grassroots volunteers for enabling every voter to have their say in our democracy.\" And Republicans on Capitol Hill, Don, are certainly sweating this out much more than they had expected. The fact that these races are tighter than expected. The numbers as they currently stand right now, of course, have Republicans on the path to winning a majority in the House, but it's not done yet. And certainly, their majority potentially will be narrower than they had expected. And we heard from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in the last hour, and he claimed premature victory of sorts taking an early victory lap. He said that, he predicted that that Republicans would win the House. He did not comment on that smaller than expected margin that they likely would have. And he said he read, in essence the results as a mandate of sorts for the House Republicans going forward, saying, quote, \"work begins now.

Let's go back to the Senate, back to Nevada, and you can just, you know, I can poke around and show you the other counties here. Leon County right here. Again, zero percent reported two years ago, the margin here for Donald Trump was 12,000. So again, just with these counties that haven't reported, you could see that margin made up completely. The most important county in Nevada in terms of margins is Clark County home to Las Vegas, which makes up almost 75 percent of the vote. There's 84 percent reporting right now, which feels like a lot, but our friend Harry Enten just told me that the bulk of the uncounted vote in Clark County is mail, is mail vote, which has been heavily Democratic and they can count until Friday. They only have to mail the ballots up by today. Those ballots can actually come in still and they don't have to be counted till Friday. So, it's very possible that that Cortez Masto can expand where she is in Clark County, which is hugely important. And again, you know, if you think about the state as a whole, 72 percent in 0.6, separating them. I can show you two years ago roughly where it is at this this. If you go back the first votes came in, and you saw Donald Trump way ahead there, but by where we were now, 8 a.m. the next day, it was very close. There was only 0.8 percent separating them with 85 percent in. So that margin isn't that different than where we are now, Don.",
