Nikki Haley now emerging as a Republican presidential candidate with the clear momentum in the race, but for second place. And, of course, the second place is not good enough. And with the Iowa caucuses just 36 days away, does she have the time and the strategy in place to overcome the clear front runner, Donald Trump? Haley and the other candidates descending on Iowa this weekend, ahead of next month's caucuses. Haley and Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, are neck and neck there, but again, for second place. So what is Haley's strategy at this crucial moment in the race? CNN's Eva McKend is in Waukee, Iowa, ahead of Haley's event today. So, Eva, tell us what you're hearing from the Haley team and campaign officials about what exactly their game plan is going forward.",

Some of her supporters, though they like her, are skeptical of that argument. Others believe that she can pull off a political upset. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so I think she's trying to set expectations, which is, OK, a good showing, have a lot of people still come out and support her. She is doing well in the polls there. She thinks she's tied with DeSantis in Iowa, even though he's been spending more time there.

That's just the super PAC, not the campaign spending here. And the polls that are also show a story that obviously Haley is going to seize upon, the new Wall Street Journal poll out just this weekend, 2024 hypothetical matchup, Trump up by four against Biden. That's outside the margin of error, 2.5 percent. And then look at Haley, 17 points above Biden. Now, is that an outlier or is that reality?

And that is not a total outlier. There's other polling. I think it's Marquette that showed some similar sort of matchup runs.And what that survey showed is the idea that in a general election setting where you could capture independent voters or swing voters, the kind of people who went Obama to Trump and then Trump to Biden, that those people would swing back for Nikki Haley, hypothetically, much more so than they were for Donald Trump men, as well as women. That this is not just a play for center right women, but it's a play for men as well. And Axios does monthly surveys with swing voters. We're in North Carolina next week. One of the questions we'll be asking is about Nikki Haley. It's precisely this question. If she can take that argument into Iowa successfully and surpass, let's say hypothetically surpass Ron DeSantis, it could give her the kind of momentum. She needs something really exceptional if any of the national, if all of the national surveys are correct. She needs something really exceptional to be able to truly compete with Donald Trump.

Look, what Trump is saying about being a dictator, maybe for day one, but, you know, raising those questions about could that happen afterwards?And, you know, the interesting thing is that Haley's trying to lean in a little bit more now on Trump. She's not, you know, going for the jugular. But she has been saying, look, we can't replace chaos, speaking about Biden administration with more chaos in terms of Trump. So she's trying to show that difference and really make the argument that Biden did when he was running in 2020, which was who can actually beat Trump? Who can actually beat that person? RAJU: And it's interesting because Trump clearly recognizes that this attack about him, you know, being a threat to democracy is an issue for him. He started to say it more increasingly.

One of them, Republican Congressman Tim Burchett, he had inserted an amendment in the annual Defense Policy Bill that would have required the Pentagon to, quote, \"declassify any documents and records related to publicly known UFO sightings.\" But that language ultimately did not make it into the final version.
