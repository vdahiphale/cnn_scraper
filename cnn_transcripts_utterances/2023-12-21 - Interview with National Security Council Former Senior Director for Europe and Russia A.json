And Russia expert Fiona Hill tells me why this is so much more than just about Ukraine. Then, \"To Kill a Tiger,\" actor Dev Patel and director Nisha Pahuja join me to discuss their chilling documentary on sexual violence in India. Plus, the New Yorker's Masha Gessen talks to Michelle Martin about the politics of memory. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Ukraine is entering its second long, hard winter at war. In the wake of the stalled summer counteroffensive, troops are digging in for a frozen war of attrition, while Putin appears increasingly emboldened about Russia's prospects on the battlefield and beyond. President Zelenskyy's recent trip to Washington didn't yield the result he wanted, with the Senate deferring any vote on more aid until the new year. Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has this report from the front lines, showing just how grim things have gotten. And a warning, it is war, and it can be disturbing to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This was where the billions were meant to spell a breakthrough, but with a counteroffensive that was supposed to have kicked Russia to the sea this summer, now it is mud, death, deadlock, and the remnants of American help vanishing.",

Down here in this tiny basement, the rule is do not get seen. The other side are not so lucky. Two Russians spotted moving a load. They guide in a mortar strike. There are just so many Russians now. Usually more meat means more mince, the commander says, but sometimes their machine struggles to handle it and sometimes they have success.

What they've struggled with are the waves of Russian assaults. Dozens of Russian prisoners, well-trained and equipped and backed up by armor, who they say are given a mix of drugs. They show us this graphic video of a wounded Russian, his legs severed, seemingly high enough to smile through his fatal injuries. Still, they claim they held hard-won ground but at a huge cost. As we say in the army, he says, the counteroffensive was smooth on paper, but we forgot about the ditches. Colossal changes are taking place. They started making their own attack drones and outnumber ours. They use them badly, like a kid's toy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Excuse me. What's happening? Heavy injuries. From what? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Dexter, Dexter, I'm Bremya. Do you copy? WALSH (voice-over):  They say a drone has hit a trench and blown up a gas heater.

Would we have left Churchill and the U.K. out to dry? I mean, that's the kind of question that we're being asked right now. Biden gets this. The administration gets this. A lot of people in Congress and the Senate, irrespective of political party, get this. Obviously, in Europe, the same thing is happening, but the focus in the United States, as in many other European countries, is really about domestic politics, about their own elections, their own constituencies, and we have to find a way of breaking through that logjam. Because right now, Vladimir Putin thinks that he's got the winning thing ticket here, the winning edge. And he is already, as we speak, sending out feelers to try to gauge whether the United States and European countries are ready to capitulate, give up Ukraine and actually push forward on negotiations.

Imean, there's more than 300,000 Russian casualties, including people who have died or been seriously injured. Putin doesn't care about that. That's beside the point. He doesn't care about the fact that he's had to distort his whole economy to a war economy. You know, for now, the Russian economy has adapted and is doing reasonably well over the long-term. This is very detrimental to Putin, but he's not thinking about the long-term. He thinks over the long-term, he will win. And right now, this is the tipping point where the United States and Ukraine and Europe, everybody loses. And he turns everything to his advantage. Right now, that's what he's thinking. And so, what does that do to all of us in the long-term? I think that that actually, you know, shows that the West is incapable of sticking to its ground. And there will be a deterrent effect after this. And I want to explain that a moment. Putin will be emboldened. It doesn't mean he's necessarily going to send tanks into the Baltic states tomorrow, it's just that he will now know that the United States and West, and NATO as well, have no sticking power. He will turn around and say, we defeated NATO, not because NATO was directly involved in Ukraine, but because NATO member countries have been involved in supporting Ukraine. He always says, and he's said before, when he threatens, he delivers, and the West promises much to partners and never delivers. And it will have a chilling effect on every ally of the United States in the West, Japan, South Korea. I mean, remember, North Korea is also involved in supporting Putin here. So, it will be a win for North Korea and Iran, and it will bleed over into every other arena that we're concerned about at this moment. This will not solve a problem. It will just create a host of other problems. An American and Western leadership will be greatly diminished by this.",

Mikhail Zygar, who is an exiled writer, rights in \"The Washington Post,\" business leaders, officials and ordinary people tell me that the economy has stabilized, defying the Western sanctions that were once expected to have a devastating effect. Putin's regime, they say, looks more stable than at any other time in the past two years. The Soviet Union's Cold War isolation has not repeated itself.

I mean, it's very close to the whole anniversaries of Pearl Harbor in any case. Because in many respects, you know, the United States is in jeopardy in three different arenas where many of the same players are very active. And the whole perspective is one of a proxy war against the United States, against the United States as a global and regional hegemon. And we're really getting unite -- seeing the United States being put in the spotlight by Russia, by China, obviously North Korea, Iran and many other countries as really being the cause of all of this turmoil. The United States is getting blamed for what's happening in Israel and Gaza, just as much as it is in Ukraine. And there's now a push by Russia and other countries, you know, to isolate the United States. The United States, I would suggest right now is on the back foot here. And Putin is obviously going to take every advantage of this, and so will China. This looks like a world with three major fires. Two, you know, fully combustible in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and one that's, you know, still simmering and smoldering. Not simmering a fire, but smoldering and looking, you know, kind of like it also might be ignited in the Indo-Pacific region as well.

There is a great desire, you know, all around the world now for more say in world affairs for having the United States taken down, not seeing Russia weakened, don't necessarily want to see China as the dominant power, but there's no real desire to see the United States on top. That unipolar moment for the United States is long gone. And this is, you know, really what we're seeing playing out here the last moments of this.

One of the precipitating factors is this resolution, and it sounds very obscure, but it's had a huge influence. So, there's a -- or rather not the resolution, but the definition of antisemitism that was written by the International Holocaust Remembrance Association, which is a nongovernmental organization and this definition has no legal force per se, but it is interpreted in such a way as to basically frame any criticism of the State of Israel and importantly to my piece, any comparison of Israeli policies to those of the Nazis as a priori antisemitic. And this definition of antisemitism is used by this anti antisemitism bureaucracy in Germany to silence any criticism of Israel. And it's had a profound impact because the German State is so generous. So, it funds all the culture. It funds so much of the media. It funds sort of all of this production.

Masha Gessen is free to hold such views, we have such discussions on many occasions these days, just as the critical assessment of Israeli politics is also a permanent part of our work as the DIG.

And the ward member is, you know, the person who is quite sort of -- I guess in some way, you know, if the film has a real bad guy that we meet, it's him.
