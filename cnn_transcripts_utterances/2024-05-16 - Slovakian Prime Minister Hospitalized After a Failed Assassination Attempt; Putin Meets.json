Slovakia's Prime Minister remains hospitalized at this hour after an assassination attempt which appears to have failed.The Slovak Deputy Prime Minister says Robert Fico is expected to survive but stressed he was heavily injured in the shooting with bullets going through his stomach and joints. The gunman fired five shots at him on Wednesday after he held a government meeting and news conference in the central town of Handlova. The suspect was arrested at the scene and no one else was hurt. Fico is considered an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who called the attack a monstrous crime. Other leaders worldwide have also condemned the shooting. CNN's Clare Sebastian is tracking developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you Clare. So what more are you learning about the Prime Minister's condition and how this all unfolded?",

He said that the Prime Minister's condition has been stabilized overnight. More steps are being taken to better his health but the situation he reiterated is still really serious.So I think that's perhaps to be expected given what we know about his injuries. Another Deputy Prime Minister speaking on Wednesday evening said that he had been shot through the stomach and in his joints in his words. We know that there were five shots that were fired overall so a very serious medical situation for him even though he is now as you say expected to survive the surgery that happened yesterday apparently went well. In terms, of how this unfolded you can see the scene in these pictures there was broad daylight it was in the town of Handlova which is a couple of hours drive to the east of the Slovakian capital Bratislava. He was at an off-site government meeting. He was meeting and greeting regular people outside that when suddenly these shots rang out and you can see that his security detail rushed over and then bundled him into their car. He was taken to hospital and eventually airlifted to another nearby hospital with a trauma center. The suspect we don't have many details on that as of yet. The police haven't officially named anyone but there was a person arrested at the scene immediately and then we did get striking comments coming pretty soon after that from the Defense Minister and the Interior Minister saying that this was a political assault clearly politically motivated they say and calling for people to only listen to official information and remain calm.

Yesterday even though the president and a number of politicians of course called for calm and for appeasing the tensions, the problem is that a number of coalition leaders accused media journalists and the opposition of causing this. So we already see attempts at different disinformation outlets to put the blame on the side of the opposition and media.

Two years ago we had a terrorist attack against a queer club in Bratislava, also politically motivated. In 2018 we had two journalists murdered.

Now Putin is back in China for the state visit earlier today in Beijing.Putin and Xi, they held talks on regional issues, on the war in Ukraine, on the Middle East. And as you see there in video that took place around the last hour or so, there was a signing ceremony where the two leaders signed joint documents. And pretty soon there's going to be a state reception and also a gala concert to mark 75 years of the relationship between these two powers. Now when they met earlier today at the Great Hall of the People, Xi Jinping hailed the relationship. And this is the comments that he issued earlier, according to state media. He said this, quote, \"the China-Russia relationship today is hard earned and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it.\" Xi went on to say that China is willing to jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries. Now these two are close friends. And Xi Jinping, he added that he personally met with Vladimir Putin more than 40 times so far. Putin, he also hailed the relationship. He gave this interview to state run media Xinhua saying that the relationship had reached the highest level ever. And yes, relations have been strong, so strong, especially as the U.S. and its allies impose sanctions against them, especially Russia after invading Ukraine, bringing them, these two countries even closer together. And that manifests in the trade relationship. I'm going to show you this bar chart. Trade between Russia and China has surged. In fact, last year it reached an all-time high of around $240 billion. Russia buying up Chinese products like vehicles, like vehicle parts, like chips, like machinery, China buying up cheap Russian fuel. And China has come under increasing pressure over this trade relationship, especially from the West, where Western powers are asking China to make sure its exports are not dual use, that they're not supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. We recently heard from America's top diplomat. He warned Chinese officials that the U.S. and other countries would act if Beijing doesn't move to curb this flow. Back to you.",

Now we have seen sustained five days of Russian military operations and advances north of where I'm standing here in the second city of Kharkiv. Behind me, startlingly blacked out as we occasionally hear blasts inthe night. The city itself, it seems, intermittently targeted too by a missile in the last hours as well. But it's to the border towns to its north where Russia appears to be seeing progress. Ukraine's military saying they had indeed chosen more favorable positions in the key town of Vovchansk. That's probably a euphemism for a tactical withdrawal up there. A local police chief saying they can now hear gunfire, street battles inside that town. Essentially a sign the Russian military has moved in. A local we saw evacuated this afternoon said that she'd been in her basement as the town burned around her for the past days. But Russian troops were indeed in the street next to hers. So key progress clearly there. The Russian Ministry of Defense say that extends to nearly a double digits worth of villages in that area. But ultimately they seem to be wanting to push further down to get their military artillery guns in range of this huge population center. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy canceling his forthcoming travel abroad. Remember part of his job is going to allies asking for better weaponry, faster. He also used his speech this day to reassure Ukrainians that the intense Russian activity they're having to try and counter to the north isn't going to necessarily leave them weaker in other areas of the front line. Well we have also seen significant losses by Ukraine and Russia moving forwards in the past weeks. It's been difficult for them in the east too and there are also suggestions that in the south there may be some elements of Russian progress too. All of this coming as Moscow ceases really to make the best use militarily of a window now before U.S. military aid begins to arrive in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers. It's been the absence of that munition, of that equipment that has enabled them to get to this position and lose territory to Russia already. And so an acutely dark moment for Kyiv certainly and one which Russia has matched with extraordinary levels of firepower and manpower across the front lines making good it seems on Ukraine's moment of weakness here.

Satellite images show thousands of tents housing displaced Palestinians in Rafah disappeared after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate the city last week. According to the U.N., about 600,000 Palestinians, a quarter of Gaza's population, have fled.But tents have popped up in al-Mawassi near Khan Younis, which Israel is calling an expanded humanitarian zone. Aid agencies say the area is sandy and lacks basic essentials, including food, shelter, water and health care facilities. Meanwhile, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant is voicing his frustration at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to address the issue of a post-war plan for Gaza. Galant opposes Israeli rule there and says Palestinian entities must take control of the enclave and establish a governing alternative to Hamas. But Netanyahu insists it's essential to eliminate Hamas first. While Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh says Hamas is, quote, \"here to stay and rejects any suggestion the group could be excluded from post-war decisions on Gaza\". CNN's Paula Hancocks is following all the developments for us. She joins us live from Abu Dhabi. Good to see you, Paula. So Israel is clearly divided on a post-war plan for Gaza.

So you can see just how much the disagreement is for that day after the war ends.And it also highlights once again the questions about the long term strategy for Israel when it comes to Gaza. The fact, for example, that the Israeli military is now having to go back to areas of northern Gaza, of central Gaza, that they said that they had cleared of Hamas because there is a power vacuum there, because Hamas has now moved back into those areas, according to the Israelis, and they are then reassembling, regrouping and taking control again. We also heard it from the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, saying that there does have to be a solution, given the fact that this anarchy will lead to a vacuum, which will then be filled by chaos. We've heard military experts as well in Israel say that they believe this will have to happen time and time again, having to go back to areas that had been cleared of Hamas, if there is not a political solution as well.

It's just about five miles away, but of course many don't have any access to transport, fuel is scarce, and it is an area that is along the coast, it's along the beach. It is not, according to many humanitarian aid groups, suitable for human habitation, and yet this is where many of them are having to go.

First responders in the province of Manitoba are struggling to put out one of the country's largest wildfires, which is burning out of control. In Alberta, thousands of people were caught in a traffic jam on Tuesday. They were trying to escape another huge out-of-control fire near the city of Fort McMurray. However, officials say weaker winds and cooler temperatures will improve conditions for firefighters, at least temporarily. But some 6,600 people have been ordered to get out.Tensions are high in the French territory of New Caledonia, where nearly 200 people have been arrested amid anti-government protests. Riots have left some businesses torched and stores looted. The violence broke out on Monday after the French government proposed changes to New Caledonia's constitution. Pro-independence groups feel France is attempting to consolidate power over the Pacific island chain. France has declared a state of emergency in the territory, sending an additional 500 police officers to assist the nearly 2,000 police and military officers already stationed there. CNN's Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An island paradise in turmoil. In the South Pacific, the French territory of New Caledonia, erupting in violence for the third straight day Wednesday. Pro-independence protesters clash with security forces, leaving shops, cars, homes burned. Mostly young demonstrators are protesting against a vote held over 10,000 miles away. In Paris on Tuesday, France's National Assembly passed changes to voting laws in New Caledonia. The aim of the legislation, to open up voter lists to French residents who've been in New Caledonia for 10 years. Local independence activists believe new voters want the Pacific archipelago to stay with France, which has ruled the islands since the 19th century. DENISE FISHER, FORMER AUSTRALIAN CONSUL-GENERAL IN NOUMEA, NEW CALEDONIA: The current people are objecting to that, not just because it's being decided in Paris without them, but also they feel that they want it to be part of a negotiation, a whole negotiation, which would include another self-determination vote. WATSON (voice-over): The French government wants more talks with the independence leaders before the voting rules are formally changed. GABRIEL ATTAL, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Our priority is to find a global political agreement, the broadest possible political agreement with the separatists and the non- separatists, which will allow us to move forward and write the future of New Caledonia. WATSON (voice-over): Leaders of the independence movement are calling for an end to the violence, which has turned deadly. For the first time, deaths reported by the president's office as gunfire erupted between rioters and security forces.",
