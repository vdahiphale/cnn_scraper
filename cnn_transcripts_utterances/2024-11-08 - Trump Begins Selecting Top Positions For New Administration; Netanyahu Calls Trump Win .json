His previous chiefs of staff struggled to keep people from meeting with the president. Trump also reportedly taking the job of selecting top positions more seriously this time around. A Trump adviser telling CNN, quote, that would seem like an obvious thing, but he feels strongly that in 2016, he allowed people who were around him and knew more about D.C. to make decisions for him. He is far more involved now.

Sabrina, good morning. You covered all aspects of this campaign. I want to be clear for \"The Washington Post\", but you also have spent a lot of time looking specifically at this group of voters. And the shift was really remarkable. It was fascinating to hear from those people that Ed was speaking to about why they made these decisions how do you understand it based on what you saw on the campaign trail in the final days of the race, and what are you hearing now from particularly Democrats who are grappling with what happened?",
