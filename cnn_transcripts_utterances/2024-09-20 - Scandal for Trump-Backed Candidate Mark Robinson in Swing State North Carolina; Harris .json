It is Friday, September the 20th, 9 a.m. here in London, and it's 4 a.m. in North Carolina, where Republican candidate Mark Robinson is refusing to drop out of the race for governor of North Carolina.This comes after a CNN K-file investigation revealed that Robinson's history, or Robinson's history of disturbing, lewd comments on a message board for a porn website. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has praised Robinson on the campaign trail, but so far he's been silent on whether his ally should quit the race. Democratic presidential rival Kamala Harris has put the swing state back in play for Democrats, and CNN's revelations of the disturbing comments could potentially impact Trump, who sits at the top of the Republican ticket. Robinson is currently North Carolina's lieutenant governor, and he denies making the comments. Here's what he told CNN's Andrew Kaczynski. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We'll get more now from the investigation from CNN's Dianne Gallagher.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Mark Robinson, the controversial and socially conservative Republican running for governor here in North Carolina, made a series of inflammatory comments on a pornography website between 2008 and 2012 on a message board in which he referred to himself as a Black Nazi, expressed support for reinstating slavery, as well as other lewd and degrading comments about women, according to a CNN K-file investigation. Now, despite a recent history of very anti-transgender comments, Robinson said on the website, which was called Nude Africa and included a message board, that he enjoyed watching transgender pornography. He also referred to himself as a perv. Now, Robinson denies making these comments, and they do predate his entry into politics, where he is currently serving as the lieutenant governor of the state. They were made under a username that CNN was able to identify as Robinson by matching a litany of biographical details and a shared email address as well. Many of those comments were, again, gratuitous and sexual, lewd nature. They were made on that website. CNN is reporting only a small portion of Robinson's comments, given the nature of them. Now, Robinson did tell CNN on Thursday that, quote: This is not us, these are not our words, and this is not anything that is characteristic of me. I'm not going to get into the minutiae of how somebody manufactured this. These salacious tabloid lies. He also put out a video statement getting ahead of the CNN story before it was published, comparing himself to Clarence Thomas, calling himself a victim of a high-tech lynching. [04:05:00] Now, Robinson's opponent in the gubernatorial campaign, the current attorney general here, Democrat Josh Stein, his campaign released a statement saying, quote: North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be governor. Josh remains focused on winning this campaign so that together we can build a safer, stronger North Carolina for everyone. Now, Robinson has been endorsed by just about every Republican in the state of North Carolina, as well as former President Donald Trump, who at one point called him Martin Luther King on steroids and better than Martin Luther King. The Trump campaign has said that it is focused on winning North Carolina and the presidential race. The fallout with Republicans here in the Tar Heel state does continue, as many Democrats try and link their opponents today to Mark Robinson and those comments that he made. Dianne Gallagher, CNN, back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Again, this is something we have heard from Donald Trump. He also continued to argue that he would end the war between Israel and Hamas without offering any specifics.

That was the goal of this tonight.
