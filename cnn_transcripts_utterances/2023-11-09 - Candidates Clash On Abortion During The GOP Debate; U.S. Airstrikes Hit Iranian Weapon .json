But there were deep divisions over how much the U.S. should be supporting Ukraine and its war against Russia.On one side, you have Vivek Ramaswamy, who says that the U.S. commitment should end that he -- and he went so far as to cast aspersions on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And then you have Nikki Haley saying that that kind of rhetoric emboldened Putin, emboldened China. And Chris Christie said if we took a turn our back on Europe now that this could lead to something akin to World War III. And then in the between you had sort of Tim Scott and Ron DeSantis kind of dodging the issue a little bit instead of turning the focus to the southern border. And then abortion, of course, is another issue that was quite topical, given the election results on Tuesday night. And all of these candidates are anti-abortion, but how they would use the government to defend that position going forward. There was some widespread disagreement.

So let me quote , Ric Flair, the 16-time World Heavyweight Champion from Charlotte, North Carolina, who said very famously, to be the man, you've got to beat them in. And if you look at the polling right now, and not just right now, all year long, Donald Trump has been the man in the Republican primaries.And what we've seen is a battle royale of people who are trying to come in second or rocket into third place. They're not directly taking on Donald Trump or even worse. They're -- they've been shoring up Donald Trump's core messaging when he gets indicted the first time, the second time, the third time, next time. It's why Donald Trump is as strong as he is in the primary. And everything that we saw last night, essentially is political -- is the political equivalent of one hand clapping. BERMAN: Lanhee, I could see in your face, the smile on your face, you're trying to come up with a Rowdy Roddy Piper quote.

And for everybody else in the field, the time may have come to get out. And I think that may have been the message after last night. That could be the single best thing, that Republicans who do not want Donald Trump to be their nominee can do, which is to winnow this field as quickly as possible.Now, it may not come quickly enough to make a difference. I think that's the point. But fundamentally, what last night was, was a demonstration that both Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley can be credible candidates as the Republican nominee. I thought DeSantis had a much more steady night than he did in the prior debates. I think Haley obviously emerges as somebody who can compete not just in the primary, but in a general election. So both of them did what they needed to do last night, I think the question is, will it matter for the longer term dynamics of the race? And unless something happens in terms of at least a few other candidates getting out very, very soon, it may not make a difference in terms of how this race develops, and who ultimately becomes the Republican nominee.",

I mean, even if you look at the nature of the arguments that were put forward, you know, he didn't make Mexico pay for the wall. And, you know, he wasn't the same guy he was before. All of the data we have shows us that these attacks don't tend to land on Donald Trump, it doesn't matter.It's very hard to dodge -- to attack Donald Trump from the right. That's the reality of where we are. And so for these candidates, yes, they're going to have to go after Donald Trump. The question is, what is going to be your pathway, the debate stage, again, I don't know if that's the best place to do it. It may be for their campaigns and their Super PACs to do some more on television. That might have to be what they do and on digital media. But on the debate stage, trying to draw contrast and saying essentially, look, Trump's not conservative enough, or Trump didn't do enough. I'm not sure that that argument is the right one. And so that's the dynamic. That's why this race is so hard, because there's not much you can say that will affect conservative voters mindset about Donald Trump as a candidate. BERMAN: You know, Doug is not every debate you have the word scum tossed around like you did last night. And that dynamic, that dynamic between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy is interesting.

It is aimed to send a strong message of deterrence to Iran and Iran-backed groups to not expand the conflict that we are seeing in Israel and in Gaza.They want to send that message. They've been doing so very overtly. They've been doing so covertly. And so these strikes serve the purpose of not just sending that message of deterrence capable, we're told, also taking out that weaponry in that storage facility. You noted the more than 40 strikes against U.S. forces across the region.

The Pentagon says it was in an international airspace, over international waters, it really shows the significant capabilities that the Houthis have in taking that down.This is not the first time that they've taken down an American drone. But Kate, it does follow firing by the Houthis of drones and missiles towards Israel several weeks ago, that a U.S. destroyer had to take down. So there really is significant concern over those Houthi capabilities, and of course, how that could play into a possible escalation and expansion of this conflict. So the U.S. is trying to send the message to Iran and its groups do not get involved in this conflict. And they're doing that with by moving the strike groups into the region, a guided missile submarine into the region and direct conversations with Iran and its proxies out of this fear that the conflict could expand.
