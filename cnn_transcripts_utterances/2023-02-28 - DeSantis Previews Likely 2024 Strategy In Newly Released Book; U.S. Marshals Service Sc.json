      "sentences": "Well, Victor, Bianna, everyone knows the U.S. Marshals Service from, you know, movies like \"The Fugitive\" in the '90s and they're out and about protecting prisoners and guarding them. But like everyone else, they deal with computer systems and store data. And they store data on some sensitive things. In this case, the Marshals Service is now confirming that someone -- and they haven't said who -- but some sort of cybercriminal group was able to break into one of their computer systems and lock up some of the data, and then also steal it.So, it is what is known as a double extortion method, where they have not only data to try to demand a ransom, but they also have encrypted the system. Now we don't know if there was a ransom that was demanded. The Marshals Service and the FBI counsel people not to pay the ransom. So, it would be ironic indeed if they were considering paying the ransom. But we don't have any evidence of that, Victor and Bianna. And I've been on the, you know, dark web forums today, looking for claims of responsibility, and haven't seen anything to that effect. Normally a group dumps the data and names the victim, if that victim hasn't paid. So, that may be yet to happen. But, like you said, this is a second sizable cyber incident to be disclosed in the last few weeks, involving federal law enforcement. We broke the news a few weeks ago on the FBI dealing with a malicious cyber incident that we reported affected some of the bureau's computers that deal with child pornography. So, this is something that they're working to contain and it has been -- you know, just an example of how this is something that the federal agencies prosecute and they're going after these people, but they also have to deal with them going after their own networks, Victor and Bianna.",

They got a DNA buccal swab of Brian Kohberger, four medical style gloves, a silver flashlight, a black sweatshirt, black socks, a pair of size 13 Nike shoes. There were some other additional items. But let me tell you what is important with this. First of all, authorities were surveilling Brian Kohberger since that Wednesday and they allege they saw him taking trash bags, putting them in other people's trash receptacles while wearing gloves. What were in the bags, what could be on the gloves forensically speaking important. You saw the items of clothes that are in black. Everybody has black clothes, right. But we do know the roommate in Idaho said that she saw someone all dressed in black the night of those murders approaching her as she stood at the doorway of her room. So, that could be significant. Obviously a flashlight, they were interested in. Now, here's one thing we don't see on this return, is any electronic devices like a phone or anything like that. But we know that authorities, the FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police knew he was in that home because they were surveilling him through the pings on the phone. [04:50:00] They even ask in this warrant a judge because of the technology now opening iPhones, because some are facial recognition, some are you put your fingertip on, they asked the judge to allow them to have him do that so they could open a phone, but we don't see the collection of one electronic device.",
