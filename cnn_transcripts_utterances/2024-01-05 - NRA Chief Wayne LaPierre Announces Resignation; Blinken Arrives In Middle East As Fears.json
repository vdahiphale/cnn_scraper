There was no sign that he would give up the fight.Although, the timing is pretty suspect on that front. The trial starts next week in his New York case. Things aren't looking great for the organization at this point, as they had been going into this. But he -- there was a report that the IRS was investigating this. Part of the idea is that he used NRA funds for personal expenses. If you don't report that on your taxes, that can cause problems with the IRS, obviously. I don't know. We have not heard anything since then. It is unclear whether the IRS is doing anything on that front. In theory, if someone who wasn't friendly towards him regained control of the NRA, they could go after him as well for how he used NRA money during his tenure. But right now, his allies are in control. So I think that is doubtful.",

BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Notably, it comes as Israel's defense ministers unveiled plans for the next phase of the war in Gaza once Hamas, if it is, destroyed, is out of that enclave. Those proposals have caused an international rift inside the Israeli cabinet. We have CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, joining us now from Tel Aviv. Nic, Israel's defense minister laying out his vision for Gaza. It doesn't exactly lineup with the U.S. version of what they want, their goals, for a post-Hamas Gaza.",

      "sentences": "It doesn't. When Secretary Blinken left, he left with the understanding that Israel was going to work towards these objectives and really frame out and and game out the end-of-war scenario, the next-day scenario, if you will.What the defense minister is presenting and has presented is a three- page document that lays out the next phase, or the phase that when phase three, it's going after tunnels and special operation forces in northern Gaza and southern Gaza. It is going after the Hamas leadership and aiming to free the hostages. The phase four, the day after that Secretary Blinken will be looking at. We already know what Israel is achieving in terms of providing security. Downing the amount of firepower used. Maintaining security and humanitarian supplies for the civilians inside Gaza. That is falling short. But, OK, so the day after part? That is going to seem very thin, I suspect, from what Secretary Blinken is looking for, is roughed out in uncertain terms. It is an environment where Hamas is no longer a threat. Well, Israel had already kind of laid that out. It is an environment where there will be no Israeli civilians, which was sort of always the case. It will be an environment where the IDF will be able to continue military operations as needed. That was sort of on the agenda already. But here is the catch. There is no definitive way of how you get to some political authority there, some Palestinian political authority. There is a rough framework, if you will, that the United States with European partners and regional partners will find a way to sort of head up the humanitarian reconstruction effort in Gaza. That they will be the point of contact. But Israel will really sort of have control over the security parameters coming in and out of Gaza, as well. So it is lacking in detail. That, I suspect, is an area where Secretary Blinken is going to say, look, OK, give me more detail. How do we even get to that? What is your timeframe for getting to that? Where is there any idea of a ceasefire? There is no mention, as far as we know, in that three-page document of a ceasefire.",

She was forced to give birth to a child who did not survive outside of the womb. I think a woman like Tania Cook, who was forced to travel to South Carolina to receive medical care in a really harrowing emergency medical situation.

There also is no easily accessible place for patients to go here in Florida. We are surrounded by states that already have abortion bans enacted. The states that don't aren't able to take Florida's patient base. We are the third most-populous state in the nation. There are millions of women who live here who may need access to abortion care. The other thing we need to talk about is OB/GYN's are heavily criminalized by these bills. The likelihood is this will only impact folks who need access to abortion, but it will impact individuals who need general OB/GYN care, whether for pregnancy or just for the regular course of their life.

As, of course, it is a situation for many countries around the world. That is according to a Rand report.

Days ago, the FDA said they were investigating multiple reports of suicidal thinking among Ozempic and Wegovy patients.
