Pretty much camping for the last several weeks, but it's been scary in the last two weeks there. We kept running out of water and that was water to flush the toilet. We always were fortunate to have drinking water, which was not true of the Gazans just outside the fence from us. They were running out of drinking water. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said just a short while ago that they are planning the evacuation of 7,000 foreign nationals in the coming days. If not, it could take several weeks, but we'll see how that plays out.Included in all of that, Phil, as you mentioned, is at least 400 American citizens that are still almost a month into this war still trying to get out of Gaza. There were about 360 foreign nationals, including two Americans, that were able to leave through the Rafah crossing yesterday, hundreds more expected at some point today. So, we'll see how that continues to play out. But right now, the logistical process of getting thousands of foreign nationals out of Gaza is a very delicate situation that will be going on for several days. And that process is just now getting underway. As you mentioned off the top there, ambulances arrive -- ambulances seen there at the crossing where Egypt says it was also agreed to take in at least 80 Palestinian civilians that have been wounded in the attacks there in Gaza as well. So, all of that playing out at really the only crossing into Gaza that has seen any kind of movement, any kind of openness at this point nearly a month into this war.",

Donald Trump Jr. testified before New York judge for 90 minutes yesterday. Prosecutors pressed him on his involvement in the company's financial statements and more broadly on his roles and responsibilities in the Trump organization.CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig joins us now from the magic wall. Let's start by taking a step back for a second. What are the core allegations made by the attorney general and where do we stand right now? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Yes, Phil. For all the big personalities and drama swirling around this case, it really comes down to one thing, valuation. Now this is a civil lawsuit, it's not a criminal case, brought by the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, against the Trumps where she alleges that the defendants grossly inflated Mr. Trump's personal net worth by billions of dollars. Let me show you how it worked, according to the allegations. Let's take Mar-a-Lago. The allegation is that Mar-a-Lago was assessed by a county assessor at being worth around $20 million. However, the Trump Organization later claimed that it was actually worth not $50, 500 million. That's an enormous discrepancy. Now, the allegation is they didn't just do this for Trump's ego. They would take this inflated number, bring it to a bank's, primarily Deutsche Bank, but others, and then use those inflated numbers to get bigger loans at better interest rates than they otherwise would have gotten. Important to note, though, those loans were paid back with interest. Trump is arguing no victims, but it doesn't matter for some of the claims here. Also important to remember this case is being decided by the judge, not a jury. And the judge has already decided before the trial started in favor of the A.G. against the Trumps on one of the counts in the case. The judge said the numbers they were creating is a fantasy world, not the real world. But there are other counts still in play here. Now, the trial has been going for about a month so far. Most of the witnesses have been financial experts, accountants, but we did hear from Michael Cohen, not the best drawing, but that is Michael Cohen.",

There's a really important development. We need to look at our favorite blank calendar, which will soon not be blank.The Mar-a-Lago federal trial is scheduled to start in late May of 2024. If it goes then, it would carry through the summer. And, remember, we have this important thing happening in November 2024, which is, of course, the presidential election, fine. The problem is Jack Smith's other case, the January 6th related case, that has been scheduled to start in early March. And the Manhattan hush money case, a third criminal case, is scheduled to start in late March. Now, those aren't both going to go at the same time. The state trial is probably going to fall away. But the concern that the judge in Florida said is, well, if he's got to go to trial, if Trump's got to go to trial in D.C. on January 6, that's going to push right up against our trial date. And what the judge said is, you can't make someone go to trial back-to-back like that. The judge has said, I'm concerned, he may need time to prepare, which would mean you have to push this really past the election because you're not going to start a trial in August and run it through September, October, November.
