You know, and we place short form games and whatnot, and I had a knack for it. And again, not wanting to be a child actor. I was always around funny friends. I always gravitate towards people that made me laugh. I love making other people laugh. I got out of a lot of, you know, demerits or jugs as they call them at my Jesuit high school by talking my way out of it or making the teacher laugh and much like Ferris Bueller or Bugs Bunny or, you know, Axel Foley again. And I just -- at that point, it was counting. Okay, I want to do this. But then I had this really amazing opportunity. I did this comedy festival in Ireland, and it was with all the second city alumni. But then they had someone drop out to do these small improv shows in the back of these pubs, and they asked me if I wanted to do it, and George had seen and Bernadette had seen me perform. And people are kind of like and George would be like, no, I think he could do it. And then they started playing short form improv games, which I had all these years of experience. You know, they didn't say go west. They would just go to Chicago, was never go to L.A., go to New York, like, go get like, get the biz. It was never that and George never pushed that. All he did was really unknowingly to me, at that point, was when I dropped out of college, I was living in my parents' basement, and I was like, right in the silly newsletter that I'd send to friends at actual colleges, when my mom and dad were nervous, especially my mom, George be like, no, no, he's -- if he -- if he keeps loving it, like he can do something with this.

But just these things make sense to me -- is that being a college coach is there's impermanence. You only get them for four years.I will have had my time with it. I've been lucky enough in most instances in my life been involved with things that when I no longer got to do them. I want to know that at least I did him as well as I could while I could.

And I get it from both a business standpoint and creative standpoint and a fandom, as a fan of things and having grown up as a fan of these things, of movies and television characters, specifically.And so, I get to hang out. I see all these, you know all my friends, you know, Jeremy, who plays Higgins, Jimmy Lance, who plays Trent Crimm, you know, like I get to hang out with these guys. Nine hours a day still, you know, and I get to watch them and be excellent and like and make me laugh. Make me cry. And I just try to support what openness and honesty and talent they've -- they've offered to the camera that we've captured and then to give to people to let them do whatever they want with it. So I haven't had the time to say goodbye to it yet, you know? And I know that, you know, it's nice to know there's a plan B there, that, you know, if she (ph) hits the fan, I can -- I can, you know, go to cameo and give pep talks you know? Keep that mustache 24/7 and, you know, view the world through that through the eyes of that character, through the soul of that character, which is a very optimistic, you know, some would even argue Pollyanna way to view the world. But I don't think so. I think we all have Ted Lasso in us. I feel like we fell out of the lucky tree, hit every branch on the way down, ended up in a pool full of cash and sour patch kids. I'm not, you know, Daniel Day Lewis, man. I'm not Meryl Streep. I can't play early, so I haven't been asked to play something that it wasn't a tiny part of myself. And how do you -- how do you widen that lens and give it -- give it as much breath as possible? That's -- so it will never leave me, even if I don't get to play it. It's in there, and I encourage folks to, you know, find themselves. It's one of the neatest things, seeing all the men and women, you know, guys and you know, kids and adults dressing up like characters from our show and all different ways. It's a hoot.",
