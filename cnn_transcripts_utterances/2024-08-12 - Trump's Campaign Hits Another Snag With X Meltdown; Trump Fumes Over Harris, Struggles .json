TIME puts Kamala Harris on the cover, sparking a debate about coverage of her honeymoon period. And breaking the mold, Harris quickie ascension makes campaigns ponder are micro elections the future? Also, his heart will go on but the music might not. Celine Dion tries to sync Donald Trump using her Titanic tune. Live at the table, Reihan Salam, L.Z. Granderson, Tara Setmayer and Madison Gesiotto. Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race. And good evening. I'm Abby Phillip here in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. This space is not available, five words and a failure tonight for a much anticipated conversation between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. That X event that everyone was supposed to watch, well, it broke the internet and not in the Beyonce kind of way. If you are trying to click over to watch that Trump-Musk talk, which I believe is still ongoing, for most of the time you couldn't do it for about 40 minutes. And when the interview finally did get underway, Trump went into his normal stump speech, including more Kamala Harris insults. This was, Tara, just maybe an allegory of what's been going on with the Trump campaign for some time. TARA SETMAYER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, THE SENECA PROJECT:  Yes.",

They're saying that it's an overly glowing picture and article about the vice president, but others are pointing out that Harris got the full cover treatment without actually doing a sit-down interview with the magazine.We're back at the table, and, Reihan, since you brought this up earlier, I'll let you have the first word, because, I mean, it is -- first of all I did go back and I looked at the covers. There have been a lot of covers. There have been some nice covers of Trump. There have been some nice covers of Biden, Obama. So, having a nice TIME cover is not a strange thing.

For example, this idea of looking at the root causes of the border crisis in the Northern Triangle in Mexico didn't necessarily handle that portfolio very well.What she did do while President Biden and his allies were bad mouthing her is that she built real relationships with reporters, with important influential reporters from new media outlets, from old media outlets. In some cases, this was dealing with women who came from a similar class and ethnic and cultural background. In other cases, he was reaching out beyond that. But particularly, there's a phalanx of female reporters in D.C. with whom she built real relationships by providing them with access and by connecting with them on a human level. That turned out to be an extremely wise investment because it turns out that not having addressed the policy portfolio was not actually going to be a problem for her, but investing in media and those relationships wound up paying huge dividends right now.",
