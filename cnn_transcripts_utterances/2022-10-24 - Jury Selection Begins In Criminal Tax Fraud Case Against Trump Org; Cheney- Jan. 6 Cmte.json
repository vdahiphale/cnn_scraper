The Committee Vice Chair, Congresswoman Liz Cheney is warning though, Trump won't be allowed to turn this testimony into a public spectacle. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), VICE CHAIR, JAN. 6 SELECT COMMITTEE: He's not going to turn this into a circus. This isn't going to be, you know, his first debate against Joe Biden and the circus and the food fight that that became. This is far too serious set of issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This will take a very, very long time to litigate, or to play out on any other number of avenues. There's just no way that this is going to happen before the end of December.",

This is a committee that has tried very hard not to have people like Representative Jim Jordan on so that it wouldn't be a grandstanding operation. And that's what they're worried about with the former president, that he'll get there and who knows what, and then they'll have to be -- I'm just thinking about this that in a court, if someone, if there's misconduct in the court, you can call the marshals.

So I would say the only thing that, you know, they could be sort of going back and forth on at this point is the scope of what was requested. Huge, huge amounts of information. And documents were requested by the January 6 Committee of former President Trump. I would imagine that Trump's legal team, their first sort of method here will be to push back and say this is just way too outside the bounds in terms of the scope of it.",

One of our other legal analysts said it was almost accusatory, that letter of nature, but it was interesting to me, they they almost went through, perhaps not surprisingly, everything they expect to get in terms of pushback, including acknowledging that there may be a push for privilege, but also setting a specific case, you know, where there was a loss actually when it came to privilege that was being pushed for.Now much do you think that did actually, sort of prebut if you will, Judge, some of the legal arguments that could be coming the way of the committee in response to this?",

One is, Trump's lawyers could try to narrow the scope of the subpoena. And there could be a negotiation, or something maybe documents, only doubtful that the committee would have this documents only, but there's certainly a period of negotiations, which will run out the clock.And the committee is, you know, at this point, everyone is dealing with not just the actual proceeding, but dealing with the public face of the proceeding. So they're anticipating what he's going to do, but they can't stop him from doing it, from challenging the subpoena and challenging the scope of the documents. They can't stop them from doing him, and that could play on the clock.",

He's just not doing himself any favors by sort of blabbing and running his mouth on truth, social, those are out of court statements that may be used against him at some point in the future. However, I think we've seen this before where, you know, President Trump says I really want to talk, but then he says, oh, my lawyers won't let me, kind of blames it on the lawyers.Yes, ultimately, you know, I don't think this is going anywhere, which is why this has opened up up the committee to criticism.

The economy is in a crisis, profound crisis, according to Sunak, with soaring inflation, rising interest rates. People not knowing if they can afford their heating and their food bills this winter.Add to that, the political turmoil of having the shortest serving Prime Minister ever in Liz Truss and all the chaos that ensued from her leadership of having a cabinet of loyalists, not briefing the markets about bold economic plans to completely rip up the way that things are usually done in the Conservative Party. Now the Conservatives are trailing behind in the polls that fractured the party needs to unite in order to get any kind of governing done. Whether or not Rishi Sunak is the person to do that is now the question. No lawmakers I spoke to, Erica, could actually point to an individual that they thought would be able to mend this broken party. But Rishi Sunak might have a good chance. He's indicated in the moves over the weekend that he's willing to extend olive branches to the other camps to the supporters of Boris Johnson, who appoints have had a very acrimonious relationship with Rishi Sunak because they blame him partly for Johnson's downfall. And if Rishi Sunak brings in a cabinet of different perspectives, a broad coalition of opinion and leads in a collegial way, he may have a good chance of trying to stabilize the markets and also restore some faith in governance and in the Conservative Party. But the challenge ahead is enormous and there'll be tested immediately.",

You know, as in that courtroom, it was packed, it was many family members, there was law enforcement on both sides of the courtroom and the back of the courtroom.When he was brought in full shackles, he's very tall in person. He sat between his two lawyers, they spoke with him, you could tell he was really listening even pointed at a piece of paper on the desk. The judge came in and the judge began to address him because he has to make sure it's a fair and voluntary plea hearing, and that he is pleading guilty out of his own free will. Asked him about what exactly happened on that they, and he said that he had brought the gun to school. He answered. Yes, he'd gone into the men's bathroom, he went into the stall, he loaded the gun, he came out of the bathroom and he started shooting. I want you to listen to some very pointed questions the prosecutor asked him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now as the judge went through each and every count asking him if he intentionally and with premeditation, wanted to kill, he got to the name of Madisyn Baldwin. Madison's mother was in the front row. And when she heard her daughter's name, she started to cry softly, but she cried.Court personnel came over. They asked if they could help her. But I think hearing that name in court and he admitted that he wanted to kill her. Now the next step in all of this is what is termed a miller hearing. This is constitutional in nature. This may be one of the reasons why they allowed him and he agreed to plea to everything. Under the U.S. Constitution, it's a very famous case. When you are a juvenile, you cannot be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole unless there are parole statues. So the judge advised him life in prison without the possibility of parole or 25 to 40 years, 60 years maximum. And at this hearing, there will be argument and his attorney said you will hear that he is remorseful. You will get to know him in this hearing.

Officials now condemning a flagrant, disturbing display of antisemitism. So over the weekend, a group of demonstrators as you see here, have huge banners over in LA freeway. All part of their messaging supporting those antisemitic remarks made by Kanye West who of course now goes by Ye. Well Twitter and Instagram locked his accounts, you may recall, after he claimed he was going, quote, DEFCON 3 on Jewish people. Adidas has been under pressure for days now to cancel West's deal after he went on a podcast and claimed, quote, \"I can say antisemitic things and Adidas can't drop me.\" The Anti-Defamation League says incidents against Jewish people in the U.S. were at the highest levels on record last year. Also, I want you to get you up to speed on what's just coming into us here at CNN. We are learning of a shooting at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis, Missouri. CNN's Brynn Gingras is following these developments. So Brynn, the district has confirmed that there were at least two injured. What more do we know?",
