Obviously, every one of those ballots is important because of the tight margins in these key races, the U.S. Senate race as well as the state's gubernatorial race.Here where I am in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, there are still an outstanding 340,000 ballots to be counted. That process is happening behind me here at the county election center. Now I want to hone in on a particular batch of ballots that could give us an indication of where this election is going. And that is the 290,000 ballots that were dropped off on Election Day by those who had received their ballot in the mail. This is important because as we start to get more information from that tranche of ballots that will indicate whether we're seeing -- we're moving in the direction of the Republicans or the Democrats. We know a lot of Republican leaders had suggested to their supporters that they actually vote that way. Even though they had a mail-in ballot, they suggest that they bring them to the polls on Election Day. That's also why these number --countings are taking so long because that is a rigorous process. These people behind me that are working, doing their civic duty, have to check the signature on those ballots, they have to ensure that they match up with the voter information. Now, that process itself, the slow methodical process has been the start of a lot of conspiracy theories that we've saw -- we've seen recently, particularly by Kari Lake, who's a Republican gubernatorial candidate. She has suggested that officials here are purposely slow- walking or slow-rolling that election process in order to help Democrats. That has drawn a lot of ire from election officials, including a man by the name of Bill Gates, who is the county election supervisor, a Republican. He spoke out against those conspiracy theories. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're looking at about 27,000 votes.So still 100 -- several 100,000 votes left to be counted in this state. We'll have to watch and wait and see where this goes. We are expecting another release of ballots here in Maricopa County. We were told a short time ago by election officials that could come around 8:00 p.m. local time hour, 10:00 p.m. Eastern, all lies on the state. We'll wait as they count.

That includes campaigning for him. That includes should he win and being inside the White House and this is a big change for Jared and Ivanka.Of course, they were key in the Trump administration the first time around. They were certainly two of his most close advisors. Everything went through Jared Kushner, as we know, as we read through the years during the Trump administration. Ivanka Trump, not only his daughter but a very close confidant for him as well. But in the two years since the White House, the couple has decided they are no longer interested in politics. They have moved on whereas perhaps their father has not from politics. Now I will say this. As the family is gathering for Tiffany's wedding this weekend in Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle are on board. I am told that Don Jr. will campaign for his father, should he decide to run that he will be one of his advisors. Same goes for Eric Trump, the other adult Trump's son, and that he will be involved. But certainly, it is a change for Donald Trump should he run not to have Jared Kushner, not to have Ivanka Trump by his side. This is a family that post-White House has definitely split in terms of how they see their own futures and whether politics is involved. And Jared and Ivanka have decided that it is not for them, moving forward.",

And in the Atlanta -- the Atlanta suburbs, he is a negative. And this is something that his candidates did not really understand. And I'm not convinced that he understands either, that for every one voter who thinks he's God, you've got one and a half who thinks he's horrible. And it had an impact in Pennsylvania, had an impact in New Hampshire. You're watching that impact right now in Arizona. Trump is brilliant at giving at providing the margin of victory and a primary.

They wanted to keep their family safe, and they could afford to do so.And those voters switch to the Republicans and the other key factor was Trump. He wasn't there. He wasn't involved. He wasn't engaged. He wasn't picking winners and losers. He was not part of the process.

It's one thing when he's attacking Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden, Republicans expect that.But when he's attacking the next generation of Republican leadership, mark my words, the party is going to turn against him. And the angrier he gets at other conservative Republicans, the more that they're going to punish him with a loss of support and a loss of faith and confidence in his message and what he -- what he brings to the political process. I -- if I were advising him right now, I would tell him to take a very long vacation, simply disappear for the next 30 days because he's destroying himself every single day by attacking Ron DeSantis, Glenn Youngkin, people who other Republicans, respect and appreciate and voted for in big numbers in the previous elections.",

While he's there. he has everything from Indo-Pacific security on the agenda as well as trade.

But on Monday at the G20 Summit in Cambodia, that's where the president is going to have his biggest meeting of this trip. And that's the meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping where we expect the president to address the relationship in general there. There are so many topics for them to touch on, including climate change, including Indo-Pacific security. But more than anything, advisors have told us that the president wants to take a measure of Xi Jinping for their first face-to-face meeting to get a sense of where this relationship is going and to try and avoid any miscommunication going forward. Today, though, the president was addressing climate change at the COP27 Summit in Egypt. We heard President Biden for the first time be able to not just give the rhetoric about the U.S. wanting to be a leader on climate change, but actually be able to tout some progress that the U.S. has made with $370 billion in investments to tackle climate change, pass through the Inflation Reduction Act.
