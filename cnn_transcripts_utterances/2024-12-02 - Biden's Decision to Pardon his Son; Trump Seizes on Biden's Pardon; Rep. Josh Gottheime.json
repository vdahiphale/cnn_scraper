Patel has promised to go after journalists, among others, and more or less dismantle the agency. We've got new reporting on the confirmation battle that is brewing this morning. And then feet of snow. Feet. Just in time for record-breaking travel. Sara is out. I'm John Berman, with Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We are standing by to hear directly from President Biden as we learn new details about his decision process to do something that he and the White House repeatedly insisted that he would not do. He pardoned his son, Hunter. And not just any pardon. A full and unconditional pardon. He had faced sentencing later this month for federal tax and gun convictions. Now he will not face sentencing. But this pardon also grants him clemency for any other federal crimes he might have committed during a long ten year period. President-elect Trump is weighing in, as our lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. This does have the potential to affect confirmation of Trump's nominees and possible pardons for January 6th criminals. CNN's Arlette Saenz is standing by in Angola, in Africa, where the president is traveling this morning. What are you hearing at this point, Arlette?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, it was a stunning reversal for President Biden as he issued this pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, after months of saying he would not make this move.Now, President Biden reached this decision as he huddled with his family in Nantucket, Massachusetts, over the Thanksgiving holiday. I'm told he ultimately informed senior staff at the White House that he was moving forward with this decision on Saturday evening. The president had called a meeting with his senior staff, and he, in that meeting, with some people in person and some over the phone, shared his decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden. He ultimately told the team he wanted to release a statement on Sunday night, and those details were finalized on Sunday morning. For President Biden, this really caps off years of family internal struggles over not just Hunter's addiction, but also dealing with the Republican attacks on their family. Ultimately, President Biden said that he made this decision as a father. He believes that his son was unjustly and unfairly maligned by Republicans up on Capitol Hill, and said that he believes that these charges were politically motivated simply because of the fact that Hunter Biden was President Joe Biden's son. Now, in his statement released on Sunday night, the president wrote, \"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. And once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.\" He added, \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\" The statement makes no mention of his reversal, but it comes after, back in June, both before and after Hunter Biden was found guilty on those felony gun charges in Delaware, the president, at the time, had said that he would not pardon his son. Take a listen to a few of those moments back in June. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS (June 6, 2024): Let me ask you, will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is?

But ever since he was elected on November 5th he's been silent on the matter. And it's raised questions, I know, from many of his supporters and others who have really been anticipating that Donald Trump would carry out that pledge and his vow to pardon the January 6th convicts.But Donald Trump did, for the first time, address it last night in responding to this pardon of Hunter Biden. He released this statement on his social media website, Truth Social, just moments after that announcement. This is what he said. He wrote, quote, \"does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J 6th hostages who have now been imprisoned for years, such an abuse and miscarriage of justice.\" Now, Kate, I can tell you, I've asked Donald Trump's transition team about that pledge to pardon these January 6th convicts in the weeks since Donald Trump won the election. Essentially I've been told that they were focused more so on putting together Donald Trump's cabinet and some of the other hires before January 20th. So, it's something they said that was a matter of what they would address in the coming weeks. But this may be the reopening now that they need to kind of reform and rethink how they are going to handle that. I will also argue, though, that in the aftermath of this pardon, we've really seen a lot of Donald Trump's allies, including Republicans on Capitol Hill, but also many members of Donald Trump's transition team and incoming cabinet kind of seize on this moment as well to argue that it is an example of what they've been arguing for the last several years now, which is that they believe that President Joe Biden weaponized, in their words, the justice system against Donald Trump and others. And so, this, as well, could be kind of an opening that they may use to kind of support some of the big changes that Donald Trump wants, including a lot of the shakeups he wants at both the FBI and the Justice Department more broadly.",

That picked up several feet. But 65.5, yes, that's nearly as high as this weatherman. You can swim in that snow it's so deep. Now, this is because of the wind direction, right? You can see the sped-up radar over the past weekend and how they lined up. These snow bands really just south of Buffalo, where the airport only received a little over an inch.
