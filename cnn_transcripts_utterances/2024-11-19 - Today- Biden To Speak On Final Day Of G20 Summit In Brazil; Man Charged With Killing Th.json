It's meant to help countries mimic the president's own Inflation Reduction Act, which we expect him to tout. But it just highlights, John, the fact that this week for President Biden on the world stage has become more of an exercise in highlighting his own accomplishments that could simply be reversed by the incoming administration or forgotten by other leaders than it has been perhaps the boisterous, laudatory send off that perhaps he envisioned just a few weeks ago. For President Biden, it has been a relatively quiet trip here. He had pull-aside meetings with the leaders of Canada and Mexico yesterday thanking them for their partnership, of course, to close allies both in proximity and in -- and in ideals that the two countries share. But President Biden is set to make his departure here from Brazil in just a few hours marking his first major summit without a press conference since he took office as he heads back to Washington, D.C. --guys.",

And we've done this for eight years now. Donald Trump can depend on us to do that. And it's why when things like The Wall Street Journal editorial page put out information like this, Republican members need to see it. But the reality is in the United States Senate -- so let me take you on the House floor real quick, Sara. A lot of conversations that House members and staff are having about what legislation is on the floor, about what you did that weekend, about what the football game is this weekend, and so forth. But as Republican senators are talking to each other and they're saying to say Markwayne Mullin, who served in the House as well, tell me about what Matt Gaetz would be like on the floor, Markwayne Mullin is going to tell them about lurid pictures that Matt Gaetz would show and stories that he would tell on the House floor. Completely out of bounds, completely unacceptable. And that's why his nomination is most likely doomed. But again, these are the things that draw headlines and conversations.

We have no confirmation whatsoever from the Ukrainians. But they're offering more details as to where exactly their missiles that the Ukrainians apparently fired were fired into it was the Bryansk region, which is sort of the in the southwest of Russia. And the Russians are saying they were fired towards a military object there. The Russians are claiming that the missiles -- five of them -- were allegedly shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile system -- however, that some parts from these missiles fell onto the site of that military object. Again, we're getting this from Russian state media via the Russian Defense Ministry. No confirmation coming from the United States or from the Ukrainians so far. But, of course, the other big story here in Russia right now is that nuclear doctrine that's been updated -- as the Russians say, by Vladimir Putin -- including now a new scenario where the Russians are saying that if Russia is attacked using long-distance weapons like those missiles by a non-nuclear country like, for instance, Ukraine, aided by a nuclear county like, for instance, the United States, that could now trigger a nuclear response from the Russians. There are some other new scenarios in there as well like, for instance, an attack on Belarus also using conventional weapons. In general, Sara, what we're seeing now with this updated nuclear doctrine is the Russians drastically lower the threshold for first use of nuclear weapons. Again, right now, very difficult to see whether or not this is bluster on the part of the Russians. But what we have seen in the past couple of weeks is the Kremlin trying -- or starting a campaign, if you will, to try and dissuade the Biden administration from making exactly the decision that it has now made to allow the Ukrainians to use these weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Kobayashi was traveling from her home in Hawaii to New York when she missed her connection. She was last seen at LAX on November 8. On November 11, her family -- her mother texted her to ask if she had made it to New York and received the response, \"No.\" That's the last time anyone heard from her. Her family is now desperate to find her after receiving a series of other suspicious text messages from her phone. She sent messages to a friend saying that she didn't feel safe.
