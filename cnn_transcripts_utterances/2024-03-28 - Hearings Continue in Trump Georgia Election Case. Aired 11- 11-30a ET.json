We're hearing from one of the attorneys, Mr. Gillen, who is counselfor a man by the name of Shafer, who is one who has been alleged to be a fake elector in the overall scheme, one of now 14 remaining defendants in this act, after several have already pleaded guilty.

First of all, he's arguing there's nothing criminal about this effort to put forward this slate of, as the defendants call them, alternate electors, as the prosecutors call them, fake electors. And that's an argument that's been made before, has been rejected before, and I think will probably be rejected here. At a minimum, I think the judge is likely to say, well, that's for the jury. And then the second argument, and Sara Murray was just talking about this, is what we call advice of counsel. Now, we will hear this throughout the Trump cases, where a defendant can say, I did that because an attorney of mine told me it was OK. Now, it's not quite that easy. First of all, the advice itself can't be ridiculous. It can't be something that the client actually knew or should have known was illegal. And the other thing is, anyone who argues attorney-client privilege, who says advice of counsel defense, who says, I did this because my attorney blessed it, when you make that argument, you give up your attorney-client privilege. So all those otherwise secret, confidential communications between the attorney and the client, they will all come out if Mr. Shafer or anyone else actually makes that defense at trial.",

I mean, he was the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. Georgia is going to be a critical state in 2024. Biden won by such a small margin, as we know, Donald Trump obviously asking for those 11,000 votes that Biden won by, and that's part of what's on trial here. But the parties now across the country, particularly in these swing states, particularly in these states in which Donald Trump's attorneys at the time were trying to create these slates of alternate or fake electors, they still haven't really recovered. And that's going to be a huge uphill battle for Donald Trump when he's running in 2024 against Joe Biden in what is expected to be a very close election, because you have some of these people who are still charged, who still are facing trial, who have actually fractured the Republican Party, which is not what you want going into a general election.",

The judge is hearing motions. Fani Willis has said in recent days that she's continuing to prepare. I don't think it's realistic that this case is going to start in August.

He's not being charged with just telling lies.He's being charged with telling lies in furtherance of some criminal activity. And so that takes you to the intent question. Was this why he was doing it? Was this the purpose behind it? Is this part of the effort, the conspiracy to either cover up or to expand the RICO enterprise? And so those are things typically that come out at trial. The First Amendment arguments are unique. I did take a little interest to hear the prosecutors say, well, some judge somewhere else has already ruled on this. Well, we happen to have dual sovereigns in this country. And that is that there's a state court and a federal court. And this judge does not have to be bound by that federal judge. He has to be bound by the Supreme Court, obviously, but not here. So it's a little bit interesting take. We will see how it goes.",

In this case, what his attorney, Steve Sadow, said in court today was there's nothing alleged here except the false statements. There's nothing -- there's no other evidence to be presented. So we're going to have to watch to see how the prosecutors actually present the case in court, because the facts are very similar. But what ends up going to trial may be a different thing entirely as far as what they're putting forward to the jury.",

And what's going on now is, you're hearing from one of the councils from Mr. Shafer, who is accused of being a false elector. This whole thing revolves around whether the court is going to allow the case to be dismissed or to go forward. Fani Willis, of course, wants it to actually happen in August. Unlikely, but that's her request. Let's go to Elie Honig for a moment here, because you have heard a lot be made about this sort of dual sovereignty, a fancy way of saying, look, who has to stay in their lane, Fulton County and follow their own court cases or what's happening in other cases? And there are many. I want to turn your attention for a second, Elie, to what Judge Chutkan has had to say about a similar argument being made around the First Amendment. Specifically, she said that this has to go essentially to trial. Let's bring up that shot of what she had to say. \"While defendant challenges an allegation in his motion and may do so at trial, his claim that his belief was reasonable does not implicate the First Amendment. If the government cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial that, of course, defendant knowingly made false statements,he will not be convicted. That would not mean the indictment violated the First Amendment.\" So it tracks in a different case, Elie, the similar argument about whether this should go before a jury or not. What do you think?",
