Thank you very much.Let's bring in Pete Seat, former White House spokesperson for President George W. Bush. Pete, I want to go back to -- I hope you were listening into the beginning of the program and everything that we aired since, because a few moments ago, we aired Donald Trump's comment that he sees America as a garbage can and also Ronald Reagan's, you know, shining city on the hill. I mean, that is a pretty startling contrast to go from the shining city on the hill, Reagan's view of America, and Donald Trump's. PETE SEAT, V.P., BOSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS GROUP:  It's a forgotten time in America, Jim, and a lot of voters who will be headed to the polls or who have voted already were not around for the days of Ronald Reagan, when leadership meant something very different than it means today. At least in Donald Trump's thinking, leadership is about being strong and projecting that strength all across the world. I think those comments -- look, I've said this dozens of times on this network and elsewhere. I wish he did not speak like this, but this is Trump being Trump. This is Stephen Miller's dream. This is what he wants. He wants Trump to be authentically himself and to speak in a way that garners coverage and attention. And as was mentioned, fear is part of the closing argument of this campaign. But I would point out, fear is part of the closing argument for both campaigns. Trump is running on the fear of illegal immigration. Kamala Harris is running on the fear of Trump. And it's because fear motivates. Fear is how you get people to show up to the polls. And they're both trying to reach those low propensity voters who may show up because they're fearful of the alternative candidate winning.",

He said that he would eliminate the Department of Education. He said that he would appoint a special prosecutor to go after Hillary Clinton. None of those things happened.And that's why you've seen in recent polling Latinos, for example, they don't believe his rhetoric on this. A lot of Americans think he's full of it when he stands behind a podium at a rally and says the things he says, and they look at the record of how the administration impacted their lives positively, and that's how they're casting their vote for him.",

They drove all the way to San Diego to get the guns. They planned how they're going to do it. They went in, surprised their parents who were just sitting there watching T.V., eating ice cream, you know, and shot them, shooting 16 shots, and then went out, reloaded to make sure that they killed their mother, you know, shooting her in the cheek. It was a very horrific crime. So, even if you accept the sexual abuse, there are still people who say this is a premeditated first-degree murder that they confessed to and the punishment that they were given is appropriate in this case. But, remember, resentencing kind of looks beyond that. Resentencing looks at other factors as well. It's more in the, in the interest of justice. So, you look at how they've done in prison, you look at how much time they've served, you look at if there was trauma in their background, you look at if there are things that have changed the situation since the time of sentencing.
