The horrible mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. 11 people were killed from three different Jewish congregations that day.CNN's Danny Freeman is in Pittsburgh. He's following this for us. Danny, what's been happening in court so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, court kicked off earlier this morning just before 9One of the jurors, in fact, teared up when just pose the question, do you think you could impose the death penalty in this case? And that potential jury said -- again, started to be filled with tears just because she said this was a place of worship and should have been a safe space. But let me bring you to how we got to this point to begin with. Of course, we're talking about October 27, 2018, four and a half years ago now. That's when prosecutors say that Robert Bowers arrived at the Tree of Life synagogue with multiple guns. Members I just said of three different Jewish congregations were there at that time. And at that point, prosecutors say that Bowers came in and started firing outside and then inside the synagogue indiscriminately, and also saying things, according to the criminal complaint, that he wanted to kill Jews. And prosecutors later found that there were actually social media postings that were anti-Semitic as well. So that leads us to today. Now, we have 63 felony counts here, 22 of which do carry that death penalty charge. And prosecutors have been pursuing this death penalty case. But it's interesting, Kate, the defense team here, they've been trying to argue against that death penalty leading up to this particular moment. In fact, Clarke -- I should say Bowers has hired defense attorney Judy Clarke to be on this team. And Clarke has represented other high-profile federal death penalty defendants, including Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the Boston Marathon bombing, the Unabomber as well. Her defense team, in fact -- rather Bower's defense team even offered a plea deal with the possibility of having life in prison, if that meant taking the death penalty off the table. But at this point, those federal prosecutors, they have not budged. So, that's what brings us here today. And I got to tell you. The conversation in that courtroom right now has been a lot on do you feel comfortable imposing the death penalty in this case? And that's what attorneys on both sides are asking jurors to find out because they will probably have to rule on that if they get to the sentencing part of this trial. Again, a lot of emotion here in Pittsburgh today and for likely weeks and months to come, Kate.",

And my expectation is that the Pennsylvania House will pass them and we'll see what happens in the Senate. But we're going to work across party lines, across the chambers to see if we can do something along these lines. So, you know that's another aspect of what's going on here. I mean, to have hate groups that have access to weapons of mass destruction, you know we've got to -- we've got to prevent that from happening.
