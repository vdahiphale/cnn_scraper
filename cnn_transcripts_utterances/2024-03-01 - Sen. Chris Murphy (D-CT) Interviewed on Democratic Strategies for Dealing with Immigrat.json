      "sentences": "So there's additional polling out yesterday that shows when Democrats just simply point out what happened on the bipartisan border bill, that it was the toughest bill if enacted in decades, and it was killed by Donald Trump, that Republicans' political advantage on the issue of immigration disappears. It literally disappears because people kind of have come to that conclusion, that yes, Republicans talk a big game on immigration, but have they ever done anything? No, they haven't.I think Democrats should lead with a simple message. We believe in border security. We want to protect the border and we have a plan to get that done. Republicans have no plan to get that done. Now, I also think that we should talk about the importance of providing a pathway to citizenship for people that are here. We should maintain robust legal immigration. But we should not be afraid by talking about the fact that we are now the party that has the plan to control and protect the border. And it is Republicans who are standing in the way of controlling the border because they want the border to remain out of control because they think it helps them politically. I think we should lead with that message. Democrats historically have been a little reticent to be out front on our front foot talking about border security. It's not a Republican issue. It's an American issue. Everybody in this country cares about the border. Everybody wants legal immigration, and Democrats should be out there on the offensive, telling the story of what happened in Congress over the past few months and telling people how Donald Trump really is trying to keep the border a mess.",

I'm right outside the Borisovsky Cemetery in one of the suburbs of Moscow where, as you've just been saying, the casket of Alexei Navalny is already inside with what we think are friends and family attending the actual burial. But you can see how many thousands of people there are outside the cemetery gates carrying flowers, carrying messages, mourners that are -- have been queuing up here, lining up here all day to pay their last respects to Russia's most prominent opposition figure.But it is also a very tight security operation. You can see there are riot police, like this one here, who are lining the entire route that the funeral procession has taken. And they're not letting these thousands of people who have come to pay their respects to Alexei Navalny at the cemetery actually inside the grounds of that facility. There's a metal detector that has been set up. Perhaps people will be allowed in later, but at the moment they have not been. And they're just standing out here waiting for the opportunity to go inside. All day, John, we've been seeing people with messages of support, chanting those slogans, chanting Alexei Navalny's name, chanting opposition slogans, anti-Kremlin slogans, anti-war slogans as well. [08:05:4] And these are exactly the kinds of scenes that the Kremlin did not want to see, particularly in the weeks running up to a presidential election in this country in which Vladimir Putin is expected to be reconfirmed for a fifth term as the country's leader. But nevertheless, dissent in Russia is very barely tolerated. Over the past couple of weeks since the death of Navalny, we've seen hundreds of people across the country be detained just for laying flowers at makeshift memorials in towns and cities across Russia. At the moment, as I say, the thousands of people that have turned out at Alexei Navalny's funeral, they're not being detained. We're not seeing any police action as far as I'm aware so far, to clear up these crowds. That might change in the future. Obviously, we're going to keep close eye on it. But as I say, the riot police are making absolutely sure that nobody steps out of the bounds of the designated root of this funeral, while so many people, so many Russians here are gathering, as I say, to pay their respects, John.,",

She's a Russian historian and author, also the great granddaughter of 20th century Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. It's really good to see you, Nina, thank you so much for coming in. I mean, what do you think of the sea of people that we are seeing, Matthew Chance is seeing on the ground, from the funeral service through now the burial that we just continue you to get more images out, what do you think of this? NINA KHRUSHCHEVA, GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER OF NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV:  Thank you. Well, it is heartbreaking and heartwarming both at the same time. I'm not surprised. I actually expected this amount of thousands of people because we see that, we saw it when the presidential candidate, who was not registered, Boris Nadezhdin, was running with anti-Putin slogans and collected many, many signatures around Russia, and people were queuing to sign up for him. So we the protests to somewhere brewing and then it can jump out at any moment. But what I'm also interested in is how despite all the police, and you wouldn't expect any less, it is allowed to take place. It is allowed to take place the way it has taken place. And of course, the slogan originally was just the memory of Alexei Navalny. Thats what they were chanting. And then it started to be no war, Putin is a murderer, and so on. But the state allowed it to continue, to go through with, to kind of follow some Christian norms that Yulia Navalnaya, the wife, now widow of Alexei Navalny spoke about, that Putin has no, he's a false Christian because he doesn't allow Alexei to be buried properly. So they're allowing it to happen. And so even despite the fact that in, what, two weeks Russia would go through reconfirming Putin, they still allowed it to happen. So for them it's important to show they're not as godless and they're not as barbarian as they are being presented. And so I think it's good for Alexei Navalny, and I'm thinking about other in previous years, the funeral of Andrei Sakharov in 1989 when there was actually a little police, but a lot of -- many more, even many more people than now. So the state kind of stayed away from the funeral, but allowed it to happen.",

I mean, of course the Kremlin is very eager to make sure that nothing comes out, that no steam would come out. But you talk to people and they're against it. I mean, they are afraid because the state has very long hands, and we see that.But at the same time it's not as monolithic as it is often presented here in the west. So it's another thing, the reason they come out, and it's dangerous, but it's not as dangerous, once again, as we think it is from far away, because this is an officially sanctioned thing. They may be started -- I don't know whether they're going to be named collected or somehow because there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people. It would be difficult to arrest everybody. But it is officially sanctioned. And there's an officially sanctioned thing, it's reasonably safe to go out precisely because it's allowed to do that. It's a Christian thing to do. So people may be in danger, but they don't think there is as much danger when they do an individual projects because there are masses of people. I was a bit surprised, but not really when there were chants no to war, but that was later in the process, and I don't think the state decided -- it seems to be the state decided it's not worth really shutting it down because it would create more problems that it actually, that it actually solves. So in this way, Russia's still protests when the state allows it to speak out. And I think that more and more Putin will stay in his power for another six years, the less is going to happen, the less the state will take chances of this kind, because, once again, I think after 25 years in power, Putin gets more and more paranoid. So people will be less inclined even in the official sanction, but there's a possibility protests will go up.",

And in those conversations, the White House said that all the leaders discussed the need to really act urgency in the sense of trying to reach some type of agreement when it comes to a hostage release, getting more aid in and reaching some type of temporary ceasefire.It really comes as the Biden administration and officials from Qatar and other Arab countries have really been working around the clock trying to secure some type of deal between Israel and Hamas. Now President Biden yesterday told me that he does believe that this incident that left at least a hundred people dead, that it will complicate these negotiations. But officials say it really highlights the urgency in which they need to act. This area severely needs additional assistance to get to its people. And the White House has been hoping that they would be able to secure some type of agreement in the near future when it comes to security to hostage release, getting that aid in, and also having a temporary ceasefire. The president at the start of the week had indicated that he believed it could be reached by Monday. Yesterday, he walked that back a little bit saying that he is still hopeful, but it probably will not be happening before Monday. But in the wake of this incident in Gaza City, there have been calls from the international community for there to be an independent investigation into this matter. The UN secretary general said that just yesterday, France this morning said that they would sign on to that. So there's still a lot of questions about how exactly this all played out and it does come at a time when the US is facing a pressure as they're trying to help push along this deal as they would like to see some type of temporary ceasefire come together in the near future to get aid in and get those hostages out.",
