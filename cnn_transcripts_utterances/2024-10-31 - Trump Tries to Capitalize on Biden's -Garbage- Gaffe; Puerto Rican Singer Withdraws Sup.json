And of course, while a number of measures and offices are on the ballot there, it is President of the United States, that race that is getting the most attention. Good to have all of our viewers with us here in the United States and around the world. Becky, I know we're going to have much more from you and that very important interview that you had with the Foreign Minister just ahead. We do begin this hour, though, with the election here in the United States with just five days to go now. The race remains deadlocked. And frankly, who could win is really coming down to which campaign manages to not alienate voters. So many votes are key here. And as it stands now, each side really trying to capitalize on their opponent's missteps. The word of the week may be garbage here in the United States. It all began with a comic so-called comedian making a comment on Sunday night at a rally for Donald Trump, where he called the island of Puerto Rico a, quote, \"floating island of garbage.\" Outraging Latinos, but frankly, many Americans across the board on both sides of the aisle. It also was seen as a bit of an energizing move for the Harris campaign as they leaned in looking for more support. And then came Tuesday night when Joe Biden seemed to hand that gift right back to the Trump camp when he appeared to call Trump supporters garbage during an online campaign event before trying to clarify that his remark was referring to just a single supporter, the person who had made that comment on stage Sunday night. Harris quickly distanced herself from Biden's comments Wednesday morning. Trump leaning in here, donning an orange safety vest and riding into a campaign event in a garbage truck. So what is the impact now on votes in the final days of the election? Look, we know how tight this race is. If you look specifically at the so-called blue wall states, you can see Harris is a slight lead over Trump in two of those three critical blue wall states. But as you know, Pennsylvania is really getting a lion's share of the attention here. And they appear tied at this point. We know that the reality is this race in 2024 could come down to a few thousand votes in any of these states, just as it has in the last two presidential elections. So here to help break down where things stand, Stephen Collinson, joining me from Washington. Steve Contorno is in St. Petersburg, Florida. And Elizabeth Wagmeister also with us this hour from Los Angeles. So, Stephen, first of all, based on where we stand today, what we have seen is the Harris campaign, right, really trying to lean in here to the outrage that came out of that event Sunday night, releasing a new Spanish language ad, taking him specifically at the Trump campaign, disparaging comments toward Latin Americans and specifically, of course, Puerto Ricans. It gives a sense. Has anything shifted in these days? Because we know how important every vote is.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, there was quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that the remarks by the comedian about PuertoRico had really put the Trump campaign in a bind. One of the reasons is that Hispanic voters are a bloc which normally votes by majority to Democrat. But Trump has seen a quite strong push into this bloc. If he's to win the election, one of the reasons will be that he was able to eat into Democratic majorities there. This is important, not just in the western and southern swing states, places like Arizona and Nevada. In Pennsylvania, that key state you were talking about in the Lehigh Valley, one of the key areas of that state where Democrats normally win, but Trump is hoping to eat into those Democratic majorities. There are 35,000 or so Puerto Rican voters specifically. So that story, which was running for three days, was potentially damaging to Trump, which is one reason I think that the Trump campaign was very happy to see President Biden's comments, which kind of drowned out a lot of the talk about that rally on Sunday night.",

The difference in both those cases is those remarks came from the candidates themselves. While these came from Joe Biden, who is a very gaffe prone politician and has been excused for many inarticulate phrasing over the years.

Immediately you had JenniferLopez, Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny, all taking to social media either to denounce Trump or to support Harris. Now, Bad Bunny in particular, he is one of the biggest stars on the planet. And I have been hearing for months from a source close to the campaign that he was really at the top of their celebrity wish list for an endorsement, particularly because they know that he can reach young male Latino voters, which is an area where we know that Trump has excelled. Now, Nicky Jam, who is another Latin artist, he is a reggaeton superstar. He had actually initially endorsed former President Trump last month in September. He appeared on stage with him at a rally in Las Vegas wearing his red MAGA hat. Yesterday, he said that he is withdrawing his endorsement from Trump. Let's take a look at what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICKY JAM, REGGAETON ARTIST (through translator): The reason I supported Donald Trump was because I thought he was the best for the economy in the United States, where a lot of Latinos live, myself included, a lot of immigrants who are suffering because of the economy. Never in my life did I think that one month later there would be a comedian who would criticize my country and speak poorly of my country. And for that, I withdraw my support of Donald Trump.

Now, Jennifer Lopez, who has over 250 million followers on Instagram, she will be joining Harris tonight at a rally. So that is obviously a huge sign of A-list support coming after Beyonce joined Harris this past weekend. I do have to tell you, though, that even though Hollywood historically always aligns with the Democratic candidate, so this is not a huge surprise that Harris is getting all of this Hollywood support, there are more celebrities than ever who are aligning themselves with former President Trump. Maybe not the same level of celebrity, but you have Dr. Phil. Last night we had football legend Brett Favre join him on stage back in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

But it shows how such an intricate issue can be a bit of a minefield, if you like, politically in the campaign trail. What was really interesting is that the Harris campaign has enlisted Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator who basically did a video and said, I understand why a lot of people are thinking about not voting for Harris because of the Middle East situation and their living in Michigan. Sanders argued that you'll get a far worse situation if you support the Palestinians. If Donald Trump, a key ally of the Netanyahu government is elected, then you will do, if Harris is there, even though he faults a lot of the administration's policies on the Middle East. I think the problem here is that this is not necessarily a pragmatic decision that people are taking. For many of those voters, the scenes of civilian deaths in Gaza, that's an existential issue. It makes this a one-issue election. And that is something that the Harris campaign has tried very hard to fight against.

Really, the only way for us to find a pathway to de-escalate all of what's going on in the region is for everybody to make a conscious decision that further escalation is dangerous, is risky, is risky for all parties. So that will also mean Israel will need to de-escalate. It will also mean that our partners in the international community will need to redouble their efforts, that we focus on de-escalating all of these issues.

Thecourt battle in Philadelphia today is over this attempt by Elon Musk to delay a hearing about that $1 million giveaway that prosecutors allege is illegal and also an improper attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election. So right now they are hashing that out in court as to whether or not the case should be moved to federal court. Ultimately, though, prosecutors are alleging that Elon Musk is simply trying to delay this matter from being resolved until after the presidential election, because until it is resolved, this $1 million giveaway can continue. So really framing this as an attempt by Elon Musk to influence the election. But separately, and also related, Elon Musk has for months and even as recently as this week continued to spread misinformation on X to his 200 million-plus X followers, but also X itself, the platform which Elon Musk obviously owns, has really become sort of a breeding ground of misinformation related to the election. We've heard from election officials in those seven battleground states, specifically all of them talking about how Elon Musk presents a unique challenge because of this megaphone of misinformation that he has at his disposal and that Trump is using to build out his presidential campaign. We've heard from state officials who have said that they've tried to appeal to Musk personally through intermediaries even. They've asked to pass information to Musk, trying to get him to stop amplifying misinformation about the election. They've tried to fact-check him in real time on Twitter.

Musk has resisted all of those attempts by election officials, those pleas from election officials to stop pushing misinformation about the election and making their jobs much more difficult. In fact, Musk has set up this -- what's called an election integrity community on X, where he's encouraging his followers this week to report any irregularities that they observe with the 2024 election. Some of the theories that are being posted in that channel have already been debunked by those same state officials whose outreach Musk previously rebuffed. So this all happening all centering around Elon Musk, but obviously his Super PAC and his misinformation role in the campaign really tied directly to Donald Trump, who himself obviously is -- amplifies misinformation on a regular basis and continues to claim that the election is already in the process of being stolen without presenting any evidence to support that fact.",

Of course, much discussion about how to navigate uncertain times here, as well as an ever-present elephant in the room. What happens just days from now in the U.S. elections? Well, in a wide-ranging interview earlier, I asked the Saudi Foreign Minister whether the kingdom favors either candidates. Spoiler alert, he doesn't. And whether Riyadh still sees Washington as a reliable partner. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The kingdom is very different than it was 20, 30 years ago, andthat means the dynamics are somewhat different. It doesn't mean that there is a change in the relationship per se, it just means that we are working together very, very differently. And it also means that we are playing a bigger role in our own national security interests. It also means that we are much more active in diverse partnerships rather than focused on one partnership. All of that is a function of the growth that the kingdom has shown, that the kingdom has seen. The growing geostrategic relevance of the region is actually one of the kind of surprising things, perhaps, that some theorists might notice, that although some years ago there was kind of this idea that our part of the world would decrease in geostrategic relevance, it's actually the opposite. It has just gained, because we are not only continuing to be an important supplier of energy in the traditional energy forms and a source of energy security, but we are also proving to be a critical hub for many of the future technologies, whether it's renewable energy, solar, et cetera, or digital technologies, AI, data centers, not just because of the cheap energy that we can produce from renewables, but also because of our geographic location, which means we are one of the best places for access. So the relevance of our region and certainly of the kingdom has increased, and that has meant that we have had, because of our policy of putting our interests first, which I think it would be odd if somebody didn't do that, focus on diversifying our partnerships as much as possible.",

Part of this bilateral deal is about a civil nuclear program, much of this is about trade, it's about Saudi investment in the U.S. and U.S. investment here. That deal is not yet signed. We keep hearing that this deal is closed. Is the kingdom on a promise that a deal will be done before the end of this administration?",

Some of them we can progress probablyquite quickly, and some of them we are working on, especially those related to trade, AI, et cetera, which are not tied to any other third parties, let's say. Some of the more significant defense cooperation agreements are more complicated. We would certainly welcome an opportunity to finish them before the current administration's term, but that's reliant on other factors outside of our control. And in the end, if we reach them, that's fine. If we don't, you know, we have a very, very strong working relationship with the U.S., even on defense cooperation as it exists.",
