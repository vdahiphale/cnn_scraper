The 22-year-old suspect accused of opening fire Saturday inside an LGBTQ club in Colorado just completed his first court hearing in the case. And we're learning more about the store manager who allegedly opened fire in a Walmart in southeastern Virginia last night killing six people before killing himself. A store employee says the man began shooting in the break room. Now, the two incidents were the deadliest of six mass shootings in the U.S. since Saturday alone, according to the gun violence archive.",

Congressman, thanks for being with us. First, I just want your reaction to this happening in your community, in your neighborhood. REP. BOBBY SCOTT, (D-VA): Well, this happens all too often, and our thoughts are with the victims who have been in touch with the mayor and the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, that have victim assistance programs. And we're making sure that those were available. I've been in touch with Walmart. They're making sure that all of the people who are in the store, victims -- direct victims are otherwise being cared for. So, that's our first thought. But Virginia has been subjected to many of these kinds of incidents going back to Virginia Tech, just last week, University of Virginia, Virginia Beach a little while ago. It just happens all too often. There's something unique about the United States. These kinds of things you just mentioned, over 600 mass shootings just this year, we need to do something about it. [14:05:15] GOLODRYGA: Yes, a shameful number at that. Congressman, Virginia enacted several gun safety laws just last year, including a universal background check, extreme risk protection law, stronger protections for victims of domestic violence, meaningful investments, and community violence intervention programs.

There's not one thing you can do that will cover everything but there are things you can do to reduce the incidence of these mass shootings. And we have to take whatever action is necessary. That might not be enough if we did everything that's on the list now, but we have to say -- begin to take action.The U.S. House passed -- Congress passed, the president signed some bills that took a little step in the right direction.

But the defendant's lawyers in court filings last night say that this suspect identifies as non-binary and uses they-them pronouns. Now, the district attorney was asked after this appearance, whether that will have any bearing on how this case is prosecuted. Remember, right now, the arrest charges are five times first-degree murder, and also five-times bias-related crimes. The DA dismissed that out of hand and said he -- the legal definition is defendant. The DA said I'm looking at evidence to what occurred here. And the pronouns, the non-binary status, he said will have no impact on the way I prosecute this case. Now, this morning, we spoke with one of the suspect's recent neighbors here in Colorado Springs. Apparently, the suspect and the suspect mother lived just down the hall until September. The person we spoke to bonded with the suspect over video games they would play for hours. Now, this neighbor said that the suspect never once mentioned a non- binary status to him. And also that, you know, the suspect had on occasion made slurs against the gay community. Had said that he didn't like -- sorry, they didn't like or slash hated gays, and according to his neighbor used a slur. But these sort of infrequent outbursts, the neighbor told us sort of came apparently from a place of anger and were normally directed in a racial fashion rather than against the LGBTQ community. Now, apparently, the suspect was very pro-free speech, very pro-guns very pro-First and Second Amendment, and showed the weapons to this neighbor, and the neighbor, you know, expressed some concern, and the suspect apparently told this neighbor, it's not the guns you got to be afraid of.

In other places where guns have been taken away, and other things are used.In London, for example, you're talking about steak knife control. In China, you had a mass killing in a school, much more horrific, and it was done with knives. So, it's the issue of the individuals, not necessarily the gun. The guns have been around for, you know, hundreds of years here. We've had semi-automatic guns around for 100 years. And this is more of a recent problem. So, the problem is not the guns per se.

But if we look over the last year, we carry -- we had over 5 million empty seats. And we projected that we'll have another 5 million over the next year. And so, this gives you unlimited access to those seats over 300 days a year for 799. And in -- if the flights are available tomorrow, you know, if the next day, we'll confirm you and it's up to 10 days for international.
