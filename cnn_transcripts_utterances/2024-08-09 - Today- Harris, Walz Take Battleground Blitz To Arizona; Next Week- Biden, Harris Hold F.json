He has a fundraiser there after this Montana trip. Saying that he doesn't have to be there, which is true, but that these are very critical Senate races, in particular, Montana.It is one of the most expensive races we're going to see and it's one of the only races in which the incumbent is a Democrat running for reelection in a state that Donald Trump won by a wide margin. So maybe it is very important for Donald Trump to be there because he is widely popular in Montana to boost up that candidate, Tim Sheehy, and to try to raise money for him as well going into November. But the fact remains the same. There are concerns on the right, his own allies, of what he is doing to campaign. And if you talk to the campaign, they say he's still doing stuff even though he's not out on the trail. Obviously this creates a split screen when we see Kamala Harris on one side with Tim Walz really blanketing these various battleground states and then you have Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He did one event last Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia and then he's going to Montana tonight. Clearly not in those battleground states, but they say that he's reaching out to people and audiences in a different way. He has done a number of interviews. He's reaching out to both conservative media as well as streamers. He's doing podcasts. They believe that he's micro targeting a specific group. But again, you now have this split screen as we are going into a campaign. And if you're looking at a traditional campaign, he should be on those -- on the battleground states. He should be crisscrossing the country. So the big question is, is his travel going to ramp up? What is this going to look like? And will this strategy of reaching out to various groups through interviews instead of necessarily hitting the campaign trail as hard as he did in 2016 pay off in the end?",

The Harris is out -- the Harris campaign is out with a statement calling Trump, quote, \"too lazy\" to campaign in swing states. Trump said he's not going there because he said, quote, \"I'm leading by a lot.\" That's not exactly true. Those battleground states, most of them are pretty tight.

Trump did have a press conference yesterday. It made national news. You could debate whether it was good news or bad news, but he is campaigning. And if you want to make an attack that Trump is too lazy to campaign because he's not having rallies in swing states, I guess we could make an attack that Kamala Harris is too something to hold a press conference or answer questions about her record, her time as vice president, her positions when she was running for president, which she now through anonymous flack says she's changing.So, you know, I guess the campaigns will have a tit for tat on that about who's actually doing what they need to do to assure the American people that they would be a good president for the next four years.",

She can stop and do an interview, but as somebody who's actually run a presidential campaign, the way that you get out in front of people is you go to their states.You have a rally, the press covers that rally, and you're literally taking the message there. And to your earlier reporting, the infrastructure, people walk by that comment too lightly. Having infrastructure in a place like Nevada and Arizona and Pennsylvania means something because you have grassroots organizers going out having conversations on behalf of the campaign at people's kitchen table and at their front door.

You got Walz out here saying he's going to protect the Second Amendment. You'd think these people were running as Republicans when in fact their record is way left of center, way outside of the political mainstream. The bottom line is they don't want her to have to run on any kind of policy agenda. This campaign is an avatar. It is a vessel to just stop Trump. Their main thing is, being president is nothing more than not being named Donald Trump. That's what their platform is. I don't think it's enough, but we'll see if she can get away with it.

And it is up to him to frame this race. I don't think he particularly did it very well at the press conference yesterday, but that's the tight frame in which they have to operate.

But if he is not re-elected, it's also not exactly clear what happens. These cases will continue in some form, but it's going to take a while to really litigate and go through the process of trying to figure out what these cases look like after the Supreme Court's decision.

I mean, there's the old adage justice delayed, is justice denied, but not necessarily when you're a defendant. And I suspect that there may be some dissension between the office of special counsel and main justice on how to proceed because that sweeping ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court has a lot of daylight in it.
