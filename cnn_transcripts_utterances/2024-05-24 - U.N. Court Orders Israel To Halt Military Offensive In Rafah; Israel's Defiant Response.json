And the Israeli government, as of now, appears to be casting it aside, showing no signs that this ruling will impact its military operations going forward in Rafah. As we have watched, this Israeli military offensive there stretching now for nearly three weeks. The Israeli National Security Council and foreign ministry in a statement saying that Israel, quote, has not carried out and will not carry out military activity in the Rafah area that creates living conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population. That, of course, referring to the fact that this ruling is in response, to South Africa's accusations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, something that Israel, of course, has strongly rejected. Now, this isn't just a symbolic measure, although it is one that certainly shows that Israel is increasingly isolated, increasingly condemned on the world stage for its actions in Gaza. But it could also result in some countries who are party to the International Court of Justice imposing sanctions on Israel. That is something that we will have to watch for in the days and weeks ahead.",

It's no surprise that the ICJ did this. There has been an anti-Israel bias by the United Nations and many of its agencies for several years now. So I think Israel will move forward with its operation. They've in some ways gotten the blessing by the administration, which had said that the updated plans that they are using now to move into Rafah to go after the remaining four Hamas battalions meet their standard in terms of addressing civilian casualties. And we also know that four weeks ago or so, there were 1.2, 1.3 million people in Rafah since then, about a million have left. So the numbers of civilians exposed this conflict has been reduced dramatically as well.",

But the problem here is every time these actions are taken, whether it was this action today by the ICJ or a few days by the International Criminal Court to try to arrest the defense minister and the Israeli prime minister, all it does also is jeopardize negotiations between the parties. I mean, Hamas can sit back and say, you know, really not be serious about the negotiations because they see international pressure continue to ramp up against Israel. And in some ways they see a growing divide between Washington and Tel Aviv. So it's bad in terms of really actually forcing both sides to negotiate seriously to return whatever hostages are left alive at this point.",

So my sense is that their demands have consistently been the following. The removal of all Israeli defense forces and personnel from Gaza. And the immediate permanent cessation of all hostilities. And, of course, that would mean that Hamas will return to govern Gaza. All those things are just completely unacceptable to Israel for obvious reasons. So the two sides are very far apart. And I don't see Hamas giving up its leverage. And it's really tragic that today, you know, once again, three of the bodies of three Israelis have been recovered. It's closure for the families. We feel for them. But consider the fact that Hamas has been dragging these bodies around for seven months. They were apparently killed on October 7th. It just speaks to the brutality of this regime that continues to fight and hide out within the population of Palestinians, using them as shields.",

A few hours after that, they confirmed that that couple, along with a third person, according to sources familiar with the situation, was killed. That third person is a Haitian staffer. But this young couple, 23 and 21, according to one source, have been missionaries there for at least the past several months in Haiti in what is an incredibly violent area of Port-au-Prince. That is a city that is occupied basically in total control by the gangs. We're talking about more than 80% of the capital under gang control. So what we know about this situation is that it lasted for several hours, that according to missions in Haiti, the couple there, along with several other children who are part of their caretaking, essentially part of an orphanage that was under this mission, they were leaving a church.They were ambushed by several gang members, we know at least this is one gang that went after them. And then there seems to have been another gang that got involved and potentially even a third gang. So that adds to the confusion. It adds to what was a very desperate situation for the folks who are part of this mission, including that young couple. And we're told they were barricaded in a home for several hours and ultimately killed. So it shows you just how unsettling the situation is. But it's something, as you guys have mentioned, we have seen firsthand and is only likely to worsen as the gangs continue their grip.",

Could be delayed at least another week. And the other thing it could do, Brianna, is it could fracture further these gangs alliance. So the miscommunication potentially that we're hearing could have happened between some of these gangs. Some of the conflict amongst them could then say to these gangs that they maybe are not as cohesive of a unit as they like to portray, as certainly one of the gang leaders himself has told us. And then that could suggest a weakening of these gangs alliance. Allow maybe this international force to have some serious impact in regaining control.",
