What's being done to stop the violence? I'll ask former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Then Ukraine says it's hitting Russia hard in Bakhmut as the Wagner boss demands, get more ammunition from Moscow. And then later, a sitting U.S. house member indicted for lying to Congress -- among other charges. We are live outside the courthouse where George Santos appeared in the last hour. But we begin tonight with the worst escalation of violence across Israel-Gaza border in months. Israel says it's unleashing new airstrikes on Islamic Jihad targets. Palestinian Health Ministry says at least six people have been killed in Gaza today, and that includes a child. Strikes yesterday killed three Islamic Jihad commanders and ten civilians, mostly women and children. Across the border, many Israelis had to run for cover in bomb shelters as air sirens warned of incoming rocket fire. Israel says Gaza militants fired hundreds of rockets at Israel today, dozens were intercepted, but others landed in populated areas. Well, a fresh round of airstrikes -- sirens were heard just a short time ago, and that includes in Tel Aviv. Let's get the very latest from Hadas Gold. So, Hadas things are definitely ratcheting up. Just bring us up to date with the latest.",

But as those reports were swirling, we were getting just a barrage of rockets heading towards Tel Aviv and other cities in Israel. It was kind of an incessant amount -- number of sirens and new rockets. We just heard from the defense minister who confirmed that some 400 rockets have now been fired from Israel -- from Gaza into Israel. And he actually says that a quarter of them fell short. Now, more have been intercepted, some have landed on buildings. There have been no reports of injuries on the Israeli side as a result of these rockets. Some reports of injuries from people as they're running to the shelters, but none from the rockets themselves. That of course, is not the same story in Gaza, where the Israeli military just a few minutes ago confirmed that it was striking once again in response to this latest barrage of rockets, saying that it was striking Islamic Jihad structures and rocket-launching sites and the like. And as you noted, at least, six people have been killed today as a result of the strikes, including one child. That is in addition to those that were killed the day before, during those middle of the night airstrikes that killed those top three Islamic Jihad commanders. The Israeli military saying that they have been trying just to target Islamic Jihad. And it has been interesting to hear how they're trying to essentially keep Hamas out of the equation. Hamas, of course, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip. But Hamas have been issuing a statement saying that it is fighting right alongside Islamic Jihad, that it is working with them. IDF has been saying, oh, it's -- Hamas has not necessarily been firing rockets. It has been Islamic Jihad. It's a different story coming from Hamas. But what's interesting right now as we just heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he just gave a televised address. And what he said -- and actually right as I'm speaking now, I'm getting more alerts of sirens going off in southern Israel just after Netanyahu is speaking. What Netanyahu said, he's saying no word on a ceasefire. He's saying that he's vowing to go after those who hurt Israelis, saying the campaign is not over and it could continue. We have confirmed with sources that the Egyptians are working on a ceasefire, but they're still sort of squishy. We have a full confirmation that either side has accepted any sort of terms. When you look at what's also happening on the ground, things are quite active. But that's where we are right now. Egyptians say that they're working on a ceasefire, both sides have said that they're talking about it. We don't have any sort of indication that the ceasefire is going to happen any time soon, perhaps. Though many people of course hoping that this latest barrage, this latest round, this latest exchange of fire will end soon, and that people can at least return to some sort of calm. Isa?",

There is a wide swath of the American public that is rallying to this individual not despite these problems but because of these problems. That is where his strength comes from, his ability to define what he is against. Every time he is attacked, it reinforces the message that he is in fact fighting on behalf of this community, this group. I hesitate to call it a political party because it is not behaving much like a political party anymore. But that seems to be the source of Donald Trump's social strength.",

The interesting part here is George Santos is in the midst of his campaign. He wants to run again for office. As part of his bond agreement, he can only travel to New York City, Long Island and Washington, D.C..
