It's Thursday, October 12, 5Israel is pounding Hamas targets with what it calls -- its military calls a large scale strike. And the Israel defense forces massed 300,000 troops on the border with Gaza ahead of a potential invasion. The IDF now says at least 1,200 people were killed in Israel, in Hamas' terror attack. Palestinian officials say nearly the same number have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Hamas militants are holding as many as 150 hostages in Gaza, including an unknown number of Americans. President Biden says he is focused on getting them out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He also said he's talking to partners in the region, countries like Egypt, although he acknowledged it's a rather complicated mission. Israel is stepping up its offensive in Gaza. Israeli jets have continued to pound the densely populated enclave in response to Hamas brutal terror attacks. There are multiple developments to tell you about this morning on the sixth day of fighting. Israel is conducting a large scale strike on Hamas, targets in Gaza, that's what the Israeli military said earlier today, Kasie. The death toll continues to climb on both sides. Israeli officials say 1,200 have died as a result of the Hamas attacks and while the Palestinian ministry of health increased the figure in Gaza to more than 1,200 earlier today. The U.N. said a few hours ago that more than 330,000 people have been displaced there since Israel began its bombardment. Another 27 people have died on the West Bank, Kasie. And in another sign that Israel is united in its effort to annihilate Hamas militants, the country's leadership has formed an emergency government and war management cabinet. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a national unity party leader Benny Gantz jointly made the announcement Wednesday. But again, what we see on the ground is still a lot of fighting going on, bombarded, even here in Tel Aviv, we've heard multiple blasts over the last several days, Kasie.",

What do you think is the most likely location for this move to Egypt? And what's the starting point? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, thank you, Kasie, for asking me to join you. I would say that I don't think that they -- no doubt these hostages have been moved. They're probably being moved all the time, but the problem right now is the lack of human intelligence on the ground in Gaza. I mean, that's the reason is the attack occurred in the first place, is that there was too much focus on signal and electronic intelligence and not enough human intelligence. What they need to do is they need to continue the blockade. They need to crank down on the blockade and then wait for human intelligence to emerge. I mean, things are going to start happening when these people can't get their medicines and can't get food and water. You're going to see human intelligence, assets who will probably come up on the net, and allow us to find out where these best chance to locate them, find (AUDIO GAP).",

Maybe they can relieve some of the pressure that's being applied by this blockade and use that as a bargaining chip. But it's very difficult to negotiate in this kind of situation.I think that they should negotiate from a position of power, and the way to do that is to enable this blockade, crank down on the blockade, put the pressure on internally within Hamas, have the people complaining that, hey, what's going on here, I can't get my food and water, my children can't get their medicines. That's going to increase the pressure internally and it's going to make negotiation opportunities much more fruitful.",

As the president mentioned yesterday, we're going to help them replenish some of their Iron Dome missiles. And that's very, very important, repair parts, those kind of things, logistic support. And I think that we can also help them out with air defense. They have the iron dome, but we have systems in Afghanistan that I have personally experienced with CRAM, counter rocket artillery and mortar, that were incredibly effective. We have a number of these systems that are available that are no longer used in Afghanistan. I submit that we need to put those on the ground in Israel immediately.

We manufactured a lot. We have local factories for everything. None of our factions and even our allies did not know about the zero hour of the attack in order to preserve the secrecy of the battle.

This is the picture that we're gradually seeing being built, that Hamas were preparing, and they have spoken to it themselves as well, that Israel was distracted by events in the West Bank and also within their own legal system and the domestic battle.And so, this big operation was being built over two years, extraordinary to think that the Israelis didn't pick up on this intelligence or indeed the Americans. But also I thought what was interesting about that quote that you brought up there, is that none of our allies knew about the zero hour. So it does shed light on this idea that Iran didn't know this was happening. Although in the same interview, this member of Hamas, who is Hamas in Lebanon, by the way, which is separate from Hamas in Gaza, but he clearly seems to know what he is talking about, saying that they had the permission of the Russians. But in terms of the zero hour, they weren't told when that would be, the Iranians effectively, but we were also told by them that they were supplying a lot of these weapons along with Hezbollah and also with the permission of Russia. So, clearly, Iran knew something might be up. They just didn't know when it was happening. So that explains a bit of the language we've had recently.",

You know, the U.S. has strong relations with Saudi Arabia. So does Iran. I think what would be very interesting is finding out what happened in that conversation because Russia folds into all of that basically because Russia has got this relationship with Iran. So it's what Saudi Arabia can do in terms of stabilizing the situation in the Middle East. Continuing that relation with Iran, but also continuing the relationship with the U.S. So I think Saudi Arabia is absolutely central to all of this now and a huge part of U.S. foreign policy.
