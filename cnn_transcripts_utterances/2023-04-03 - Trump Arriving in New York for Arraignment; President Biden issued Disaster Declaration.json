Also another option is to challenge on the timing of what is being charged here. We know that there are some of this case is based around the campaign of 2016 for Donald Trump, hush money payments that were made to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet before the 2016 election and also some financial entries related to the Trump organization, related to that hush money payments.

Some of the very same states across the Midwest will likely see a new round of storms starting Tuesday.

Meantime, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a major disaster declaration for Arkansas at FEMA's arrival. It will free up more federal resources to help in immediate relief efforts. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam has more on the damage the state is facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Governor Sanders arrived on the scene of the badly damaged Wynne, Arkansas, where we find ourselves today. She was flanked by federal representatives from FEMA, but also from the National Weather Service. One of the representatives from the NWS actually telling her, I listened in on this conversation, saying at a bare minimum, they believe that this is an EF-3 tornado. So, they're having meteorologists come out and assess the damage here and an EF three tornado is winds of 136 to 165 mph. That is the bare minimum of what this place experienced. But when we talk about the role that meteorologists have in forecasting this, I was able to ask Governor Sanders about if she felt like the warning lead times there was adequate for warning the residents of Arkansas. Have a listen to what she said. So it sounds just from your press briefing that ah, you did -- you believe that the meteorologist gave adequate warning time for this particular tornado. Do you feel like that saved lives, and can you elaborate on that? GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): Absolutely, there's no doubt that the warnings that came from meteorologists certainly saved lives. You know, one of the things that I found pretty unbelievable as the folks on the ground in Little Rock certainly as the storms were moving through there, they were literally watching their own neighborhoods as they were reporting and warning people knowing that their families were right in harm's way. They stayed on TV. They continued to warn people. They continue to give people notice and did that as best they could throughout the day on Friday. And we're thankful for their willingness to keep staying on the air even though, when it was really difficult for them personally as well.",

The Secretary called for his immediate release. Secretary Blinken further urged the Kremlin to immediately release wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.\" Paul Whelan has -- is in the process of serving a 16-year sentence after facing espionage charges in Russia, Gershkovich is also facing espionage charges, something that the White House and his employer, the \"Wall Street Journal,\" say simply just is not accurate.
