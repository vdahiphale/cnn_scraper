Now, this comes not long after Odessa received the all clear after an air raid siren alert early on Friday. Listen.(VIDEO PLAYING) Well, that terrifying sound continues and this makes four nights in a row now that the city's residents have heard those sirens. To the southeast, meantime, the bridge linking Russia and Crimea is up and running again after that temporary closure late on Thursday and that's according to Russian appointed officials who said the bridge was closed during an air raid alarm. Meantime, the U.S. says its cluster munitions supplied to Ukraine have been used in battle now. The U.S. National Security Council says they've already been having an impact on the battlefield. Scott McLean is keeping an eye on all the latest developments for us and he joins us now from London. I mean, Scott, this perhaps was a little quieter this evening but still quite destructive and menacing for the city. It's been a few days now. Is there a short-term solution?

At first, those air raid sirens went off, and there was no incoming reported. It was only later at dawn, the Ukrainians say, that those grain facilities were actually hit.A case in point, yesterday morning's attack on Odessa saw 19 incoming missiles. Air defenses were able to shoot down barely a quarter of them. They had more success with the Shahed drones. But the difficulty with the missiles, the Ukrainians say, is that because of the type of missiles used, things that are, missiles that are used to target ships or aircraft carriers even, and because the speed at which they fly and the trajectory that they fly at and the altitude, it makes it almost impossible for air defenses, at least the ones that they have, to shoot them down. The Ukrainians say that they could be shot down if they had the Patriot air defenses, the U.S.-made system that is considered the Rolls-Royce of air defense systems. The Ukrainians have at least two batteries. They don't obviously say where they are, but they have previously confirmed to protect Kyiv. The difficulty with the Patriot system though, is that it is a stationary system. It is not easily moved from place to place or quickly redeployed. And that is why President Zelenskyy says, frankly, his country simply needs more of them. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Of course, our soldiers managed to shoot down some of the enemy's missiles and drones. But unfortunately, the capacity of Ukrainian air defense is not yet enough to protect the entire Ukrainian sky. We are working with our partners as actively as possible to add additional air defense systems that can give peace and security to Odessa and all the other cities and communities of our country.

And that is because cluster bombs essentially break apart into little bomblets, close to 100 of them, which spread across an area about the width of a football field. The most intensity, or the area that feels the most intense concentration of bombs is about half of that width.And even the U.S. variety of these weapons has a dud rate, meaning the percentage of bomblets that don't actually explode of more than two percent which can pose a risk down the line to civilian populations similar to landmines. That's why the U.K. and other European countries have banned their use, but not the Americans and not the Ukrainians either. The White House says that they are being used on the battlefield for about a week appropriately, meaning not targeting any civilian areas, but they also say, according to U.S. officials, that they are waiting for progress support to see how effective they've actually been on the battlefield, the Russians. There is evidence that the Russians have used cluster munitions in Ukraine in the past.

CNN's Will Ripley reports now near the DMZ. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Korean DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone, is one of the most heavily fortified border areas in the world. That's the reason why you have barricades and spike strips and all of these military checkpoints to try to prevent people from being able to go in or come out. There's a reason why this road has tank traps. Basically, if tanks were to come rolling down, they would blow up to stop an invasion from the north to the south. And the north has similar booby traps set up as well. So obviously, it's a highly secured area. How did this U.S. Army private just run across? Well, we're learning that on Monday at Incheon airport, about 90 minutes drive from where I'm standing right now. He was supposed to get on an American Airlines flight to Dallas, but he told after going through all of the procedures, all the security right at the gate to the plane, he claimed that he had lost his passport and was escorted back outside of the airport, somehow made his way here on Tuesday where he was able to board, get on a tour. He had booked a tour. It was apparently the passenger manifest was approved by the United Nations command and he along with about 40 other people took a bus down this road over to the unification bridge, and less than five miles that way is the Joint Security Area where he was able to basically, according to others who were on the tour with him, run across ignoring the calls of guards and get into a North Korean van where he was whisked away. Now where he is now after being in North Korean custody for Wednesday and now Thursday, still an open question because the North Koreans have not released any information publicly and it may be quite some time before we officially know anything about this soldier's whereabouts or when he might have a chance of getting back to the U.S. Will Ripley, CNN, in South Korea near the DMZ.

Salman Mamaki, the same man who just last month was engaged in burning pages of the Quran outside a major mosque in Stockholm, held yet another demonstration, this time in front of the Baghdad embassy, the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm. The demonstration lasted about 45 minutes. He was issued himself and his translator permits by Swedish police to carry out this protest, although they emphasize that the permit is for the gathering, not for the happenings at the gathering.The event, the protest, was live-streamed in the video. You can see Salman Mamaki, that man, that individual, wiping his shoes at one point with the Iraqi flag and appearing to step on pages of the Quran. It does not appear that he burned the Quran in this incident on Thursday. Still, again, there were repercussions. Even before the demonstration took place, hundreds of demonstrators in Baghdad stormed Sweden's embassy in the city, setting part of the building alight. They were mostly followers of Muqtad al-Sadr, the prominent Shia cleric who was outspoken on this issue. Iraq's government cracked down, of course, saying that it arrested certain individuals, that they would face legal consequences for the storming of the embassy, but at the same time threatened to sever diplomatic ties with Sweden for permitting the demonstration, for permitting this protest to go ahead in Stockholm. As the event was taking place, Iraq took the first steps in that, expelling, asking Sweden's ambassador in Iraq to leave the country, and at the same time recalling its Charge D' Affaires from Stockholm as well. We did see there was information from a telecommunications giant which suspended the license of Sweden's telecommunication giant Ericsson that was suspended by Iraqi authorities as well but still causing huge reaction, huge anger across the Muslim world.

Although I don't think anyone there was killed. But the bigger picture for them will be balancing two things. One is trying to make sure that what it calls its friendship without limits with the Russians, which are declared at the Beijing Olympics last year, continues to be strong. In other words, they want to make sure that they back up Russia's broader position that the war is really the fault of the United States and NATO. On the other hand, they don't want to sacrifice their position as wanting to be honest brokers.
