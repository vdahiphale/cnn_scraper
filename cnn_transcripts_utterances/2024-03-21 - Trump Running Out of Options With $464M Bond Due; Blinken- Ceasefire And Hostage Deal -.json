Donald Trump running short on time and options as he scrambles to put up a half-billion-dollar bond in the New York civil fraud case that he lost. If he can't pay the $464 million by Monday, he could lose some of his most prized assets, like Trump Tower, or 40 Wall Street. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LETITIA JAMES (D), NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL:  If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court and we will ask the judge to seize his assets. We are prepared to make sure that the judgment is paid to New Yorkers and yes, I look at 40 Wall Street each and every day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Stef, good morning. Wonderful to have you. So this is a scramble for him. You know, he has bragged about his great wealth for basically his entire career. Now someone said, okay, put up, you got to put up half, half a billion dollars. What are the former president's options here? I mean, they -- they are arguing that this is all political, that they are out to get him in a way that's not fair. How this is going to play, especially with general election voters as we move into that phase of the campaign.",

In addition to if financial problem and I think that's going to play a huge role in how he plans to deal with this moving forward.You know, he could file for bankruptcy, and some of these financial issues would be solved. It would take long enough potentially for him to avoid that, but that's something he doesn't want to do. He doesn't want to again, have is image as a successful, wealthy businessman be tarnished because of all of this. And there's something to be said for whether Trump is actually willing to call Tish James' bluff, tell her go ahead, try and seize my assets, and whether he'll try to spin something like that as again, another example of the justice system being out to get him. We know that he -- there's a part from that enjoys some of those loud headline moments.",

In his PACs, we've seen just last month, one of his PACs had had to pay another $5.6 million just on legal fees.

We worked very hard with Qatar, with Egypt and with Israel to put a strong proposal on the table. Hamas wouldn't accept it. They came back with other requests, other demands, the negotiators are working on that now. CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier joins us now with more. Kim, good morning. Thank you for being here. Take us behind the scenes of what's really going on here, especially with Bibi Netanyahu. He was -- he gave an address to members of the Senate, virtually. But yesterday, it pretty rare situation.

Even though up to this point, Hamas has, every time they're near to deal, Hamas has raised the bar, knowing that Netanyahu faces the right-wing if his own party, which will be fighting any concessions to Hamas. So it makes Hamas cooperative and the Israelis look uncooperative.Meanwhile, this is playing against a backdrop of the U.S. is the Biden administration specifically, its putting more pressure on Bibi to get aid into Gaza. And to slow its onslaught, especially as planned on slot of Rafah. So by reaching out to the Republicans, that's a way to needle the Biden administration give the Republicans a win with the upcoming us presidential election, you know, that painting them as the pro-Israel party but it's all a bit of theater because Netanyahu needs the Biden administration right now. He also needs that aid for weapons. That's held up in Congress right now.",
