Stand by for new details on the Trump team's decision not to try to move the criminal charges against the former president from state to federal court.Also tonight, President Biden attempts to sound the alarm about the threat to democracy here in the United States posed by Trump, MAGA Republicans and GOP hardliners in Congress. Will his message breakthrough as he prepares for a potential rematch with Trump next year. And the government shutdown countdown is growing more urgent with just two days, two days to the deadline. Tensions among House Republicans boiling over with no solution in sight. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. All right, let's get right to the breaking news, the breaking news in the Georgia election subversion case, Donald Trump and his legal team deciding not to try to move his prosecution to federal court. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is joining us right now. What are you learning, Jessica?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. This is somewhat surprising because we did expect Trump's legal team to try to get his case moved out of Fulton County Georgia to a federal court. The deadline for them to try to do that is tomorrow. And that's why today they are in fact telling the court that they are not going to try to remove it.So, this is what they're saying in the court filing that just came down. They're saying, President Trump now notifies the court that he will not be seeking to remove his case to federal court. This decision is based on his well-founded confidence that this honorable court intends to fully and completely protect his constitutional right to a fair trial and guarantee him due process of law throughout the prosecution of this case in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. So, Trump's team filing that in state court saying we are not going to try to move it to federal court. This may be because it's so far been an uphill battle for Trump's co-defendants to try to get removal. It was just a few weeks ago that a federal judge rejected Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' attempt to move his case out of county court, state court, to the federal level. So, perhaps, you know, we know that Donald Trump's lawyers were closely watching that proceeding. And by all accounts, Mark Meadows would have had a good case. He was chief of staff working directly for the president of the United States. He said that most of what he did was within his official duties. But the federal judge rejected that argument. So, perhaps Trump's lawyers thinking it would be an uphill climb if they tried to remove the case to federal court. So, Trump's case will, in fact, now officially go forward in state court in Fulton County, Georgia. That case proceeds, as his other cases are moving. And we're seeing a lot of pre-trial motions in the cases of the Mar-a-Lago classified documents, as well as the subversion case in January 6th here in Washington, D.C. But for now, we know that at least one more case will not be added to the federal court docket and it will remain in Fulton County, Georgia, where Trump is charged with numerous other co-defendants for a racketeering scheme that Fani Willis, the D.A. there, has alleged. So, Wolf, a bit of surprising news on the legal front when it comes to Trump's team tonight.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this one was a genuine strategic stunner, in my view. There were plenty of good reasons why Donald Trump would want to be in federal court, starting with the fact that he would have a more favorable politically jury pool to choose from.That said, there are countervailing considerations here which may under underlie Donald Trump's strategic decision here to stay in state court. First of all, the judge, and if you look at the filing that Kara just highlighted, it seems that Donald Trump is quite satisfied with the state level judge, Judge McAfee, who has indeed given fair rulings. He's given some rulings, I think, that Donald Trump's team likes, where on the opposite side of it, the federal judge, Judge Stephen Jones, is an Obama nominee. That does not mean he's biased against Trump, but he has firmly rejected prior motions by others to come over into federal court. You start with that. There's also the uncertainty about timing. It could be that Donald Trump feared that if he went into federal court, he'd be pushed to trial very quickly, but in state court, those cases seem to be on a much slower track. And then, finally, there's the fact that if he did want to make this motion to get into federal court, he'd have to survive an evidentiary hearing. He'd have to go into court and either testify, as Mark Meadows did, or make some other showing. And there's risk in that. So, now he doesn't have to do that. So, it's an interesting strategic decision. It's going to have major consequences.",

And many people believe that he damaged himself by making statements that could be used against him in other proceedings in Fulton County, or if he's ever indicted on the federal level. So, that hangs out there. We'll have to see how that plays out. So, by not pursuing this motion, thinking of it as likely a long shot for success, they also avoided that tough situation of having to provide evidence and possibly deliver testimony in court. We should also remember that Jeffrey Clark tried to provide his evidence and his removal hearing by just submitting an affidavit and the judge rejected it. So, I think it was probably a wise move to figure that they would likely be unsuccessful.",

So, those would be any of the real estate holdings that he has, certainly in New York.Let's remember that the judge in this case has already determined that he committed fraud, and the purpose of the trial is simply to determine damages. How much money is he going to have to pay to resolve these claims of fraud? It's entirely possible if he's a large judgment that he's left to have to satisfy, the court would seize and sell some of his assets, things like Trump Tower, in order to satisfy this judgment. So, it's really a devastating place that he's in with respect to his business but also with respect to he and his family's personal finances. So, this is a very tough spot for the former president.",

And he's been pushed by a lot of Democratic strategists to start taking on Donald Trump directly, and that is what he did today. And what he said that sort of was very affecting, I think, was, you can't love your country only when you win. And I think that was his sort of message to the public, which is, beware. And he went point by point by point over things that Donald Trump has said, threatening Milley, for example, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, saying, I am your retribution.

But here's the thing, one, Gloria pointed out a really good line. The line that I appreciated most was that he said -- he made the point that this issue of democracy is not a partisan issue. It's an American issue. And where, and I agree with the president on that, I also agree with Judge Luttig, who actually testified at the January 6th hearing, the conservative judge who said that the party that is tearing down democracy has to be responsible for building it back up again, that the Republican Party now has to be part of the coalition that's building up the democracy and securing democracy, and we're not currently seeing that from the Republican Party. They continued to turn a deaf ear and lie and deceive the American public about Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the election and the threat that he presents to democracy.

Governor, thank you so much for joining us. As you heard, the Republicans own witnesses today admitted the current evidence doesn't necessarily show corruption or wrongdoing. One senior GOP aide told CNN, and I'm quoting now, this is an unmitigated disaster. Do you agree? FMR. GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R-MD):  Well, look, well, if I think that these are serious charges and that we really ought to get to the facts in a fair and impartial way, and I'm not sure we can do that in this Congress, because it's just more of the divisiveness and dysfunction. But, look, I spoke out when the Democrats were going through impeachment proceedings, and I said Democrats shouldn't rush to judgment and already determine guilt before they actually collect and see all the evidence, and Republicans shouldn't ignore the evidence and not consider the facts when they made the decision in the House and the Senate. It seems to me it's the same kind of a situation. Look, I don't know that there's criminal wrongdoing, but just dismiss it with all of the smoke out there and say it's not worth gathering evidence and it's not worth at least gathering the evidence to do an inquiry. We're not at the end of an inquiry or an investigation. It's the very first day. So, of course, you don't see the smoking gun. There's not evidence. We don't know if it's a sham or whether there are serious violations of law. So, look, I come by this with a historical background. My dad was on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of Nixon, and he was fighting for Nixon's defense and fighting against Democrats that he thought were being overly partisan. And months later, after seeing the facts, he was the first one to arrive at the conclusion that the president was guilty of impeachable offenses. So, I don't know all the facts yet, but I don't think Democrats should be so quick to dismiss and I don't think Republicans should be so quick to convict. I think we ought to just try to get to the facts in a fair and impartial way, which is really hard to do in a divided Congress like this.",

I'm not saying some of the things he said weren't true. I appreciate the fact he was honoring John McCain, but look, I think the president should have shown leadership and been back in Washington trying to work together to resolve this budget crisis instead of you know, it was playing politics.
