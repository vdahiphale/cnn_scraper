Ahead on CNN Newsroom, a U.S. government shutdown looms as House Republicans fail to pass a bill to keep the government running for millions of people who depend on it.No regrets. Gisele Pelicot's strength and resilience pushes France to examine sexual assaults, saying the shame must change sides. And alleged CEO killer Luigi Mangione faces a federal murder charge that could carry a death sentence. We are now 23 hours away from a U.S. government shutdown after a Trump-backed plan to keep the government running failed to pass. Republicans are scrambling after resistance to the bill's two-year suspension of the debt limits supported by Trump left the legislation falling well short of the majority needed. 38 Republicans defied the president elect by voting nay. And now a lot of finger pointing happening on Capitol Hill. Here's the U.S. House speaker blaming Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE JOHNSON, U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: Very disappointing to us that all but two Democrats voted against aid to farmers and ranchers, against disaster relief, against all these bipartisan measures that had already been negotiated and decided upon. Again, the only difference on this legislation was that we would push the debt ceiling to January of 2027. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, that issue of a debt limit was a complex, complicated issue that typically Congress tends weeks, if not months to try to negotiate. No one wants to vote really to raise the borrowing limit in the United States. And Donald Trump does not want this to be part of his first year agenda. So he wants to take it off the table now. He's saying deal with it now. And so he doesn't have to worry about when he's president. But here's a problem. There are Republicans in the ranks who say that they will never vote for a debt limit increase, especially if it does not have spending cuts. TUM BURCHETT, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: This just stinks.

But the problem is how do you get to that particular point? And the Europeans really don't have at the moment, the diplomatic muscle to by themselves, broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. And that therein, I think, lies the crux of the problem. The Europeans are dependent on the United States, both diplomatically and militarily at the present time.

They are getting aid from the Russians, and in essence, the North Koreans are joining in a kind of a partnership not only with Russia, but also with China and distantly with Iran that is basically designed to circumvent western sanctions that are directed against Russia, North Korea and Iran.

The Trump team has really been pushing to get her off the case, arguing that not only was her romantic relationship inappropriate, they've also raised questions about his billing practices. And here, the appellate court agreed, saying, look, it's rare that you would remove a prosecutor for just the appearance of impropriety, but they found that the only way to restore public trust they said in this case and the integrity of the process is for her to be disqualified.
