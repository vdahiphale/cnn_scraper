      "sentences": "It's a reflection of reality. I don't think there's any question for that, for the aspirational goal to a de-nuclearized Korean Peninsula.This is the reality of the moment, a moment where North Korea's nuclear capabilities have rapidly expanded. Their tests seem to be moving at a tempo now where we have almost lost track of them. And there's legitimate and tangible concern inside South Korea, not just about the threat of North Korea but also about just how sturdy the U.S. deterrence and the U.S. commitment is to the country. I think that's the driving force behind what you're seeing today and what the leaders are signing off of in terms of the commitments from the U.S. side to make clear that extended deterrence is both solidified and backed up in terms of U.S. assets in the region. In terms of South Korea getting a seat at the table in terms of planning and consultations related to nuclear weapons. But also on the South Korean side where there has been a very real concern and, to some degree, a popular move toward the idea of developing their own nuclear weapons, where there will be a commitment, which has long been a U.S. goal to maintain that they will not pursue nuclear weapons as well. So there's an agreement here that, in large part, lines up with what the U.S. policy has been for a significant portion of their seven- decade relationship and alliance but also underscores the need to make those commitments tangible, concrete at this moment of very acute risk and concern in both countries.",

That's something the U.S. presidents of both parties have said would never happen for years, for decades really.And China is rapidly expanding its own nuclear arsenal here. And you open discussion, Paula Hancocks, of both Japan and South Korea, perhaps, going nuclear themselves, although we did have the South Korean president walk back comments on that develop on the peninsula. Is this new deal partly to kind of keep that off the table?",

      "sentences": "I think that's certainly the idea behind it. Whether it actually convinces many people back here in Seoul, we're going to have to wait and see.This was a fringe idea, Jim, about 10 years ago, this idea that South Korea should have its own nuclear weapons program. But it has increased significantly. You look at opinion polls across the board, there is a majority of people polled, who believe that South Korea should have its own nuclear weapons program, that the main argument being, if North Korea has it, in order to deter them, South Korea needs it as well. Clearly that's something that Washington doesn't want. That's a big part of what we're seeing today. President Yoon went to Washington. He wanted visible deterrence. He wanted more reassurance that the United States would be there if South Korea needed it. So clearly this is what this deal is about today. The declaration, for example, saying there will be more cooperation on military training. Now what we've seen over recent months has almost been unprecedented when it comes to these joint drills between the U.S. and South Korea, not just the size of them, but the fact that they have continued for months on end. They'll also have more cooperation when it comes to information sharing. That is something that Seoul has been consistently talking about for months. President Yoon saying that he wants to be part of it. He wants to know what is happening. And of course, they also will have this nuclear consultative group, which is where the leaders will be meeting, where they will be discussing an understanding of what goes into these strategic decisions. So this is bringing South Korea to the table. This is sharing far more information with them, at least as far as we can see, from the declaration we have heard about from senior administration officials. Whether it's enough to calm the concerns of what North Korea represents at this point to South Korea, it's really unclear. Because, as Phil pointed out, it's not just about the threat from North Korea. It's also about needing to know the United States will be there as a close ally to South Korea, no matter who is the American president. Of course, with the former President Donald Trump talking about potentially pulling U.S. troops out of South Korea, that resonated very strongly here. That concerned a lot of people. And this is really where some of that need for extra reassurance comes from as well.",

      "sentences": "Certainly. I think those revelations probably surprised the South Korean public more than they surprised South Korean officials.Because it's a reality in the world that we live in that the U.S. government will spy on its allies and adversaries around the world. Nothing they said in those conversations were necessarily altogether that surprising. But you did have some major pushback from the South Korean public saying, hey, how is this a reliable relationship with the United States if they're spying on us? However, U.S. officials, South Korean officials privately are underplaying this, saying it's not a big deal. We even heard President Yoon yesterday in an interview with NBC talking about the trust between the two countries and that being central. It's clear he isn't trying to make this a major issue going into what is a very critical conversation about the security relationship between the two countries.",

This isn't going to be permanent, right? This is just going to be a show of force.But it's the first time that we've seen this since the Cold War. And I wonder how you think North Korea is going to respond to it, David. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, the North Koreans react badly whenever we've ever had a public show of force. And it's not the first show of force we've had. Periodically, when North Korea is acting out, conducting tests, they run B-2 bombers and so forth just south of the DMZ to make a point. To some degree, this is symbolism, right? Because the United States' nuclear force can reach North Korea from Nebraska. It doesn't need to be off the coast of South Korea. But this is a way of reassuring the South Korean public that we're there. The bigger and more interesting element of this, to my mind, is the agreement itself to have South Korea join in developing the strategy for using nuclear weapons, if the South is ever attacked. It's important for two reasons. First, it's a recognition that 30 years of efforts to threaten the North Koreans, sanction the North Koreans, try to buy off the North Koreans have all failed.",

What struck me about the comments from the Chinese president speaking with Volodymyr Zelenskyy was he brought up the prospect of nuclear war over Ukraine, as a warning, saying this will be horrible if it went there. But in all these conversations, you have a thinkable conversation about the prospect of a nuclear exchange, as opposed to unthinkable, where we were for decades. That's genuinely worrisome.",

But your rules against expanding chip manufacturing in China is hurting South Korean companies that rely heavily on Beijing. Are you damaging a key ally in the competition with China to help your domestic politics ahead of the election? And one for President Yoon. There have been concerns since last year that North Korea will soon be conducting its seventh nuclear test, amid growing domestic support in your country for your own nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Russia has suggested it could send its latest weapons to North Korea if South Korea sends lethal aid to Ukraine. How do you seek to manage the North Korea risk amid obligations to Ukraine and NATO? Thank you.",
