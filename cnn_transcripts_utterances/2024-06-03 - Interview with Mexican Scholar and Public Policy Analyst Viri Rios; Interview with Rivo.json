We look atwhat's ahead with Tessa Dooms, head of South African NGO, the Rivonia Circle. And a closer look at life for women under the Taliban. Asne Seierstad, author of \"The Bookseller of Kabul,\" joins me around her new book, \"The Afghans.\" Also, ahead, stories of presidents in crisis. Journalist George Stephanopoulos takes Walter Isaacson inside the White House's Nerve Center as they discuss his new book, \"The Situation Room.\" Hello, everyone, and welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. It's a breakthrough moment for Mexican women as the nation elects its first female president. Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum sealing her place in history as the result was called. Though her rise is undoubtedly historic, for many she is the continuity candidate. The protege of the popular outgoing president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as AMLO. There are concerns that while she will continue his popular anti-poverty measures, she may also inherit some of his anti-democratic efforts as well as his failure to reign in violence. This election season was marred by bloodshed, with dozens of candidates murdered in the last year alone. The president-elect is vowing to confront such crime, but how? And what will her election mean for the crucial relationship with Mexico's neighbor to the north, the United States? Joining me now on all of this is Mexican scholar and public policy analyst Viri Rios. Viri, thank you so much for joining us. Welcome to the program. A huge win for the Morena Party, virtually unknown prior to 2018. Obviously, a large part of that attributed to AMLO's popularity. What more can we expect now from President Sheinbaum and some of her policies as she is expected to step out of his shadows, finally?",

This clearly coming from a lot of pressure on his campaign as this is seen as a top -- one of the top issues for American voters. Since you raised it, let me go there first. And how can we expect a Sheinbaum administration to respond to this executive order?

The immigration agenda in terms of policiesimplemented in Mexico is defined, designed, and pushed in the U.S., right? So, Mexico, in that sense, is a follower to the instructions of the U.S. Whenever the U.S. has put pressure in Mexico to close the southern border of Mexico, whenever the U.S. has put pressure for Mexicans to invest in more security, that has happened, right? So, I think that, in that sense, once we understand the balance of power of Mexico and the U.S., basically, immigration policy is going to be determined not by Sheinbaum, not by this election, but by the November election in the U.S., right? And that's when we are going to observe if Trump wins or if Biden remains, you know, that's when we are going to observe, you know, what's the -- what's to follow for Mexico.",

That really delves into the political ramifications and aspects here, but also the populist as well. If we can get to the issue of crime itself, one of the antidotes that we saw Sheinbaum's predecessor, AMLO, really reinforce is an investment in the military and handing over policing and any sort of security role to the military, that had been met with wide skepticism. And just judging by the numbers, it doesn't appear to have been successful. During this campaign we heard vague answers when Claudia Sheinbaum was asked how her policies would differ if she would keep that same policy specifically on turning to the military and taking away civilian jobs and giving them to the military. What do you expect to see now that she is in office?",

Despite his popularity, there had been a lot of concernabout what many describe as democratic backsliding, continuing attacks on the checks and balances of the country, weakening various institutions, including the electoral body. There is a lot of concern that these policies will continue with this new administration. What can we expect and what should we be looking out for, specifically now that it appears that both the upper and lower house won the majority for the Morena Party, which gives them more constitutional control and the ability to change the constitution and amend it, perhaps even introducing a new Supreme Court justice powers that AMLO himself didn't have?",

Because, indeed, Lopez Obrador, in many instances, he proposed very controversial reforms, but those reforms never passed in Congress. Those reforms were systematically rejected, either because he didn't have a majority, or because the Supreme Court rejected these reforms for procedural reasons, right? So, the idea that Mexican democracy was a backsliding, it was not supported, in fact. In fact, the institutions remain solid and the proof is that the election -- yesterday's Mexican election was, you know, free, fair, and majority democratically, right? Now, that does take us to this market, right, and takes us to different Mexico. Because the Mexico that Sheinbaum is going to rule is going to be a Mexico where she is going to have majorities. She's going to have super majorities to change the constitution and to approve controversial reforms if she wants to, right? So, I think that the country is now in a much, I would say, slippery territory. And the international attention should be on analyzing the specific proposals that Sheinbaum advances. I don't think the agenda of Sheinbaum is to destroy democracy. I think her agenda is much more simple. Her agenda is just to improve the salaries of people, create better jobs, and reduce poverty.",

It just seemed that he had the desire, at times, to bend the system and the checks and balances held in place for no other reason than he didn't have, a supermajority.

On one side, we have a full democratically elected woman with the largest mandate that Mexican democracy has ever given to anybody, right? And on the other side, right, we're here discussing the democracy. It's backsliding, right? When -- you know, those two things don't match, right? So, what we should expect is a Mexico that is a start that pushes the agenda of the (INAUDIBLE). The Sheinbaum -- you know, that she won, the agenda that made her won, right?

In a result that coulddramatically shift the country's future, the African National Congress lost its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela swept to power 30 years ago. While the ANC still won 40 percent of the vote, they will now have to share power. It is a damning indictment of a party by voters who are frustrated with the state of the economy and angered by allegations of corruption and violence. Joining me now to talk about all this is Tessa Dooms, the programmes director for Rivonia Circle, an NGO that aims to foster democracy and community in South Africa. Tessa, welcome to the program. So, this isn't a shock given that there's been buildup from the polling that we've seen over the past few weeks. Nonetheless, once it is official, it is quite jarring to see such a reversal for this party, the ANC Party. Its vote share drops from 58 percent to 40 percent. The ANC held nearly 70 percent vote share at the height of its popularity in 2004. Walk us through the mood in the country right now.",

And I think many people didn't see how that would happen because the big factor in this election that has come to bear is the re-entrance into the political space of Former President Jacob Zuma under the uMkhonto weSizwe Party. Which is a breakaway party, once again, as we saw in 2009, with the COPE Party, and then, in 2014, with the EFF, a breakaway party from the ANC that has surpassed everybody's expectations in terms of what it was able to do, garnering in its first election 14 percent of the vote after only existing for five months. And so, while people may have predicted because of the general decline in trust generally in the political system and politicians, but particularly in the delivery of the ANC, I don't think anyone could have predicted the ways in which it would happen, which is effectively an ANC versus ANC battle in a very different form.",

President --Former President Jacob Zuma was forced to resign in 2018, a year before his term had ended. And there didn't seem to be in many ways for him to re- enter into political relevance. But what we're seeing here is two factors based on the kind of rhetoric that the MK Party has come up with. One is that President Jacob Zuma has said that this is not a new party that is away from the ANC, but a party that is meant to try and restore the ANC to its former glory, painting the current ANC as not being aligned with the history of the party. And so, taking on the name of controversies where is actually to double down on an ANC-ness of this new vehicle. But also, I think the sentiment has widely been that people have seen this as a protest vote in many cases. I think the ANC has often seen, over the last few years, a decline in its voter turnout. Voters that are disillusioned either with the party itself or the democratic dividends of our democracy after 30 years, deciding to stay at home and not vote. And I think part of what we've seen with the MK Party is certainly the use of a vote in order to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only in the country in general, but within its ranks and people have supported it over the last 30 years.",

Some 42 percent of working age South Africans are unemployed. The GDP has shrunk during four of the past 10 years. We have frequent electrical blackouts. Crime is one of the highest in the world. Inequality has only gotten worse. The gap between the rich and the poor in South Africa is in -- by some measures, worse than it was in 1995.

Given all those multiplecrises, the issues just weren't the central focus of this election. This election, unfortunately, veered into a palace politics of sorts. A lot of politics around personality, around identity, around long-standing political infighting, and a posturing of our politics, rather than a solving of the issues at the core of this election. And I think that may have been why we have seen a lower voter turnout than we've ever seen before in South Africa, dipping below 60 percent. Because South Africans in the main want the issues to be addressed, and have gotten to a point where giving over power to politicians that aren't addressing those issues really is disempowering for people. I think what this government, however it is formed, needs to take forward is the idea that a democracy that ticks so many of the boxes of being an effective democracy must start giving a dividend of development in South Africa. Otherwise, people won't just lose faith in a party, they will lose faith in the democratic project that we have here. What is the point of having freedom or the right to vote if it doesn't result in water sanitation and jobs for young people who under the age of 30 have only lived in a democratic dispensation? It is really democracy that was also on the ballot and the politicians that emerged from this must put that at the center of their governance. The issues must matter, not the politicians.",

And they include those -- the tapes of several of those phone calls in the audio book.

Now, policymakers, including Henry Kissinger, have to act as if they can control the world from that room, but you have to know at the same time that, you know, the world may have other plans. I think you could almost argue that Nixon and Kissinger overreacted to Johnson's obsession with the situation room and went very much in the other direction. But, you know, the episode I write most about in the book, and it's one you know well, is that time during the first Yom Kippur War in October 1973 when Nixon was so out of commission, you know, drinking scotch up in his hideaway in the old executive office building that Henry Kissinger managed the crisis on his own, and in a remarkable move, basically on his own, ordered the United States nuclear alert up to DEFCON 3, which had only been done once before during the Cuban Missile Crisis because of fear that the Soviets were trying to exploit that war in the Middle East.",

And they had reached the conclusion that there was about somewhere between a 40 to 60 percent chance that this pacer that we'd all seen in the compound in Abbottabad was actually Osama bin Laden. And as the meeting began, Obama says, listen, it's just not going to get much better than 50 percent. We have to make the decision based on that knowledge. He pulled the whole room, almost all of the principles from Secretary Clinton through Leon Panetta, the director of National Intelligence, of course, Admiral McRaven, who was running the mission were for it. Gates was the most reluctant. Of course, he was haunted by the memory of Jimmy Carter's failed mission. He was a deputy to Stan Turner at the time. And he -- he'd always remember --",

The place would just be reduced to rubble. So, Obama polled the room. He also polled -- and this was what was unusual. He asked all the plus ones for their opinion as well, polled the room one more time and then took left and said, I'll give you the decision in the morning and made it overnight. It went off on Sunday. That famous picture almost didn't happen. That room is actually a little ante room off the situation room. And it was meant to be the place where the military leaders were going to be in contact with Admiral McRaven, but it wasn't supposed to be the place where everybody was gathering. But once someone found out, you could actually see the raid in more or less real- time. Everybody drifted into the room and it created that incredibly close, close feeling. At one point, Tom Donilon, the next security adviser, asked, my favorite character in the book, a guy named Gary Bresnahan, who's a combination of the MacGyver and the Zelig of the sit room. He set up the communications for every president from Reagan through Obama. Gary said he told a white lie at that point. He said, I can't move it into the other room. He now tells me, he said, I probably could have, but I was just so afraid to take any chance that we would lose the feed in the -- in those final moments. Said, I didn't want to do it. And that's a good thing because we did get that incredibly iconic photo. It's a good thing for Gary Bresnahan as well, because he was just outside of the room. So, after it all went down, he got the first fist bump from President Obama, which was fitting tribute to all of his work for so many presidents over so many years.",

Never before in American history has a president continued to lie about that election after being both indicted and impeached.
