BRIAN SUMERS, EDITOR, \"THE AIRLINE OBSERVER\": Literally, I was talking with a senior airline executive last week and he said the same thing. He said, Brian, everybody worries so much about Boeing. It is the engine manufacturers, they can't deliver the engines on time. Sometimes the engines are faulty, sometimes they need to be repaired or replaced much sooner than they need to be. And I think people forget, they think that this is just some component. Richard, these engines are extraordinarily expensive, tens of million dollars per engine.

And as you know, it is extremely expensive to build an engine from scratch with the latest technology. And if you have three or four engine choices, how is Rolls Royce going to recoup its money back for building this amazing engine if airlines can just bid out to the lowest bidder.

He said that in order for them to fly, this airplane, the A350-1000, it is going to have so much time in maintenance that it is not worth it for them. So I do think that the engine manufacturers have to figure this out. There is a bit of a blame game depending on who you talk to, right, Richard. If we talk to the aircraft manufacturers, they say it is the airlines' fault. Airlines say it is the manufacturers. Hard to tell exactly who is at fault here, but we are kind of burying the lead, right, Richard? I mean, Rolls Royce is doing an okay job here.

One of the things that we have to keep inmind is that what happened today, obviously also, of course, plays into a very difficult military situation for the Ukrainians, Richard. On the one hand, they do have their incursion that they started into the Kursk Region of Russia, where they are apparently still moving forward a little bit, but that has also slowed down. However, for the Ukrainians on the eastern front, the situation remains very difficult and certainly is getting a lot more difficult with the Russians pushing closer to the very important town of Pokrovsk. But one of the main issues in all of that is that the Ukrainians are suffering from a severe manpower shortage. So one of the things that they have vowed is to protect their personnel and clearly they are now acknowledging something went wrong as far as that is concerned. In fact, that Ukrainians have launched an investigation into the strike that happened today to see how measures to protect their personnel at facilities like the one that was struck today, can be improved -- Richard.",

So why don't we get the money into the actual artist of the people, as he said, on stage, who are sweating for three hours and get this money to them? And of course, the industry has changed. The artists don't make as much money from things like album sales as they do now from concerts. But the issue I think for a lot of these fans for Oasis, for other bands, is the whole transparency of it because what some of these fans were saying is that they would be logging in en masse to try to get these tickets. They're very excited. This is a reunion tour. Oasis broke up in 2009 acrimoniously. This is a big deal for them coming back. But these fans are saying they logged in, they had to wait hours in a virtual queue before they could even buy their tickets, and some of them are saying, I would put a ticket in my basket that was for the face value normal price only to see it shoot up once it was in my basket up to these hundreds of dollars, making it completely out of reach.

But regardless of how you think this should go, the U.K. government is looking into this now. The Prime Minister Keir Starmer even saying this is just not fair, it's pricing people out of the market.

      "sentences": "It's been nearly two years since the so-called crypto winter and the downfall of FTX, the price of bitcoin, on the path not surprisingly hasrecovered. FTX, and its former chief exec Sam Bankman-Fried certainly not. He is currently serving a 25-year sentence in a federal prison. The author, Michael Lewis, spent plenty of time with SBF before everything went down the drain and certainly got a chance to look at the considerations. This is the book, it's \"Going Infinite,\" it's called, and it paints the portrait of an ambitious, unfocused, and well, eventually dishonest man. Lewis joined me in the C-suite in the Sky. I've always enjoyed Michael Lewis' books so having him talking about SBF was a real treat and he told me all about the felon once considered to be the crypto king. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL LEWIS, AUTHOR, \"GOING INFINITE: THE RISE AND FALL OF A NEW TYCOON\": One of the curious things about the whole FTX fiasco is that nobody, like zero people, actually said what the problem was or predicted it. With most like Madoff-like scandals, there's someone out there who's detected a problem. And in this case, the problem was really simple that $10 billion of customer deposits were not in FTX, but in Sam Bankman-Fried's private little hedge fund trading firm. And no one knew it. And so it was -- and I didn't know. I was shocked when it all went down. I did have a sense in the year I spent reporting before I wrote the book, and before it collapsed, that this is a chaotic situation and anything could happen. But I didn't know what anything was.",
