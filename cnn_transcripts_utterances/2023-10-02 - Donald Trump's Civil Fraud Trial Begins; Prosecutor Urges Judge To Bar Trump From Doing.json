It's a civil proceeding. He could have been represented there by his lawyers and that makes it different from his arraignment in Miami, different from his arraignment in criminal court, in the hush money case in New York, different from his arraignment in Washington, D.C. on the election fraud, the federal case or in Georgia election fraud, the state case.This time he came there for two reasons, one, to make his appearance in court and be seen at the table where his business empire, not his personal freedom, hangs in the balance, but also to make that statement in the hallway. The judge not allowing cameras in the courtroom, which he could have done under New York state law to shoot the opening statements of the prosecution and the opening statements of the defense, actually leaves us in the position of really having to kind of go through our crib notes from the people in the courtroom and Donald Trump's statements in the hallway and Letitia James' statements on the steps. I don't understand why we're still operating in the Stone Age when we could have cameras in that courtroom. The only difference is compelled witness testimony. The judge would have to leave it up to the witness as to whether they wanted to allow their testimony to be televised, but the rest of it we could have seen today and we should have.",

In this case, you know, go after the attorney general. Donald Trump knows exactly what those words mean. He knows exactly how some of his supporters will take that. I think it's a very dangerous statement to make.But I'll say this, security was tight at the courthouse today and Letitia James, the former New York City public advocate, has had a New York City Police Department security detail for her time in city government. She has had a very competent security detail made up of people that I know, as she's been attorney general and she's used to threats. She'll take that in stride.

So if they fraudulently said, our properties are with this amount and the banks then gave them a better interest rate than they would have gotten had they not defrauded the banks, those ill-gotten gains in the form of the better rate and the money they saved is something that should be disgorged.But I think they're using it as a rhetorical point saying, listen, kind of what's the harm here, nobody lost money. Even if the values weren't exactly what they should have been, no big deal. So it's not really as much of an actual legal point as it is something that would appeal, again, more to a jury, frankly, potentially, than to the judge who's going to follow the letter of the law.",

And that is something that is not going unnoticed with his team.Now, this is something I have been asking Trump advisers for months. How are you going to navigate a 2024 presidential campaign with all of these looming trial dates and lengthy trials? And clearly today, we saw at least one of the ways that they are going to navigate that and that is by turning these trials into essentially campaign events. Just to break down what happened today, as soon as Trump was leaving Trump Tower, they knew that there were cameras everywhere. They blasted out an email attacking Letitia James like you would a political opponent. Once he was downtown, he walked into the courthouse. He waited for the cameras. He waited near them and knew where they were. He gave everyone an opportunity to roll on him, essentially and then he started making his remarks. His team was aware of how many press seats were in the courtroom. They were very aware that the judge was going to rule on whether or not they were going to allow cameras in both the courtroom and in the hallway. These are things that they monitor closely because they are all about optics. And Donald Trump likes to play this out in the court of public opinion. You could tell by at least some of what he said today that this is going to be something he makes political. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, there is no indication of what this would look like or if this would help him down the road in a general election. Something his advisers themselves have told me that they are concerned about. I don't know how this would play out as, obviously, unprecedent (ph) in time.The other quick thing I want to mention here, while this case and while the way they're handling this is very political, it's very personal to Donald Trump. He built his entire brand on the idea that he was a rich successful businessman. It's not just his personal brand, but his political brand. He spent the entire year of 2016 saying the reason he was best suited to be president is because he was such a successful businessman. He could take that and translate it into running the country and a message that you would likely hear again in 2024. So an impact to that or a hit to that is also a hit to His political identity.",
