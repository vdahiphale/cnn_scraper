Plus, what he's now claiming about China's influence there.And what caused that deadly Christmas Day plane crash in Kazakhstan? While Russia is blaming a bird strike for bringing that plane down this morning, Ukraine is blaming Russia. And a dog stranded on a frozen lake now safe thanks to a drone and a piece of chicken. Details on this lovely Christmas Day rescue. I'm Sara Sidner with Kate Bolduan. John Berman is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Days after warning the U.S. would retake control of the Panama Canal, President-Elect Donald Trump has named his pick for U.S. ambassador to Panama, a role that could unexpectedly suddenly become key during Trump's second term. Trump tapped Miami-Dade County Commissioner Kevin Marino Cabrera, one of his staunch allies. Cabrera may be critical to Trumps new push for potential U.S. expansion, which so far has included the Panama Canal, Greenland, and even Canada. CNN's Steve Contorno is tracking all this. It sounds like this will be a big job, or at least he will be in the spotlight as a new ambassador with all the talk from Donald Trump about trying to take back, as he put it, the Panama Canal. What can you tell us about him, the ambassador?",

DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, (D-FL):  You know, I don't know much about the commissioner. I did represent Miami-Dade County for 18 years. And I'll tell you, it's just another example of Trump selecting an individual who has a scant resume other than being someone who worships Donald Trump. We have a free trade agreement with Panama. We have a decades and generations long relationship.

And listen, the Belt and Road Initiative that China has engaged in is something that I have traveled the globe with my colleagues and met with military leaders. It is real, it is a real issue. But what we need to do is make sure that we strengthen our relationships with our, with our allies and treaty partners like Panama, not make ridiculous carnival barker threats like buying Greenland, which isn't for sale, and we're not going to acquire, and invading Panama to take back the canal. There's been a drought in Panama, and so it has been -- it has slowed passage of ships. But what Donald Trump is really trying to do here is try to get better fees for passage for his corporate and billionaire allies. That's what this boils down to, and it's preposterous. BOLDUAN:  You talked about the, I think you called it chaos Congress. One thing that we know that Congress will not be staring down, at least immediately when you all return, is a government shutdown. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting on how Speaker Johnson was able to pull it off in the end after the bipartisan agreement, then not, then -- you know, we all know the formations of how we got to where we got. Let me read what \"The Washington Post\" says that Speaker Johnson did. He says he \"proposed a handshake deal with fiscal hawks in his party to try next year to slash mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' health care, and food stamps by at least $2.5 trillion while raising the debt cap by $1.5 trillion.\" And this is according to the three people familiar with the details.

President Biden is now condemning those attacks on Ukraine's critical energy sector and promising to continue a US surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Joining me now is CNN military analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton. Thank you so much for being here, Colonel. I want to get your take first on the plane crash over Kazakhstan, Russia, saying it's a bird strike. Ukraine saying, hey, this looks to them like it was shot down by Russia, similar to what we saw happen over Ukraine with MH17. What would it mean if Russia is in some way responsible for this crash? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Sarah, good morning and Happy Holidays. There are some, you know, really significant things. The pictures that were showing right now are critical to the assessment of this kind of an air crash. And what you see here is not consistent with a bird strike. Those holes in the wing and the fuselage there indicating that there was some kind of, in essence, a missile attack or potentially bullet attack against the aircraft. Now, bullets would have to be done at a much lower altitude than an aircraft normally flies at, but in some cases, you can see this being consistent with a missile like the Buk missile, which was used to shoot down the MH17 several years ago in Ukraine. So, that's the kind of thing that could have happened here. Obviously, there needs to be an assessment made to see if that is actually what occurred, but it's not consistent with a bird strike for sure.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's going to be a close run thing either way, Sara. And what I mean by that is that the Ukrainians are really dependent on Western, especially US aid in terms of weapon systems. Ukraine needs, in essence, to have its air defense systems replenished. They do an excellent job shooting down a lot of the missiles and drones that are being thrown against them, but it's obviously not foolproof. And there are some key components here where the Ukrainians are critically running out of them. They're running out of munitions, they're running out of the ability to spot the incoming missiles and drones, and they need to continue to have those capabilities. The Ukrainians are being stretched to the limits because Russia is just so much bigger in terms of population, in terms of the size of their militaries and in terms of the weaponry that they can throw against Ukraine. That's the kind of thing that that really Ukraine and the West are up against in this particular case. So, what the Biden administration is doing is they're trying to replenish as much as they possibly can, probably about $1.2 billion will make its way before the end of this year in terms of munitions and weapons support.Also, maintenance support for things like the F-16s. And that's the kind of thing that Ukraine needs in order to sustain their operations. This is going to be critical to sustain, because if we don't sustain it, the Ukrainians are going to face not only a tough winter, but it's going to be a really tough negotiating session with the Russians, once that finally comes about.",

And it provided what it said was evidence, which is a list it says it came upon during the course of operations in Gaza, which listed these men as operatives of Islamic Jihad, and also provided an infographic of the five men where it has their purported positions within Islamic Jihad as well. Now, whatever the facts of the matter, the Committee to Protect Journalists, which is a US-based nonprofit, says that this has been an incredibly deadly year for journalists in this part of the world, especially in Gaza, saying that over 130 journalists and media workers in the Gaza Strip have been killed since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th -- Kate.",
