CNN was on the scene of attacks that sent civilians flea for cover, including a giant blast just yards away from our crew.Also tonight, Representative Ilhan Omar is slamming the House vote to remove her from the key foreign affairs committee, the Democrat calling it an act of revenge by Republicans. But Speaker Kevin McCarthy is denying any partisan tit-for-tat. And new questions about additional videos related to the Tyre Nichols fatal beating by police after the D.A. told me up up to 20 hours of footage has yet to be released. I'll talk live this hour with the Nichols' family attorney, Ben Crump. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, Ukraine's warnings about Russia's next move are growing more ominous and more urgent, as Vladimir Putin's forces unleash new attacks targeting Ukrainian civilian areas. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and Sam Kiley are both on the ground for us in Ukraine with firsthand reporting on these new Russian strikes. First to you, Fred. You and your crew had a very, very close call in Kramatorsk. Walk us through what happened and the current fighting unfolding there in the east.",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Wolf. Well, firstly, we certainly did have a very close call. And, essentially, what happened is that, the night before, there had been a big airstrike on a residential building in Kramatorsk, a missile hitting that building, leveling the entire structure. Several were killed. Others people were wounded in that incident.So, we went out there today to film the scene of the rescue operation that was still going on, a very large rescue operation with a lot of police officers, first responders also on the scene as well. So, we got to the scene, which is really in downtown Kramatorsk, right in the center of town. And we just left our vehicles, gotten out of our vehicles and started making our way to the scene of the first strike when all of a sudden there was a gigantic explosion right behind us. And that was another missile that had impacted right in the building where we had parked our vehicles. Now, we then made our way or tried to make our way to safety to another building. And as we were walking or going to that other building, I looked around and then saw that another missile struck almost in exactly the same place. Now, the Ukrainians later say that they believe that these were S-300 missiles, Wolf. Those are missiles that are normally used to take down aircraft. And you can use them in a ground to ground configuration, but when that is done, they become extremely inaccurate. And then, obviously, if they are used in population centers, there is the recipe for disaster and a big amount of civilian casualties. In this case, there were several people who were wounded. There's obviously also those people who were killed in the initial strike. But, essentially, what happened there, Wolf, is that there was an ongoing rescue operation going on, a lot of civilians in the area, rescuers in the area, and the Russians targeted exactly that area once again in spite of the fact that a lot of civilians were on the ground there. And it really is a pattern that we've been seeing recently with a lot of those towns that are a little bit behind the actual frontlines that had been fairly quiet over the past couple of weeks. Those are now being struck once again as the Russians really seem to be intensifying their assault in a lot of places in the east. Wolf?",

It seems to be a not so veiled threat that Russia obviously does has a big stockpile of nuclear weapons and something that we've heard from Vladimir Putin throughout the time of this invasion has been going on.You'll recall, Wolf, that right after the big invasion of Ukraine started, Vladimir Putin increased the readiness level of Russia's nuclear forces then. When you had the first mobilization in the fall of this past year, he once again said look, we have big, nuclear weapons and no one should think we're bluffing. So now, as western nation, the U.S. and its allies have talk about, or have decided to send main battle tanks to Ukraine. That is something that Vladimir Putin picked up on today. And, of course, one of the things that we have to mention is that he said all of this at the memorial service for the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad, where, of course, the Soviet Union defeated Nazi Germany. And he was saying, look, once again, it's tanks from Germany that could be rolling towards Russian positions and that's when he made that threat. So, clearly, Vladimir Putin, warning western nations, but, of course, it's not something that we haven't heard from him before, Wolf.",

And I'm glad, especially today you guys were very close to these Russians' air strikes against civilian targets in Ukraine. We'll talk again tomorrow.Let's get more on the state of the war now. Joining us, CNN Military Analyst, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark, CNN Contributor on Russian Affairs Jill Dougherty and the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, Evelyn Farkas, she is now executive director of the McCain Institute. General Clark, is this the beginning of this renewed Russian military offensive in Ukraine and how much worse will it get from here? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, I think we haven't really started to see the real beginning of the offensive. This is more of a preparatory phase. This is to discomfort the Ukrainian people, put pressure on the government, exhaust resources, but the forces that will be involved in this offensively are apparently being moved forward. There's training that's been going on for several months. Many of the 300,000, maybe more than that that were mobilized, were sent forward but many were not. So, I think we're looking probably two to three weeks in the future before the main offensive really kicks off. It would kick off with some effort to blow through the Ukrainian defenses.",

You know, there's a lot of posturing now. Putin is trying to intimidate the Ukrainian people. He's trying to intimidate the west out of providing ongoing and increased support to Ukraine. And it hasn't worked all along. It looks like perhaps he's mobilizing additional troops to throw into the fight as early as perhaps now. At least that's what the Ukrainians are saying. But I'm a bit skeptical about what the outcome will be given that we don't believe that they have the equipment and training for all those people.",

I mean, you know, again, we don't know whether he actually in the end would.[18:10:03] But I think what is really important is that context. The Battle of Stalingrad, 80 years today, Putin is trying to look tough. He's talking to the Russian people saying remember World War II? Well, this is the same thing. He's drawing a direct line between what happened in World War II with the Nazis and Soviet Union, although he constantly depicts it as Russia, not the Soviet Union, right? And then, you know, he's saying we can -- we have to pull together and this is very, very important. And Wolf, today, in Volgograd, which is the name of the city of Stalingrad today, they actually unveiled a statue to Stalin. So, I think that gives you an idea of how Putin now is kind of hijacking World War II history in order to pull people together and actually scare Russians into believing that they are going to be invaded.",

She said that this was really about revenge more than anything else, that she was disappointed in it. That it felt like a witch hunt, but is that this was about revenge in her eyes.

There's no question that this is politics.One of the things that Jessica just talked about, which I don't think has gotten as much attention as it could, is the fact that there has been, for the past several year, bipartisan concern in some areas, discussed with some of the things that Congressman Omar has said, a pattern of things that she has said, a lot of which she has apologized for. Again, she did that on State of the Union on Sunday. And some of the discord has been within her own Democratic Party. And what Jessica talked about is that she signed on today to a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, supporting Israel, which some of her progressive friends have said to me that they were surprised she did. She did that in part so there would be a unified Democratic vote against this because there are some Democrats, Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey worked on this, and other -- maybe a lot of them I think believe are Jewish Democrats who wanted her to affirm those sentiments before saying, yes, we will support you to stay on foreign affairs.

So, you're absolutely right. There is not consistency here. There is hypocrisy across the board on this and it's important to point out.What is also interesting, Nia, I think what you just said about McCarthy trying to be more statesman-like going forward, that Marjorie Taylor Greene example notwithstanding, that's because of pressure from moderate flank of his own conference who say, we've got to be less extreme.",

And I didn't just look at that video as the only African-American governor in this country.I looked at that video as a human being. And the inhumanity that was shown towards Mr. Nichols that day was something that I and none of us should ever forget. And so, I know that in this time -- and when we think about the policies that we have to push together, when we think about the urgency that we have to push these policies forward in, it needs to be done in a context of remembering what it is that we saw. And we saw a brutality and a barbarism that should never, ever be forgotten when we're talking about how quick we need to move with the reforms that are going to be necessary.",

That identified the need for things like police cameras and body cameras, identified the need for the transfer of records when an officer gets moved from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction.But the thing we continue to see is more still continues to -- there's a need that we still have to address. And that includes things like how are we thinking about guidance for measurements of police stops? How are we thinking about guidance when it comes to both the recruiting of officers, where we're recruiting our ourselves from, and at the same time, making sure there's core measurements of accountability. And so, there's a lot that's been done. And we've seen that work here in the state of Maryland, but I think what we continue to see within our neighborhoods is that more needs to be done in conjunction and coordination with our police force and with police officers. But more still needs to be done to make sure there's real measurements of accountability enough for people in our communities that they do feel safe.",
