      "sentences": "Yes, the principal force is HTS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. This is a force that grew out of al-Qaeda, grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq. They sent representatives to Syria to -- during the revolt against Assad that began in 2011.They, after a period, decided that they weren't going to follow al- Qaeda's lead on being international terrorists. They became designated a terrorist group in of themselves, but they became a more nationally focused Islamist group. But there have been other principal groups. One of the biggest groupings, of course, the Kurdish minority in Syria, mostly in the northeast of the country. They got support from the United States. Assad himself was a member -- is a member, of the Alawite sect, which is a minority Shia Islam offshoot in Syria. This is why he was able to bring support from Iran, because Iran saw him as a kindred religious spirit, if you will, and able to help support their proxy in neighboring Lebanon. What became coined to Iran's distaste of the Shia crescent was this sort of axis of connection between Tehran across Syria to Lebanon and Hezbollah there, putting pressure on Israel, of course. So there was that side. Russia, for its own interests, had interests in the port city of Tartus and a military airbase Latakia in the Mediterranean. This is all sort of in the Alawite heartland, if you will, of Syria, which is on the Mediterranean coast. So, again, this was in Russia's interest to exert its influence. An old client, Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, was a client, if you will, during the Soviet Union of the Soviets. That's where a lot of their military equipment was purchased from. So those alliances were sort of old alliances, but they were what shored up Assad. But what he saw arrayed against him were Islamist groups, were Western interests in terms of the United States backing Kurdish groups. And, of course, a plethora of other smaller regional groups. But what the HTS leader was able to do significantly, what Julani was able to do significantly, was over the past number of years, while their grouping had been cornered in the northwest of Syria, was rekindle relationships with smaller rebel factional commanders and bring them back on board under an umbrella and get some significant training, it appears, to become a cohesive, effective force able to make the lightning moves that they've been able to across the whole country. Remember, this is when you're moving a military around a massive battle zone, you need communications, you need effective command structures, you need an obedient and compliant forces that go to the places they're told, do what they're told there, and move on to the next location without choosing themselves to go off track, if you will. And they've executed this over the past couple of weeks, which really speaks to a level of training and discipline that I think had previously perhaps been underestimated of their capabilities.",

But the leading force in this is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, HTS, they've been leading, again, this push, this offensive through. They are still designated, however, as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States.I know there's a lot of different factors here, of course, Russia, Iran, foreign terror organizations, whatever they may be.

We have, other than our troops in the northeast and a little bit in this, as the colonel said, in the southeast at all times, a few troops on the ground.But we do have close ties with Israel, with Turkey, and with our Syrian Democratic Forces allies. In terms of Julani and the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, we dealt indirectly with them when I was the envoy, because as they were in the terrorist list, we couldn't communicate directly with them. But nonetheless, they claim their reform. Now, this is a problem. When we went into that huge effort after 9/11, we didn't say we were going to kill every Islamist. What we said is we would only kill those or put them out of action if they were continuing terrorist operations against us and the rest of the international community. If they were willing to reform, if they were willing to, whatever their beliefs, not conduct international terror, we would find a way of living with them. This is exactly what Julani is offering and what he's been doing for the last six years. Will he hold to that? I don't know. But he has held to that for the last six years. He has not conducted any international attacks. And while he's on our list, believe me, we are extremely assiduous in taking out terrorists all around the Middle East. We haven't touched anybody in his movement for many years. And that shows you how we really think about it.",

And in a week, the rebel forces have advanced and taken all these cities. And here we are at the beginning of a potential new chapter in this country. But, obviously, the civil war spans back over a decade at this point to just after the Arab Spring. So where were we in 2018? And how do you compare that moment to what we're looking at now?",

And the good news is this is a success, among very many other things, of American diplomacy and military action over two administrations, the Trump and the Biden. We were losing the war after Russia came in.Halfway through the Trump administration, when Mike Pompeo came in, we decided we would contest Iran and Russia and Assad in Syria. You remember the two strikes to stop the chemical weapons use, the destruction of the Russian mercenaries when they came across the Euphrates. But also President Trump specifically called on Assad, Russia and Iran not to attack Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Julani and Idlib in September of 2018. And that led to the first of a set of ceasefires. So we froze the conflict during the Trump administration, hoping for a better outcome. [23:15:04] And the Biden administration, while it had some questions, continued that freezing and, very importantly, kept our troops in the Northeast and in the Southeast in continued close coordination with Turkey and with Israel and with our partners on the ground. And that led to this frozen conflict that is now flipped very much to our advantage.",

The president-elect did put out a statement today sort of at the end of it, saying the United States should have nothing to do with this. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved.

And that is a very good thing. But that doesn't mean we don't have interest. We've got a NATO ally, Turkey. We've got a very close partner, Israel, as well as Jordan, Iraq, and other countries and movements involved here. And we also have the stability of the region that we care a lot about. And we've just spent a year essentially fighting alongside Israel. So we need to take care of our own people on the ground first, ensure they're safe, suppress the Islamic State elements that still are active below the Euphrates. We need to work again with Turkey, with Israel, with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds in the Northeast. Those all have, if you will, skin in the game. We need to push for a ceasefire. We need to push for protection of civilians and turn to the U.N. under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 that everybody still accepts that calls for reconciliation, new constitution, elections, and a countrywide ceasefire. That's the path forward. The U.N. is ready to move out on that. We should support it.",

Rebel forces have entered the capital of Damascus and they've declared Damascus free, claiming Assad has fled the city.Now, a source tells CNN that the Syrian military there has fallen, adding that Assad is nowhere to be found. And rebels have been sweeping through the country since launching an offensive last week. They claim to have captured four cities in one day before reaching the capital. Syrians were seen tearing down and setting fire to posters of Assad. Rebels say senior Assad regime officials are preparing to defect in the capital as well. We're also seeing reports of Syrian soldiers fleeing the country and going to Iraq. U.S. officials tell CNN that Assad's regime could fall within days.

Rebel fighters say they're planning to take over state media offices to broadcast their victory over Assad, adding that some senior regime officials are preparing to defect in the capital. I want to go live now to Doha, Qatar, where I'm joined by Charles Lister. Charles is the director of the Syria Encountering Terrorism and Extremism programs at the Middle East Institute. Thanks for being here. I want to sort of contextualize this moment and sort of explain to our viewers how we got here, maybe going back to even the Arab Spring. But of course, we have seen various chapters of conflict between the Syrian regime, the government, and various versions of opposition forces, even the rise and fall of ISIS, for example. Just kind of catch us up to how we got to this moment. CHARLES LISTER, SR. FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Yes, first of all, thank you for having me on this historic day. I mean, Syrians are waking up to a day now where the Assad regime and its family will no longer be in control of Syria for the first time in 54 years. So this is really a historic change for Syria. Most of the Syrian population alive today know nothing but Assad family rule, and it has been uniformly across that 54 years, a brutal rule. Since, as you say, 2011, with the outbreak of the Arab Spring, Syrians took to the streets initially to demand political reforms. They were met very swiftly by brutal suppression, machine guns, tear gas, helicopter gunfire, that then spiraled into a civil conflict in which the regime has embraced what it has called an Assad or We Burn the Country approach to suppressing the opposition. And that, frankly, is why it's taken 14 years to get to this point. But ultimately speaking, despite 82,000 barrel bombs, 340 chemical weapons attacks, half a million dead, 130,000 people missing, the Syrian people didn't give up. And we're seeing the consequences of what had been over the years a fraying, a decaying, a fragmenting regime that collapsed very quickly after a series of triggers and obviously this rebel offensive that's taken over over the past 12 days.",

You know, at one point years ago, there were over 1,000 armed opposition groups. The number of -- the numbers have reduced with time, as a lot of them have merged.What we've really seen is, at the tip of the spear of this offensive has been a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Now, seven or eight years ago, they were a publicly avowed affiliate of al-Qaeda. The group has changed in some quite dramatic ways over the last eight years. It remains very conservative, but its governance practices are far more pragmatic than certainly than they used to be. A lot of the steps that group has taken to moderate its stance and to kind of embed itself more deeply in the Syrian revolutionary movement has seen this much greater unity of purpose that has been demonstrated over the past 12 days, in which the entire spectrum of the armed opposition in Syria, from nationalists and everyone else in between, have unified to launch this territorial offensive. And I think for the first time in 13 or 14 years, that unity has really made a difference on the ground. And then, of course, beyond that, there is the political opposition that maintains offices across the Middle East region, that maintains open and very constructive relations with the international community. The challenge now will be to see that political opposition unify its purpose with the armed groups on the ground in order to create some kind of a unified vision for what comes next. And then, of course, the even bigger challenge of reconciliation with what remains of the Syrian government in Damascus. That is the big challenge that lies ahead. But for now, of course, Syrians are, I think, uniformly exhilarated by the idea that there is light at the end of the tunnel after 14 years of a hellish civil crisis.",

I think it also reflects, frankly, that those within the regime in these high positions of power have lost, and so they have very little other option but to issue that olive branch.There has also been, or there have also been, over the last week or so, a surge of communication between the armed opposition groups, including HTS, and some of these regime figures. It's, of course, been entirely secret, but a relatively open secret for those of us working on this issue. And I think a lot of that was intended, perhaps surprisingly for many outside observers, that was intended by these armed groups, including HTS, to avoid the scenario whereby Assad one day leaves and then we just restart a whole new civil conflict. And so I think that, plus the fact that, as I say, the vast majority of Syrians have lived through such a hellish situation for so long. That no matter where they might have stood over the last 14 years, the humanitarian crisis, the economic crisis, I mean, there really is no understating how much Syrian people are suffering these days on all sides. The idea that change is now afoot, I think, has created a kind of optimism on all sides that the Syrian people can unite and figure this all out. Now, that is the optimistic take in these very, very early minutes and early hours. But for now, it's a very encouraging sign, and one can only hope that that kind of communication and that kind of understanding and the move towards a peaceful transition is where we're headed right now.",
