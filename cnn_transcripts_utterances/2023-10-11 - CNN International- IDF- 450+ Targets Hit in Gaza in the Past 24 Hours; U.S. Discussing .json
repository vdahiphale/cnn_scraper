CNN's Ben Wedeman has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Gaza city neighborhood once known as El Rimal, The Sands, reduced to ashes. Its residents retrieve what they can, which isn't much. Israel continues to pound the strip, targeting, it says, Hamas infrastructure. Residents in shock are asking why? I got married this year, says Yahya Al-Ahwal. What did I do? What have we done? You destroyed an entire neighborhood. He says he never fired a rocket. And this, one of the most densely populated patches of land on Earth. Bombs crashing into crowded neighborhoods rarely differentiate between fighter and civilian. The death toll rises by the hour. While Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with the wounded, including infants. Around 40 percent of the population of Gaza is under the age of 15, according to the CIA. The information ministry in Gaza reports that nearly 170 buildings have been destroyed and more than 12 thousand residences damaged. Tens of thousands have fled their homes, seeking refuge in UN schools converted into shelters. An oven in this bakery in Gaza city has shut down, many of the shelves empty. Life here was already difficult, and now the future looks bleaker than ever. Gaza will take five years to raise its head after this, says Wahiba Sirsawi, and after five years, there will be two or three more wars. It's a catastrophe. And amidst all this, somewhere in Gaza, only Hamas knows where, are more than one hundred Israeli captives, fates unknown. Tuesday afternoon, Israel struck Gaza's only port, used principally by fishermen. While at the same time, Hamas unleashed a massive volley of rockets towards Ashkelon. The abyss approaches.

MIDHAT ABBAS, GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY, GAZA CITY: Well, in our hospitals, there's this threat, the situation is miserable. Now all the hospitals are full of injured people. Now we cannot receive anymore. So we're now sending our patients to NGOs and trying to cope to this pressure. But in fact what we consume in one day of our medicine and medical supplies used to be used in one month in the ordinary day. The other thing is that with the shortage of electricity and shortage of fuel at the same time. Our standby generators will stop within two days maximum. And the main power station plant will collapse today, as I know, which is now giving only one hour every 24 hours of electricity. In fact, the situation is very miserable. Talking now about 974 killed. And more than 5,000 injured. The houses are being annihilated while people are inside. What's needed now, right now, we need more ambulances and we need to have a safe route at once immediately to be able to send patients outside those wounded for treatment because we can't take them anymore in our hospitals. The other thing is that we need to have medical communities come to assist our local staff and medication and medical supplies and there should be a solution immediately for fuel and opening the borders. Otherwise we are talking about a disaster and many, many of the people now are still under grabbing. People trying to evacuate them by their hands because of shortage of civil defense equipment in their district. And we are living under heavy bombardment along the hour and strikes are ongoing. So the situation is very, very hard and difficult. I am 60 years old. I have never ever seen such a thing in all my life. This is the first time to see such a disaster like this in my life.

It's the biggest Israeli failure in security since 1973.
