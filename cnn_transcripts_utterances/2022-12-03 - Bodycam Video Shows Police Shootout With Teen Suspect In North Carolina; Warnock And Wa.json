And that number includes those the council called innocent victims and martyrs. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh explains how World Cup celebrations within Iran were also protests.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Protests turned into scenes of joy and jubilation across Iran this week. Iranians were out celebrating their country's defeat to the World Cup. Surreal but for many after touting its team, it was the repressive regime that was defeated. No longer could it claim a victory while violently suppressing its own people. Mehran Samak was out on the streets of his city of Bandar-e Anzali in his car honking the horn in celebration, when he was shot in the head. Activist and a human rights monitor tells CNN, it was regime forces that killed the 27-year-old. Authorities denied killing Samak. They're investigating his quote, suspicious death. They say several suspects have been arrested. Investigations by the Iranian government into the deaths of young protesters since September lacked credibility and impartiality, according to the U.N. We're not allowed to report from inside Iran. Those who speak to it face jail or worse, making it hard for us to tell the stories of victims and those left to mourn. Samak's Instagram post just a little snapshot of a life ended too soon. An athletic young man who enjoyed life, being with his friends and water sports, growing up he played soccer with Saeed Ezatolahi, now a midfielder in the national team who shared this photo. Mourning his childhood friend he wrote, I wish we could always stay at the same age, without any concerns, without hate, without jealousy, without fighting to put each other down. After another bitter night last night and with the news of your death, my heart is even more on fire. At Samak's burial mourners chant, death to the dictator, Khamenei must go. Every life loss brings more heart ache, more anger, more defiance and determination of a people risking it all in this bloody battle for freedom. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And it's three weeks later. So a lot of people just so worried.One of the things that they cleared up recently is that they're saying that there was a sixth person on the lease of the house. They're saying that person they don't believe is a suspect in this case. They've also ruled out some of the surviving roommates. They've ruled out other people who were seen on surveillance video with Kaylee and Maddie at the food truck, the driver that brought them home, they had been cleared. Just a couple of rumors that police say, hey, wait a minute. This is not the case here. Let us do our work in this investigation. But of course, people continue to be worried and try to come up with theories. That's why in their latest statement, authorities saying this, they say there is speculation without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts. So what they're saying now is essentially, wait for us to finish this investigation. Wait, as we continue to make progress. They say there is progress, but it is behind the scenes. And they're also saying look, it is just going to take a little bit more time here. One of the things that was very confusing was that they've always said that this was a targeted attack. But recently they said, look, we just have not been able to determine whether the house was targeted or the students were targeted. So of course, people there still in so much fear. Fred?",
