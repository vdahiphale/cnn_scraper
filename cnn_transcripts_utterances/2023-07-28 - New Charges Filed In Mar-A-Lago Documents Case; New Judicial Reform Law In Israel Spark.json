Now, prosecutors have charged him with an additional count of willful retention of national defense information, as well as two additional counts of obstruction, alleging that the former president and two of his employees attempted to destroy surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago from the summer of 2022.And that surveillance footage is really at the heart of this investigation. It's key evidence for prosecutors as they tried to put together were exactly classified materials were moved on the Mar-a- Lago property after the former president left office. But we also know that witnesses have been asked if anyone tried to prevent them from getting all of that surveillance footage or if anyone tried to tamper with it, or destroy it. Now according to the superseding indictment, two Trump employees wanted to destroy this surveillance footage because \"the boss wanted it gone.\" Now, the new charges were filed not only against former President Trump and his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, but they also added a new co-defendant Carlos De Oliveira. He is a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago. He has been seen on surveillance footage with Walt Nauta moving boxes that contain classified information, including one incident where they moved boxes out of a storage closet right before one of Trump's lawyers went to search that closet for classified documents. Now, Carlos is represented by a lawyer who is paid for by Trump-linked political action committee. His lawyer tonight had no comment but they're both expected to appear in court next week.

Russian forces withdrew after a week's long fight.And for the first time, a Ukrainian military vehicle was spotted stuck in a ditch, it seems, along a Russian anti-tank obstacle known as Dragon's Teeth. The images are from southern Ukraine suggesting Ukrainian forces have pushed behind this Russian line of defense. And the mercenary leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was seen in Russia for the first time since his uprising last month, holding meetings on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg. It also was on Thursday. Last week, the Kremlin set the price of grain like wheat and corn soaring on world markets by officially withdrawing from a deal with Ukraine to provide safe shipping for grain exports to the Black Sea. Now, Vladimir Putin at a summit with African leaders is promising free grain to six countries. He says Russia is still a reliable supplier of food to Africa. He accused Western governments of hypocrisy for sanctioning Russian exports. Those wheat prices shot up last week not just because Russia withdrew from that Black Sea deal but also because of repeated Russian attacks on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and others within that region.
