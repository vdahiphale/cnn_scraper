And we start this hour with breaking news.The United States is surging military aid to Israel after the devastating surprise terrorist attack by Hamas which killed at least 900 people, most of them civilians. We have also just learned that number includes at least 11 Americans. This afternoon Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Israel's response to the horrific attacks is just beginning. You are looking right now at images from Gaza just moments ago where we are seeing that response play out as Israeli forces have fired dozens if not hundreds of rockets into Gaza. Hamas terrorists have taken an unknown number of innocent civilians as hostages today threatening to broadcast their executions if Israel strikes homes in Gaza without warning. We are hearing continued reports of rape. We are hearing reports of people dragged out of their cars and shot. CNN crews witnessed mass execution sites where innocent attendees of a music festival spent their last moments huddled together in a bomb shelter. The shelter was no match for terrorist infiltrators who had guns on the ground. These are images that you should not have to see because, frankly, such depravity should not exist, but it does. And that depravity, which I discussed, led to this response from White House official National Security Council spokesman John Kirby when I asked him about some of the images we've been seeing on The Lead just a few minutes ago.

Nearly three days after the Hamas terrorist attack, the desperate and heart- wrenching work of first responders in Israel continues.Joining us now is Miriam Balin. She runs the trauma and crisis response Unit called United Hatzalah. Miriam, thank you so much for joining us. What has been the response so far? MIRIAM MIEDZINSKI BALIN, FOUNDER, PSYCHOTRAUMA &amp; CRISIS RESPONSE UNIT: Well, horror. We're just in horror. We've sent over 1,500 volunteers for United Hatala, which is a network of community-based volunteer. EMTs, paramedics, and doctors down to the south. They have constructed a field hospital on the border. They are seeing sites that they've never seen before, and we are just horrified. We're doing the best we can to be able to stay on top of all of the, you know, the medical, medical care that needs to be given in these very difficult circumstances. But just to give you an idea of some of the calls that we've been seeing. Our field hospital had a woman come with her children. After having been inside her home, inside a bomb shelter, with terrorists actively trying to break down the door, she stayed there for hours. They eventually then burned down her home to try to get her out. She miraculously lived and came to our field hospital with second- and third-degree burns. We had a woman come to us right after having been rescued after five hours of playing dead in a field near bushes after having been shot at the festival, music festival. And she just had to lay there in the bushes waiting for somebody come rescue her with an open wound to her arm begging us to save her arm so that she'd be able to be a personal trainer which was her dream and her ability to be able to provide for her family. I mean, the things that we found, two children all alone in a bomb shelter right after their parents had been murdered in the same house and brought them to the field clinic and had to take care of them. Orphaned. Just slaying people, murdering people, vicious, barbaric, it is unbelievable to see what's going on here. As a mother, I'm torn, you know, I'm trying to be a first responder as well as a mom. The kids are asking hard questions. We have no answers for most of the questions. Tying to be able to stay calm with all these fighter jets overhead, with sirens going on all the time, with having to bring children up to the bomb shelter every couple of hours and then stay there, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. It's a really difficult situation here right now.",

Congressman, tell us what you and your family experienced when Hamas launched this attack. What part of Israel were you in? REP. DAN GOLDMAN, (D-NY): Well, we were in Tel Aviv and at 6:30 in the morning. I had a daughter on either side of me in bed and we were woken up by the sirens that in Israel are well known to reflect missiles being shot into Israel from some border territory, border area. We ran to the stairwell in the interior of the hotel, which is the bomb shelter for the hotels. And we remained there until we got the all clear. We had to do that several more times in the morning and again in the evening. And we heard the Iron Dome defense system blowing up rockets outside of our window.

And what we need to remember is that this is not about Israel versus Palestinians. This is about Hamas, a terrorist organization dedicated to the eradication of Israel and all Jews. It should not exist. It should not be in power. And like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, it needs to be eliminated. And the Palestinians deserve a robust government for themselves that can be a partner in peace and security and prosperity. And Hamas is not that. TAPPER: I saw a post on Instagram today from, I don't want to pick on Yale, your alma mater, but it was from Yale-ies for Palestine.

In response to the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks over the weekend, Israel has ordered the siege of Gaza as it retaliates against Saturday's deadly terrorist attack. CNN's Ben Wedeman is live on the ground following the launch of Israel's counter offensive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Moments after an Israeli airstrike on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, desperate calls for help the dead, the dying and the injured covered in dust and blood. Israel's wrath is now unleashed upon Gaza. The Israeli, say Ahmed Shamalakh, hit the building without warning. They didn't ask us to evacuate. They didn't say anything. Suddenly, we heard the airstrike and we ran to the building and found it had completely collapsed. Around 75,000 people in Gaza have already been displaced, according to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency which deals with Palestinian refugees. In this cramped strip of land along the Mediterranean, 2 million Palestinians are now in the crosshairs of an enemy bent on revenge for Hamas's surprise attack, which left hundreds of Israelis dead and thousands wounded, and dozens now in Hamas captivity. By mid- afternoon, the death toll in Gaza was approaching 600 with almost 3,000 wounded according to the Palestinian health ministry. Gaza and Israel have gone to war many times before since Hamas took control. This will not be yet another brief outbreak of attack and counter attack before it return to the status quo. Israel is massing troops and armor on the outskirts of Gaza, preparing in all likelihood for a ground invasion on a scale not seen before. And now Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has ordered what he called a complete siege of Gaza, cutting off all food, fuel and electricity. That is in a place where according to the World Food Program, 63 percent of the population was food insecure before this war began. So much has happened since Saturday morning in Israel and Gaza. And it's only the beginning. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
