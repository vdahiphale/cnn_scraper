They are instead calling for these humanitarian pauses to enable aid to get into Gaza, to try to increase that output of aid, the output of civilians leaving Gaza, and we saw Secretary Blinken push this very hard yesterday in his meeting with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv.

The other problem with a pause, just in terms of how you would figure it out is a lot of the roads south have been damaged or destroyed. And with Israel ringing that area, what area are they going to open up to allow people to flee. We had a senior U.S. officials brief reporters yesterday and say, Hamas already tried to sneak out a number of its wounded operatives as part of the negotiation to get the wounded out and let foreign nationals out over the Rafah border crossings. So what Israel will ask is okay, if we opened some avenues South, how is Hamas going to take advantage of that? So that's why they want more hostages out. It would help Israel militarily to prosecute their war. In the meantime, you know, Blinken doesn't have a lot of political capital to play with because the Israelis are feeling like people have forgotten what happened to them and therefore, they're just going to do what they have to do.",

Once it unleashes all of those rockets, the U.S. carrier strike groups that are in the Mediterranean right now could attack and it could also pull Iran into the war.I don't think Iran wants that either.

If any indication of Trump's past with regard to how he handles things is any indication to the future, I think we'll hear that my business was ran perfectly. We have a branding that is tremendous. Subjective values were placed upon property. It is not an exact science. My brand is enormous, spectacular. We did nothing wrong. The financial statements were perfect. Remember what he said to the Secretary of State drawing the parallel of Georgia.And so I don't expect there to be any admissions on his part. I expect there to be double, tripling, and everything down. The distinction, though Victor is important to note that this is in front of a judge. The Judge is not persuaded by star appeal. The judges not persuaded by arguments about witch-hunts and political prosecutions. The Judges are persuaded by facts. And when you have a control of the company indicating as the comptroller testified, Mr. Connolly, that we had an eye and I had direction from his son with regard to the financial statements, appraisals, and evaluations, when you have one of his sons signing off of, right? Where you have Donald Trump Jr. signing off of financial statements. Oh, it was my accountant. Oh, I relied upon my lawyers. It's a problem. Because the essence of what was in those financial statements are not factually accurate when you include, for example, apartments that are not yet constructed, when you have rent stabilized apartments that you don't account for and you deem to be private. Those are factual discrepancies. So it will be interesting to me how he deals with those factual issues and can't and has to just get away from the witch hunt narrative, which a Judge in a bench trial will not buy, potentially jury, not a Judge.",

So -- and the most objective way that I could present this Victor, what happens at any trial as a Judge in presiding over the trial, being in at a jury trial, or particularly a bench trial, is really reliant upon the law clerk for certain issues and matters. When there's testimony that a person is giving to the Judge. Remember, a Judge has a trier of fact meaning has to make an assessment as to what's factually accurate as a jury, in a normal case, would do if it were a jury trial. And a Judge also has to make rulings with respect to the admissibility of the evidence, with regard to being a referee, about what he's going to -- really of value, what it's not, right, because that's what a Judge does is a referee of the evidence of a trial and just has to control that.In doing that, you're reliant as a Judge on your law clerk. And in any instance when I'm in court, you see a Judge conferring during trial with the law clerk, after trial with the law clerk, before the trial with a law clerk. And so there's nothing nefarious or myths about a law clerk who's keeping copious notes and giving it to the Judge to make sure they have a consistent focus and that the Judge is on point with regard to rulings and factual determinations.",

Because in this case as you're seeing, people not just in Dearborn, not just in Michigan, there are a lot of Muslim-Americans all over the country that are expressing to pollsters and others that they've got these concerns.And now, you know, even in a state like Arizona which Joe Biden won by 10,000 votes, it doesn't take a lot to really sort of change the political map in a way that's quite meaningful, well, for his re- election chances. So, this is not going to go away. This is going to be a very serious issue. Some of the polling, Amara, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. I mean, the level of support by Arab-Americans for the Democratic Party, for this Democratic incumbent president has just fallen off a cliff.

CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  I simply believe that the current level of civilian casualties inside Gaza is too high, both from a moral perspective and a strategic perspective. What we have learned in our own country's counterterrorism operations is that, when you are too permissive of civilian casualties, you kill a lot of militants, but you also create a lot of terrorists as well, because that civilian harm becomes bulletin board material for terrorist recruiters.

And look at who is in charge in Afghanistan now? When you look at Gaza, and you look at the fact that, I think half the population is under the age of 18. I mean, it's -- there are a lot of young people there and you don't want to become a recruiting ground for jihadists all over the -- all over the world and specifically in the region. He's got a very good point. I mean, you know, this is -- this is going to be a debate that continues, and a lot of this is up to Israel.

So we learned that the economy added 150,000 jobs in October. That is below what economists had been expecting.It's also a dramatic slowdown from September's revised total of 297,000 jobs. When you look at the jobless rate, the unemployment rate, that ticked higher, slightly to 3.9 percent. And when you look at industries, and you look more in-depth of the breakdown of where jobs were added and where jobs were lost, so 35,000 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector. And that includes the more than 33,000 in the motor vehicles and the parts industry. And that's mainly due to the now resolved autoworker strike activity, the UAW strike. Now, on the flip side, healthcare led the way with 58,000 new jobs added, and government added about 51,000 positions, returning there to pre-pandemic levels. When we look at wage growth, annual wage growth, this was a welcome sign, I think, for the Fed. This slowed to levels not seen in more than two years. And when you put all of this in perspective, you look at monthly averages of 239,000 jobs in 2023. That is what we've seen so far. That is noticeably smaller than the monthly gains of 400,000 that were reported last year. But this is actually -- this report and these new figures, these are likely welcome signs for the Federal Reserve, because remember, they're looking to tame inflation, and one way they are looking to do that is by bringing a bit more balance in the labor market. So, creating a bit more balance, seeing a bit more balance, in terms of the supply of workers and the demand for workers, and this report suggests that they may be getting a bit more of that.

And then, things crashed into each other and planets crashed into each other, and over that four and a half billion years, some of these asteroids that are flying through space are the remnants of those early collisions.
