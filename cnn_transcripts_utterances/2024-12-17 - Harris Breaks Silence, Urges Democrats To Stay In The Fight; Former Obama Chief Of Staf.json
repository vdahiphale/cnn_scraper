No one can walk away. We must stay in the fight, every one of us.(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: That is not the only medicine that is being prescribed to Democrats right now. Former Obama chief of staff and the current ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, is diagnosing what led to Trump's win, and what the Democrats need to do to regain power. In a Washington Post op-ed, he argues that Americans see a system that is rigged in favor of the powerful, and Trump seized on that. He seized on that feeling that has been brewing for more than two decades. Emanuel says that voters were primed after the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis, two calamitous events that virtually no one was held responsible for. And on Iraq, Emanuel writes, the conflict was perpetrated by people who now sit on corporate boards and hold chairs at prestigious universities. So much for justice. And on the financial crisis, he says, it was a mistake not to apply Old Testament justice to the bankers during the Obama administration, as some called for at the time. Everyone is with us here in the studio. So, Rahm Emanuel has three parts to this. He says, the goal for Democrats ought to be to reveal that Trump isn't a populist, he's a plutocrat. Don't hide from crime, immigration, homelessness, fentanyl crisis. Get better, more authentic candidates for the midterms. That honestly all sounds fairly sensible to me. But one of the interesting things is that on the financial crisis, I mean, he was there. So a little bit of a self-examination happening there.",

I've been preaching this for the last, I don't know, how many years, which is that Democrats need to start talking to normal people in normal English. They need to start getting with the program and understanding that we can't continue to communicate like we're these elitists sitting atop a mountain.And most importantly, we need to understand that there's deep, deep, deep anger in this country that Trump channeled. And that anger goes back at least 25 years, if not longer, to being lied into the Iraq war, to the financial crisis where nobody was held accountable who got us into this crisis, but a lot of people lost their life savings. If you're a 25 year old person right now, your entire life, you've been living under people who essentially lied you into war, lied you into financial crises, and nobody faced the consequences. And what people voted for in November is a disruptor, which is what Trump is. Democrats could be that disruptor. And Democrats need to start acting like they need to disrupt the status quo as opposed to leaning into a world that no longer exists. We'll never go back to the, you know, old world phenomenon that Democrats want to go back to. It's over.",

If you actually go back to when Build Back Better was the policy that the Biden administration wanted to do, where they wanted to do things that progressives, like Pramila Jayapal was trying to hold the line that would actually improve the quality of working people's lives, those are the principles that Democrats actually stood on, but there were moderates, like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, that would actually not let Democrats deliver for us. So, I think there are policies that resonate with the American people. I do think that we did not communicate to the -- we lost, so we did not communicate properly. But I also want to say I think that Kamala Harris is doing the right thing and telling people -- I know we think there was a mandate, but she lost by 200,000 so votes across a lot of states. That is not millions of people saying they do not want Kamala Harris to be president. I think what she needs to do is she needs to say, you don't -- when you lose, you don't storm the Capitol. You don't throw in your talent, say, I'm going to be a brat and not work with other people. You say, I believe in this country and I'm going to keep working.

I was also sued by Mr. Trump, as you may remember, for $500 million in the Southern District of New York. The playbook that Donald is doing right now, it's not new.
