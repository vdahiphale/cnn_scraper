This is the seat held by Sean Patrick Maloney, New York's 17th District -- Westchester and other counties nearby. He's trailing by about a point, by 3,000 votes -- 98 percent in. There is still more votes to be counted. Republicans would love to defeat him here.

Right now, Democrats are trailing in one. This is Illinois' 17th Congressional District, largely redrawn. This would have been Cheri Bustos' seat -- she retired there.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I mean, look, I think the big thing that's coming out of this midterm is that Democrats did so well and I'm kind of going OK, why did Democrats do so well despite the fact that Joe Biden is unpopular?Let's take a look though at the national polling that essentially looks at those who have a favorable view of only Biden, only Trump, Biden and Trump, neither Biden nor Trump. Look at that. Only 38 percent of voters had only a favorable view of Trump. When you add in that one percent that had a favorable view of both Biden and Trump, Donald Trump's favorability nationwide just 39 percent. Now, I want to zone in on that 18 percent, right, that did not like Donald Trump nor did they like Joe Biden. And what you see is that the Republicans were able to win there by 17 points in the national House vote. But historically speaking, if you had an unfavorable view of the incumbent -- the presidential incumbent, that margin should be much, much wider. So it does seem to me that Donald Trump being in the minds of voters very much cost Republicans, at least when it came to the House nationally. Now, Trump may be unpopular but what about Ron DeSantis, who easily overwhelmingly won reelection? Look at his approval rating in the state of Florida -- 58 percent, significantly higher than Donald Trump's favorable rating nationwide, which totaled up to 39 percent. And when it comes to actually running in 2024, let's take a look there. And what we see is that yes, 45 percent of Florida voters, in fact, do want Ron DeSantis to run for president in 2024. The majority say no -- 53 percent. But that 45 percent -- compare that to Floridians' views of whether they wanted Donald Trump to run for president. And this, I think, gives you a real understanding of why Ron DeSantis is so strong. Look at that -- just 33 percent of Floridians wanted Donald Trump to run for president. The vast majority said no. So, in Florida, where the voters know each of those candidates equally well, Ron DeSantis is much higher up when it comes to 2024.",

So, we're going to talk about what's happening in Wisconsin.But let me just reset for you here four key Senate races still undecided at this hour, including the one in Wisconsin between Mandela Barnes and Ron Johnson. You heard Ron Johnson saying hey look, we looked at the numbers. Not yet sure. We don't believe right now that they can make it up, but I don't want to declare victory right now. Let's go now to CNN's Lucy Kafanov. She joins us now from Milwaukee with the very latest. So we heard from Ron Johnson. What are you hearing there as you're on the scene in Wisconsin?",

Ron Johnson in a challenge -- facing off a challenge by the lieutenant Democratic governor, Mandela Barnes in a race that is -- was incredibly competitive. With 94 percent of the vote in, though, Johnson ahead by something like 33,000 votes, which is a significant number in a -- in a state where races often come down to the wire.And as you heard in that sound bite there, Johnson not declaring victory but basically declaring victory. We have yet to hear from Barnes. We've also yet to have the race be officially called. But keep in mind, that Wisconsin was considered the Democrats' best chance of flipping a Republican seat. Johnson was not particularly popular here and Mandela Barnes initially had a slight lead in the polls in the initial months. But we saw that lead evaporate in a barrage of negative advertising throughout recent weeks. But, of course, it's not all bad news for the Democrats here in this state. Governor Tony Evers has won his reelection bid -- that is at least according to CNN projections -- against his Republican challenger, preserving the Democrats' veto power in a state where the legislation was seeking veto-proof supermajorities. And if the race is actually called for Sen. Ron Johnson, this would be the first time in 24 years that we've seen a split ticket here in Wisconsin -- guys.",

You can see this one right here, Dunn County -- a smaller Republican county. Ron Johnson could pick up some votes here but not very much. You're not talking about tons of votes there. Rock County, down here on the border. Mandela Barnes has a small lead there -- 84 percent in. He might be able to pick up some vote here. The biggie -- the biggie where the votes still are is Milwaukee County, or Mil-wau-kay as they say in \"Wayne's World.\" You can see Mandela Barnes has a huge lead. He leads by 41 percent, which is outperforming what Joe Biden did there. He would need to pick up, essentially, in Milwaukee County alone, the overall vote total -- the 32,000 votes that he is trailing Ron Johnson. It's a tough order -- tall order to be sure. This race has not been projected yet -- largely, I assume because Milwaukee is still out there. And as we just heard from Lucy, CNN has projected that the winner of the governor's race will be Democrat Tony Evers. You can see he's 83,000 votes ahead so there is a difference between Tony Evers and Mandela Barnes. Evers, 83,000 ahead; Barnes, 32,000 votes behind.",
