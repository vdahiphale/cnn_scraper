THE CHRIS WALLACE SHOW will start in just a few minutes, but we do want to get you the latest on our breaking news we have been following all morning.The Middle East on edge after the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike Friday today night. Nasrallah, one of the founders of Hezbollah, oversaw it's transformation into a powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East responsible for numerous terrorist attacks. The strike that killed Nasrallah happened in a densely populated area, killed at least six people, wounded, dozens more. This according to Lebanese officials. In all, Israel targeted more than 140 sites. The IDF says those targets included weapons storage facilities, production sites, as well as other infrastructure embedded inside residential neighborhoods in Beirut. There are concerns about a possible response. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel, as it has so often these last several months. Iran's supreme leader says its forces are standing alongside Hezbollah. This morning, an IDF spokesperson defended the targeting of Nasrallah, claimed Israel did not see a wider conflict in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT HEAD:  Israel does not seek a wider escalation. We seek two things, two simple things -- to bring our hostages home for almost a year in Hamas captivity in all means, and to make sure that our borders are safe and secure for our citizens.

In fact, I had that conversation with some senior officials here speculating about the possibility of this happening, though they gave me no indication that this sort of targeting of Nasrallah was coming. But their question to me was, well, if you do that, then you don't know what you're going to get. And at least with Nasrallah, you knew what you're going to get.So I think there has been also a pragmatic calculation at the leadership level in Israel that this was still the best move, because in the short term it protects Israel.",

You don't know the terrain. But the limits of going into that terrain, will it just be a couple of miles to destroy, create a buffer zone?

Our teams on the ground witnessed this last night, many gathering around the coastal area in the west of Beirut, sleeping on the streets with their children, with their families, the fear that their residential buildings could also be struck or maybe impacted by nearby strikes. Now, as you mentioned, we have heard that there have been some evacuation orders in some cases issued to civilians, which the Israeli military claims are located near Hezbollah targets. But what we've also been hearing is that oftentimes there were simply not enough time, not enough warning to give civilians an ample amount of time to actually get out and get to safety. And of course, this is a country which has already been through so much in recent years. This is a hugely distressing and difficult situation for the civilians of Lebanon.",

He makes it seem like he's inviting violence at times. And like that is not something that appeals to a lot of suburban women, and those are the women that he's really suffering with.

Schools won't be operating there tomorrow. The mayor certainly says that the town is on alert. People understand they have to stay close to their shelters. But in the center of Israel, this would be different. If it comes under heavy Hezbollah bombardment in a way that it hasn't before, this will be something new.

But now is not the right moment for that voice to be heard, not because diplomacy isn't the right way forward, but the language that's being spoken between the Israeli government and Hezbollah right now is the language of war. There is no space at the moment for diplomatic words to be heard and to be acted upon. There's no -- there will be no desire from Hezbollah's side that this is the moment that they should turn the other cheek.And certainly, what we've heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he thinks Israel is winning. That's what he said at the United Nations, at the UNGA just yesterday. He thinks Israel is winning. His tactics are winning, and those tactics are not for diplomacy. They're to continue to double down against Israel's enemies. So I suspect the conversation is, we know what we'd like to say. And deeply frustrated as we are, we've been frustrated before. But when is the right moment to interject and call for calm? Because if you call for calm and there's about to be an explosion of violence, that really doesn't benefit you. Your voice sounds weak and ineffective, and that's really counterproductive also for the White House.",

And Hezbollah are after all, is an army of tens of thousands of soldiers, has been around for more than four decades. They're going to have a leadership succession plan.

It is a weapons defense system called David's Sling, which is a much more powerful, much faster rocket-based missile system that -- we just heard in the distance an explosion there, my colleagues are telling me. So the David's Sling will shoot down a ballistic missile at a higher altitude, and the ballistic missile, of course, has a much bigger payload than the smaller missiles that were coming from Gaza that the Iron Dome intercepts.So that's potentially what we've just heard is an intercept off in the distance here.

I don't want to underplay the fact that their leadership has been decapitated. It's a problem. Some of their other leaders have been killed. That's a problem. Some of the foot soldiers were injured or killed in the pager and walkie-talkie attacks we saw some days ago.But that said, Hezbollah is not going to go out of business because of this. And they also have a pretty strong popular movement in Lebanon. I mean, they have members of parliament. They are a political party. They are -- they have the most effective military force in Lebanon. It's more effective than the Lebanese army. And I'm not saying that's highly effective, but the point is, is that this will obviously, for it's a victory for Israel, but it doesn't mean that the fight is over by any means. And the United States has often taken out terrorist leaders. In 2006, the United States killed the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Well, that group eventually became ISIS and took over much of Iraq. So it's kind of a dangerous mistake to think that one kind of strike like this is going to be ultra significant in the long term.",

They've sent Hezbollah hundreds of millions of dollars over the years. They've supported them in other ways. But Iran does not want to have a full-scale war with Israel or the United States. So they have a dilemma, which is they'd like to respond, but how?One way that they've responded in the past, the United States killed Soleimani, the leader of the Iraqi Revolutionary Guards in 2020 under President Trump. Will, their response has been an attempt to kill Trump himself, we know from recent news reports, and also people in his inner circle, like John Bolton, his former national security advisor, who now has 24-7 Secret Service protection. So they are going to try and respond, but they probably going to try and respond at a level below outright warfare because they fear they may either lose or at least be severely damaged if it comes through a war with Israel, which might well draw in the United States.",
