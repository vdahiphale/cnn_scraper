      "sentences": "Listen, Boris, it's really not good. I mean, the talks are happening. There will be another meeting of officials in Cairo, as you said.And the U.S. is sending senior officials to take part. Bill Burns, the director of the CIA, Brett McGurk, a top State Department negotiator often involved in these talks. So the fact that they're showing up shows that the U.S. is still invested. And an Israeli negotiating team will be there as well. Hamas does not take part in these talks in-person. They have mediators who convey to them where things stand. Talks are taking place. But as you mentioned, Israel is now publicly insisting on a presence at what's known as the Philadelphi Corridor. That is the border between Gaza and Egypt. And why that is of a concern to Israel is because there are all those tunnels underneath there that bring in arms. And the concern among Israeli officials that only they can trust themselves to control that corridor. To date, that had only been discussed privately as the possibility that Israel is insisting on that. Now the prime minister's office is declaring it publicly. That's a position U.S. officials called as a called a maximalist position, not helpful to the negotiations. And what it speaks to is -- and this is the way other parties view it -- that Israel wants to maintain a presence in Gaza after this war, which is something going into these talks that even the U.S. was not comfortable with. So talks happening. But if that is the Israeli position, it's hard to see how they move forward towards an agreement.",

Listen, my team and I, we spent today up on Israels northern border where, every day, there is cross-border fire from Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Israel -- from Israel into southern Lebanon against him Hezbollah targets.There's been really a low-grade war there since October 7th. The concern is, if the talks fall apart, then that low-grade conflict on the northern border becomes hotter with perhaps Hezbollah exacting this revenge it's been talking about. And sitting in the background is Iran, which has publicly said it's going to seek revenge for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. They seem to be saying they're holding off for some time. Perhaps there's greater concern about Hezbollah striking in the near term. Regardless, the fear is, if the talks go nowhere, then the risk of that expansion of this war grows higher. And there's genuine concern about that in this country and also in Washington.",

Joining us now is the Harris-Walz campaign co-chair, Senator Chris Coons, of Delaware. Sir. Thank you so much for being with us. Give us a sense of what we're going to be hearing from the vice president tonight. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Thank you, Brianna. Thanks for the chance to be on. I'm sorry my voice is a little raspy. I did a lot of shouting last night as I got to hear from a governor, congressman, veteran and coach, Tim Walz, as he spoke, introducing himself to the broader nation. And tonight, I expect we're also going to hear an electrifying and upbeat speech from Vice President Kamala Harris. A review of her life story, of her record as an attorney general of the most populous state in the country, vice president serving alongside our beloved president, Joe Biden. And now nominee to be the next president of the United States. Excuse me. On the Democratic ticket, I think you'll hear about her vision for the future, her compassion for the middle-class, her concern about the proposals that have been made by her opponent, and her hope that coming out of this convention we'll have an energized, engaged Democratic Party nationwide.",

We are a polarized nation in a challenging time. And despite all the things that are happening in the country, Donald Trump still has more support than he has had at any other point.

RFK Jr has struggled to get on the ballot in many states to deliver a message that breaks through with any significant number of voters.There are folks who dislike vaccines or are vaccine deniers, or who share some of his issues and concerns, of course. He has a running mate who has poured a fair amount of her money into trying to make their campaign a successful national campaign. He's dropping out because that effort hasn't succeeded. And so, look, I think folks should pay some attention to some of the more extreme positions Robert F. Kennedy Jr has. One of them is that he said that he would act to deny a single penny of funding to any public school that requires vaccinations of any kind. I'll just remind you that, without a measles and mumps, vaccinations, we'd have widespread national pandemics of these childhood diseases that we're largely eliminated due to effective vaccines that you're required to take if you're going to go to a public school. So, look, RFK has got a whole bunch of different positions. His brain's all over the place. It's been hard to keep track of all of them. But his opposition to vaccination is one of them. And I don't think the science or public health bears that out.",

      "sentences": "This is a big case. This is one of the election cases that we've been following very closely.And here, the Supreme Court has said it will not revive citizenship requirements to vote in the presidential election in Arizona. There may be some citizenship requirements to vote in state and local elections. But as you know, voter I.D., this is an issue that Republicans have tried to keep front and center for a long time. And Arizona is one of seven states that is expected to decide the outcome of the November presidential election. And this case, if it had gone the other way, it could have potentially impacted the ability of tens of thousands, maybe as many as 40,000 people to vote in the presidential election. And, Boris, we're talking about a state that was decided by just over 10,000 votes in 2020. That's why the Republican National Committee made this emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. But this was an emergency appeal. This wasn't the usual kind of case where you have oral arguments and you get a lengthy decision. We just have this sort of short one-page decision. And one of the things that you see on here is an interesting alignment across the justices. Usually, there is a doctrine that they follow trying not to get involved in contentious disputes related to ballots too close to an election. But here, while this was presented to Justice Kagan, you see that Justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch would have just granted this request from the Republican National Committee. But Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Justice Barrett and Justice Jackson would have denied it in full. So there is clearly a split across the justices, three different ways of thinking about this, even though, historically, there has been a doctrine, often embraced by conservatives, not to get involved in these kinds of disputes. So this is one of several cases that could have an impact on the election we're watching very closely.",
