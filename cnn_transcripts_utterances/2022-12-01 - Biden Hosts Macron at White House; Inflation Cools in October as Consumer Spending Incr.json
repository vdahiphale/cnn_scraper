There will be a press conference in just a short while but there are no shortage of issues for the two leaders to discuss.This morning was certainly rich with symbolism, pomp and circumstance. Tonight will be very much the same, a glittering state dinner, the first of President Biden's time in office. This bilateral meeting behind closed doors is where very real, very significant substance will be discussed, much of it extraordinarily consequential, not just from a bilateral sense but also on a geopolitical sense. The two allies, two very long-standing allies, two leaders who have spoken quite often over the course of the last 1.5-2 years since President Biden has been in office are central in the West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are central to how President Biden is attempting to move the West in his direction when it comes to addressing China. Also very real issues as you noted, on the economic side of things. Macron has been very clear about his distaste and outright anger to some degree with some of the protectionist, as he calls them, policies President Biden has put in place. Over the top of all of that, sits the critical nature of the alliance. As president Biden laid out this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Macron heard me speak before about the inflection point, we stand at in history. BOLDUAN (voice-over): Let us jump in right now and listen to the President in the Oval Office with Emmanuel Macron. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is, for me, the best evidence of this, indeed, very long-term friendship and partnership. And this is exactly the basis of -- of our relation. We will discuss about a lot of topics but obviously, we -- we are together in challenging times globally and with the war in Ukraine launched by Russia. And so, obviously, it will be the first topic of discussion for both of us. And since the very beginning of this war, we worked very hard together in order to help Ukraine to resist and to be resilient and we will reinforce this -- this action. But what we want to do as well -- and I want really to pay tribute to a lot of statements you made -- we want to build peace. And sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time, a new architecture to be sure that we have a sustainable peace on the long run. And we are very much committed on -- on the -- on this issue. We will discuss about, as well, energy, economy, space, nuclear. And I spoke about this: we're in synchronization. And I think this is extremely important, precisely, to have close coordination between us on these different issues. Because we want to fix the direct and indirect consequences of the war on our economies and our people. But at the same time, we want to prepare for future generations a carbon-neutral economy, creating a lot of jobs, which means investing a lot in our economies. And we have to synchronize our action on this issue. And it will be an important topic of discussion. Beyond that, we will discuss climate change and biodiversity and the common actions in the -- in this field, health and a lot of global topics where our alliance is so critical. But let me, once again, thank you -- thank you and your wife for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday, for the friendship and, really, for the quality of the discussion we have together and the common actions and the common decisions we take in these so difficult times. Because I think when we look at our common history, this friendship always prevailed -- with quite good results, by the way.",

He is a veteran leader within that bloc. That is why he has become so invaluable. That is why the relationship, despite tensions from very early on in the administration to now, on an overarching basis, is so critical.The other, which really gets at one of those tensions that continues to exist is where President Macron was saying not just about how they need to remain aligned on Ukraine but also afterwards particularly as it pertains to the European economy, saying that they need to synchronize things when it comes to how they invest, how they create jobs. That is a not-so-subtle hint at the problems that he has been very clear about when it comes to the subsidies that the U.S. has put into place through one of President Biden's cornerstone pieces of legislation related to electric vehicles. It has been a major concern and one of the top agenda items at least in terms of areas where they very much so diverge. President Macron and his top aides, officials have said he is going to bring up during this trip.",

And Macron recently reelected; Biden coming off of the midterm in which his party performed better than expectations.And these are also two individuals who really kind of campaigned on and are rhetorically focused on this idea of restoring the kind of way things used to be, which is that America leads on the global stage and that they do it in partnership with Europe. And as Phil pointed out and as President Biden said, Macron thinks of himself as the leader in Europe. And so for the two of them to be here for the state dinner, it is really important for both countries to signal that this is a kind of dual relationship, a partnership, not just between France and the United States but between France and Europe. And in spite of all the other tensions that I am sure we will get into, that, the durability of that relationship is the most important factor that they want to emphasize coming out of this.",

And all the indications are that they are not. President Macron has been good at being an interlocutor with Putin. He has done so on the -- on the nuclear plant that has been under attack. He did so before the invasion. The fact of the matter is, he has been very influential with Putin. There is no indication that any of the things that he has warned Putin about, Putin listened to him. And on the negotiations, I think it is pretty much the same thing. Right now, both sides believe that they have the upper hand. And until one of them believes that that is not the case. [11:15:00] SANGER: I do not see a space for negotiation. President Zelenskyy is saying he is not giving up any territory. President Putin is saying he has annexed four provinces within Ukraine.

Normally this would be a bad number because this is how historically -- and it is actually three times hotter than what is considered healthy.But we obviously are not in normal times. When you look at where inflation has been over time, you can see that is actually cooling off. That trend is very encouraging and it is also raising hopes on Wall Street and Main Street that the Fed is going to be able to chill out these monster rate hikes that are raising foreign calls for all of us. And also raising recession fears. Now, concerns about the economy have led companies to start to cut jobs, a wave of layoffs in corporate America. AMC Networks, DoorDash, Kraken, all announced 1,000 or more job cuts. That is on top of tech layoffs from Amazon and Twitter and other companies. But when you look at where the jobs market really is, it still looks pretty solid. New numbers up today show that jobless claims actually fell in the last week. Yes, they have increased a bit in recent months, but they've remained relatively low. In fact, jobless claims are lower than a year ago. And exactly where they were three years ago before COVID-19.",

Curtis, we have been asking this question for months now, which is what is going on with the economy. And I was frankly excited when I read your words. You are putting words to all of this. The economy is slowing, the consumers are still spending. People say it feels bad. Inflation is bad. But their own situation is OK, at least right now. And you say this is called secondhand pessimism. CURTIS DUBAY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: It is a really unique circumstance. It's hard for economists to make heads or tails of what is going on. On the one hand you have any survey, whether consumers or businesses, and you will see, though, they will say things are bad and expected to stay bad for a while. But when it comes to actual activity, consumers are spending, earning more income. Recently had that data today. Both are up strongly above inflation. Businesses, the same thing. They say things are bad. Outlook is bad. But for their specific circumstances, they are hiring more workers, increasing wages and continuing to invest. That makes it really complex to figure out where we're going afford, especially when it comes to figuring out what the Fed will do. But for our current circumstance, it is good news.

They still do not have all the workers they need. So they are keeping their workers on, increasing wages and this delicate balance we're in right now is staying put. Which is that businesses can keep workers on because demand remains strong. As our people can continue to spend, because they have savings and their incomes are rising. So while inflation remained pretty high and a major, major problem, that we can continue on this for the time being. I do not want to overstate things.
