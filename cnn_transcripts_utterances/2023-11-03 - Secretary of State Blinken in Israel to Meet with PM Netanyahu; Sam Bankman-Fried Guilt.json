It is Friday, thank goodness. November 3rd. We really appreciate you being here. Five a.m. in Washington, 11 a.m. in Tel Aviv, where America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, right now meeting with the prime minister of Israel. Secretary of State Blinken is on the first top of the trip through the Middle East and Asia.

The Israeli Defense Forces say they've encircled Gaza City and are, quote, deepening operations there. Clashes between the IDF and Hezbollah have also been increasing that Israel's border with Lebanon. In just a few hours, Hezbollah 's leader is expected to speak about the Israel-Hamas war. CNN's Scott McLean is live for us in London. Scott, good morning, always good to see you. The Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be pressing Israel to take a greater care tool avoid civilian casualties, to try and ease suffering in Gaza. And to say, according to our reporting, that the clock is ticking on global support for Israel if they don't do those things. How do you expect this message to be received?",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kasie.Yeah, based on past statements that we've heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, probably not very well. Netanyahu is asked on Monday about civilian casualties, and he was very blunt in saying that Israel is already doing all that it can to protect civilians. And any blame ought to be passed on to Hamas for preventing them from being able to evacuate the areas where these military operations are taking place. But the reality is, even though the Israelis were talking weeks ago about creating possible safe spaces within Gaza, those still do not exist. While they've been telling people to move from the northern part of Gaza to the south and central parts, they continue to carry out bombing campaigns in those areas at as well. And the U.S. now, U.S. officials, White House, Pentagon, they are finding themselves straining to defend Israeli attempts to protect civilians. So now you have the Secretary of State Anthony Blinken saying that they will be discussing concrete steps that they can take in order to protect civilian lives. He says that as democracy, as a democracy, Israel has a responsibility to do that despite the fact that Hamas is using civilians as human shields. But yesterday, Blinken was pressed on whether or not Israel's exercising any restraint. He didn't answer directly. Two weeks ago, he was asked whether he thinks that Israel is operating within international law, and he deflected that question as well. But he will be getting tough questions when he departs Israel on route to Jordan, because much of the Arab, much of the Middle Eastern world, look, they already see the West and the United States has been outraged by the rural terror attack that took place on Israeli soil, but not having the same level of outrage necessarily for the civilian death toll that you're seeing in Gaza. And the Emiratis, perhaps summarized it pretty well this morning by saying that, look, the temperature needs to be turned down here because this really risks spilling out into the wider region, and, of course, when that happens, extremists they can really take over and get their ideologies out. And that can keep us trapped in this cycle of violence, Kasie.",

It's difficult to really collect intelligence on and in Iran that gives us a really clear picture of how much influence they have and what they're doing. But I do think it's the case that the influence that Tehran has overHezbollah will play into Hezbollah's decision to directly escalate the conflict. But it's complex because there are some elements of Hezbollah that will act independently, and then there are elements of Hezbollah that does care what Tehran wants. But, you know, that notwithstanding, at the end of the day, Hezbollah is going to seek to survive to -- to blunt any attacks from Israel. So, at the end of the day, I won't think it really matters. I think what's really happening here with regard to calibrating and holding back as more to do from Hezbollah's perspective, has more to do with assessing Israel's response to the attack that happened on October 7th and to -- and assessing whether or not, how Israel is going about its operations. I think that we have repeatedly underestimated Hamas and Hezbollah and the coordination, the collaboration that's going on between these two. So I think one of the things you have to be mindful of here is that they could simply be watching Israel, watching Israel wear down as it takes this urban fight in Gaza and waiting for the opportunity to get more heavily involved in this conflict.",
