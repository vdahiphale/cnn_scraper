Have a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP) But that is the moment when rockets hit the village of Majdal Shams on Saturday, killing at least 12 people and leaving 29 others wounded.

We've seen for months now the exchange of fire between Iran-backed Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon and the Israeli military across the border. But this is, of course, an attack with a significant civilian death toll here. One Israeli military spokesperson describing this as the deadliest attack on civilians since October 7th. So, you can imagine that there are warnings now of a fierce and firm response from the Israeli military.As you mentioned, the Israeli prime minister is returning now following his trip to Washington, D.C., a few hours earlier than had previously been scheduled. He has also vowed fierce response. Has said Israel will not be silent in this matter. And we've already seen the Israeli military carrying out airstrikes across parts of Southern Lebanon overnight, but there are fears that there could be more of a response from the Israeli military, questions as to what this will be, whether this latest incident will be enough to trigger an all-out war, as we've heard warnings now for weeks, for months rather, around the potential for an all-out war, for an escalation between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. According to state media in Lebanon, the Lebanese government has condemned any attacks on civilians. It has called for a cessation of hostilities on both sides of the border. We've previously heard from the Lebanese government saying they do not want to see an all-out war with Israel -- between Israel and Lebanon. But again, these airstrikes have largely been coming from Hezbollah. And of course, it's important to note that Hezbollah has denied responsibility for this latest strike in the Golan Heights. They've said that they were not responsible. The Israeli military believes those rockets came from Southern Lebanon. They have accused Hezbollah. But again, this could certainly trigger a broader escalation. That is a huge concern, not only for those in Lebanon and Israel, but of course, more broadly in the region and internationally.",

If they were looking for escalation of this type, I don't think they'd be denying responsibility. The Iranian ambassador to Beirut also sent out a message earlier today on Twitter. And I think that indicates as well that the Iranians are not looking for escalation.So, I think that the Israelis will be looking at this and thinking, OK, we're going to respond. How are we going to respond? And how can we respond without a full-scale war breaking out? Because I don't think the Israelis want the full-scale war at present. I think that there are forces within the Israeli establishment that are certainly looking for that sort of war, but I think that at the moment the -- on balance there are more voices within the establishment, particularly within the security establishment than those that if full-scale were to break out, it would not be a repeat of what Israel is doing to Gaza. And the repercussions there. Of course, Gaza has been a complete catastrophe for the people of Gaza, more than 40,000 people, mostly civilians killed by the IDF and their strikes. But the response upon Israeli towns and cities and civilians has been quite minimal in comparison because Hamas simply doesn't have that capacity or capability. When we talk about a strike on Lebanon going beyond what's taken place so far, the risk of Hezbollah responding in kind or escalating on Israeli towns and cities, they have far more in terms of people, but also in terms of weaponry. And I think the Israelis know that. I think that it would be catastrophic for the Israelis, as well as, of course, for Lebanon and the Lebanese.",

The atmosphere there will be incredible this morning. It's also worth keeping an eye on the U.S. women's national football team. They're back in action as they look to reclaim Olympic gold after their 3-nil win over Zambia in their opening game later on Sunday. It's a tougher test, I think it's fair to say, against the 2016 champions, Germany. They know a win will secure a quarter final place. Anf that, I hate to tell you, Kim, is something that will feel a very long way off for Canada as things stand. They were handed a six-point deduction yesterday as punishment for that drone spy gate scandal, from flying drones to spy on their rivals.

You almost retired. You missed the last Olympics. Sarah, what was it like seeing one of your best friends go through that?",

But seeing Kassidy struggle with her shoulder through the last Olympic trials, it was truly heartbreaking. You don't want to see anyone go through that type of injury, that type of pain, especially in sports.So, seeing her go through that was hard, but she pushed through it and continued fighting. And now, we're standing here at this Olympic Games, my first Olympic Games, and our first Olympic medal. So, proud of her for pushing through it. I couldn't be more proud of her.",

Australia's reigning Olympic champ, Ariarne Titmus, won the women's 400-meter freestyle beating out American Olympic record holder Katie Ledecky. She took home bronze while Canadian Summer McIntosh grabbed silver.Sports Analyst Christine Brennan joins us now from Paris and she's also a sports columnist with USA Today. Good to see you again. So, Team USA got its first gold medal in the pool. It was on the men's side. You've been pool side. So, take us through what happened.",

They had a great world championships last year and they have just been riding that wave, so to speak, into these Olympic Games. And they got two gold medals. Their women's 4x100 freestyle relay. U.S. was second in that. So, that was a nice result for the U.S. China, third.And of course, the race, right? They call it the race of the century until there's another race of the century later this week. But it's great to see that a woman's race would get that kind of attention. The 400 freestyle, Katie Ledecky, Ariarne Titmus, as you mentioned from Australia, Summer McIntosh from Canada. You know what it is? Kim, it's really past, present, and future of women's swimming. Now, to say Katie Ledecky is past is not quite right, but she is 27. And she's now has 11 Olympic medals, an extraordinary medal haul in four Olympic games. She won that 400 in Rio. Remember when people -- I'm sure, remember, when there were pictures of the pool and Katie Ledecky and no one else was in the pool because they weren't in the picture. You know, they were down at the other end, like she was so far ahead. That was in Rio eight years ago. And then, three years ago in Tokyo, Titmus, who is 23, four years younger than Katie, Titmus won the gold. Katie came in second. This time, Titmus Gold, 17-year-old Canadian Summer Macintosh, a real rising star, came in second. And then, Katie Ledecky, the bronze, which was expected. That is not a surprise. This was not the race that Katie was expected to win. But what a great moment for Australia. And for Ariarne Titmus, who has become a very worthy rival. And of course, dear friend of Katie Ledecky.",

Anytime a French swimmer is swimming, the place -- they tear down the place, the noise is incredible, which is great to see. And Leon Marchand, who will be starting today for the 400 IM, he, of course, is a superstar in France. A lot of pressure, the weight of the world on his shoulders.You know, China is a big story for all the wrong reasons. The doping, the 11 Israeli -- 11 Chinese athletes, excuse me, who are -- were -- their drug tests, their positive drug tests were hidden back in 2021, 11 of them are still here competing. So, that's a big story as well. And, you know, I think what's happened now is there's much more equity and equality across the nations. It's not just the U.S., it's not just Australia, it's certainly in the old days the East Germans who also were doping and cheating, you know, other countries that have been so dominant. Now, you can see and if anyone kind of rise up, and that's wonderful. Many of them, by the way go to U.S. colleges and play and swim in the NCAAs, and then, go back, of course, understandably, to their home nation and win medals. So, it's wonderful to see it kind of spread across the board at this point and all of the opportunities for so many nations to win a medal or two and swimming.",
