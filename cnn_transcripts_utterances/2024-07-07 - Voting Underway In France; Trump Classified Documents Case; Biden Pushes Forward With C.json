      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM.Voters in France head to the polls. The fate of the country's parliament and the direction of the country is on the ballot. Donald Trump's delay tactics may be working yet again. The latest on the former president's classified documents case. And NASA ends its experiment to test humans in Mars-like conditions. We'll hear from the scientists who reemerged after a year in isolation. We begin in France, where voting is underway in the second and decisive round of snap parliamentary elections. Polling places opened in hundreds of constituencies across the country a little while ago. More than 49 million people are eligible to vote. The first round of balloting last Sunday resulted in huge gains by the far right National Rally party, spearheaded by its figurehead Marine Le Pen. They led with one third of the vote. Now, it was a dramatic blow to President Emmanuel Macron, who's been gambling on stopping a surge to the right. His centrist alliance slumped to a dismal third place behind the left wing new Popular Front coalition. Macron called the high stakes vote last month after the right's strong performance in European Parliament elections. Hundreds of candidates have dropped out of today's race to avoid splitting the vote, thereby blocking the far right party from winning. And joining me now from Paris is Jean Lesieur, former editorial director with the French news channel France 24. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, after the first round, there is still some 87 percent of seats to be decided. So, explain to us the so-called cordon sanitaire, the Republican wall, that strategy some of the parties will use to stop the far right from winning seats. JEAN LESIEUR, FORMER EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, FRANCE 24: Good morning. Well, this cordon sanitaire, as you call it, is a kind of unholy alliance between very diverse left wing groups going from a center left moderate groups to an extreme far left quasi Trotskyite group interested more in the revolution than in actually managing the country. And they have united to make sure, in their view, that the national rally does not get the absolute majority in parliament tonight.",

At the same time, there has been no major demonstration of any kind. This will or might very well change as early as tonight. There are already calls for demonstrations right in front of the Assembly National, which is our own capital building. And the left, I mean, some antifa, very extreme leftist people, have called for a demonstration to protest what they call the racist far right extremist, right wing National Rally.And actually the minister of the interior has called on 30,000 cops to be present in Paris' and major cities streets tonight. Because what if the outcome of the election is that the National Rally has a majority but not the majority that will be enough to govern, they might be angry because their point is we are the majority party in France. We deserve and France needs and France has chosen to have a prime minister from our ranks. But Macron, of course, will not call a prime minister from the right wing, National Rally, if he doesn't have to. And the only way he will have to appoint Mr. Bardella as prime minister is if the National Rally has the absolute majority tonight, which polls seem to say is not likely to happen.",

He's digging in despite a small but growing number of Democratic lawmakers coming out to ask him to lead the race. So, where do you think things stand right now?

So they have something to gain by calling out Biden in this moment. On the reverse side, we've seen most elected Democrats actually closing ranks around Biden, certainly leadership, Hakeem Jeffries, Jim Clyburn, even former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, continuing to support the president and push for his moving forward in this race.Certainly he had an interview just yesterday on ABC News. It went better than the debate itself. Though certainly it was, he still had that raspy voice. He, at times his sentences seemed to trail off into no specific direction, and yet at the same time he was able to deliver a message and looked a little bit more energized than he did in that debate, all of that saying that he can still win this. Polling just coming out today shows that he's narrowing that gap with Trump.

So, certainly, there is a whole media frenzy around this issue and it's selling newspapers.So, people are talking about it. And at the same time, we continue to see him closing some of those gaps within the polling.

I mean, I think if she were to launch some sort of coup against him, it would need to be led by her, but we don't see any clear indication of that at this point in time.And let's go back. History can tell us a few things about what might happen if Biden were to step down, or if Kamala Harris were to try and make a play for this at the convention. Back in 1968, of which 2024 has been compared to 1968, many, many times, given that at that time, the student protest against the Vietnam War, we've seen similar types of protests against the genocide in Palestine this year on college campuses. And at that point in time, Lyndon B. Johnson had stepped back from running for a second term, opening the pathway to Hubert Humphrey. It didn't end well. The convention ended in chaos. And, ultimately, Humphrey was not able to pull out a win against Richard Nixon. So, having Kamala Harris move forward, while it could be historic and very exciting to see the first female president, the first person of color take over the White House, at the same time, it's an incredibly risky move. We are just months away from the election. And let's not forget, Kamala Harris comes from California. The, while it's my home state, it's a place that many places throughout the nation just simply don't like.",

One of the interesting things that we were looking at was the voter turnout in this runoff vote. It was around 50 percent, which is a lot better than the first round of voting, where it was below 40 percent, but still quite low by Iranian standards.And one of the interesting things about that is that, normally, when the turnout is low, the conservatives tend to do very well, but in this case, it was the moderate Pezeshkian who won the runoff and is now the president elect of Iran. Now, Pezeshkian has said that he wants better relations with countries in the region, in the greater Middle East, but also better relations with the west. Now, in order to do that, of course, he not only has to negotiate with countries in the region and in the west but also, of course, within the political apparatus of the Islamic Republic. Anything that happens in Iran, needs the blessing of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. And then, of course, also the military plays a very big role as well, especially the elite IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. So, it could be quite an uphill battle for Masoud Pezeshkian. Nevertheless, the voters appear to have told their elected officials that they want the economic situation in Iran to improve and they believe that the main way to do that is to try and get some of those crippling sanctions against Iran's economy lifted.

No one has accepted or denied responsibility for the killings.Our crew filmed the shocking scenes, like here, left of your screen, a man running away is shot in the back with a tear gas canister at close range. These protesters, standing over a man who's apparently dead, police fire a non-lethal round directly at them. Nairobi's police chief, seen here, commanded the operation, his officers clearly contravening their own rules for the use of force. CNN analyzed the deadliest two hours when most of the protesters are believed to have been killed. Keep an eye on the man in white overalls waving his arms earlier in the day. 25-year-old Erickson Chalamutisia (ph) was supposed to be at the butcher's shop where he worked, his mother said, but ended up here. CNN's camera captured him dancing until shots ring out. Police advance towards the protesters. More shots and people run away. Amid the chaos, we spot Erickson again. He is lifeless on the sidewalk. Around him, other protesters are also on the ground. As the smoke lifts, one man has been shot in the head. People rush to help, but police keep firing at them. A bag is thrown in the air as the smoke grenade goes off, but that protester escaped. We were on the scene as this unfolded. There are three bodies lying on the ground. After we heard live ammunition coming from Parliament, a police truck is on fire and the protesters appear to be pushing the police, overwhelming them, getting closer to Parliament. Unknown to us at the time, Erickson's body was being carried away behind me, his white overalls soaked in blood. We obtained his autopsy report. Erickson was shot in the back and bled to death. Moments later, another injured protester is carried away, but he is lucky he survived. That protester is 26-year-old Ian Keya, who was also hit in the back.",

Well, the short answer would be no, because five minutes later, Bukayo Saka, who shows all his class, wonderful finish there, right into the corner, beautifully placed into the net for 1-1, This much going to extra time then penalties.
