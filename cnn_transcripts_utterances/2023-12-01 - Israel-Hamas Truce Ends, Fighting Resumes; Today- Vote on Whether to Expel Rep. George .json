And we do begin with breaking news this morning.The truce between Israel and Hamas is over. Once again, explosions are rocking Gaza, and giant plumes of smoke are rising over that skyline. The fighting started just minutes after the seven-day truce expired at midnight, Eastern Time. Israel accused Hamas of breaking the deal by firing a rocket. The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza says today's strikes have already killed at least 32 people. And this is the aftermath of a strike in Southern Gaza this morning.",

The stakes could not be higher. What about the remaining hostages? Israel says 137 hostages are stillbelieved to be in Gaza. A senior U.S. official says before the truce fell apart in the final hours last night, Hamas was claiming it did not have any more women or children hostages to exchange. Israel says that's not true at all. The same official tells me Hamas didn't even submit a list of hostages for potential release last night. So, what happens to the civilians in Gaza? The Biden administration is pressuring Israel to help protect Palestinians. The secretary of state on the ground yesterday talking about exactly that. CNN's Oren Liebermann starts us off this morning, live in Tel Aviv. Oren, the IDF is already dropping leaflets in Southern Gaza. What do we know about the scale of the combat operations that are under way right now?",

And that's exactly what happened right around 7 a.m. this morning.We have seen the skyline of Gaza. We have heard the strikes the IDF is carrying out in Gaza. So this war is very much back on as both Israel and Hamas had promised. We have seen Israel carrying out strikes in Southern Gaza. According to authorities there, that is where they said they would focus the second phase of their operation. According to health authorities in Gaza, at least 32 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the first hours of the resumption of fighting. Meanwhile, Israel has dropped leaflets in parts of Southern Gaza. Interestingly, those leaflets have a QR code that brings you to a map with Gaza broken up into very tiny parcels. It seems as if Israel is trying to evacuate these parcels in an attempt to avoid civilian casualties as the fighting resumes at pace. Worth noting that Secretary of State Antony Blinken was just here. He said Israel had to have a concrete plan to protect civilians before they launched the second phase of their operation. Well, that is now here. He also said Israel needed a plan for more humanitarian assistance, and yet, aid trucks outside of Gaza that have already been inspected by Israel, according to an eyewitness on the ground there, have not gone in since this morning. So Phil, it is very much a question of whether that humanitarian aid has now been cut off with the fighting resumed.",

The effort is still very much there.It's worth remembering that we got to the truce through negotiations in the middle of fighting. The real question: Why did they break down? Israel clearly believes there are enough women and children held by Hamas in Gaza to continue for at least a day longer. Hamas not clear that they agree with that sentiment. They blamed Israel for a breakdown in negotiations, saying they were ready to begin talks on the other groups: elderly women, as well as soldiers, women and men, to continue the truce and to release more of the hostages. They're looking for a bigger deal here. And that's what the international community is pushing for, as well. But with no list handed to Israel of women and children that could be released, the fighting has once again started. We'll see if possible and how long it might take to get to another point where there is another pause.",

So Israel is now dropping these leaflets on the Southern city in Gaza of Khan Yunis, which we should note, by the way, is located South of the line of Wadi Gaza that was driven (ph). That was before. where all the residents were told to evacuate from the North to the South. So, now they're dropping leaflets in Khan Yunis that say this is the fighting zone, evacuate immediately. What do you believe the IDF is about to do? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So Poppy, good morning. What we're seeing here are basically movements down to the South. So Khan Yunis is right about here. Excuse me, right down here. And what that does is it shows that they're trying to move everybody into this area. If you look at this map right here, this is the damage map that we've seen with the previous strikes, right in this area. And that's where most of the damage has occurred in the Northern part of Gaza. There's some damage also in the central part. But Khan Yunis as some -- and the area around Rafah, they've had minimal damage. But what they're trying to do is they're trying to move everybody into the Southern areas. And so, along this Salah al-Din route and the coastal road right here. Wadi Gaza is the dividing line. The Northern part is their military zone. At least, it has been up until now. Now they're moving into the Southern part. And we believe that they're going to try to have some areas right in here that are areas where they're going to bring the civilian population into them. But having said that, they're also going to be moving their military forces in this area. The IDF will be doing that probably as part of their next phase of operations.",

There are some, obviously, that are going to stay in the North, although it's extremely damaged.But in the South, they're expecting them to be there. And so what the Israelis are doing is basically called shaping operations. These shaping operations are designed to move people in certain directions. There are two types of people that the Israelis are worried about here. The refugees, the civilian population, but for them, more importantly from a military perspective, the Hamas fighters. And they believe that those fighters will be moving in these areas, as well, to blend into the civilian population and to try to avoid being struck by the Israelis.",

The main piece of leverage that the U.S. has is that Israel is using U.S. weapons and is going to Congress -- or the administration is going to Congress for an additional $14 billion in aid.And one of the debates under way in Congress right now is would there be conditions placed on that aid? And of course, something you write in the law could be a lot clunkier than something that the secretary of state can negotiate out with the Israelis. But if you just back this up over, say, the past seven weeks or so, we've gone from the president saying, I'm unambiguously behind Israel, to the president saying, Do not make the mistakes that we made, the excesses that we made after 9/11, to the secretary of state in his visit saying, there are far too many Palestinians being killed, to now the State Department saying, here are three specific conditions.

Certainly from the progressive wing of his own party, but not only from the progressive wing, to try to rein in what's going on here. Before the pauses took place, we were somewhere between 12,000 and 14,000 Palestinian dead, and we don't even know quite how accurate those -- those numbers are because most of them come from the health service that's run by -- by Hamas. But American officials I talked to think they're roughly in the ballpark correct. And the president recognized that the U.S. is in a very difficult spot if it is seen around the world and at home providing the weaponry for that kind of killing. The additional problem, Poppy, that they've run into is that, at the beginning of this operation, the Israelis asked everybody in the North to move to the South.

It is historic. We say historic a lot. It is historic, right, because you haven't -- you've seen charges brought, but you haven't, you know, seen that whole process carried through.

And that's in part because GOP leaders are not whipping this vote, which means formally counting the votes and seeing where members stand. In fact, I've had top Republicans reaching out to me, asking what my private whip count was. So this could be close today. Remember, expulsion is a really high bar. It takes two-thirds majority to succeed. That means they need around 80 Republicans assuming all Democrats back this effort. And meanwhile, there is a divide in the GOP. There are around a dozen -- dozens of Republicans, I should say, at this moment who say that that damning House Ethics Committee report is enough for them and that Santos, it's time for him to go. But there are plenty of Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise who say they are concerned about the idea of expelling a member who has yet to be convicted in the court of law. And privately, you know, they might not say this out load, but they are certainly thinking it. There is concern about reducing their already razor-thin majority. So there's a lot at stake here.

Hamas says it's behind a deadly shooting attack at a bus stop near Jerusalem that killed four people yesterday.

CNN senior international correspondent Ivan Watson is live for us in Beirut, Lebanon, where the terror group Hezbollah has been threatening to join the conflict. Ivan, that's where I want to start.

So, there was a 21-year-old Palestinian who was shot down yesterday -- shot dead by Israeli military Thursday morning around a prisoner release. And then, of course, Hamas claiming responsibility for a deadly attack on a bus station in Jerusalem that killed at least three people and wounded seven more.
