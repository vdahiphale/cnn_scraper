There are no words that can adequately express the sadness we feel, and we pray each day for them. We will continue to let the legal process unfold, and as a family we love and support our son and brother. We have fully cooperated with law enforcement agencies in an attempt to seek the truth and promote his presumption of innocence rather than judge unknown facts and maker erroneous assumptions. We respect privacy in this matter as our family and the families suffering loss can move forward through the legal process.\"And that arrest that happened on Friday in the early morning hours was at his family home. And the attorney tells me that his father actually answered the door. He was cooperative. Bryan came to the door. He was arrested by the Pennsylvania state police. The FBI was there, also, however, and he was at that point taken into custody. The next legal hearing will be tomorrow. It will be the extradition hearing.

And he had Bryan stand up, and everyone was like -- a few people were on his side because they wanted to keep their high grades and not have questions be cut out or whatever. But for the most part, it was like half of a 150-person class just asking him all these real critical questions and he would answer.

ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL):  If this is not a crime, I don't know what is. If a President can incite an insurrection and not be held accountable, then really, there is no limit to what a President can do or can't do. I think the Justice Department will do the right thing. I think he will be charged, and I frankly think he should be. If he is not guilty of a crime, then I frankly fear for the future of this country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think it's much more likely that there will be an indictment relative to those Mar-a-Lago documents, because that is so much more a straightforward case. And in fact, I think that AG Merrick Garland may have backed himself into a corner by appointing a Special Counsel in Jack Smith, and then charged with the responsibility of determining was the law broken? And can you prove it? And I think it's a pretty straightforward case, relative to the documents. But it's much more hazy, a much more difficult case relative to January 6th, and Don, if in fact, there is an indictment only for the documents, I think some people may be left saying, wait a minute, is that all there is? After all the time and all the expense and all the investigation, it is only those documents at Mar a Lag? Soon we shall find out. 2023 is going to be a very interesting year.",

SMERCONISHfrom, because from his perspective, having played the role that he played on the January 6th panel or commission, to look at the evidence and to say, wait a minute, this is what he caused, he was essentially the arsonist, the President who let the fire burn, and he is not going to get held accountable for that, I completely understand his concerns, but it is still not an ironclad slam dunk case.",

So, he'll go in already in a very diminished role. The only thing I feel confident in saying about tomorrow is that he is not going to get there on the first ballot because of the numbers that Harry Enten explained earlier in the program, the fact that he can lose four and at least five are already lined up against him, maybe as many as 14, as you say, Poppy. The other thought that I have is when you look at the five who are the never Kevin McCarthy's, you know the Matt Gaetz's, I can't imagine they will have a change of heart between now and tomorrow. And therefore that's what causes me to say, he is not going to get there on the first ballot, and it could go on for a while. And I don't think anybody knows how it ends, but you can't beat somebody with nobody. There has got to be the emergence of someone else, if it's not going to be Kevin McCarthy.",
