The death toll on the Palestinian side has surpassed 300 as Israel retaliates against Gaza.The IDF says its goal is to control all of the Gaza Strip and to, quote, \"kill all the terrorists in our territory,\" unquote.

There was an outbreak of gunfire just around the corner from here that we could hear a few minutes ago. There were intercepts of Iron Dome missiles shooting over our heads.More rockets coming out of Israel. So securing the area around Gaza where there is still a high intensity operation to confront militants that left Gaza yesterday or today and have gotten into Israel territory, that has to be part of an important precursor because you can't fully deploy battlefield troops, lots of tanks, lots of artillery, lots of armored personnel carrier, and bring in reservists, some others, that will be required for the type of response Prime Minister Netanyahu is talking about. And at the moment, we have seen a limited number of tanks, main battle tanks moved in the area along with a few Howitzers, but that is not going to make a military incursion. The political decisions are being made. The military has taken control again of this territory here which will then open it up for that big deployment that we expect if there is going to be a ground incursion -- Fareed.",

They've been deteriorating in part because there is a recognition on the Palestinian side that there is a very strong nationalist, very right of center, very security driven Israeli leadership. The leadership was focused principally on what was happening in the West Bank. We've seen incursions into Jenin, to go after gunmen there. That is bought the Israeli Defense Force a certain amount of success in those operations.They've captured and neutralized the personnel that they wanted to there. But at same time, a certain blind eye, if you will, seemed to be turned on Gaza. The fact that Hamas wasn't jumping to support those militants in the West Bank, in those separate areas, was sort of taken that they don't want to confront Israel at this time. Where what is emerging is that Hamas was very clearly plotting and planning this massive, significant, ground-breaking operation. And then internally of course Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have faced huge internal dissent from the changes that he wanted to make to the judiciary, for example. That has brought hundreds at times of thousands of Israelis out on the streets. So he's fought these domestic political distractions. The pressure internationally not to have high Palestinian casualties in the West Bank. At the same time as the big prize for him which is making a deal involving the United States and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations. That has been for him his golden prize if you will. And it does seem as if it's caused him, doesn't explain his intelligence services, but drops of the ball here, but it does appear to have caused him to divert some of his attention in this hugely pressure situation.",

Let me ask you to begin with about the magnitude of this intelligence and security failure because we are comparing it often to the Yom Kippur War but in some ways it strikes me as even greater. Yom Kippur War was a failure to see what was happening in foreign capitals. This is Gaza, this is a place that Israel occupied for decades.

What Hamas did was massacre in a dreadful manner against civilians, children, women, families.So when we are speaking about asymmetrical war between the state, the country and terrorist organization, it's not just, you know, something really technical.

We saw the division in our region in the last few years and even more that the vision is not between the Arab world and Israel, but it's between the moderate in the region, the more pragmatics, and the extremists. And the religious Islamist group in (INAUDIBLE) states like Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon. So it's different camps in a way in the region.And therefore for them, Hamas, they represent this kind of religious Islamist ideology of Muslim Brotherhood and others, for them it's not winning something. It's something that can have an impact within their own countries. And therefore it's clear that Hamas doesn't represent any Arab cause and any Palestinian cause. And speaking if I may also about the international community, I think that it's time to understand that when this kind of terrorist organization has a political branch and a military branch, it's the same and we see it with Hamas, with Hezbollah in Lebanon. They are abusing their political power. They are abusing their democratic rules to get more and more power, and to abuse it sometimes against others, against the Israel, to either the region or even against their own citizens. And this is what we see in Gaza and in Lebanon, and therefore when my expectation from the international community and really the support coming from the international community, and the United States and President Biden is touching and important. But let's also speak about the future. I think that it's time to recognize what we are facing, what is the meaning of Hamas and Hezbollah, these terrorist organizations that represent unsolvable religious conflict and not to legitimatize their political branch in the future as well.",

As a matter of fact I represent a democratic Palestinian movement called Palestinian National Initiative which is non-Fatah and non-Hamas. And we have -- of course I'm not affiliated with Hamas. But I think this situation that has evolved is a direct result of the continuation of the longest occupation in modern history.Israeli occupation of Palestinian land since 1967, this is 56 years of occupation, that has transformed into a system of apartheid. A much worse apartheid that what prevailed in South Africa. Yes, maybe Hamas did not recognize Israel, but the PLO did. And the Palestinian Authority did. What did they get? Nothing. Since 2013, the Israeli government would not even meet with Palestinians. And what you see today is a reaction to several things. First of all, settlers' terrorist attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank that has evicted already 20 communities in an act of ethnic cleansing. 248 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank including 40 children. Attacks on the holy sites, the Muslim and Christian holy sites, by Israeli extremists, as well as declaration of Netanyahu that he will liquidate the Palestinian rights and the Palestinian cause by normalization with Arab countries. And he dared even to go to the United Nations and carried in the United Nations a map of Israel which included the whole of the West Bank, all of Gaza, all of Jerusalem, as well as the Golan Heights. He declared the annexation of the occupied territories. So of course Palestinians turned to resistance because they see that this is the only way for them to get their rights. The question here is not about dehumanizing Palestinians as is happening and calling them terrorists, it's about asking the question. Why the United States supports Ukraine in fighting what they call occupation, while here they are supporting the occupier who continues to occupy us?",

And these checkpoints were there during the last 30 years.We are suffering from a wall that is built on our land. The whole West Bank has been divided in 224 small ghettos, separated from each other. And the settlers are everywhere attacking Palestinians. You speak about right-wing government in Israel, already Israel is a right-wing government. Israel is already having fascists in its government. Smotrich described himself as a fascist homophobe. And that man Smotrich who is also a settler said that Palestinians have one of three options only, either to immigrate, or accept a life of subjugation to Israelis or die. This is the Israeli minister of finance. Netanyahu never negated these statements. And both Smotrich and Bibi (ph) said that their plan is to annex the West Bank. Can we stop what's going on now? Yes, of course. All these Israelis who are now in Gaza can be released tomorrow, including everybody if there are civilians, also the civilians, even the generals of the Israeli army can be released if Israel also accepted to release our 5,300 Palestinian prisoners who are in Israeli jails. Including 1,260 Palestinians who are in jail without knowing why under the so-called administrative detention. They don't know why they are arrested. They are not charged. Their lawyers don't know why they are arrested and that is the life we have. Look, Fareed, we have lived all our lives under occupation. My father lived under occupation. My daughter is living under occupation. We want a time when we, the Palestinians, will be free. Hamas was not there 30 years ago or 40 years ago. But before that, we are all described as terrorists. Any Palestinian who struggles for his rights or for freedom is described as terrorist. And the question here, do we have the right to struggle for freedom? Do we have the right to struggle for real democracy? Do we have the right to have normal democratic elections which unfortunately Israel and the United States don't support? I think we are entitled to that. But the unfortunate thing if we struggle in a military force (ph) we are terrorists. If we struggle in an unviolent way we are described as violent. If we even resist with words we are described as provocateurs. If you support Palestinian and you are a foreigner, they describe you as anti-Semite. And if you are a Jewish person, and there are many of those, who support Palestinian cause, they call him self-hating Jew. This should end. It doesn't make sense. We should all have equal life. We should all have peace. We should all have justice and we should all live in dignity. The main way to achieve that is to end occupation, end the system's apartheid that I am sure no Jewish person can be proud of. Time has come for that and time has come for justice and freedom. If we achieve that, there will be no violence and nobody will be hurt.",
