My exclusive interview with the veteran who oversaw Walz when he retired. And the new pitch from D.A. Fani Willis. Fulton County, Georgia's D.A. pushes to keep her case against Donald Trump alive, and she says she's the one who should prosecute him. So before 2:00 this afternoon, you might have been asking yourself, is Trump M.I.A. from his own campaign? I mean, just one rally scheduled this week and Senator J.D. Vance on the trail more than the top of the ticket, all in time when Kamala Harris is blitzing critical swing states along with her running mate, Tim Walz. Well, today, some kind of alarm must have gone off inside of his head, and there he was. So, he tried to do what he often tries to do, and hijack the spotlight. He gathered reporters at Mar-a-Lago for a news conference, and naturally, they obliged. They're likely waiting to hear from a political candidate, talk about, well, politics. But instead of drilling in on policy and what he would do if he were to get back in the Oval Office, he went after Harris, personally and repeatedly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

His campaign, though, is trying to project a sense of optimism, claiming that Harris's rise is really just her getting back Biden voters who had soured on the president.Now, I'm not exactly sure why her getting more votes would be soothing to a campaign, but okay.

She should be giving interviews. She should be doing press conferences. I mean, I'm a member of the media, I'm a journalist, so you will never hear come out of my voice, you know, no, you should not do this. What the campaign, though, thinks is that this is a kind of maybe a bit of a lose for her. She doesn't want to face tough questions. She hasn't been terribly strong in one-on-one tough interviews in the past. And so right now she has momentum. And I think what they're thinking is, is this something that actually is going to benefit us?

I mean, the fact of the matter is that Donald Trump is the same person that he has been since 2015.When -- you know, when I was on Dr. Carson's campaign that he was during the entire presidency, he would get up there and do these type of press conferences. He's not going to get up there and talk policy. I don't think -- there may have been a handful of press conferences where he actually did that during his entire tenure. What he's doing, I think, is just drawing attention to the fact that, hey, you know, I'm here talking to the press, I recognize that the press plays a valuable role, and I'm going to try and grab the spotlight, like you said earlier, and take it away from Kamala Harris. The danger, I think, on Kamala Harris isn't so much that, you know, she isn't ready for the interviews, but the longer that she waits, the more important that first interview becomes. And if she doesn't knock it out of the park, if she doesn't exceed expectations, then I think there's some real problems there. Additionally, I think right now she's riding this huge wave of not only grassroots support and reinvigorating her base, but she has got a lot of the media on her side and kind of helping her along. Not that I'm saying that it's wrong, but at a certain point, the media does turn on you and they're like, wait a minute, why aren't you answering these questions? I think she's -- honestly, her campaign is afraid because she's going to have to justify switching from within 24 hours in people's minds. Her positions on fracking, her positions on defunding the police, her positions on the border, that is a real problem, and I think the longer she waits, it's going to become worse.",

And so, there is sort of this nostalgia of how the polls were a month ago. And now, the Donald Trump's campaign maintains that this is the Harris honeymoon and that once voters get a sense of who she is, it will sort of revert back to that Joe Biden era of polls. But certainly, it's frustrating for Donald Trump to be in this position when a month ago he was on more solid ground. GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Everything -- everything was there, you know, for them.

First off, which is he wanted to defeat the guy that beat him and show that he won, right? Secondly, I think him bringing up and tying the Harris to Biden, the policies there, that's a good approach.And also, it's speaking to the people that were upset that Biden dropped out. There's still that small group of voters on the Democratic Party that are like, wait a minute, we like Joe Biden because he was more moderate than Kamala. And so, he's speaking to them and then on air and what they're doing on the -- out in the states is actually addressing some of those issues of what -- what was bad about Biden policies. And then the next wave, I anticipate, is going to be -- it's going to be even worse under Kamala. To your point on the debates, I think -- I think Trump -- we all know how Trump -- Trump style is going to be on the debates. I worry -- if I'm a Democrat, I worry about you've got Kamala Harris who is now -- was not prepared to run for president. I'm not saying that she's not prepared to be president. I'm just saying not prepared to run for president. This is a snap election. The amount of intelligence that's going to have to -- not intelligence -- policy briefings that are going to have to go into preparing her for a debate is going to be pretty insane because she hasn't been part of that discussion for the most part. So, a debate for Trump in his mind and his advisers are probably thinking we can beat her on this because she's going to slip up, she's going to revert back to what she did during the primary in 2020, and talk about things that, wait a minute, that's not where the Democrat Party is today.",

In approximately February of 2005, my boss, my commander, colonel, and the command team, we scheduled a meeting at Camp Ripley, Minnesota for a meeting, getting everybody together so all the battalion sergeant majors, the battalion commanders, and the staff would get to see each other and kind of start the team building event in that concept there.

With me now, former D.A. in DeKalb County, Georgia, Gwen Keyes. Gwen, so glad you're here. I'm going to pick your brain on this issue because in Georgia, I want to begin. Back in March, a judge ruled that Fani Willis could stay on the case if Nathan Wade resigned. He did that. But then Trump's team appealed the ruling and the state court of appeals paused the case in June. Now, D.A. Willis is now arguing that the Trump team -- quote -- \"They were unable to provide evidence to even demonstrate a coherent theory of the conflict.\" How strong is D.A.
