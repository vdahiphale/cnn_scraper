There simply is no overstating what happened. In the entire history of this country and of the American presidency, not one president or former president has ever been tried or convicted of anything, let alone multiple felonies.Today, a jury of 12 New Yorkers supplied that dubious distinction. This is their verdict sheet, guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult film star made right before the 2016 election. Convicted with the 2024 election fast approaching, the 45th president of the United States, running to be the 47th. Now, back at the gilded skyscraper he built, that's him arriving back there where he once lived, worked, and sought out the headlines. Facing tonight headlines that no one with his title or self-image ever has.   In a moment, we'll talk with presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. But first, CNN Political Analyst and New York Times senior political correspondent Maggie Haberman who watched the verdict read from the courtroom. You've been there every day. You've been in that courtroom, in the courthouse. What was it like?",

Justice Merchan had indicated he was going to ask the jurors if they wanted to go home. Trump walked back into the courtroom in anticipation of that moment, in a great mood, one of the best moods we've seen him come in since this trial began.And Merchan was taking a while to come back. He said he was going to step off the bench. He was going to figure out what the jury wanted. It was taking so long, it was clear something was up. And when he came back, he said that the jurors had said they had reached a verdict and they needed another 30 minutes to finish filling out their paperwork. And then they came in, they filed past him. One juror appeared to look at him out of the corner of his eye. I'm fairly certain that's the juror who the Trump team had seen or Trump allies had thought was on Trump's side and kept channeling that. The counts were unanimous. The foreman stood up. He said guilty 34 times into a microphone. Trump was basically quiet. I've covered a lot of high-profile verdicts in the past or some high-profile verdicts, and usually there is some - there's a reaction. And there were caution not to react, but normally people can't help it. There was just silence. I think that everybody was stunned around Trump, including Trump himself.",

And that for all of the energy that we all spent on whether Todd Blanche dinged up Michael Cohen, and Michael Cohen definitely had a rough couple of days. But what didn't happen was Todd Blanche didn't get under his skin and didn't make him blow up, and Cohen was clearly well-prepped for that cross-examination and knew some of what to expect and was braced for it.

He let both sides have their say. And the jury spoke. You know, first the lawyers speak, then the experts in the media speak, and finally those 12 people speak. And while the jury system is never perfect, as no institution is, it's a hallmark of democracy. So I think that's the first thing that'll be written in the chapters of history later on. Then the question will be, how does the public receive this verdict? Is it going to be fractured like the country? Will there be many people who agree with President Trump, former President Trump, that it was rigged? How many of those people will there be? Will it make a difference that this verdict is there to those people that are undecided, those people that are independent? How will the citizens are going to write the next chapter of this story?

And yet he was able to persuade by doubling down a lot of people that the election was not lost. It led to January 6th. At that time, I thought that had made a difference and that everything would be changed.   So even as I say that now, that this is going to have a fundamentaleffect on people. I do feel, however, that I don't know that 71 percent of the people as a current poll say it won't matter that this verdict came in. I think when people look at it, they're going to wonder, something went on during this thing. Somehow the prosecution was able to make a story that had a beginning, a middle and an end that persuaded those jurors that something bad happened. And I wonder how many people are going to feel that as well and do we really want to have as somebody, as our leader, who sets an example that you cannot accept a loss, neither in 2016, a potential loss, and do something to change the rules of the game or in 2020 again. And somehow you just know that if you have a kid and they lose something, you want them to accept it with grace. And I don't suspect that's going to happen, but it's going to be up to us to make an educated understanding of what the jury system meant, just as we should have made.

I mean, the economy has difficulties, but we're still the best economy in the world right now. Unemployment is at a certain rate. People are feeling their daily lives moving along. We've begun to move away from COVID. It's going to be hard to make that understanding that we're in terrible shape and that the whole system, now it's not only the electoral system that's rigged, but now the jury system is rigged. At a certain level, people understand what democracy is. You know, when you waited for that decision, as I did, I felt that sense of emotional, visceral connection to what democracy means. It's sometimes an abstraction. It's the same thing you feel when you walk into the voting booth and you mark your opinion and you mark your vote and you realize millions of other people are doing the same thing. And that's going to determine whether we throw the characters out or we bring new ones in. And somehow I think democracy is going to be made to feel real.

That's why the sentence date is so long. A motion to dismiss post-conviction pre-sentence can be based on one of three things. One being newly discovered evidence, which certainly Todd Blanche doesn't have at this moment. Whether or not there was some inappropriate conduct by the jury, which presumably he doesn't have at this moment.

He'll appeal, and he's not going to admit to the conduct. So there's a whole sort of ball of wax that the judge considers. Among other things, you don't operate in a vacuum. The fact that he's under indictment in other places can be used. It - his conduct during the trial, the fact that he sustained almost a dozen contempt penalties, all those things come into play. But what Judge Merchan is going to have to do, as your judge guest knows, is tune out a lot of the noise the same way that he did during the trial, and look at this as he would look at any other case with the unique factors that attend this particular defendant and make the best call that he can.

Congressman, your reaction to this historic verdict? REP. JAMIE RASKIN, (D-MD): Well, I felt some relief and vindication for the rule of law. You know, I've been traveling around the country. I've been to 20 states now and so many people have said to me along the road, they just don't feel like the law can ever really catch up to the level of lawlessness that we've seen. And so, the jury system works in America. And a judge who follows the law scrupulously wherever it will lead for the state or for the defendant, that works. So that feels good. I felt also a certain sense of vindication. I got to tell you as a politician, because what we do in our business is we go to work and we try to make people's lives better. We try to make improvements in infrastructure or prescription drug prices are protecting the right to choose. And then we go out and we ask people for their votes. And the thing that's gotten to me about Donald Trump is he doesn't want to go through that process of really setting forth a program and asking people for his votes. Every time he's gotten in really serious trouble, it's been because he's tried to shake down the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to try to set up Joe Biden and lie about Joe Biden or, you know, here in this case, he wanted to pay hush money to keep something out of the news away from the voters, or he wanted to stage and incite an insurrection against the peaceful transfer of power. Those are all assaults on democratic norms and democratic processes. And I feel like today was a victory, at least, a minor victory, for the rule of law and also for democratic politics. And I guess the other thing that crossed my mind was how central women have been to bringing Donald Trump to justice. Stormy Daniels, in this case, E. Jean Carroll in the civil case where he was adjudicated a sexual assailant. And, of course, he has made such outrageous affronts to women and declared himself to be a violator of women's privacy and autonomy, and there's a little bit of poetic justice that it's come back to haunt him.",
