This one, very particular, had a lot of things saying you could die here, this could happen, this could happen, you could perish. How strong are those if someone decides, hey, you know what, we're going to sue you anyway?",

      "sentences": "You know what, we've all probably signed waivers and many of us have just in a very cursory review before even signing things. This would have been a more comprehensive given the gravitas and given the likelihood of potential risk in the depths the ocean.Now, a waiver can give you some protection as the company owner who is actually handing this out and requiring it to be signed. But there is no protection if there was gross negligence involved. If the person who was signing the waiver and the liability, either was misled in some meaningful way, they were not told about the potential risks or the risks that were apparent to the people who were in a position of power, i.e., the people who were navigating it, were not forthcoming about those risks or acted in spite of potential for grave, serious bodily harm, or even death. And so, you've got this concept of, \"Yes, you can sign your life rights away\". But in reality, there are limitations here in the United States about that. Now, what's complex about this, of course, is you're going to have competing different jurisdictions, you've got citizens of different country countries, you've got a departure from a different country as well. And so, the law is involving what it requires to hold someone liable for negligence in the U.K., for example, versus the United States are quite different. And then, Sara, to complicate it all, you've got what's called maritime law, which essentially law that governs the oceans. And so, there are some certain caveats that a company that operates a vessel could actually go to a federal court and ask them what limit whatever liability they might have to the current value of the actual vessel. Having been destroyed, that would be zero, which is very difficult to understand if you are the victims' families in this case.",

Is there more than potential civil liability here? Would there be any possibility that the agencies that would look at this, like the NTSB and others will say, look, there is some criminal culpability here as well? COATESAll of these factors will come into play. But sadly, for the families involved into the globe that's really been vested in entire investigation, a lot's going to require us to know first what caused the actual implosion.

And so, this is a message that is purported to come from Hunter Biden to a business partner in China that he's trying to get them to pay up. And so, here's what the message says in part, I am sitting here with my father. We would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. He goes on to suggest that there might be some grudges held by him, along with members of his family. And then he ends it saying, I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father.The importance of that is simply this, again, Joe Biden is not in office. He's not a government official at the time. But the president has repeatedly said that he never talked business with his son. Never talked -- never got involved with his son's business interests. And so, that's where potentially the conflict could be. The other issue here is that the agents say that they were not allowed to fully investigate this -- these messages. And, you know, they don't know whether Joe Biden actually was sitting next to Hunter Biden when that message was sent. So, there's so much questions that they believe were not fully answered as part of this investigation that they wish they could have gotten to the bottom of. Of course, Kate, you can bet that Republicans in Congress are going to spend a lot of time focusing on just that question in the months to come.",

Overnight, some success in sky, Ukraine claiming it has shot down 13 Russian missiles headed toward a military field, along with a reconnaissance UAV. But some Russian fired did get through. Three residents were killed near the front lines in Zaporizhzhia, and two more died after a Russian attack on Kherson.On the southern front, Ukrainian is claiming partial success there and they're also halting Russian advances in the east. Despite these positive gains, some western officials believe Ukraine's counteroffensive is having less success and is not meeting expectations on any front. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now. Nic, I imagine that the response from Ukrainian officials is not a happy one with people, you know, doing, sort of, the side driving. They're, sort of, talking about it, but we don't have troops there, they don't have troops there, and these guys have been fighting for more than a year. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN'S INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yes, and I think you're getting that senseless into Ukrainian officials today, for sure. There's this perception, you know, gap, you know. And I think Ukrainians feel good when they're shaping that perception, because actually before we heard from those western officials a couple of days ago, President Zelenskyy actually said, things were going slower than desired. Both he and the prime minister have spoken about it's not Hollywood, this is not a movie battle. This is a real battle. It's really hard. The Russians have real soldiers, real defenses, they've got a lot of soldiers, many trenches to get through if you want to make advances. And this was something I heard on the ground in Ukraine at the front line from soldiers there, from their commanders. And even in Kyiv, speaking to officials there and they were saying, you know, it's OK. We've got this support. We've got this help. But do they realize, do our supporters, our friends and allies realize that this is real war? How hard it is tonight. You know, and at that time, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, was saying, we've given Ukraine 1,500 -- 150 fighting vehicle, 230 tanks, 98 percent of what they need. And that language in Ukraine makes them feel that outside the perception is they've got what they need, get on with the job. And if you go back a month or so ago, they were saying, well, we need more time, more time. So, I think there's this perception gap and I heard it yesterday, as well, between Ukraine official at the recovered conference here in London. And he said, all these western leaders are slapping themselves in the back. They're saying, great. We've raised billions of dollars for Ukraine -- for Ukraine's recovery after the war. And he said, I'm going back to Ukraine tonight. And the war is still happening.",
