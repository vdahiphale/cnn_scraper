Wagner leader said that he agreed to that in order to avoid bloodshed.

And I don't think even people close to the Kremlin really have a firm answer because it was just Saturday morning that Vladimir Putin was making a televised address to the nation saying that this was a dire threat to the country, that he was comparing this to the 1917 Bolsheviks Revolution, and raising the specter of a possible civil war.So, one of the propagandists show on state television on Vladimir Soloviev. And on his program, Saturday night, you could see him almost physically wrestling with the discomfort of Wagner mercenaries who he had broadcast alongside, including Prigozhin himself who he had called heroes, who had brought Russia to the brink, as he put it, of a civil war. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR SOLOVIEV, RUSSIAN TELEVISION PRESENTER (through translator): The country was on the brink of tragedy. It was a very difficult day.

And so, for the short-term you did not have this potentially catastrophic scenario of thousands of mercenaries who had fought hard in the trenches of Ukraine, who have seen their comrades die, and whose ranks are supplemented by convicted criminals who have been recruited from Russian prisons. You did not see them going toe to toe against the Russian security forces.So, in the short-term something has been avoided here. But longer-term anybody with political ambition in Russia has just seen that a rival, potentially this -- Prigozhin could be described as a rival, could lead his men on a charge, a cannonball run up the highways almost to Moscow through a number of different provinces where the Russian authorities were left with fewer options than basically trying to cut off the highways or park trucks full of sand on the highways to try to block these advancing callings -- advancing columns of mercenaries. And to avoid that, the Kremlin struck a deal rather than follow up on the reputation that Putin has of completely eliminating any critics whatsoever. So, it's hard to see this in any way other than Putin lost credibility, his reputation as a strongman has been seriously dented. HOLMES:  Yes, yes. Indeed. Ivan, thanks as always. Ivan Watson there in Hong Kong. All right. Let's take a closer look at the role Belarus played in all of this. I'm joined by CNN's Salma Abdelaziz in London.

She joins me now from London. Thanks for doing so. Prigozhin wouldn't have done this for nothing, would he? The question is, what does he get in return for turning back and going to Belarus? What do you make of that deal? VERA MICHLIN-SHAPIR, LECTURER, WAR STUDIES, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: Good morning, Michael. I think that as -- that's been mentioned so far, there are too many enigmas here, (INAUDIBLE) wasn't an enigma enough. There are too many question marks about this deal. Most things we know about this deal are actually what we've been told by Peskov, by Putin's spokesman. And I think that if one thing we've learned in the past year and a half was that we don't trust what Peskov -- thing that I don't trust what Peskov is saying right now about this deal. And the biggest problem, for me, when I look at this deal is that what guarantees is Prigozhin getting? Because everything that's been said, and they're quite silent on the Wagner side. But on the Kremlin side, they're saying that the president guarantees -- the president. But what kind -- what underpins those guarantees? It's unclear. And so, if that doesn't make sense, that obviously -- then obviously, there are other things that are in play there. Now, one of the things we could consider is that actually Prigozhin wanted to leave Ukraine. He wanted to get himself out of this situation that is clearly not going in the right direction. And with a Ukrainian counteroffensive may go in a very sour way for the Russians. And so, he actually, in a way, could have wanted himself out of that situation. He wanted to get out of Ukraine, and now he has this way. At a very high price, but also, he gained some popularity and power on the way.",

How does he let the man who just launched an insurrection just carry on?MICHLIN-SHAPIR:  This is a very good question. I think that what we've seen yesterday, when in the morning, the president of Russia is saying that maybe heading towards a civil war, but civil war with whom supposedly, right? These are 25 -- according to Prigozhin, 25,000 armed men. Yes, they pose some kind of risk. But a severance, large severance -- well, at least a power, yes. A military power, as Russia claims to be, it shouldn't be too much of a threat. And this kind of mutiny, right? And in order for this to move from mutiny towards say, an insurgency, a civil war, then there needs to be some kind of popular support for the idea that -- for the ideas that Prigozhin was putting forward. And so, I think that although Putin is now kind of what the Kremlin is trying to show to the Russian population is that we stopped the bloodshed, and so we are still in control, yes? But I think everything the Kremlin was doing throughout the day yesterday showed immense weakness, specifically the fact that they thought that Prigozhin's ideas, that -- ideas, he called this march yesterday -- Prigozhin called this march, a march -- the justice march. He has this idea of, kind of, justice against the Kremlin, against the corrupt officials. That they would have some kind of hold within the Russian population. [02:15:00]",

Do you expect any sort of crack down in the Kremlin? What do you expect to happen in Moscow?MICHLIN-SHAPIR:  So, we see an immense level of weakness within the Kremlin with how things develop. The fact that they relied on Lukashenko is yet another sign that they didn't have the levers to kind of put Prigozhin back into his place within the Russian system. The thing is that the place that the Kremlin allowed Prigozhin to curve for himself was from the beginning very problematic which -- because from the beginning, actually, the fact that they allowed a paramilitary organization, a private military company that gets its money from the client states where it serves. So, for instance in Syria, in Libya, in Africa. So, it gets, kind of -- it has resources that are outside of the Russian MLD (ph). This was from the start a, kind of, forfaiting (ph) monopoly of use of force, forfaiting (ph) all sorts of levers that have over him. So, yes, they need to fix the system, absolutely. But how?

However, he was pretty important for Vladimir Putin as well.If you look at the beginnings, it really was pretty small at the start. He was in jail in the 1980s, in the Soviet Union, and started selling hot dogs in the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Now, it was there that he founded a catering company and became known as Putin's chef. And from there, things really went up for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He started a media company, which then turned into a media and propaganda empire, which, of course, the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election. Yevgeny Prigozhin was actually indicted for that in the United States. But then there was also the Wagner private military company. And I saw them and action, really at the beginning, when they were starting to go to places like Syria. And on the ground in Syria, their forces back then were pretty much doing base protection for the Russian military that was on the ground in Syria. But from there, things really did involve -- did evolve. They started getting involved in the oil business in Syria, then, of course, also things like gold and diamonds in African countries, and started training the forces of African countries as well. But it really wasn't until the war in Ukraine that Wagner turned into pretty much a full-on army with really heavy weapons. If you look at the battle in Bakhmut, for instance, some of the firepower that was unleashed there by the artillery, by the tanks that Wagner now had in its possession, that certainly seemed to be a very professional army. And it was now that Yevgeny Prigozhin seemed to be at the height of his power, but it appears as though he's gone one step too far. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier we spoke about that with our Russian Affairs Contributor, Jill Dougherty, and asked her how the Russian president is now viewed through the eyes of other world leaders. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is not good, I think, for any type of respect that the Chinese would have for the Russians. He must be in the basement at this point. It is more -- it's really a disaster.And so, it strengthens, you know, China. China comes out looking strong in most of this, and Russia looking very weak and disorganized, which it really is and chaotic. And then other countries, you know, might be looking at Putin let's say as a source of selling weapons. You know, North Korea, Iran, they too must be questioning, will Putin be in power, you know? They -- it's very unclear. So, I think it weakens him domestically, very weak and internationally. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We do know after an armed insurrection that lasted about a day and a half that Prigozhin is apparently no longer welcome in Russia. He did agree to leave for Belarus under a deal brokered by the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko. The Kremlin says, Prigozhin will not face criminal charges nor will the Wagner forces who marched towards Moscow. Now, earlier I discussed this with Robert English, a professor and director of Central European Studies at the University of Southern California. I asked him if Prigozhin still poses a threat to Putin even after calling off his uprising.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Putin won. But Prigozhin is, sort of, like a Caesar in exile, right? Someone who can still threaten from abroad. Someone who has enormous credibility as a military leader. Who has loyal troops, although he is separated from them for now. And someone whose anti-corruption, anti-elite. His anger at the, sort of, self- satisfied oligarchs in Moscow resonates very strongly. So, he could be a future threat as well.Again, I draw the analogy also with Julius Caesar, who came to power that way with his private army challenging the corrupt elite. And as roman history showed, generals sent into exile often came back to pose a second and maybe successful challenge.",

But it reminds us that there could be another Prigozhin. This is what's most concerning. We are all, maybe, excited to see that Putin's hold on power is shakier, and the state is more fragile than we thought.But we should also think as much about what would happen next. And it probably will be somebody like a Prigozhin or another, sort of, military leader who pretends for power. Not a liberal like an Alexei Navalny or these other liberal critics of Putin, but a populist from the right who appeals to the same anti-elite, anti-corrupt instincts, but has brutal dictatorial tendencies of their own.
