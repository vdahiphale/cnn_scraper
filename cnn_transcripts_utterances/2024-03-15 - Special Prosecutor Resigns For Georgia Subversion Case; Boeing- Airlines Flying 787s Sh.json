As you can see, markets pulled back this week as wholesaleinflation came in hot, and of course, investors looking ahead to next week's Fed meeting. Those are the markets and these are the main events. The election subversion case against Donald Trump will continue in Georgia with a new special prosecutor. Boeing is warning airlines to inspect their cockpit seats after reports suggests the issue who may have caused a mid-flight plunge on a recent LATAM flight. And Miami Beach is trying to break up with spring breakers  with a new curfew. Live from CNN headquarters, it is Friday, March 15th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And we do begin with developments out of Georgia. Prosecutor Nathan Wade has resigned from the election interference case against Donald Trump. The judge had ruled that District Attorney Fani Willis could only stay on in the case if he in fact was removed. Willis had a romantic relationship with Wade. The defense argues that she had benefited financially from hiring him. Now the judge said there wasn't sufficient evidence in fact, to actually prove that. He did say, however, that Willis showed a \"tremendous lapse in judgment.\" Ryan Young has been following all of this and joins us now. You know, this almost works like a split decision, right, not a clear win for either side. The judge, we just heard said some very harsh words for Willis, but she can stay on the case. What have you been doing though in terms of trying to gauge the reaction to this because people are playing it for their own political spin.",

In the classified documents trial, a Florida judge heard the defense argue why those charges should be dropped. The judge denied one of those arguments and said she will rule on the others soon. To New York now where prosecutors said they won't fight Trump's request to delay his hush money trial file up to 30 days, and that was after thousands of pages of new evidence were received. That case could be delayed, in fact, more than 30 days. And of course, there was today's decision that we were just discussing on Fani Willis. What does all of this mean? We know Trump wants to push the trials until after the election and here is why. Even among Republican primary voters, a small but significant portion say that would mean he would be unfit to serve if in fact he was convicted. CNN's senior legal analyst, and a busy guy, Elie Honig is with me as is Republican strategists since CNN commentator Shermichael Singleton. Thank you to you both. Elie, first to you, break down the impact of what we just heard about the Fani Willis situation in Georgia. Does it weaken it because it surely will delay it by a little bit.",

She will survive as the DA here, but she lost Nathan Wade, who was the lead prosecutor on the case. The language from the judge in this ruling is really unlike anything I've ever seen. He essentially says that there is the aura of dishonesty, I'm paraphrasing here. In the testimony that he received, he calls into question the ethics of the DA. He says that the public statements she made about this case have been unlawful. He suggests potentially having to put a gag order on her to prevent her from making further public statements. And this all boils down to the defendants, Donald Trump and his co- defendants were not able to make these specific level of showing they would have needed to justify her removal. But boy, it was darn close. So the DA lives on to fight another day. The case carries on. Let me just be clear about this. This case will not be tried before the 2024 election regardless of all this. The DA is asking for an August trial date. That's not a serious proposal. There is no way this case starts in August. And even if it did, it would not get done anywhere near before the election.",

I think Donald Trump's team would have liked to have seen Fani Willis removed. But if we think back just yesterday, they got news that this trial in Manhattan for the hush money payments, which looked all but certain to kick off ten days from now with jury selection. Now that one is likely going to be pushed back at least 30 days and maybe more. It is important to understand the reason why, because Donald Trump's legal team has finally obtained from the federal government, from the Justice Department a bunch of documents that appear to help Donald Trump's defense, that appear to undermine Michael Cohen, the star witness who the DA is building the case on. So I think there are two pieces of good news there for Donald Trump's team. If we go down to Florida to the classified documents case, Donald Trump's team did lose one of their motions to dismiss, which was expected. They have other motions pending, but it also looks like that one is going to have the trial date pushed back potentially until after the election. And then if we turn to the other federal case, Jack Smith's January 6th case, they got that one taken up by the Supreme Court. So that one is delayed until at least April when the Supreme Court will hear arguments and likely into June and July. So I think Donald Trump's chances of getting most or maybe all of these trials pushed till after the election have gone up this week.",

But let me put a word out there, a plea to all the pollsters: From now on, you have to specify which case you're talking about. Because I think a lot of people who are responding to that or thinking of the big ones, the January 6 case, the Mar-a-Lago case. I don't know that respondents are thinking about a hush money payment case from eight years ago to Stormy Daniels on a story that's already well-known and how many people, a conviction there is actually going to move.",

Now what you have to do if you're the Trump campaign is raise the level of doubt, if you will, in the minds of voters. To Elie's point, when you think about the hush money case out of New York and you talk to the average voter, they are not particularly concerned about that, Paula, in fact, they ask, but what about the January 6 case or what about the documents case? So maybe they'll even mentioned what's going on in Georgia because it has been all over the news. But the New York case is something that you rarely hear the average voter bring up unless it is someone who is really in tune to the politics. And so the ability to delay this as far and long as possible is a net gain to the former president because it gives him the ability to articulate his message, his visual, and some of those more kitchen table issues, the economy, immigration, foreign policy, which is something he wants to talk about versus some of these criminal trials.",

When voters should have the option to look at both candidates and judge and engage whether or not the person is making statements put forth the best policies to move the country forward. The Trump campaign, Paula, is very well aware of this data, which is why they want to continue to articulate this as political persecution.

      "sentences": "This is more of just an accident than anything else, and when you think about what has happened over thelast few months regarding Boeing airplanes, you can classify them into two buckets. There was a 737 Max 9 issue on the Alaska Airlines flight on January 5th where the door-plug came off violently and dangerously, a miracle that nobody was seriously hurt, that points to serious quality control issues and manufacturing issues at Boeing, systemic problems. Now, the other bucket is everything else. It is this LATAM 787 issue. It's the 777 with the wheel fell off in San Francisco. It's a 737 Max off the end of the runway a couple of weeks ago, and then a 777 leaving Sydney this week that had its tires smoking. This is really isolated incident like you mentioned, and it is so key to frame it that way. What Boeing is telling operators and airlines to do with 787s is to make sure that this key switch, which is on the back of the pilot seats, is inspected at the next possible opportunity, and that is significant because that combined with reporting at \"The Wall Street Journal\" really points to the fact that there was a new target for investigators. I tis all about this switch. Think about it like the powered seat switch in your car. It may move the seat fore and aft enough, pretty much does essentially the same thing in a 787, in this case, it is on the back of the seat. There's an L-shaped track that the seat follows when it is in a completely aft position, it makes it so the pilots don't have to step over the center console to get into the seat and fly the airplane. What likely happened here, according and go \"The Journal\" is that this seat erroneously got pushed all the way forward as a flight attendant was serving meals to the pilots and then that essentially ran the pilots into the control column, the wheel in front of the seat there that usually sits between their legs. And that means that the plane would have taken a bit of a nose dive there briefly. So what is really key now are the black boxes, the flight data recorder will show the position of the control column and if it matches the linear movement of that seat, and then also the cockpit voice recorder will really be able to capture with its incredibly sensitive microphones if there was any sort of struggle go with the seat. If anybody said, hey, wait, stop, stop, stop the seat keeps moving forward. That will be so key and that will enable investigators to really put together the whole picture here. It is really important to note, this investigation just at its very, very early stages and it is just beginning.",

There are more Airbuses flying right now in the world, by the way. The good news here for passengers is that aviation is incredibly safe, worldwide, especially commercial aviation and especially in the United States. To put this into context, the last time there was a fatality on board a commercial airliner in the US was back in 2018, that was sort of a freak incident where a fan blade came off of the engine on a Southwest Airlines 737 and killed a woman passenger seated nearby that fan blade. The last fatal commercial airplane crash in the US was back in 2009, the Colgan Air crash, and that led to some really significant reforms when it came to pilot training and the experience level required. So aviation since has a pretty sterling record, a gold standard really, and the good news here is that there has not really been many incidents spurred on by manufacturing issues. The one thing here though to note is that there have been issues time and time again at Boeing, most of them have not ended in a literal explosive way, like we saw with the Max 9. And now, Boeing describes it to me, like an iceberg. You see what's happening above the surface. They're doing these safety stand downs, they are really issuing these big edicts to workers to make sure they put every part in the proper place right now. But then there's the below the surface portion of the iceberg and they're really trying to rally every employee from the bottom all the way to the top around quality control.",

You know, these viral videos that we are seeing right now on social media of the $18.00 Big Macs, the $3.00 hashbrowns, it is certainly making -- it is taking an impact on McDonald's image. We start to see customers that are going to grocery stores more frequently than they are going to fast food restaurants because grocery prices, right now are a little bit lower. So McDonald's is going to have to go into its playbook, its famed marketing, advertising playbook to try to find ways to get customers back in stores. There you see a graphic food at home prices, grocery prices up, just one percent this year, dining out 4.5 percent more expensive.

And a popular spring break destinations is trying to break up with its visitors. Before that, though, these are the headlines this hour. Ukraine's president calls Friday's attack on Odesa a despicable act of cowardice. Ukrainian officials say Russian missile strikes killed at least 20 people and injured dozens of others. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the victims include rescuers and paramedics who were actually responding to the first strike when a second missile hit. Deadly and disastrous tornadoes tore through towns and across many midwestern states in the US, at least three people are confirmed dead following the storm in Western Ohio, and dozens of other people are hurt. The National Weather Service confirms major damage in both Ohio and Indiana. So, the Irish Prime Minister says he reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as he met with President Joe Biden at the White House. Leo Varadkar said that while the meeting was \"very substantive,\" he also made it clear that nobody likes to see American weapons used in the way that they are now. He said that Israel was no longer using them for self- defense. So Gaza has received its first shipment of humanitarian aid by sea since the start of the war. It has taken three days for the charity ship to arrive from Cyprus. It has now unloaded the equivalent of about one meal per person for a quarter of Gaza's population. Gaza doesn't have a port, so aid groups had to rush to build a jetty to allow the shipment to arrive. The hope is that it will be the first of many more but aid groups, of course, are stressing that they are not an alternative to deliveries by land. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem and has been following all of this. I mean, look, Jeremy, this is a good milestone for Gaza, but it certainly doesn't feel that way. It can't feel that way given the aid that has reached Northern Gaza though in the last few weeks, we put that together with perhaps more humanitarian corridors being opened up.

Now, we don't know whether those two are actually linked or if it is simply coincidence, but it is certainly interesting timing. And there has been a school of thought that a lot of the threats of going into Rafah have been an effort by the Israeli government to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a deal that would be more favorable to Israel's conditions. Now, we  do know that Hamas has now submitted its latest counterproposal. It does bring it slightly closer to the Israeli position, but enormous gaps still do indeed remain. The number of Palestinian prisoners that Hamas is demanding here is still significantly higher than what the Israeli government has been comfortable with up until now. So while there is some cautious optimism in the wake of this latest counterproposal, the very fact that there is at least movement here between the two sides and that Israel is going to send a delegation to Doha, Qatar next week to pursue these negotiations, it is a sign of cautious optimism, but at the same time also clear that those negotiations are going to be very tough as one Israeli official told us tonight.",

Now with a rapidly growing population, Africa needs to increase its food production. Many countries are turning to fish as an affordable food source. Now as of 2022, the continent caught seven million metric tons of fish a year. To maintain today's levels, it would need to catch 13 million tons per year by 2030. Now, among the nations turning to fish production is Zambia. The country is vying to become one of the largest producers of tilapia in Sub-Saharan Africa. CNN's Eleni Giokos has our story.

Now, a bill that could ban TikTok in the US breezed right through the House earlier this week bipartisan, that's not easy to do, but it could have a harder time getting through the Senate. The Senate's Commerce chair says she wants something more robust when it comes to privacy policy. The current bill would ban the app or force TikTok's owner ByteDance to actually sell its stake. Now potential buyers, as you can imagine, already lining up. The CEO of Activision Blizzard is reportedly interested on top of former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and for good reason. \"Financial Times\" reports TikTok raked in $16 billion of revenue in the United States alone last year. Sara Fischer is in Washington for us and you've been following this story so closely all week. Where are we especially I am a bit confused about what's going on in the Senate now. Is there a compromise here or do they just not want to pass this kind of a bill that the House just passed?",

One is that they can take up the exact same bill that the House did,or two, they could modify it, I think right now, they're in the process of understanding how many votes they could get with the current House bill in place or if not, would they need to modify it to sort of sway people who are on the fence? There are a lot of concerns amongst people in the Senate right now about this bill. Primarily, they understand that constituents are going to be very frustrated. You have folks on the left in particular saying, what impact would this have for voters in the 2024 election? So it is not a clear thing that this is absolutely going to pass the Senate. But if it does, were expecting that vote to come within the next few weeks. If it does, President Biden has said that he would sign this bill into law. After that, it would be only a matter of time when I assume that TikTok would sue to appeal it and block it from going in place, maybe asking for a temporary injunction to stop it while it is dealt with in the courts.",

And so even if the US government allows a sale, it is unclear whether or not ByteDance would let that happen and then let's say that there is a bidding war, think about who could actually bid on something like this? In the US regulatory environment, there is so much distrust on antitrust and competition. I don't think they would let Microsoft or Oracle or any of the big tech players really buy TikTok. So who is left? A smaller company couldn't afford it. You're talking about somewhere between eighty to a hundred billion dollars this asset costs. You could have a company we know, or group of investors come together. That's sort of what former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is trying to do, get a bunch of investors in on a bid.

I will tell you though. I just don't think any of this is going to come to that. Why? Number one, we have yet to find a smoking gun or really a significant proof of a national security threat that would make me feel as though this law has weighted in a lot of merit. It wouldn't come up against challenges in courts. So if it goes to court, you see how long his court cases take. It could take months, if not years, for this to get litigated out, and in the meantime more and more Americans are going to download the phone, they are going to set up businesses on TikTok, that it is going to become harder and harder to pull it away. Remember, the Trump administration tried to ban TikTok and at the time TikTok's business was so much smaller. We were talking about a sale of the US asset being like $50 billion, not eighty to a hundred. The longer this takes, the harder it becomes to really ban it and divorce it from the parent app.",

So that campaign ad that was released by the city of Miami Beach when viral and the city really made nosecret of the fact that they were going to implement a curfew at some point during the month of March.

They are even limiting the entrances to several beaches out here all in an effort to really discourage folks from coming out to Miami Beach during the month of March. What is interesting is that the city decided to enact a curfew before anything really happened. Last year, a state of emergency was declared out here and a curfew was implemented after back-to-back shootings ended with folks dying out here. But this time around the city said, in anticipation of these large crowds, they were going to go ahead and do this. As for how it is going to work, that curfew goes into effect tonight at midnight and it will be in effect until Monday from midnight until six in the morning. There's also going to be a number of other restrictions including the limiting of alcohol sales after a six o'clock. No doubt, Paula, city officials out here are just trying to really do everything possible to avoid a large crowds of folks gathering in a relatively small space when you consider that Miami Beach is an island and it is quite small.
