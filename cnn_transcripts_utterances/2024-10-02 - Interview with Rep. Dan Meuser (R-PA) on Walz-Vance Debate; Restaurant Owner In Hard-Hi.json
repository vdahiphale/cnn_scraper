      "sentences": "Here in minutes, we are expecting President Biden to take an aerial tour of the Carolinas to see firsthand the destruction from the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina back in 2005.Helene has now killed at least 180 people across six states in the southeast. A seventh state, West Virginia, declared a state of emergency just yesterday because of damage from the remnants of Helene. Now Biden is deploying 1,000 active-duty soldiers to help in hard-hit North Carolina. And you can see here that help is so dearly needed. Search and Rescue is still underway around the area of Asheville as teams are still reaching cutoff areas. Many people are still missing now, even after days. Helene tore up hundreds of roads. And the regional power company says it wiped away chunks of the power grid. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in the southeast still without electricity. With me now is Katie Button. She owns the restaurants Curate and La Bodega in Asheville, familiar I think to many foodies who have been to the city. And, Katie, tell us, I know you're partnering now with World Central Kitchen. Can you tell us what you're doing, but also about the challenges that you're facing with water and doing that? KATIE BUTTON, OWNER, CURATE &amp; LA BODEGA RESTAURANTS IN NC AFTER HELENE: Absolutely, yes. So World Central Kitchen is just an incredible organization. On Sunday, they we're reaching out to us. They we're already sending people down here to start setting up kitchens to cook for -- to cook meals for the community. Sunday afternoon, we started prepping meals for the community. We're -- we're able to do it because World Central Kitchen is trucking water in for us to be able to use. They are just logistics geniuses. And they act fast. So we have personally prepared at 20 of our restaurants, 2,400 meals so far. It'll be 3,000 by the end of today. And we started on Sunday. And we'll do at least 1,000 meals every day. And then they have other satellite kitchens that are also producing meals for the community. And then they helicopter those meals to people who are completely cut off from road access. There's so many challenges.",

And it was -- it was incredibly scary for those couple of days. The road to recovery though is incredibly long. And I worry for them as well and all the businesses and Asheville. Some restaurants, businesses, homes, completely wiped away either by flooding or trees. And we we're fortunate we had power, which is why we can produce meals here for the community and also our staff. But I think it's going to be weeks before we have water, running water in Asheville, in the area of Asheville. Which I can't even imagine how we're going to make weeks without running water.",

      "sentences": "There's a big question about safety here, and we'll get to that.But it's really the shortage of air-traffic controllers that has the FAA making this really big policy shift. You've probably been caught in the middle of this issue, just you might not really know it. The FAA's shortage of 3,000 air-traffic controllers has triggered flight delays and cancellations. But it's also burning out controllers with some working mandatory six- day weeks of 12-hour shifts. That is the safety issue since fatigue has been a factor in some of those recent cases of near collisions on runways of major airports. So this new announcement is a huge about-face from the FAA, which, for years, demanded that air-traffic controller candidates go through the FAAs training academy in Oklahoma City. That has been severely backlogged since the start of the pandemic. So now the FAA says grads from two universities can bypass the FAA's own training program. They are the University of Oklahoma and Tulsa Community College. New hires who graduate from those programs can now begin work as air- traffic controllers nearly immediately. You might say, Pete, those two universities don't really sound like all that much. But the FAA says this is just the start. The goal here is to expand this program to deal with a shortage that's really not getting all that much better. Last month, the FAA says it hired 1,800 controllers this year, a big dent in that 3,000-controller shortage. But the increase after retirements and attrition is really the most important number. In May, we reported that the FAA has netted only 160 controllers overall. The good news is that the FAA is about to open its hiring window again next Friday. And the median pay, according to federal data, is $137,000. Pretty good scratch if you can get it. Never a been a better time to get into an aviation career. There's a lot more out there than just being a pilot. And gamers are especially good at this. So if you know a young person who's really good at Xbox or PS5, get them off the couch and get them to FAA.gov to try and get hired for one of these jobs.",
