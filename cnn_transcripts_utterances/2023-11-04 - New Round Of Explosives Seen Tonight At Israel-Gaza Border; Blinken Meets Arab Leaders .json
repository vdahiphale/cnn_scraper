Tonight, we've been watching multiple images of multiple explosions of lighting up the night sky around Gaza City. CNN's Nic Robertson in Sderot, Israel, witnessed some big secondary explosions and a huge fire in Gaza. Nic and his crew also witnessed eight rockets being fired from Gaza. In Israel, the IDF tells CNN that six of the eight rockets were intercepted by that country's Iron Dome defense system. Israeli Police say there are no reports of casualties that they can pass along at this moment.Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken has wrapped up his meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan. He is now heading to Turkey. Blinken stressed support for Israel to implement what's been called humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza that is far short of the ceasefire wanted by Arab countries and international aid agencies. Minutes ago, Israel's Military said it would allow a window tomorrow for civilians in Gaza to move to the south. Let's begin this hour in Israel. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Tel Aviv. Ed, what can you tell us about this latest round of rockets being fired from Gaza? What's the latest on your end?",

      "sentences": "Well, another tense and excruciating night of war here inside of Gaza. Earlier tonight, just several hours ago, our Nic Robertson reporting to us that some eight rockets were launched toward Israel from inside of Gaza. And the Israeli Defense Force says that the Iron Dome protection system was used, activated and used to shoot down about six of those eight missiles. There were no reports that we know so far of any casualties on the ground here in Israel from the two that presumably landed somewhere. Many of those rockets. Jim, according to what we've been able to see is, were targeted and directed and struck down over the area just south of Tel Aviv. So, quite a distance away from Gaza.But, all of this unfolding as Israeli Defense Forces continue fighting inside of Gaza. They say they're trying to dismantle that tunnel system which is basically the home and where Hamas fighters are operating from. But, we've also seen excruciating images of some of the airstrikes that have been ongoing for the last several hours inside of Gaza, and try to get a sense of just the scope of the magnitude of the attacks. And there has been a great deal of criticism as we all well know of the way Israel forces have been carrying out some of these attacks, and the toll that it is taking on civilian populations. Earlier today, just several hours before this latest round of fighting that we've been able to document, here in Tel Aviv there was a large protest, hundreds of supporters and family members of the 241 Israeli hostages that are still being held inside of Gaza. There was a rally outside of the Military's government building here in Tel Aviv where protesters had gathered. They were demanding that more be done from the Benjamin Netanyahu's government here in Israel to get those hostages released. It has been nearly a month since those 241 people have been in custody. Organizers of the event try to point out that this is not an anti-government protest, but more an effort to try to get the focus back on those 241 hostages that remain being held inside of Gaza.

This is something that he said the U.S. thought would be beneficial to Israel and to the wider region, and this is something that Benjamin Netanyahu came out and rejected. Almost immediately after their meeting, he said there would be no stop in fighting, whether it was temporary or a permanent ceasefire until Hamas releases those hostages.Now, Blinken sought to address some of the common grounds between he and his Arab partners here in Amman today. He said they are all focused on getting more humanitarian assistance into Gaza, and they want to see this regional conflict not spread. And this is, of course, a message he will be bringing to Turkey as he travels there in the coming days. Jim.",

You're seeing Tony Blinken trying I think his best from a diplomatic standpoint to get these two sides to get close to somewhere resembling middle ground, calling for these humanitarian pauses. Arab leaders in Jordan obviously wanted that ceasefire. Netanyahu is not going to do that right now. There is just no way. I was talking to one of his top advisors, Mark Regev, earlier today.

And you have to put yourself in their shoes for a second and say, hey, I have -- my people are being held hostage at this point in time. I want them back before I do anything. And so, from that standpoint, it's very understandable that the Israelis would have that position. Now, on the other hand, you have the situation with the Palestinian civilians in Gaza who absolutely desperately need a pause in the fighting. So, that middle ground that you talked about, that Secretary Blinken is trying to achieve, is really one in which there is a pause in the fighting, but Israel is allowed to achieve its goals.And it's very hard to really thread that needle because those seem like diametrically opposed interests in some ways. So, the Israelis want to move forward militarily. The U.S. has a vested interest along with the Arab nations in limiting the damage that has been done to the Palestinian civilians. So, it's a really, really tough and difficult situation from that standpoint.",
