Now, Israel is providing more evidence that it says proves Hamas was using Al-Shifa Hospital as a base of its terrorist operations. The IDF released a video that it says shows a hostage being taken into Al- Shifa through the main entrance. The video appears to be dated October 7. The IDF also provided video of Israeli soldiers investigating a tunnel at Al-Shifa. It's arguably the most compelling evidence thus far, though there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. CNN there hasn't been able to independently verify the contents of either of these videos.I want to bring in Clare who has been looking at them. They seem pretty convincing. Are they enough to convince the world of what the Israelis have been alleging?",

      "sentences": "They are very compelling. The tunnel video in particular, Max, is very compelling, although none of them are conclusive at this point. And I think if you listen to the IDF spokesperson, for example, who spoke to our Oren Liebermann, who was taken by the IDF to see this tunnel shaft by the Al-Shifa Hospital, they said things like we assume that this goes all the way into the hospital right now. They haven't gone all the way through that tunnel. There is still a blast proof door they say that they haven't opened because they believe it to be booby trapped.So, they're still investigating. They're still involved in this operation. But, it is compelling. You see as sort of evidence of a staircase or a ladder there. It is concrete lined, then goes into a sort of a long corridor. Looks clearly something that has been purposefully constructed there. This is clearly part of a major effort along with that CCTV video, Max, for Israel to show the world that it is, if not already there, on its way to meeting that very heavy burden of proof that is needed to show that the hospital has essentially lost its protected status under international law, because as Israel has long been claiming and Hamas has long been denying it is being used for military purposes.",

      "sentences": "Yes. This is an interesting one, because there is two different videos, right? There is one that shows an injured, purportedly a hostage that we only have the IDF's word for that, being taken in which I suppose there are some medical staff moving around, could potentially show complicity in -- from the medical staff at the hospital if they are helping bringing in hostages. The second one perhaps more compelling shows an uninjured hostage being, we don't know if it's hostage, purportedly hostage, being brought in and relatively roughly treated, which could suggest that, given this person was not injured, the hospital was being used for purposes by Hamas outside of medical purposes. Potentially risky to be putting out these videos. This is a delicate moment. We know that the hostage negotiations are progressing, and are getting closer than they ever have, according to a U.S. official to a deal. So, I think this shows potentially this could send a signal from Israel that they're still looking to rescue hostages by military means, not just negotiate their release. So, it is delicate, but it is also -- that shows this ongoing campaign by Israel to try to get the point across that this operation at the hospital is justified.",

Here is what U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor John finer told CNN's Jake Tapper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON FINER, DEPUTY U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We think that we are closer than we have been perhaps at any point since these negotiations began weeks ago, that there are areas of difference in disagreement that have been narrowed, if not closed out entirely, but that -- the mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed certainly applies here.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, and there really has been cautious optimism from administration officials here about the potential for a release of hostage. But, as you heard Jon Finer there, warning that there are still many details that need to be wrinkled out and fine-tuned here. But, the crux of this potential deal that CNN is learning about is that there is a draft of a proposal that would call for a four or a five-day pause in fighting in order for Hamas to release around 50 hostages. That is according to sources who are familiar with the talks. But, there have been many fits and starts throughout these negotiations that have been going on for weeks now.There are major concerns about some of the humanitarian aid that would be going into Gaza, and trying to figure out how many trucks of aid would be going, and how they would inspect these trucks, and how to ensure that that assistance would be going to civilians and not to Hamas fighters. Now, Israel sources, they say, it has about a list of about 100 hostages that they initially want to see released, but Hamas has indicated that they would be OK with releasing closer to 50 hostages over that multi-day pause. There is also the possibility that there could be other pauses down the road to release other hostages as well. But, this is a very fluid and sensitive situation on the ground there, and in these negotiations. You have senior administration officials from the White House who have been working with counterparts like the Qataris who have really been the main go-between between Israel and Hamas in these talks. The U.S. is hopeful. President Biden himself telling reporters he wouldn't say exactly when he believes these hostages would get out that he wants to ensure that these negotiations can still go over smoothly. But, at the same time, as there could be a potential pause in fighting, President Biden himself has again resisted calls for a ceasefire. That is something that there has been a growing call for in the international community and among some here at home. The President saying that a ceasefire is not a road to peace that that would just give Hamas an ability to retool and rebuild their infrastructure, their supplies. But, the U.S. at this time is trying to press for this release of the hostages as this now conflict has been going on for weeks now.",

But, in this electoral campaign, he has received the decisive support of the former Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, who ruled the country between 2015 and 2019, and who allied himself with Milei to defeat the ruling power -- the ruling coalition, the center left.I think this election is really interesting, Max, because every election is local. And we know that Milei has been propelled to victory, because frankly the Argentinian economy is in total disarray. The country is battling the worst economic crisis over the last 20 years. Inflation is at over 140 percent. And so, the voters have clearly backed the new guy who has promised to, just like you said, tear the house down, and at the same time create a new economic model for the country. However, it's also an election that turns the tide against the some convincing victories that we have seen in Latin America for the central left, and the progressive, Chile, Brazil, Colombia have now have won -- the central left has won in these countries in the last few years. And now, you have Javier Milei, a clearly right-wing, extreme right- wing candidate convincingly winning in Argentina with a clear mandate. And of course that could turn the tide, not just in South America, but also in the rest of the continent. And we know that we have a very important election coming up next year where an ally of Milei, Trump, will be probably on the ballot. Max.",
