With less than 24 hours before polls open in the state, the race is a Trump-Haley match-up. A head-to-head, a face-to-face, all of the things, it's just the two of them now.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis abruptly bowed out of the race before the first votes were even cast there, and throwing his support behind Donald Trump. That means four former rivals have now endorsed Donald Trump. Does any of that matter to New Hampshire voters? CNN's Kristen Holmes is in Manchester, New Hampshire, for us.

Remember Donald Trump has always viewed New Hampshire as a two-person race. Even before Ron DeSantis dropped out, they viewed it as Trump versus Haley. And this doesn't really change this.DeSantis didn't have a ground game. They didn't expect he's going to get a lot of votes. But what does change is those endorsements that you mentioned. That now gives Trump this opportunity to say it is time for the party to rally around me. Look at my rivals. Somebody who I attacked relentlessly for a year, now he's backing me as well. Now the other thing to point out here is of course as you said Trump is in court today, again part of this campaign strategy, sucking all the oxygen out of the race a day before votes are cast in New Hampshire. And on the campaign trail he is talking about his legal issues. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And many presidents leave and there are things you can go after. And frankly to be honest, that's one of the reasons the Supreme Court is looking now at immunity. You have to have guaranteed immunity for a president. Otherwise a president is not going to be able to function. Tomorrow, I go to that, I do the court thing, then I come back and I make a speech tomorrow night, and hopefully that should wrap it up because we are so far ahead, it's incredible.

And this is the race that Nikki Haley has said time and time again that she wanted, and she's going to get it tomorrow when we go in, when we finally see these votes being cast in New Hampshire down to this two-person race. The fact is, if you look at the polling, our polling that just recently came out of New Hampshire, Ron DeSantis was just polling in very low single digits.So the idea that him getting out and his supporters going to one person or another, really probably isn't going to have a huge impact in this race. Haley advisers think they'll kind of split evenly. It's possible, you know, DeSantis was really in the end running pretty far to the right, even sometimes to the right of Trump on issues like abortion. So it's possible that a lot of his voters go to Trump. But as I said, Sara, there is just not -- he wasn't running in such big numbers that it will likely make a huge impact in this race. And it was really South Carolina that DeSantis and his team wanted to focus on. They wanted to go there, the original thought process being go there, try to beat Nikki Haley in her home state and get it to a two-person race with Trump. But that's simply just was not how things shook out in the end. Nikki Haley is now contending with what's going to happen in New Hampshire. And then she will look to her home state of South Carolina. And we've seen the former president now bringing out all of these endorsements from her home state. Tim Scott, also the current governor, Henry McMaster. Here's what she said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And then they said, but what do you say about the fact that the governor of South Carolina came to New Hampshire to campaign against you?

We will go there live to see how she kicks off this penultimate day of the New Hampshire campaign.In the meantime, we have a brand-new CNN poll which shows you where the race stood. This is where it was with Ron DeSantis still in. You can see Donald Trump led Nikki Haley by 11 points. If you take who Ron DeSantis voters picked as their second choice, you can see here without Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump's lead actually grows. It was 11 points with Ron DeSantis, 13 points without Ron DeSantis. Let's talk about where Nikki Haley is strong, though, and why she thinks she might have a chance there. It's among the undeclared voters in New Hampshire. Independents. They make up a huge percentage of people who will vote tomorrow. She has a big lead among them. You can see almost 30 points. Among voters with a college degree, she holds a significant lead, 12 points. But here's the rub. In our poll, we tried to figure out who would be voting tomorrow. And undeclared voters make up a big chuck of the electorate but registered Republicans a bigger chunk, 47-53. College grads, only 33 percent, non-college grads, 68 percent. And in these groups that have the majority, Donald Trump is just cleaning up. Among registered Republicans, he's got a 40-point lead in our poll. Among voters with no college degree, he's got a lead of about 20 points. That's why he's got this lead over Nikki Haley heading into election day. One thing to look for tomorrow. Look, Nikki Haley could still pull this out. But if Donald Trump does win, what's the margin? He's leading by 13 points head-to-head in our poll. That actually would put him up with some of the biggest margins in New Hampshire history. You can see in competitive primaries, Ronald Reagan, he was the only one by the way to get more than 50 percent. He won by 27 points. John McCain 18, Mitt Romney 16. Donald Trump himself almost won by 20 in 2016. So this might be a little bit of a measurement of success here. Does Trump do better or worse in terms of the margin over Nikki Haley tomorrow? If he does manage to win, just one thing to look for -- Kate.",

But there is a comfort level across the Republican Party as well as other voters in questioning people's fitness and age.And so she needs to go after him but up until even this final day or two ahead of the New Hampshire contest, she has still allowed effectively every Republican rival, including Nikki Haley, except, you know, Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, have allowed a permission structure for going ahead and nominating Trump and voting for Trump if Republicans ultimately decide they want to do that. So how much more will we see her ramp up her attacks? Or is it just really going to focus on his age and, you know, turning the page? We're going to see in the next day.

Nonetheless, he's been hired along with two other lawyers from the outside to come in and help the D.A.Nothing wrong with that. But if you look at the amount of money they've been paid and they've billed, Mr. Wade has billed $650,000 plus. The others have billed $70,000 and $90,000. So there's a question of, is he working nine times as much as the other folks? The other big problem, though, is there's clearly a relationship of some nature. We don't know exactly. Between the D.A. and Mr. Wade. And some of that money is being used on travel that the D.A. is accompanying him on. So some of the money that the DA's office is paying out to Mr. Wade is now being used for personal purposes for the D.A. So there's a real potential conflict of interest.

Families of hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas, disrupting the proceedings in this meeting to demand action. Over the weekend, families of hostages also showed up at the prime minister's home to deliver their message that they want their loved ones back and they want more action to do it from the Israeli government.Just as Netanyahu says that he is not rejecting outright the latest conditions set by Hamas to secure the release of the hostages, terms that would include an end of the war and withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv tracking all of this for us. Jeremy, Netanyahu's office says that the prime minister has told the families he has an initiative to win release of the hostages. What are you hearing about this?",
