They're carefully watching Nevada, make sure they don't lose that state. So, of course, every vote is going to matter, and they're really watching the discontent among young voters and Arab American voters, certainly, after the Israel war -- the war -- the Israel-Hamas war broke out in -- it broke out in early October.And I think that they are -- there's two thoughts. Obviously, I think people generally feel that these aren't voters that would necessarily go to Donald Trump, and they have been -- and the Biden campaign has been highlighting that, obviously, in the last several weeks. You're looking at their -- you know, you're looking at their reminders to voters of the Muslim ban that President -- then-President Donald Trump tried to implement in his -- implemented in his first weeks in office. But there is the concern, there is always a concern of just discontent, that these voters just, you know, they don't like Donald Trump, but they don't like what Biden has done in office. And that apathy is really what the Biden campaign and Democrats are watching right now and make sure that doesn't spill over and that discontent doesn't spill over into next year when voters start voting. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Yes, I mean, they may not go to the polls to vote for Donald Trump. They may not go to the polls at all if they can't live with their decision --",

One is to continue in whatever way they can to communicate Biden's accomplishment to voters and make sure that voters connect those accomplishments to what President Biden himself did.If you look at research and the campaign will tell you, Democrats will tell you, that if you look at research, if you tell voters all of the things that the president -- President Biden has been able to get done in his first, you know, two, three years in office, you're looking at the prescription drugs issue, in particular being really popular with voters, the Infrastructure Law, other provisions in that Inflation Reduction Act. They say those remain immensely popular with voters and they just really need to make that connection between the popularity of President Biden's agenda, his accomplishments and to President Biden himself. And the other big part of that in terms of the numbers is to continue making that contrast with Donald Trump that we're talking about this morning. If you'll look at the extensive campaign memo, that campaign manager Julie Rodriguez distributed to allies last night, and just hammering away that, you know, democracy versus autocracy. That's not only been a pillar of President Biden's foreign policy agenda, but it really is going to be a hallmark of his campaign when he argues over and over that Donald Trump is going to get back to democracy. That's -- so, that is really their two broad pillars, and I don't think you're going to see that change.",

What do you think his options are?TOM DUPREE, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL AND REPRESENTED GEORGE W. BUS IN BUSH V. GORE:  Well, I think his options would be to try to push this immunity issue as far as he can take it. He does have a few cards left to play in the court of appeals and potentially he could try to get the United States Supreme Court interested in the case. So, I think his strategy right now is to say, give me and my legal team a little bit of breathing room so we can figure out what our options are, figure out what we want to do, and then potentially take this issue all the way to the Supreme Court, which could potentially, again, delay this trial.",

They have got a lot of other important issues and cases that they have to decide.And I think there's also a lot of hesitance, frankly, to get involved in these political disputes, because inevitably, no matter how they go, what they decide, a significant portion of the country is going to say, well, that's a political decision.

It took me -- I mean, looking at my paper, I almost want to apologize in reading them to people about the position that the Supreme Court now finds itself in. Being asked to decide whether Donald Trump is covered by absolute presidential immunity in the federal election subversion case. Being asked also if the obstruction charge, which is at the core of many January 6th cases, including Trump's, is viable. Likely to be asked to decide whether or not Donald Trump should be on the ballot in Colorado after the insurrection decision there and then possibly being asked to weigh in on the E. Jean Carroll civil defamation case.That is a lot. I mean, how do you see this happening here? What position does this put the court in, really? It's really unprecedented. DUPREE:  It is unprecedented. I mean, you go back and you look at our nation's history, say Bush versus Gore, where kind of the country was somewhat shocked that the United States Supreme Court would get involved in, you know, \"Deciding a presidential election.\" And that was one case. Now, as you note, we've got six, seven, eight possible cases going up there. I think it's a safe bet they're not going to take all of them at the same time. I think they probably will take at least one or two of the cases, particularly that Colorado case that's now going up to the Supreme Court. But look, they understand that every time they get involved in the political fray, there's somewhat of an institutional price to be paid for it. So, I think they're going to be cautious. They're going to be judicious. They're going to take some of these cases, but they're certainly not going to take all of these cases.",

We've had meteors from the Ursids the past week or so, but really, tonight is the night where you have the highest likelihood of seeing the most a number of meteors.
