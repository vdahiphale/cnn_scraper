The extension of a humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas is about to run out but the league mediator says he is hopeful we will hear some good news today. Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces conducted a heavy incursion into the city of Jenin, killing at least two Palestinians. The head of Doctors without Borders said he was trapped with staff inside of a hospital while the incursion and ensuing clashes were ongoing outside. And as we gear up for the annual year-end climate conference tomorrow, some good news on the sustainability front.

Ben Wedeman is back with us this hour from Jerusalem. Let's start with the Palestinian releases and what we're hoping to see over the coming hours. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we understand from the Palestinians and the Israelis that 30 people will again will be released this evening. These are all women and boys under the age of 18. We do not have a breakdown of how many are administrative detainees and how many are actually prisoners. But certainly this does represent, if there is no breakthrough for an extension of the truce, the last exchange that will take place. Although as you have been reporting, all indications are that there is a very good possibility that the truce will be extended perhaps a few days. Hamas has suggested that it wants four days; the Israelis indicated perhaps two, maximum three. And then it will be back to ground offensive in Gaza.",

CIA director Bill Burns leading meetings in Qatar yesterday with both his Egyptian, Israeli and Qatari counterparts.

Wehave known the big picture idea behind the agreement for even weeks before it was officially announced. And that is a exchange of Israeli hostages, at first women and children in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But the devil has always been in the details here. How many Israeli hostages for how many Palestinian prisoners? The agreement was reached for a 1:3 ratio there. And we've seen that play out. As you point, out at some point, the current truce is going to run into the cold, hard math of the fact that, according to the Israeli prime minister's office, there are 161 hostages remaining in Gaza, including foreign nationals. Only 35 or so of them are women and some of those are soldiers. And so there aren't enough of the women in children to keep this going. The current agreement is going for a much longer period. And that means that it's back to the drawing board and quickly if you want to keep this truce going. You have to find a number that can work. How many Palestinian prisoners of essentially what are they being held for? Are they detained? Have they been arrested and charged? How many of that group for Israeli elderly man held by Hamas? And then for soldiers? That math is likely to change with each of these iterations. And the problem is, if I'm not mistaken on the Israeli political side, it takes time to approve a new deal each time. We saw how long it took for that to play out the first night that the deal was approved. All of this is a tremendous challenge. So it is, I should say, incredibly encouraging that we're hearing optimism from the countries that they can keep this going. And yet at some point, it is realistic just to look at it and wonder how far is optimism going to take you here.",

Is that a realistic goal from where we stand right now during this pause? It seems a very, very long way off in a very difficult mission for Israel to achieve completely. And, yet it does still inevitably mean that the war restarts. Israel's defense minister also promised the campaign going out here would be even bigger and stronger, even as the White House has urged Israel privately to not unleash the same sort of damage and devastation on southern Gaza that we've seen on northern Gaza. And to keep in, mind all of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians. Still, Israel will pursue in some fashion a continuation of this war and that makes the prospect of a long-term cease-fire a true end to this round of fighting, very, very distant right now.",

And now U.S. officials estimate that around 140 trucks are coming to Gaza every day, which is important because bringing in food and fuel and water and (INAUDIBLE) material and shelter as the rainy season gets by. And they will need a whole lot more and according to U.N. estimates, 200 trucks coming in every two months just to meet the needs. But here is the problem. There are a lot of trucks backed up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. Egyptian officials now telling CNN that there are 572 trucks of aid waiting to get in at the (INAUDIBLE) checkpoint run by the Israelis. They cannot go to Gaza until they go through that process. And that Israeli checkpoint takes hours until every truck is cleared. That is part of the holdup here. But so many people who are waiting for aid on the Gaza side just have not had that cleared to get past them and that has been an issue. That is Qatari and Egyptian officials who want to move this process faster. But also the ceiling that was put on this deal, 200 trucks, to be raised so that more aid can come in for the people who badly need it, 1.7 million people displaced across the Strip.

In the best of times, our understanding is that going through the Rafah border crossing should take less than an hour, less than a half an hour if they were just going straight from Egypt into Gaza. But that is another process. They have to drive down and go through this queue, in which they are checked before they go into Gaza. The other problem and the fear that the Israelis had was that this aid would be ending up in Hamas hands and would be aiding Hamas. And that has been largely confirmed to be not true.

This was the council set up at that NATO summit in Vilnius in July. It's good to hear this rhetoric and these remarks, especially from the U.S., which is Ukraine's biggest military backer, saying that support is unwavering. But support and practice is not unwavering because Congress has yet to pass new funding to provide more military aid to Ukraine. And so the Pentagon is essentially having to ration what is left and to meter (sic) it out in its own words. The latest U.S. aid package to Ukraine in November was less than 100 million. We've seen packages over this year that were in the billions and so they are getting smaller. That is practically speaking. I think that there are also concerns about fatigue in Europe. We've seen certainly this new government and Slovakia has counseled military aid to Ukraine. The election and another lens, which the most votes were garnered by a far- right pro Russian politician has caused some concern there and the Netherlands has been a very staunch backer of Ukraine so far. And so I think that this is a concerted effort that we saw from Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, from Secretary Blinken and other foreign ministers, to shift that narrative, to try to get that message across and that they are standing firm with Ukraine. They want to support Ukraine as it tries to push Russia out of its territory. And they do want to do that in the long term and work toward NATO membership.

At his Wednesday audience in Rome, he was on his own two feet. But he admitted that he is not quite his usual self. POPE FRANCIS, PONTIFF, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator):  I am still not well with this flu. And my voice is not nice. NADEAU (voice-over):  Since his election in March 2013, the pontiff has taken 44 trips to 62 countries. But he has also had some serious medical problems and has been hospitalized three times in the last two years. He has part of his colon removed in July 2021 and returned to the hospital twice in 2023, the last time in June for an abdominal surgery. Whenever a pope is sick, it is assured that the faithful start to pray.",
