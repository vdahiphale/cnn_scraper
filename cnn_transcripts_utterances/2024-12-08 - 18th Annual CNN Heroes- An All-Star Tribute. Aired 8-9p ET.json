So a dress can become a barrier to a girl's success or the key that empowers her to reach her potential.Payton McGriff learned this as a college student after reading a book that opened her eyes to the oppression of women around the world. Payton never forgot its lessons. And in her senior year, she developed a plan to provide uniforms to girls and pitched it to a professor from Togo, a country in West Africa. And get this, 11 days later, Payton was in that country doing field research. Now, in just seven short years, her college project became a reality. And today it is called Style Her Empowered, aka SHE. It provides free access to education and a whole list of oppression- lifting necessities, including an ingenious design for a uniform that grows with each girl. This is what I do know for sure, and that is that education has the power to provide a sense of more than just learning opportunities. It provides dignity. It offers purpose, and in this case, a source of power. For a movement, for opportunity, Style Her Empowered is knocking down barriers so that hope can rise in its place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Talent and resilience and resourcefulness is so equally distributed worldwide, but opportunity is not. And that was really what kick- started SHE.When a girl enters our program, she receives a new school uniform, the full tuition scholarship, school supplies, a reusable menstrual kit, and year-round tutoring from our local staff. Today, we have 1,500 girls in our program across 21 rural communities in Togo. In addition to that, we created the uniform that grows. It grows six sizes and up to 12 inches in length. It adjusts in various parts of the body to provide a well-tailored fit. To put their uniform on for the first time, that's one of the most joyous experiences that we see. So Elolo has now graduated high school. She has recruited thousands of girls. She is a role model for every girl in our program who can see themselves in her. It's so girl power. It's so fun. When you educate a girl, you educate a community. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In 2015, when she learned that many of these kids lacked housing, food, mental health care, and other basic necessities, she started Project Libertad. She provides tutoring, mentoring, language classes, college prep, and career assistance, as well as training to make sure they know their legal rights. Hundreds of kids have benefited from her work and felt her empathy. For Rachel is more than just their lawyer.

We always have a social-emotional learning component. Are you going under it? We learn to work together and cooperate, right? And then we always also incorporate an English learning piece. Good job. That's awesome. We work with a lot of kids who have been out of school for a long time. The program really helps them to build a community at school. We've had teachers tell us that our program is the first time they've seen kids laugh or smile and feel truly engaged in the classroom. I was 14 years old when I first arrived. I just feel so lost. This organization has helped me in everything. I am a U.S. citizen now. I joined the Army National Guard. I have a full-time job. I'm also going to school. I want to become an immigration attorney. I'm really grateful for all the opportunities this country has given me. Immigrant communities are so essential across the U.S., and I think that's very misunderstood.

But too many people don't, and in the United States, more than 900,000 shelter animals are euthanized every single year.One reason many people surrender their pet is because they cannot find someone to take care of them while they're seeking treatment for substance abuse. COOPER: Well, our next hero is changing that and keeping their beloved pets safe and out of shelters. To tell us about his remarkable work is the star of NBC's Brilliant Minds and a proud supporter of the Trevor Project and a champion of raising awareness around mental health, Zachary Quinto. ZACHARY QUINTO, EMMY NOMINEE AND STAR OF NBC'S BRILLIANT MINDS: Late one night, a woman holding her beloved dog, Jade, knocked on the right door. Stephen Knight opened it, and there stood his friend in bad shape. She asked Stephen to take her to the animal shelter to surrender Jade so she could go to rehab. Stephen was only eight months sober himself. Having been addicted to crystal meth, he contracted HIV and lost everything, his job, his home, his family. But when Stephen locked eyes with Jade, he said, I'll take her, and in that act of kindness, he found his purpose. He went back to school, became a substance abuse counselor, and created Dogs Matter, which provides foster homes for dogs, allowing their owners to seek the treatment they need. When they return, he offers 12 months of counseling and other services to help them succeed. To date, he's kept more than 1,200 pets from going into shelters. The road to recovery is hard, but Stephen's work ensures that along the route, there are wagging tails, endless cuddles, and love. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And through our foundation have found a way to realize that. They've risen to this challenge with energy and love and dedication and commitment.I'm so proud to be a part of it.

And I share this award with Jade.She's the reason why I did this. One act of kindness. And then to have that dream and that goal to be able to help others. And do one step at a time to get there. And 1,500 to 1,200 dogs later. It's amazing. But it's just beginning too. This is going to be able to take us to the next level. And I'm so excited. I got to thank my family. I got to thank my team. I got to thank Dallas Pets Alive. There's so many people to thank. And I'm most delighted to thank our fosters. We have to have foster families to do this.
