The Corporal Story's body was never accounted for until now. The Republic of Korea and the United States worked together to identify Corporal Story's remains among those buried as a Korean war unknown -- as a Korean war unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Today, we can return him to his family and to his rest with all of the honors he deserves because we never forget our heroes.",

What happens next today, though, I think is what political watchers are watching very closely. Yes, all of the diplomatic correspondents want to know the agreements that have come out of this. But there is going to be a meeting in the Oval Office where reporters will get in and they'll shell questions, and maybe we will hear from the president there. And then a news conference, there aren't a lot of them for President Joe Biden. And this one is the first time he will answer questions since his announcement that he is officially running for re-election.",

And what we heard from the presidential office was denial, effectively saying that they believed much of what was reported was fabricated. So, of course, that is quite a strong statement in itself.Now, we've been hearing from officials that they don't believe that this is going to play into any of the conversations or have any impact on what's happening today. But what it did show us was exactly how difficult the situation the South Korean officials and government find themselves in. The fact that it was a remarkable -- remarkably detailed view of senior South Korean officials debating about how they were going to get around the fact that the United States wanted South Korea to send them ammunition and artillery, which they could then send on to Ukraine. Now, South Korea has this policy that they don't provide weapons to any countries at war, but they are coming under increasing pressure, not just from the United States, but from other countries. The NATO chief came to South Korea to speak to President Yoon to try and push him to give weapons to Ukraine. And so, it is becoming a point of contention. There is public debate as to whether or not South Korea should now start to do more and start to give more than just the humanitarian aid and financial aid that they've been giving to Ukraine. Because the fact is, South Korea is becoming a significant arms and weapons exporter. And we know that they have a lot of ammunition which Ukraine needs at this point.",

Something that the White House has threatened to veto. But something that the Republicans say will show them moving forward to raise the national debt limit by -- for one year, including a slew of spending cuts in order to win over conservatives who had been skeptical.But last night, overnight, changes were made in order to win over some skeptics. Including subsidies for ethanol, that is something that the initial bill would have repealed subsidies for ethanol. That is now included in the package in order to win four Iowa GOP members who had planned to oppose it over this issue, as well as some other midwestern Republicans. Also, changing how new proposed Medicaid work requirements for beneficiaries to that program. There had been a push among some on the far right to make those work requirements implemented quicker under this proposal. The Republican leaders agreed to that. And as a result, the expectation is that they will get the votes to actually pass this today. But in talking to some members, some members are still concerned and warning that they'll vote no.

He does plan to support this now going forward. And the expectation is that they can limit those defections to less than four Republican members.Remember, four Republicans vote no, that's OK. But if five vote against it, that's enough to sink the bill and we do expect at least there. As you can see, there have raised concerns, may vote against it. Matt Gaetz told me he's not certain he's going to vote for this bill yet. So, uncertain but the expectation at the moment is if they can get the votes, get this out today as the debt default looms as soon as June. Sara.",

While Nebraska became the 27th state to eliminate conceal carry permits for most adults, in other words, you can carry guns without permits.CNN's Zach Wolf joins us now. So, Zach, let's start with the assault weapon ban in Washington, because at the federal level, let's be honest, the assault weapon ban doesn't seem to have much hope of passing at the federal level, but some states are doing it piece by piece. ZACHARY WOLF, CNN POLITICS SENIOR WRITER:  Yes, states have been working on this and its mostly blue states doing it on the west coast, in the northeast, and Illinois. These are all subject to court challenges. So, I think, there's a real question about how long these assault weapons bans will be in place. None of them has been, you know, stayed yet, but I think that there's a serious court battle to keep an eye on. Washington state's become -- becomes the most recent, but we also have places like California, Hawaii. And then in the northeast we have, you know, New York and New Jersey and states up there.",
