I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Today we are learning of several additional pages of classified material found at President Biden's Delaware home this week. This is on top of classified material found at a Biden affiliated think tank in Washington. And it's believed approximately 20 documents with classified markings have been found. Joining me now CNN'S Evan Perez and Elie Honig, former assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and CNN senior legal analyst. Elie, I will talk to you in just a second, but Evan, what is going on with these additional pages that were found. Obviously not the kind of news that they want to hear over at the White House.",

And for the White House, you know, they had told us just about 24 hours ago that they had found one additional document turned over to the Justice Department in a search at a room that was adjacent to the president's garage in his home in Wilmington.And now they say that in the process of turning over those documents or that one document, they found an additional five records. And so now we have as you mentioned, around 20 records or so, that have classification markings. And the various classifications -- what we do know is in the first batch, the first ten documents were found at this office at the Penn- Biden Center. There were some documents that were at the level of top secret SCI, which is among the most sensitive documents, the stuff that raises the concern about exposure of sources and methods, which is why the Justice Department and why the FBI is taking this very seriously. Now we have a special counsel, Bob Hur, who is going to be setting up a team. And one of the first orders of business will be to try to talk to the president's team and try to make sure they could find out whether there are any other documents. That is one of the concerns that lingers here, is, you know, could there be additional places that haven't been searched? You know, how thorough have these searches been? And could there be additional records that are still missing. I will say real quick that the president's personal attorney is saying to explain why they've had so many shifts in stories. They said that they have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where appropriate with the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigation's integrity. It should be noted, the Justice Department did not ask them to not say anything. The Justice Department has not coordinated any of their response. This is all of their own doing. And so, this is partly why you see now they're saying, this is it. We're not going to tell you anything more.",

Generally speaking, more documents means more problems for Joe Biden because the more documents that turn up, the harder it is to write this off as some sort of accident or some sort of unknowing incident.Look, if there was one document here, you could readily understand how that could be an accident. But now we're talking about 20 documents. That's a lot harder to write off, particularly, I should say, as to the documents found inside Joe Biden's private home. The office perhaps is a little bit different. That office has not been used in several years. You can maybe understand how there's some documents in a file cabinet. But when you are talking about inside the home, that gets more difficult to explain. The other factor, and Evan touched on this, Biden's team is developing a credibility crisis. They've now, more than once, made incomplete public statements. And I think that really undermines their credibility. Prosecutors take note of that. It is a PR problem, but it's potentially a legal problem as well.",

He went into great detail saying that, you know, he makes sure that he hands documents back to military aides and to make sure that people viewed his handling of classified documents in a completely different manner than Donald Trump's.And here we are now, and it appears that the president was a bit of a mess himself.

First of all, cooperation -- full cooperation will help move things along. The less forthcoming a defense team is, the more it is going to drag things out. The other things Is, DOJ, the prosecutors here, both special counsel relating to Biden and Trump have to be aware of the broader reality that we are rounding the bend here politically, we are coming up on the 2024 election. Donald Trump's already an announced candidate. Joe Biden could become one soon. And I think you have to be aware that because you want prosecution and politics to mix as little as humanly possible. So if I'm a prosecutor here, if I'm either of these special counsel, I am putting my foot on the gas to the maximum extent possible because speed is really in the interest of all the parties here.",

But putting that to the side for a moment, you worked as a press secretary in the Clinton White House during his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment. You have experience handling a president during a crisis, what is your assessment of how the Biden White House is handling this? I suppose the most generous, you know, way of explaining all of this is that, you know, the way these documents have come out have just been very inconvenient for this White House team.

Either way would have been better than this in between drip, drip, we're doing the process but, wait, we found more documents. It is just very -- it's very messy.

I think the much more interesting question is the media.

This is not a conspiracy theory. This is real. And Republicans are right to take it seriously. But to Joe's point, I am also sure they will overplay their hand.

Mostly convicts that they have brought up, tagged and put forward into the battle to be used up. Ukrainians are expending a tremendous amount of artillery and that's probably the one thing they need is more ammunition right now for their artillery pieces. But when you look at it Bakhmut has not fallen. It is still out there. It is a critical hub for transportation. You have railroads. You have highways. You have roads going through it, which is why it is so important. Soledar is not that significant strategically. Tactically it may serve to help forces.

You don't wake up one morning and decide you are going to go into somebody's home and kill four people inside the home. You start thinking about violent behavior. You start to read about it. You start testing other people, what do they think about it? And now, you have social media, you can post on social media. But the ideation about acting out violently, especially if it's a non- impulsive, and particularly if it is not an act of violence that is reactive -- in other words, if I punch you in the nose, you punch me back. The violence that we saw in Idaho was called \"instrumental violence.\" It's a very specific type of violence. So there would have been planning ahead of time.

As sad as that is, it's a very sad thing to think about.But it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to go out there and commit crimes later on in life. Where does this line get drawn where the behavior becomes so disturbing, there's such a lack of empathy that you could cross into this kind of territory? O'TOOLE: Well, it's a blending of a couple of things. And, so, the personality of a person is really critical. And we know that our personalities aren't hardwired until we are like in our mid-20s, same with our brains. But a pattern of behavior will become manifested as we get older. So people that see us and know us will see we're very empathic or not so much. Or people that see us and know us will say, you can really relate to other people or you just simply can't seem to relate to other people. So the patterns will continue as we become 10, 11, 12, 15 years of age. So that development is known to others around us. But then the ideation about killing other people, for whatever reasons, whether they're sexual or emotional, that kind of ideation also begins to develop, we think, at a very early age. When you have a culmination of the two, very violent ideation in the body of someone who has very little remorse or guilt for what they do or regard for others, then that's a deadly combination.

We spoke about those efforts and what he's trying to do to change the face of probation and parole in this country just a few weeks ago. Here is a little bit of my interview with Meek Mill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEEK MILL, RAPPER, CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMER &amp; ADVOCATE, THE REFORM ALLIANCE: Well, we are working on probation and parole because I was affected by it. And I'm from a community where I see mothers and fathers leave their kids all the time in the house because they may have smoked marijuana or went to cross the Philadelphia/New Jersey state line to take their children to football practice. So I would say probation and parole, taking a look at that is a real thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Most ever granted by a Pennsylvanian governor.But I will say that, just to put this into perspective, we talked about this before, Jim, what Meek is talking about in that interview. Is that some people on parole in this country, on probation, they could get thrown back into prison for something as simple as crossing a state line from New York to New Jersey, Georgia to Alabama to go and take their kid to soccer practice, right? And maybe, you know, their crime has nothing to do with crossing state lines or anything like that. So they want to make these laws, especially in the state of Pennsylvania, which Robert Rooks just told me, the CEO of Reform Alliance, that Pennsylvania has some of the strictest probation and parole laws. That's what they're trying to reform. And Meek Mills obviously so happy he's been pardoned. But like they say, there's still a lot of work left to be done.",
