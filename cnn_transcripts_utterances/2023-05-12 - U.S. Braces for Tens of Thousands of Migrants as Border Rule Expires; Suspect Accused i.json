And, Polo, this all come after the Republican governor of Texas sent thousands of migrants to New York and other so-called sanctuary cities. Well, what you are seeing right now? POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  And, Phil, we should not that even before the overnight expiration of Title 42, New York City has been in migrant crisis mode as its struggle find accommodation and housing for what's currently close to 40,000 asylum seekers that are still in the city's care. So, it gets to be seen exactly how much that number will continues to rise now that Title 42 is no more. But what is for sure is that that number will rise in the last, as we have been seeing that for the last year, 200 to 300 asylum seekers arrive a day and many more they will be arriving here in New York's bus Port Authority today. So, what the city is doing right now, basically considering all options. That includes the Mayor Eric Adams potentially pressing forward, at least eventually, on his efforts to off-road the asylum, volunteer relocation from New York City to some of the nearby suburbs. In fact, we saw that just yesterday as he did send a couple buses to nearby Burke (ph), New York, a short drive north of the city. That prompted come criticism and some outrage from Orange County officials. They say that they simply lack the resources to take any people up there more than the asylum seekers that they've already seen. So, what we're really seeing now, the Title 42 is a thing of the past, is the growing call here in New York City for President Biden to potentially interject here and the form an executive action or something else to offer a form of humanitarian assistance to some of the asylum seekers here potentially giving them the right to work legally. Because when you speak to these asylum seekers, as I have Phil, they will tell you time and time again that they want to be able to make a living and basically work out of a city shelter.",

The Manhattan district attorney's office says they expect to arrest 24-year-old Daniel Penny and charge him with manslaughter. It's been almost two weeks since Penny held Jordan Neely in a deadly chokehold.Witnesses say Neely was acting erratically on a subway train in Manhattan and they described Penny approaching him from behind, putting him in that chokehold, pinning him to the ground until he was unconscious. Now, the law firm representing Penny released a statement saying in part their client, quote, risked his own life, safety, for the good of his fellow passengers. And they go on to say, we are confident that once all the facts and circumstances surrounding this tragic incident are brought to bear, Mr. Penny will be fully absolved of any wrongdoing.

They intend to bring on everyone who was on that train, testify as to what they saw, what they heard and whether they felt threatened. The wild card is, does Daniel Penny, the defendant here, waive immunity at his own peril, go into the grand jury and tell his story there on the idea that if he convinces them of two things, one, I felt a threat against me or others on that train that I had to intervene, and, second, that I never intended to kill him.

Clearly, this has been re-evaluated in terms of the risks.

My point is that this is as chaotic as Afghanistan was and the administration came back and said they were happy with it. This meets their needs.

There is a legal process over a million people a year, and the Democratic Party does not want to take the law as it is. A million people a year is more than any other country. It's a process that we can then bring people in, assimilate them, know who they are. Here's the biggest point, Phil.
