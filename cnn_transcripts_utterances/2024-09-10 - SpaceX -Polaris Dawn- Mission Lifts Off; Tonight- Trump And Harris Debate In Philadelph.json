They'll get about three months' worth in a few days. So, you know, the biologist in me would want to see the -- that data. But other than that, they're taking some 3D ultrasound things that they're going to be doing on the head to understand how they respond to things. They're going to have some smart contact lenses.

It looks like in this case they're going to fail because you have the very broad coalition of Republicans who don't like this continuing resolution plan. And then in the end, Democrats and Republicans come together and vote on a clean continuing resolution to fund the government for a few months here.
