I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now, off the coast of South Carolina, US Navy divers are scrambling to recover that downed Chinese spy balloon or what remains of it. US fighter jets shot it down this afternoon, a few days after it crossed the US border and was spotted over Montana. It then floated all the way to the Carolinas raising National Security concerns for days. Most of the wreckage is believed to be sitting in 47 feet of water at this hour. Let's go now to CNN's Oren Liebermann over at The Pentagon. Oren, do we think we might get some kind of update this evening as to whether or not they have been able to secure that wreckage and retrieve it.",

Whether they can retrieve it tonight or not, that is a different question. Forty-seven feet of water according to a senior Defense official, so not all that deep.But still, it's a question of what's left, what's down there and what shape is it in? And how do you bring it up without damaging it further. A salvage vessel is on the way, it might not be there in time to do it tonight, but it will get there as quickly as possible to begin that salvage effort. Why is that so important? Because the Pentagon has said repeatedly, this was a Chinese surveillance balloon that had the ability to maneuver, to loiter, to gather Intelligence, and because of that, there is information they want to glean from that wreckage once they find out what sort of condition it's in and can pull it up. It is worth pointing out that the Intelligence gathering operation from the US perspective hasn't started now. It happened as this balloon made its way across the United States. The Pentagon says they took steps to mitigate the ability of the Chinese to gather information or Intelligence from this, and instead tried to gather their own Intelligence about the capabilities and the technology aboard the Chinese surveillance balloon. So now that will shift from it being in motion to once they bring it up seeing it in person up close, instead of at a distance of something like 12 miles in the sky -- Jim.",

The Pentagon decided it wouldn't be safe to do it over the continental US because of the risk to property and people below what would be a payload of a length of three school buses falling apart and creating a debris field from 60,000 feet.So the decision was made to shoot it down once it was off the coast. It was F-22s launched out of Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia that fired a A9-sidewinder missile, a heat seeking missile, that's a fairly short range weapon, so they had to get up close. The Pentagon says that the F-22 fighter jets were at about 58,000 feet. The balloon somewhere between 60,000 and 65,000 feet, and it was one shot, one kill for the balloon.",

So to me, this was the best of both worlds. It was, as I understand it, done within our territorial waters. And obviously, no jeopardy to anyone on the ground. So to me, it was the right thing to do.

That's why this is going to be very good to recover, the payload from the balloon and find out what kind of sensors they had on it. As others have already discussed, the Chinese have very capable overhead reconnaissance satellite system that can collect all kinds of imagery Intelligence, probably better than with a balloon.

They have very aggressive intellectual property attacks on us.So they are very aggressive about this. Having said all of that, this, to me is sort of a ham-handed to do this as an Intelligence collection effort when they have so many other ways of gaining Intelligence on the United States, that is not nearly as visible and dramatic as this and this is what's drawing so much attention to this. Now, we're concerned about our sovereignty, well, how high does sovereignty go? So we're going to shoot down the balloon because it's an affront to our sovereignty.

And it was discussed whether to shoot it down and let it come to Earth by itself.And so it's extremely rare, was discussed when TWA 800 went down off the coast of New York because there were military operations nearby. But, of course, that was not a shoot down, but it was - there were suspicious - a lot of suspicious people about that. So it's very rare and, of course, it is dangerous when you have military operations around civilian aircraft.

There are actually pictures floating around the Internet people saying they're going to go out and shoot at them. That's a ridiculous idea. Civilian aircraft, by the way, of the United States have been shot at before at U.S. airline - U.S. airplane, I think back in 2011, landed at Charlotte with a bullet hole on top of it. In foreign countries, passengers that actually been shot on planes by straight bullets. So what we've learned is that the government can deal with these hopefully will pick up the remains of this balloon and will keep us safe. But the American public, I think should have been alerted to what was going on so they knew the government had it in hand.

They didn't know what was happening - would happen when they shot at it. And two, they had a chance of getting the debris intact, which is hugely important. Now, I saw it on television like everybody else, but it looked like a piece fell off before the rest of it. So they do have chance to recover it from the ocean floor and they're pretty good at that.

There you can see the video right there. This video is taken by a man in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, who said he watched a couple of fighter jets circle around the balloon for about an hour before they then started closing in. The balloon went down off the coast of South Carolina as we've been reporting all afternoon into the Atlantic Ocean. The takedown ended a day's long drama after the balloon had floated across much of the continental United States.As we wait to learn more, we're also looking at what China might have gained from this mission. Earlier I spoke with Democratic Congressman Adam Smith of Washington. He's the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee and terms China as a reckless bully on the international stage. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): Yes, I don't know what message they're trying to send. But the message that China has been sending now for the last several years is they are reckless bully in many different areas, not just in the way they treat the U.S. They went after Australia launching a trade war against Australia when Australia dared to suggest that China could be more open and transparent on COVID. I was in Indonesia last year. Indonesia is doing some exploration in their territorial waters looking for natural gas, China moved in and push them back off of that claim, in territory that isn't theirs. They now trapped numerous countries in the developing world in a debt trap by loaning the money and running up the bill on that. China is behaving like a reckless bully and what we need to do is work with the rest of the world to rein that in, in a way that deters them without launching a full out war with China. And that's what I hope people understand, China's a big powerful country. They're going to be a big powerful country (inaudible) for as long as I can see. We need to find some way to rein in their worst behavior while finding a way to - for the world to be big enough for the both of us. So it's a difficult challenge, but I think the President's taking the right approach.",

Also, Russia and China may well be talking together regularly, but we need to talk more to Russia. We need to talk more to China. I think that's a missed opportunity.

It is the brazen and reckless behavior as they've tried to throw their weight around in Asia and across the world.But look, when you're talking about the efforts of countries to spy on each other, I mean, people know enough of the history to know that that goes on a lot. Now, flying something directly over U.S. airspace, that I think is a far more rare event. I don't, off the top of my head, know of a precedent. So, it - again, it speaks to the increasingly reckless behavior that China is engaged in and the importance of us working with the rest of the world to try to get them to stop and be a more productive partner in the world.

And so that does bode well, I suppose, if and when they're able to retrieve that equipment from the ocean, because it does look a - you can see a right there, a fair amount of it still intact, dropping very quickly below what was left of that balloon after it was shot out of the sky. Fighter jets from Langley Air Force Base shut down that balloon earlier this afternoon. China insists the spy balloon drifted over the U.S. accidentally. Its foreign ministry also says its purpose was purely scientific, mostly weather-related research. Of course, that's according to the Chinese.

Huawei is a company that has drawn intense scrutiny from the U.S. government for its ties to the Chinese government.
