The three Democratic lawmakers are accused of breaking house rules. At any moment, we expect their colleagues to vote on whether or not they should be expelled.CNN national reporter Ryan Young is live for us in Nashville. Ryan, lots of noise is still ongoing. A lot of protesters that were with the lawmakers one week ago are back there today to support these three legislators. RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. We really seem to swell, Fred, in terms of protesters. We had thousands earlier outside, now that you can see this small crowd that's still behind me. Some eventually made it on the inside so they can protest, so those lawmakers could hear their voices. Let's not lose sight of this. We had a terrible tragedy in this community where we had six people lose their lives, including three children. And so, this is what so many people have been protesting about. Now, the focus is on this decorum issue where these three lawmakers and one of them is that even admitted that they broke the rules, they use the bullhorn, and they said they were trying to bring attention to what's going on in this state. At the same time, this is run by the Republicans, so they have the chance to vote these three out this afternoon. I have a protester with me. His name is Kevin. He's a schoolteacher. You felt though that you needed to be here today. Why did you want to be here and have your voice heard?",

We're not sure how this is going to end in terms of any sort of gun laws being passed, but we do believe that with the Republicans in control, this expulsion could happen within the next hour or so. So, when you put all this together, you understand how painful this is for the community, especially after what's happened in the last few weeks.

On the other side, there are people who talk about decorum and the idea that you can't just go on the State House floor and do whatever you want, and the only way a body work is if you follow the rules. So, you hear from that side as well. But some people think this is a punishment that might step too far. And obviously, there's a great divide here.We talked to a teacher earlier. And she was saying people need to stop talking in red and blue and start talking with our hearts. And I think that spoke to a lot of people here because obviously, there are people here who love the Second Amendment. And they're -- and they're obviously going to stick by that. And at the same time, you want people to be able to have both and have school safety as well. So, we'll keep watching this, Fred, and watch what's going on inside to tell you whenever something breaks there. WHITFIELD: And you know, Ryan, while you were talking, we were looking at live pictures inside of the State Capitol and we saw what appeared to be you know, the legislators Justin Jones of Nashville, Gloria Johnson of Knoxville talking at a table. It would be of course wonderful to know what it is that they are talking about. If they are talking about some emergency here, or whether there is any kind of groundswell of support among legislators now suddenly, for them, perhaps those legislators might be listening to the kind of passion outside of the Capitol there. And then, shortly thereafter, we saw a picture of -- live images of Justin Pearson of Memphis, who was kind of like tapping his heart, you know, and then also raising a hand to the audience there, perhaps an acknowledgment of people who were the -- expressing their support of them. Is there any feeling -- given the level of emotion here, the passion, is there any feeling that those, particularly Republicans who were dug in about their expulsion, are listening to the constituents there, listening to the protesters, and perhaps rethinking voting for expulsion? I already see you nodding your head. No.",

Just the idea that someone could walk across the aisle and say, all right, we're going to maybe censure you, maybe they face some sort of fine. That has not been the conversation at all.And the passion for the folks who are out here, yes, they may feel a certain way. But the lawmakers on the inside had been voted in. This is a Republican-controlled state house. So, if they make that decision to make this move today, that is something that their voters put them in power to do. And that's been part of the conversation here. I'm not sure I heard one conversation yet that is reached across the aisle, either way, in this. And on top of all that, we are focusing more time on talking about this procedure than we already have, three babies and the three workers who are killed last week. And that's been a big frustration point for a lot of people here. I mean, they've been begging us to cover this more often. I mean, we've had some people ask us, why are we covering their funerals as well? And I get their passion. And I get their concern about why we haven't been doing that. But we tried to bring as much light to this conversation as possible. And this is what the focus is right now.

They don't believe they voted for their president to do this. They have much more appreciation for a work-life balance than I think most North Americans do. And it's incredibly unpopular. But also, the second, I think prong of people's anger is how it was done. This bill was introduced. There was a shortened debate in both houses. It passed through the Senate and never passed through a vote through the lower more powerful house. And in the end, the government thought that it could realize it didn't have the votes to pass it through the lower house and instead use a constitutional tool to push it through. Many people think that while the Constitution allows for that, it was deeply undemocratic. They think that this is a reflection of a government that is tone-deaf, completely deaf, doesn't listen to the people. And they fear that it's a sliding slippery slope towards a more autocratic government. So, there's two things going on. It started as your reporter, Melissa, talk -- you said as a protest against a bill. And now it's part started to focus on the government in the form of the president, Emmanuel Macron.",

The security cabinet is meeting this evening, which defense minister Yoav Gallant as the same defense minister that was supposedly fired about a week ago, but wasn't really apparently fired, he will -- we are expecting to present the options to the cabinet so that it can make a decision on how to respond.Now, we already have heard from the defense minister saying that he's instructed the defense establishment to prepare, in his words, for all possible responses. And Israeli defense officials have also been telling us that Israel will decide, in its words, on the place and time of its response. Now, the important thing here is that Israel believes that it was either Hamas or Islamic Jihad that fired these rockets and mortars from Lebanon towards Israel. In other words, it wasn't Hezbollah, the militant group backed by Iran, which holds sway in southern Lebanon. So, that should mean that Israel will probably be likely to retaliate when it does retaliate against the positions where those rockets and mortars were fired from or towards assets belonging to Palestinian groups in southern Lebanon, not Hezbollah. Because I think what this also shows is that Hezbollah doesn't seem to want a major escalation, certainly not of the sort that we haven't seen since 2006. And Israel would much rather deal with Palestinian militants in southern Lebanon than Hezbollah as well because Hezbollah, of course, is much more heavily armed than Hamas in the Gaza Strip and would make any conflagration that much more serious. But we've heard calls for calm from the United Nation, from the Government of Lebanon as well saying that it's keen on maintaining calm and stability on the border with Israel. But I think it would be incredibly surprising if Israel does not retaliate in some shape or form. And that is something that they will be mulling over and discussing right now this evening at the meeting of the cabinet, Fredricka.",
