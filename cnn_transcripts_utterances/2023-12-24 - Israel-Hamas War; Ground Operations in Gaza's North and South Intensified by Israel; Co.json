And I think it was interesting, when you spoke to Regev yesterday, the senior advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He spoke of the logistical challenges that Palestinians are facing inside Gaza when it comes to having to move and move again, repeatedly, per the orders of the Israeli military to avoid that fierce fighting.But it isn't just the logistical challenges. It is the intense security threat that these people are facing, that these civilians are facing when we are seeing aerial bombardment across the Gaza Strip from Northern Gaza to Southern Gaza. We've seen those evacuation orders now for Central Gaza. And of course, now we have heard from the Israeli Military Spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, who has said they have expanded their ground operations, both in central and Southern Gaza. Now, the focus for the Israeli military, and we've heard this repeatedly is trying to tackle Hamas, to try and target those weapons stores, to try and target underground infrastructure, and crucially, of course, to bring back those hostages held in the Gaza Strip. But the civilian casualties that we have seen are simply unavoidable. We've heard that warning repeatedly. This is a densely populated enclave. And of course, there is mounting concern about what this means when we do begin to see this intensification of that ground operation.",

They have called on Hamas to a release, of course, all the hostages held under Hamas captivity inside Gaza, but also, of course, to stop posing a military threat.But the goal for the Israeli military is to completely eradicate Hamas's military capabilities, and Israel's military leadership has repeatedly said that the only way for them to do this is via that ground operation, via the aerial bombardment of targets they say are focused on Hamas's military capability. Now, of course, when it comes to how that impacts civilians, it is simply unavoidable because the Israeli military says, Hamas has embedded itself within civilian infrastructure. But again, we are talking about a densely populated strip of land that has been under a blockade since 2007. It has been almost impossible for civilians to evacuate Gaza. Of course, although we have seen some foreign nationals being able to evacuate. And the situation in terms of the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly. Only a small portion of aid is really getting in now. A drop in the bucket in comparison to what is needed. And of course, as we mentioned, more than 1.9 million people displaced in Gaza. And the fear is that this ground operation, this expanded ground operation will put even more civilians at risk.",

It is the first time they've spoken in a few weeks, and it is interesting to see what has happened in that span.You've seen this string of American officials go to Israel, including the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, to discuss with the Israelis this American expectation that Israel eventually shift to what they're calling a lower intensity phase of this war. And when we saw president Biden on the South Lawn on Saturday, he declined to get into the specifics of his phone call. He said it was private, but he did say that it was a long phone call. And I think you can read into that, this continued discussion with the Israelis about their war plans and objectives. And in fact, the White House said in a readout of the phone call that they discussed Israel's military campaign in Gaza to include its objectives and phasing. And certainly, that is something that American officials have been discussing sort of on a daily basis with their Israeli counterparts, this imperative to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. The White House said that President Biden did underscore the critical need to protect the civilian population, including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation. Now, President Biden is someone who does, you know, feel very strongly that his recommendations, his advice to the Israelis are best delivered in private, that he feels like that is the best way to influence the Israelis as they continue this operation to go after Hamas. And when we did see President Biden on the South Lawn, he declined to get into details of the call. He said that it was a private conversation, but he did emphasize that he did not ask Prime Minister Netanyahu for a ceasefire. The White House said afterwards that President Biden discussed the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting. And they also discussed securing the release of all remaining hostages. Of course, we have reported that those talks between Hamas, Qatar, the U.S., all trying to secure the release of those hostages that are remaining in Hamas custody. Those have intensified over the last several days, and certainly President Biden wants to see more hostages released as part of his conversations with regional partners.

Areas like Khan Younis which Israel has asked people to go to is now a hotspot and is now under the bombardment and on the clashes.
