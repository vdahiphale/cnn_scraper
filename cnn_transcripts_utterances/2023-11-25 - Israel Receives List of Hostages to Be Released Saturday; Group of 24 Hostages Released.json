It's not clear how many more might be released. We understand there are still some 20 Thais held hostage inside of Gaza. You mentioned the Israelis have the list of hostages that will be released today. We won't know their names until they're safely on Israeli soil. All of this is rather delicate. It is entirely possible the truce, expected to last four days, could hold longer, allowing hostages beyond the initial 50 and 150 to be released. Ten per day, if that were to be the case. But all of this is delicate. We already saw clashes between IDF and people who had gathered outside of a prison in West Bank, which was used to facilitate the release of some prisoners held by Israel in the West Bank. So perhaps it wouldn't take much to derail all of this. The families are waiting anxiously to see what happens next. You mentioned and we saw it in Matthew's piece, video taken by Hamas, showing them handing over their part of the hostages. And people in the video were cheering. Hamas has plenty to cheer about in all of this, because they have few good cards to play in this war but the hostages are one of them. While this truce was brokered by Israel, Hamas, the U.S. and Egypt, it was implemented carefully on the ground by the Red Cross, who emphasizes all of this is complicated. Listen.

Have a little mercy on us. They can be joyful but the joy is in the heart because we are dying in Gaza. Have some respect for us a little. BASHIR (voice-over): The release of this first group of Palestinian prisoners comes as Israel and Hamas begin a four-day truce, a window of desperately needed respite for civilians in Gaza. According to Hamas run health authorities in Gaza, nearly 15,000 Palestinians in the enclave have been killed over the last seven weeks alone. Israel says, it is targeting Hamas in response to the terror attack of October 7th, which killed more than 1,200 Israeli citizens. But in Gaza, it is civilians that are paying the highest price. More than 8,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, including more than 3,000, according to the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex- Prisoners' Affairs held under administrative detention, meaning no clear charges and no clear legal process. But for those gathered in the occupied West Bank on Friday night, this is a welcome moment of, in their eyes, long overdue justice. UM TARIQ, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN CITIZEN: People want to gather and be together in this moment. And however, folks internalize that in terms of their own emotional, sort of, reaction to it, that's for them to speak to. But I think people want to be here to be together. To welcome home these prisoners and that's part of the spirit of being Palestinian. BASHIR (voice-over): With over 100 Palestinian prisoners still set for release over the next few days, scenes like this are expected to continue, though some say at too high a price -- Nada Bashir, CNN, in Jerusalem.

However, when the truce ends -- or getting toward the end of the truce period -- the Israelis have the problem of they have decided the aim of the war is to destroy Hamas. So they can't let Hamas survive. So they need to find some government who will take over managing Gaza and stop security attacks on Israel to end the war. The Israelis say they don't want to occupy Gaza and the U.S. doesn't want them to, either.

Four attacks alone on Thanksgiving Day.On Thursday, according to the Pentagon, rockets and drones were used to try to strike two bases in Iraq and two sites in Syria. There was no damage reported nor were there casualties, according to the Pentagon but the growing attacks highlight the concerns about a wider conflict that could draw in U.S. troops. The U.S. has retaliated and tried to send a message of deterrence. The Pentagon says, including hitting two locations in Iraq earlier this week, which belonged to the Iran-backed Kata'ib Hezbollah, following an earlier attack by the group with close range ballistic missiles. In all, the U.S. has now carried out four sets of airstrikes for these dozens of strikes against U.S. and coalition forces. The U.S. strikes included three in Syria against facilities tied to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Iran-backed proxy groups. The Pentagon argues that the deterrence is working because the conflict has not yet spread more widely in the Middle East -- Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.
