I'll ask the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, what federal officials are doing to find answers.Also breaking, the FBI now says it received a tip from police in San Francisco about suspected CEO killer Luigi Mangione. This as the Manhattan district attorney now says, Mangione might be looking to drop his fight to the police against extradition to New York. Plus, tech billionaires are racing to cozy up to President-elect Donald Trump just ahead of his second term. Why major U.S. companies like Amazon and Meta are now donating big bucks to the Trump inauguration. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our top story tonight, the hunt for answers as residents and elected officials across the northeast report mysterious drone sightings. The Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, is standing by. He's here with me. He'll join us in just a moment. But first, this report from CNN's Omar Jimenez. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): There has to be some explanation to the public for all this increased activity, and they must do so now. OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): And yet, there hasn't been, even as the federal government says there's no evidence of any national security or public safety threats.

I do not know if this increasing activity over our skies is a threat to public safety or national security. There was even a downed drone that was reported in Morris County, New Jersey, but it was later revealed to be a hobby or toy drone.All the while, without a definitive explanation, questions have filled the vacuum. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy writing to President Joe Biden expressing concern about the reported drone sightings and asking for more federal resources, saying in part, existing laws limit the ability of state and local law enforcement to counter UAS or unmanned aircraft systems. It has become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity. New York Governor Kathy Hochul confirming that drones have also been spotted in New York, posting on X, at this time, there's no evidence that these drones pose a public safety or national security threat. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ (on camera): Which is what we've heard from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI as well. But also we are now seeing more states with these reported sightings. Some military installations in New Jersey have also seen airspace restrictions over them as well. And it gives some perspective on just the market in general. There are nearly 800,000 drones registered with the FAA, about an even split between commercial and recreational. But, of course, that might complicate the efforts in trying to find a through line between all of these sightings that, again, are starting to span multiple states, Wolf.",

People are reporting sightings of drones. It is very common for individuals who think they see drones to actually see small aircraft and we have a case of mistaken identity. Also, we have six different people reporting what they think is a drone and all of a sudden we have reports of six drone sightings. So, there's some duplication. I have been in touch with Governor Murphy every day. Our experts have been in touch with the New Jersey State Police every day. What we have done is we have deployed our state of the art technology. We've deployed our experts to New Jersey. That technology has not confirmed that any drone sightings. In addition, it has confirmed that some reported drone sightings are in fact small aircraft. Pilots have not reported seeing drones. That's not to say that there aren't drones, you know, flying in the air, but we have no concern at this point with respect to a threat or any nefarious activity. The reality is you can have a 15-year-old kid who buys a drone off the shelf and puts it up in the sky. We have not seen drones turn their lights off in the dark. We have not seen drones penetrate restricted airspace. Those are two indicia that would give us a cause for concern.
