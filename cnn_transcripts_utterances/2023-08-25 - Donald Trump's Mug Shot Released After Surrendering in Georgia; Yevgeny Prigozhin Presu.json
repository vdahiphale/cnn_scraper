He has an overwhelming lead in the U.S. Republican presidential race. And today Donald Trump also has a mug shot, an inmate number, and a new arena to vent his anger over what is a fourth criminal indictment. This one of course for allegedly trying to overturn election results in the U.S. state of Georgia. Required that the former president turned himself in at a jail in Atlanta. Well, he quickly promoted the mug shot on his Truth Social media platform, and also with a return to Twitter, now on this X. His first post there since getting banned after the January 6th insurrection. Nick Valencia is outside the jail where that unprecedented booking happened on Thursday night.

Well, after the apparent death of Russia's most notorious mercenary, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Kremlin is rejecting speculation that it was involved in Wednesday's plane crash in Russia. A Kremlin spokesperson says theories that it's responsible are a, quote, \"absolute lie.\" Well, it comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin had this to say about Prigozhin on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I knew Prigozhin for a very long time, since the early '90s. He was a man of difficult faith. And he made serious mistakes in life. And he achieved the results needed both for himself and when I asked him about it, for common cause. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now of course he didn't refer directly to leading that uprising that became the biggest challenge to Vladimir Putin's authority in 23 years, but clearly and a lot of Russians say this to me they believe that was of course Yevgeny Prigozhin's biggest mistake, leading a rebellion against the Kremlin. He also talks about how he had a very hard faith, Yevgeny Prigozhin. That's often a euphemism in this country, for someone who served time in prison or was an orphan, or someone like that, and of course Prigozhin served several years in prison during the Soviet period. So he comes in that criminal past. But a good businessman, a talented businessman I think is what Putin said.

Using an array of data and video evidence, CNN has investigated the flight's final moments on Wednesday. Our investigative producer Katie Polglase takes us through what we know so far and how we know it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): Falling from the sky, the plane reported to be carrying the Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. Coming two months after he launched a mutiny against Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, he was widely seen as a man on borrowed time. As footage started to emerge on social media of the crash, CNN's Open- Source team began piecing together what happened. The aircraft associated with Prigozhin is RA02795. It makes frequent trips between Moscow and St. Petersburg. CNN geolocated the main crash site to here. And you can see the same tail number visible amid the debris. The plane had left Moscow at 5.55 p.m. local time, 12 minutes later the location is no longer detectable. But public flight tracking site Flight Radar 24 still receives information on its altitude. (On-camera): The last minute of the recorded flight is key. You can see here the flight's altitude is erratic. It's going higher and lower before it eventually plummets. Now aviation experts told us this is highly unusual and it suggests those on board were trying to stabilize the plane after something happened to it. In other words, the disruption was not big enough to obliterate everyone and everything instantly. (Voice-over): Expert opinion is split on what exactly happened, likely an explosion, perhaps a bomb on board or a missile hitting it, or even something else. Whatever it was, was clearly powerful as the plane is visibly falling without a wing. The tail ends up over here, 2.6 kilometers away from where the rest of the debris lands. Videos show fires at the crash site. Some are graphic. Human remains strewn amid the debris. Since then Russian authorities have taken the bodies away for examination and began an investigation. But many have already made up their minds as to who they think was behind the Wagner aircraft's violent end. Katie Polglase, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Even if these Ukrainian pilots have flown their Soviet-era fighter jets, even engaged in combat with the Russian air force or Russian drones, there is still a tremendous process that it will take to learn to fly the F-16s. And it's not just a function of learning how to take off, fly around and land. There are missions and a pilot has to be mission capable. And quite a number of these to be signed off by an instructor saying, yes, you know how to operate the plane at its maximum capability in the air. And that process will take time. Yesterday, DOD here said that the pilots would arrive next month to begin English training in Texas. That's expecting to take several weeks. And then the F-16 training itself will begin in October. They're not putting a specific timeframe on it because they know this could take a while. Not just because of the individual skill levels of the pilots themselves but also because of their English level. And they need to be proficient enough, their English is at different levels, so they may have quite a bit to learn here. In terms of what they will be learning, the Pentagon talked about that yesterday. All the missions they will have to be ready for, to be ready to fight with this jet in the skies over Ukraine. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: They're going to teach you formation flying, basic fighter maneuvers, weapons employment. And this is going to help you transition from being a, you know, basic pilot mindset to a fighter pilot mindset. There's going to be some type of ground training involved. We've all seen the images of people going through a centrifuge training to learn how to cope with G-forces. There will be additional training on your combat maneuvering, tactical intercepts, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, because extreme heat can generate powerful storms, Europe as a whole recorded over 70 large hail storms and received nearly 100 high wind reports. Twenty-four hours later, the extreme weather continues as the level two out of three threat of severe winds and heavy rainfall has been issued from eastern France all the way to central Poland.

So when our body looks forward to cooling down, well, some people just don't have that opportunity without the use of air conditioning. Temperatures today could rival records upwards of 41 degrees Celsius. That's the heat indices. Now this is all part of the same heat wave that has gripped the nation over several hundred records broken this week. Chicago had a record yesterday of 38 degrees. Just incredible to see that kind of heat across the nation's midsection. It's so hot that the corn was sweating. Corn sweat. Google that. That is a thing, right? Well, now we've got this intersection with a major sporting event, the pinnacle of the PGA Tour Championship, happening where I'm at right now, and this tournament used to actually take place in November. And believe me, the players here and the spectators wish that it still was in November. But it hasn't happened for several, several decades. It's impossible to escape the heat here. I talked to the executive director of the tour championship, and he told me that he wants the players not to focus on extreme heat being dehydrated. He wants them to slowly square their focus on that $18 million U.S. prize money that's up for grabs from this particular tournament. They have done so many heat mitigation efforts from cooling stations, sunscreen stations, multiple shaped tents, discounted water, you name it, they've thought about it. And I actually, well, the press rather, had an opportunity to speak to the some of the golf pros to find out how they're coping with the heat wave.
