Now that former attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, has been a key witness in this case. He has this message for critics of the grand jury's decision to indict.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, FMR. PERSONAL ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: This notion of, oh, this is a weaker case than the January 6, I acknowledge that. January 6 was an insurrection but doesn't make this any less of a crime. I always call this the Capone theory, the Al Capone theory. They couldn't get him on murder, extortion, racketeering, bootlegging, et cetera, they got him on tax evasion. If that crime done was enough for me to be charged, fined, convicted and sent to prison, why am I any different than Donald Trump?

So much so that advisors were essentially believing at least some of them that the charges might actually be dropped and this is, of course, because of those media reports that said that the grand jury was not going to take up this case before they went on hiatus. They thought that this meant, at least they had a month, but they might even have more time than that.We heard specifically that the former president himself was shocked and that we heard confirmed by his lawyer, Joe Tacopina.

We also know that he had dinner last night with Melania.This is something that sources described to us as him being essentially in a good mood. He was talking to guests there. The reason why that's interesting is from so many sources we have heard throughout this process is that he has compartmentalized this event, so he might have been shocked, but he turned around and then started having dinner with his guests at Mar a Lago with his wife. So that team is still figuring all this out. You heard Kara talking about the security assessment, talking about the media access there. That's all trickling down to the Trump team. They are trying to figure out their plans now for Tuesday, but a lot of this information is going to end up coming from the Secret Service when they finish that security assessment because as we continue to say this is completely unprecedented. So this idea of having the regular security on top of having a Secret Service detail that is going to dictate a lot of what Trump does, including media access and optics.",

In 1921, President Warren G. Harding was about to be charged in a bribery scandal. It was known as Teapot Dome, but he died in office before an indictment came down. In 1974, President Nixon was destined to be charged during the Watergate scandal, but he of course resigned and then his successor President Gerald Ford, later pardoned him. Which brings us to today, The Washington Post writing this: \"The expected prosecution of Trump shatters an unwritten American political norm and brings the United States more in line with dozens of other nations, including democracies such as South Korea, Brazil, France, Italy and Israel.\" Joining us now to help put this in historical context is CNN Presidential Historian Tim Naftali. He is the former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. Tim as always, great to see you. This is unprecedented.",

But - so for us to actually experience this does represent, at least for many, a sense that we broken the norm that somehow a former president, because of the office that they once held is beyond the reach of the law. But under our law and our Constitution, it's never been the case. So Donald Trump is actually experiencing a power that the founders expected us to use, but which we've been reluctant to use up to now.",

The idea was that it'd be very hard to find a jury that hadn't already come up - had not already made up his mind about Richard Nixon.This case involving Trump is a lot easier because the details are not known to most Americans. They may know a little bit about it, but the actual details of apparently a 20 - a 30 count indictment are not known. So it'll be a lot easier to find a fair a jury of his peers and so that particular issue does not - is not there for Alvin Bragg the way it was for Leon Jaworski, and arguably would have been for Robert Ray if he had sought to indict Bill Clinton.",

I can tell you security teams have been walking around this building here behind me at 100 Centre where the arraignment will happen on Tuesday, doing security measures. We actually just saw a mobile camera being installed. Of course, there are lights as well all around this building that light up at night to make sure that this area is well seen at all times.And again, we're several days away from Tuesday, but these measures will stay intact. Inside the courtroom, I think Kara mentioned it, there - that floor where the arraignment will happen, well, it has restricted access and that's going to continue into Tuesday as well. That means only certain people can be on that floor at the moment. We're also hearing when Tuesday comes, it's very possible they may stop, put to a halt all other cases that are happening at the time of the former president's arraignment to avoid any more foot traffic in the building. Just to get a sense, we're talking about a New York City courthouse kind of coming to a standstill when the president comes in to make that arraignment. All these security measures continuing to have discussions between all the parties involved. We're talking NYPD, the FBI, the Secret Service, the Court Marshals here down at the courthouse. These conversations are fluid, they're ongoing. Now, also I want to mention behind the scenes, of course, there's a lot that we don't know with intelligence officials looking into the chatter that's online, looking at social media, chat rooms, trying to get a sense if there's going to be mobilization of people that want to come to this area between now and Tuesday or even after and create some court - some sort of chaos, of course. There's no credible threats right now, we're told by law enforcement, but that is why, as you mentioned, Bianna, the entire NYPD force is showing a presence in uniform today able to work overtime shifts go into next shift for - to work those extra shifts in case something should pop up, they're ready to mobilize, guys?",

They - the prosecutor can charge cases where they can take a fraud scheme, for example, and charge multiple instances of payments, for example, as separate counts versus charging them as one count. There's also potential here that there's a - there are charges not only for let's say the Stormy Daniels payments, the hush money payments that are at the center of this, but also for Karen McDougal and also potential, let's say, conspiracy charges as well. So I think we have a lot of leeway here that's given to prosecutors interms of how they charged the case, which is why so many of us are holding our breath and waiting to see what the indictment looks like. One thing I'll just caution our viewers though, is the number of counts while can be difficult for the defense because they have to get a jury to check not guilty 30 times as opposed to five doesn't necessarily mean that a case is stronger or weaker.",

I mean, we - obviously, there were charges that Michael Cohen pled to that were federal charges related to federal election crimes, regarding these hush money payments.Obviously while Trump was president, the DOJ has a policy that they don't charge a sitting president, but there has been reporting that the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutors there did consider whether to bring charges after Trump left office. They decided against it primarily because of concerns about the credibility of Michael Cohen who, of course, has been convicted of fraud and of lying to Congress and has made a bit of a living since - or at least over the last couple of years criticizing the former president. Now, obviously, these charges are different, right? These are falsification of business records related to those payments. We don't know all the details, but I have to say that there are serious questions about the legal theory here. And there are also questions about the sufficiency of the evidence and I think there's going to be a lot of scrutiny that's going to come once the indictment is released. So I'm withholding judgment until I've read the indictment and I understand what the evidence is. But I will - I do think that if this turns out to be basically the same case that we've known about for years and packaged differently with state court charges, I do think there'll be a lot of questions and Alvin Bragg will have a difficult road ahead.",
