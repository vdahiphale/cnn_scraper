I'm Kim Brunhuber.You may be waiting until next week to learn the outcome in a number of key races in the U.S. Midterms. But results trickling in late Thursday show that Democrats pulling ahead or catching up in several important contests. Republicans still hold the edge in the House with 211 wins. But still possible for Democrats to reach a majority with 218 seats. Three Senate seats have yet to be decided. As of now, CNN projects Republicans will have 49 seats, Democrats 48. In Nevada, incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is closing the gap on Republican Adam Laxalt with tens of thousands of votes to still be counted. And in Arizona, incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly is expanding his lead over Republican Blake Masters. CNN estimates show about half a million votes yet to be counted there. Arizona's governor race is also too close to call. And Republican candidate Kari Lake is openly accusing election officials without evidence of deliberately slowing down the vote count.

So, for a lot of women, there were actually a lot of older women who made up their mind later on in this election, which is unusual. But they were, you know, making decisions along these lines. And I do think that what we are seeing with abortion is that it really varies from state to state. In states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, that did become a top concern for many of the women who are voting there. And that's why we saw strong Democratic victories in those states. Whereas in other states, like Nevada, we are seeing potentially inflation ending up coming out on top in those decisions.",

We are seeing a lot of, you know, conspiracy theories being spread on social media among right-wing figures.

And President Biden I'm sure will be trying to highlight his legislative wins this year in terms of moving the U.S. into a more positive frame when it comes to climate change.But there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done. Some 45 percent is needed to cut on current pledges of emissions to get anywhere close to the Paris Agreement, 1.5 degrees Celsius. That was seen as the threshold to avoiding the worst of the climate crisis. So, I'm sure the president will be showing off his agenda trying to show leadership. One of the big issues here, though, is the fact that China and the U.S., the two biggest emitters have not been talking. I spoke to the climate envoy, Secretary John Kerry, and asked him whether formal talks were happening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY:  We're not formally negotiating at this point, but our hope is that when they're short span of time, it will become possible for us to really get together again in full measure and do the things we need to be doing as the two leading emitters in the world and as the two largest economies in the world. China and the United States really need to cooperate on this. And without China, even if the U.S. is, as we are moving towards a 1.5-degree program, which we are, if we don't have China, nobody else can make to that goal. And we blow through 1.5 and it will cost citizens around the world trillions of more dollars.",

What President Biden has said is we can compete, but we don't have to be confrontational. We don't have to be in conflict, and I think that's what is critical here, is that we deal with the issues and there are real differences between our countries, obviously, but climate should not fit into that bilateral pattern of those issues.(END VIDEOTAPE)",

I appreciate your reporting out there in Sharm El-Sheikh, David McKenzie.Medical centers in the U.S. are reporting long wait times and a lack of facilities due to a spike in respiratory illnesses. Hospitals in Boston have been swamped with children suffering from the virus RSV, leaving many pediatric ICU units low on beds. According to the Center -- U.S. Centers for Disease Control 22 states are reporting high or very high respiratory illness activity. The outbreak coincides with a flu season that's hitting harder and earlier than usual. The number of flu cases, hospitalizations and deaths nearly doubled in the last week of October and jumped again in the first week of November. At least two people have died due to what was Hurricane Nicole. The powerful storm made landfall early Thursday along Florida's East Coast. Dozens of beachfront homes and hotels have been declared unsafe in the wake of the storm. Thousands across the state remain without power. One man describes seeing the damage to his home. Here he is. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRIP VALIGORSKI, HURRICANE NICOLE VICTIM:  I don't know, it's honestly just kind of shocked, so still haven't really processed it, but definitely, definitely crazy.

      "sentences": "Yes, it really does. In fact, Hurricane Nicole finishing what Hurricane Ian started roughly 40 days ago. Remember, Hurricane Ian slammed into the Florida Peninsula at the end of September. It really compromised many of the coastlines, including Daytona Beach and those areas you saw on the video just a moment ago.And it just took another category one, a weaker storm than Ian to come through and do this. It really compromised the structures. Can you imagine if this was your house or your business? That's priceless memories, just being swept out to see very, very scary moments for people there. And just really sad to actually have to clean up after another, yet another hurricane. Look at this. This is the same system. It is now a tropical depression churning about the southeastern U.S. But I want you to take note of this shading of red. That is where the storm prediction center has issued a tornado watch. And just within the past 15 minutes or so, it has just been canceled since I've been waiting to go live here. But we did have a tornado warning for Columbia, South Carolina. This is very typical with a tropical storm that's moving into the area just off the coastline, so that draws in the instability and allows for some of those spin up thunderstorms to form a tornado or two. And that threat of tornadoes exists across the mid-Atlantic and into the nation's capital today as well. Marginal risk for you. Now, I want you to see that shading of white on the northern portions of our country, that is a full on blizzard that has been taking shape. I'll explain why that's important in just a moment, but let's take you to Bismarck, North Dakota so you can see that first taste of winter that is impacting the U.S. right now. Wow. Remember that? It's been a while, right? Well, it's coming and you know, we are a set to see more scenes just like this as we get our first lake enhanced snow event. That is coming through. Get back to the graphics and you'll see the remnants of Nicole that'll interact with that what was a blizzard maker. And that's going to produce a very wet and rainy weekend along the eastern seaboard, at least from today right through Saturday. You can see the rainfall totals here exceeding three to four inches, especially for some of the northern interior of New England, as well as the mid-Atlantic states. So, we're going to look out for some travel disruptions across the region. Now, we're also anticipating some snowfall down wind of the Great Lakes as well. So, lots going on. This is the changeover of seasons. We had a tropical storm and a blizzard, both of them working together to create kind of travel headache this weekend. Kim?",
