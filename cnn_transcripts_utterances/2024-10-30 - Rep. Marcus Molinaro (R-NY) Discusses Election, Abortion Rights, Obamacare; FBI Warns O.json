MARCUS MOLINARO (R-NY): I want to be sure, first, that the laws in the state of New York are not -- not diminished at all. And that I think is the first priority for me. I do not support a national abortion ban. And I won't. I'm the first Republican to embrace and seek to sponsor legislation to protect both IVF and birth control in this country. And I remain committed to it. And I also believe in expanding, as I have by leading the bipartisan coalition, access to health care so that women have quality care, no matter the decision they make. I want to be sure that any action that's taken -- I don't know that the Senate can move on much of anything -- but any action that's taken does not at all infringe on the rights of New Yorkers. And that the law in the state of New York is protected and access and rights that are given New Yorkers are preserved.",

I've been fighting to broaden access to ensure that those families that live with intellectual, physical and developmental disabilities have broader access to both physical and behavioral health care.

JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, this comes from IC3, which is the Internet Crime Complaint Center, run by the FBI. And they've been getting these complaints and have identified some of these games. So what you should be looking out for is what they call the Campaign Investment Pool Scam. That's when somebody calls you up and says, you know, if you donate money, you'll be one of the early investors here. And when we hit our goal and we exceed that, we can start sending that money back. So give the money now and you'll get a return on that money and you should recruit others to donate, too, because you'll get the money back. Basically, this isn't any campaign calling. This is a Ponzi scam, a pyramid scheme. And they've seen a lot of that. Another is the scam political action committee. They say, we're this PAC, we represent this cause. But they may not even exist. They're just getting you to send money to a portal where they can take it in and launder it. This is one of those things where you go to the FEC Web site and you say, does this PAC exist? And then you go to its Web site and say, does it look real? Merchandise scams, you order the stuff, you pay for it. The stuff doesn't exist and the stuff never comes. And the scam voter registration, this is a key one. Because this is when they call you up and say, let's get you registered to vote and they get all kinds of personal information, which has nothing to do with registering for you to vote. That's for identity theft. So there's a lot of these scams out there now.",

Instead of receiving a text stating that people were not registered to vote, last weekend, thousands of voters there received a text claiming that they had already voted.

But that -- that all important in 2022 part was left out of the texts. John, how can people protect themselves from this other misleading election-related conduct?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Brianna. Israeli, American and Lebanese officials are, indeed, stepping up their discussions around the potential ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.And one of the centerpieces of those discussions has been the possibility of a short-term ceasefire, perhaps at least lasting a month between the two parties, during which time they would ultimately negotiate a final deal to end the war between the two sides. And also to implement U.N. Resolution 1701, which led to the end of the two 2006 war between those two parties. That would, of course, involve the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces some 30 kilometers north of the Israel-Lebanon border. Israeli officials believe that now is the right time for them to pursue these ceasefire negotiations after having achieved some really significant military gains against Hezbollah over the course of the last couple of months, namely killing Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. And so now the question is, Will Hezbollah feel similarly? And clearly, they have expressed openness to ceasefire negotiations. For the time being, though, Israeli officials are also making clear that these negotiations that are happening now are going to continue, quote, under fire, as one Israeli official told me, And that's exactly what we've been seeing this week as the Israeli military has really been stepping up its airstrikes in Lebanon. Today, we saw evacuation orders issued for the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon. This is a historic city where some 80,000 people have been living. The city was ordered to evacuate and, then hours later, we saw a series of very intense airstrikes, some enormous fireballs resulting from some of those strikes. So clearly, Israel is showing that even as it is willing to engage in these stepped-up negotiations with some top U.S. officials set to arrive in Israel tomorrow, they are also not going to let up on the military pressure.",

He tweeted on Friday about the FDA, that they've, quote, \"aggressively suppressed things like psychedelics, raw milk, Ivermectin, clean foods, sunshine and exercise.\" He says, \"If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you. One, preserve your records. And, two, pack your bags. He has also talked about cleaning out the NIH of infectious disease research.
