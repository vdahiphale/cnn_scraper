But, in this final hour, we haven't seen any of the other members who have been questioning their support of Johnson, definitively come out and say they are against him. So, there is just a lot of unknowns here.But, Johnson has been working behind the scenes, trying to shore up his support. He has been quick to say, though, he is not making any side deals in order to get votes. He is just trying to open up this process and let members who are frustrated be heard. But, there is a lot of frustration, especially among the far right. Let's take a listen to what Thomas Massie has to say about why he is not supporting Mike Johnson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): I am the one hell no. They say there is up to five or six who may be voting no. You can count on me to be a no. You can pull all my fingernails out.

Republicans do not want the chaos that would ensue if Johnson -- if they can't elect a Speaker. I mean, also, as you mentioned, January 6, which is the certification of the election on Monday, is going to have some serious challenges if there is not a Speaker of the House elected.So, Republicans know what's at stake. They have been given the majorities in both chambers of Congress, and that is the argument that Johnson and his allies are using in these meetings, trying to get these holdouts on board, because they know that with Trump's backing, they have to try and move forward. And the argument here is chaos is not good for Republicans, as they try and show that they can lead.",

Obviously, it took not just 15 rounds of voting, but he had to make so many compromises, right, and so many side deals in order to eventually clinch the speakership. Clearly, in hindsight, that may have been a mistake for him. Walk us through what Mike Johnson is going to have to do this time around. Can you see the same sort of thing where, yes, let's say he doesn't win on the first ballot, that eventually, though, he will have to make some similar types of compromises?",

The last time around, it was after a midterm election. A Democratic President was still in office. There was no certification of the election, days away from when the Speaker election was, and Donald Trump, at that time, was still trying to push for Kevin McCarthy, obviously not in the extreme way that he is pushing for Mike Johnson now, but was pushing for Kevin McCarthy. You'll remember the images on the House floor of Marjorie Taylor Greene holding up her phone with Donald Trump on the phone, trying to get the last few members of the far right Freedom Caucus to (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY). Obviously, we saw that. It didn't work, and it only worked at the end because he gave up so much of his power, and that ended up in his removal.But, what you'll see in this case is that Mike Johnson has not only the backing of Donald Trump, but he has the extreme support of the majority of the caucus. We do not see the same numbers that Kevin McCarthy had, and that's because Mike Johnson is relatively new to this job. He hasn't had a lot of time to make a lot of people as angry as Kevin McCarthy had over his decade-long leadership of the Republican conference. So, I think that the terms and the consequences of what happens if Johnson is not elected Speaker today is much, much different than what happened with McCarthy.",

You can claw out all my fingernails. I am not voting for that man, is essentially what he said.So, let's just say that he doesn't win on the first ballot, and that -- it goes into another round of voting, which is likely at this point in time, what does he need to do between those ballots, between those votes, to get more people on board? He has already said that he is not willing to make any side deals. There is not going to be any quid pro quo.",

I think what we're going to see is a lot of what we saw with Kevin McCarthy, which is on the floor, live negotiations between (TECHNICICAL DIFFICULTY) two or three people that may hold out until the second or third ballot. We might see -- one of the things up for negotiation is whether Representative Chip Roy of Texas would become the Chairman of the Rules Committee, which is a powerful Committee that decides whether or not legislation gets onto the House floor. That is still up for negotiation.Obviously, last time around, Chip Roy and several of his far-right colleague getting on the Rules Committee was part of the compromise that Kevin McCarthy made. Whether or not Johnson will take that even further and make Roy a chair, will be interesting to see. That might be something we see on the floor. But, I do think a lot of this, and I'm saying this after having talked to Republicans in the last hour, a lot of this is a hazing effort. I think Republicans know after what happened with McCarthy, that they can get away with this kind of stuff, that they can push leaders to far extent, and sometimes even for the TV hit, sometimes even for just getting attention for a freshman member, a sophomore member, who normally wouldn't get the attention, is able to become the main character of the day, if they hold out long enough, and Johnson might throw something at them while on the House floor just to get this process over with. [11:10:00] But, I would agree with what Annie said. I think we'll see likely by the end of the day that Mike Johnson will become the Speaker of the House again because of the stakes of what happens if he doesn't.

But, the truth is, the speakership job is a thankless, impossible job, because it's so difficult to really unite such a divided party.

You'll see Tom Emmer, the majority whip, and then Jim Jordan, who is someone I spent a lot of time covering, who really is what many of the folks that are having issues with Johnson see as a solution to him.And -- but, at the end of the day, the math problem that Annie and you have talked about is still there with those individuals. And Johnson, given that he has already been Speaker and he is currently Speaker right now, has the leg up on that, and has the backing of President Donald Trump that none of those people have at this current moment, and not to say that Trump wouldn't switch his support if that came up.

We won the popular vote by millions of votes. We had a great election, and it would be nice to cement the election with an election here. I mean, that would just be a big, beautiful exclamation point.\" Now, Trump has not only been publicly endorsing Mike Johnson, but he has been privately making calls on his behalf as well, trying to convince some of these skeptical Republicans that it's time to fall in line, including conversations with individuals like Texas Representative Chip Roy, someone who has been immensely critical of Johnson's leadership, saying, ultimately, quote, \"Chip Roy will do what is right for this country.\" So, he believes very strongly that right now, only one Republican, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, will be the only vote against Mike Johnson.

Well, ultimately, dozens of Republicans voted to do just that, and Trump ultimately stepped away from that challenge. So, it will be interesting to see what does happen. But, he is so out there for Mike Johnson right now, not only becausethe two have been especially close since the election, but also because Donald Trump wants to be very active in his first 100 days, and he doesn't need a Speaker of the House who will be learning on the job. He wants someone who understands what it will take to muscle through his agenda and potentially pass a new spending plan through a reconciliation bill. Those are not easy tasks with someone who will be -- have training wheels.

We have not only his supporters, but the equivalent of South Korea's Secret Service protecting the President and refusing to turn over suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol to investigators, investigators who want to hold him accountable for putting this country down the road of martial law, declaring martial law one month ago, on December 3rd, into the early morning hours of December 4th.

I mean, there is no recession in sight. Gas prices are in check. Paychecks are increasing faster than prices. All that is really good. But, of course, there are risks out there, and one of those risks is the fact that the market has gone up so much. I mean, the S&amp;P 500 added $10 trillion in value last year alone. It was the first time that we've seen back-to-back years of 20 percent or more increases for the S&amp;P 500 since the late 1990s under Bill Clinton.And there are some growing concerns that perhaps some of this is starting to get out of hand, that some parts of the stock market have price tags that are untethered to reality. We heard from UBS recently, warning its clients that six of the seven preconditions to a bubble already exist, including the fact that it's been a quarter century since the last bubble, the fact that retail investors are participating, and that there is this this time is different mindset that has creeped in over technology. Now, UBS says that they don't think that we're in a bubble right now, but they do see a 35 percent chance that we're going to get there. And Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, he told me that he hasn't been this concerned about markets being overvalued since the late 1990s just before the bursting of dotcom bubble. Now, Zandi doesn't expect anything like that kind of market crash, but he is worried about a severe market downturn, one that could really endanger the economy, right? I mean, he pointed out that consumer spending is the number one driver of this economy, and that if markets are down dramatically, a lot of people are going to both feel less wealthy and actually be less wealthy, and they could spend less. So, Zain, at this point, this is just a risk, but it is one that we need to keep on our radar.",

Of course, one of them, or more than one of them, could ultimately stumble, and that could cause the whole group, and perhaps the whole market, to retreat.We're also talking right now about the House of Representatives trying to elect a new Speaker of the House, and at some point, they're going to have to get the debt ceiling raised and diffuse that ticking time bomb. That's another risk that's out there. There is also obviously the incoming administration's policies around tariffs and deportations and whether or not that could be inflationary. And lastly, we do need to keep an eye on what's happening in the bond market, because we are starting to see some signs that investors are getting more worried about enormous federal budget deficits. And again, the Trump administration wants to perhaps add to the deficit by doing more tax cuts. And so, if you saw a big negative reaction in the bond market, that is something that could ultimately hurt the stock market too. I do think, at the end of the day, Zain, it's important to emphasize that it's almost impossible to time the market. And experts say that long-term investors, retail investors, they should try to look past any potential market drop, because in the long run, those market sell- offs, even a bear market, kind of looks like a blip, and investors should really be focusing on the long run and all of the strengths in the U.S. economy.

Now, fans, we heard from Thursday, said they felt completely safe walking around New Orleans with the amount of law enforcement that was on the ground there, and they were happy the game was being played, because you can't let the terrorist win. Now, before the Sugar Bowl, an emotional moment of silence was held in the Super Dome to honor those who lost their lives and were affected by Wednesday's attack.As for the game, Notre Dame had one of the greatest one minute of football in their school's history, tied at three, late in the first half. The Irish kicked the field goal to go up 6-3. They then got a strip sack and recovered the fumble, and quarterback Riley Leonard hit Beaux Collins for a 13-yard touchdown before half time. Notre Dame then got the second half kickoff, and Jayden Harrison would take it 98 yards for the touchdown. The Irish scoring 17 points in just 54 seconds of game time. Georgia would never recover from that one minute, as Notre Dame wins the Sugar Bowl 23-10. Here was Fighting Irish head coach Marcus Freeman afterwards on how his team handled the past 24 hours.",
