Later today, Donald Trump's lawyers will be in a Florida courtroom taking aim at the prosecutor who brought criminal charges against the former president over his handling of classified documents at Mar-a- Lago federal judge, Aileen Cannon will hear arguments on a request by Trump to declare Jack Smith's appointment as special counsel in the case invalid. Trump is not expected to attend. But the decision by the judge to hear that request adds to the growing questions and criticism of our handling of the case and whether she slow-walking. Similar challenges from Trump and other high-level special counsel targets like Hunter Biden and Paul Manafort have fallen flat. Yet this hearing comes as \"The New York Times\" reports two federal judges urged Judge Aileen Cannon to hand off the classified documents case, but Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, wanted to keep the case and brushed off the requests according to that report. One of the judges named in the article, Cecilia Altonaga, chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, declined to comment to CNN. \"The New York Times\" did not name the other judge. Now, joining me now to discuss, CNN legal analyst, Joey Jackson. Joey, great to see you. Good morning. This is pretty unusual request to -- unusual to hear a quiet to dismiss a special counsel. Is there a legitimate reason for Aileen Cannon and granting this hearing today?",

I think what occurs and we could seriously have an argument as to whether she's drag this out, slow roll this, gone down rabbit holes, entertained issues that should not be entertained, but ultimately, if you're going to look at the special appointment and its propriety. I think it's important then to determine whether or not the special counsel was appointed properly, whether or not it should have been done by Congress, whether or not the appointment being done by the attorney general was appropriate?I don't think it carries much weight, but I think ultimately if the American people after hearing reached the determination that there's nothing to see here, then the matter goes forward confidently. Nobody questions that dynamic of whether this is a political prosecution or otherwise. And so I don't question whether or not this should be this proceeding. I just question then the nature and manner, Manu, in which she is handled the entirety of this proceeding from the outset.",

You are involved in this case in an earlier time.There was a search warrant dealing with Mar-a-Lago that you may rulings upon, the optics may not be fair or appropriate, particularly when you made decisions early on in terms of the FBI's looking and search warrant, and it was favorable to Trump. It got reversed by an appellate court. They really use some strong language against you, maybe you should move on. And so, she made the decision not to and to keep the case what she could. But the fact that other judges came to her says that it's not just the public who had been a concern at the outset. Her colleagues had a concern and that's troubling.",

Maybe they'll ruled in his favor, but a very least, they have some key succeeded in delaying the two federal cases against him.

That's the nature of it, happens all the time, right?But the reality also is, is that it's a system that is available to everyone. You just can't cherry pick and when a judge doesn't do things that are favorable to you, say hell two-tiered system, it's rigged, it's ridiculous. But when they do things your way, oh, great, judge. This is how it should be. So, you know, you say great things about a judge who makes rulings that are favorable, but anyone who makes a ruling on favorable to you, oh, it's a rigged. It's, you know, it's really a political hit job. That's not the way it works. We've seen the prosecution of Hunter Biden really, Joe Biden's son, that to me demonstrates that everyone's being scrutinized and looked at, and people are being held accountable for conduct, whether you're Democrat, Republican, or otherwise, this is our system of justice.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yet another U.S. citizen on trial in Russia. This is Ksenia Karelina from Los Angeles, now in a glass cage near Yekaterinburg. The dual Russian citizen, the 33-year-old, was arrested on treason charges earlier this year while visiting family. In the U.S., she's a beautification and amateur ballerina accused of donating just over $50 to a Ukrainian charity. Her boyfriend, Chris Van Heerden, issuing a new statement obtained by OUTFRONT calling for her immediate release. It's hard to believe Ksenia that's been in Russia on unable to return to the U.S. for over six months, he wrote. She is an innocent young woman with her whole life ahead of her. Her friends and supporters are hopeful that the Russian courts we'll see that prosecuting her is a mistake, and send her home to Los Angeles. Hi. Matthew from CNN. Are you holding up, all right? No, no questions. But Russia is now holding a growing number of U.S. citizens in jail, like \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, whose trial for espionage is set to start next week.

Some people getting relief this morning, mainly northern New England while the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic start to build up the heat once again. So you see all the heat alerts in place, New York, Philadelphia, all the way to Washington stretching westward towards the southwestern portions of Michigan. But it's not just there. Look at the western side of the country as well. So over 100 million Americans impacted by this excessive heat today, some of the records we broke yesterday. Here's a few examples. Hartford, Connecticut 98 degrees. So here's what it feels like as you step outside today, this includes the humidity and boy that is just plain old uncomfortable for the nations capital. It's tomorrow where we believe the mercury in the thermometer will climb to at least 100 degrees. So yes, records that's in the forecast through the weekend. And you can see that triple-digit heat impact in places like Philadelphia and D.C., New York shy of that, but still hot, very humid, more the same across the southeast as well. So that's the big story along the East Coast. Rain in the potential of flooding across the upper Midwest, namely into Minnesota. And this is the remnants of Alberto. And remember fires across portions of New Mexico, ongoing drought conditions rained too much of it in a short period of time and very drought conditions. And that, of course, leads to the potential of flash flooding. So that's why we have of these flood watches in place for the area and not to mention the heavy rain that is ongoing across a southern sections of Minneapolis. You can see some of our rainfall totals through Saturday could exceed a half a foot and we don't take much rain to really start to bring some problems to the southwestern parts of the U.S. So, Manu, from heat to flash flooding.
