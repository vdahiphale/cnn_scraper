And they had for one thing, houses in Paris. They had a lavish amounts of money that the coup d'etat pooches found in their houses, even in the last few hours.And so there was a lot of corruption there and the election was very dubious indeed.

On the other hand, I spoke to the La Liga FA, the Women's League president, yesterday, and she said, you know, while it's disappointing, there's a sort of divine justice that this is happening. That what's happening to Rubiales is happening because of the issue of women's football. And there are deep structural problems within the federation.You know, we had a chance to look at this by speaking with the man who filed the original complaint at the World Cup. And keep in mind, the number of complaints has now, you know, blown up to 16. So there's a lot more to come. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (voice-over): At the moment of Spain's triumph, an unwanted kiss now threatens to bring down Luis Rubiales, the powerful president of the Spanish Football Federation. Rubiales apologized, but it was not enough, and he became the target of national anger. A wave against sexism and sport triggered in part by Miguel Angel Galan at his unassuming office in Madrid. Officially the head of the National Training Center for Football Coaches, unofficially the longtime nemesis of Rubiales and the Football Federation. He says he has filed more than 50 complaints against the Federation, one of which landed the previous president in prison. Now, he hopes to take down another with this kiss. It was a sexist and intolerable act, a chauvinistic act, he said to CNN, by a president who is already plagued by corruption scandals and sexism. Steeped in tradition, Spain's Royal Football Federation has long ruled over the nation's lucrative football fortunes. When this furor broke, Spain's prosecutor was already investigating Rubiales for trafficking in influence and bribery. Allegations, Rubiales, has consistently denied. CNN has reached out to both the federation and Rubiales. Neither have responded. And now women footballers have entered the professional ranks. They are demanding equal pay, rights and structural change, says the president of Spain's women's league, La Liga F, Beatriz Alvarez, who's had her own disagreements with Rubiales. In that federation meeting, that totally delirious speech he made, she says, look at how they applauded him. It is unacceptable. It shows that more than the president has to change, the entire model has to change. As the scandal grows, at the Rubiales hometown church, his mother went on hunger strike to support her embattled son. Briefly hospitalized, she continues to defend his innocence, even as others close to him are speaking out. His own uncle, Juan Rubiales, told Spanish news \"El Mundo\" that the kiss was just the tip of the iceberg. I was not surprised by that at all, he said. He is an extremely arrogant man who has not acted as a president should. Instead of being a political leader, he wanted to be a warrior who sees ghosts and enemies everywhere, he said. In the end, his own worst enemy was himself. Spain's historic win at the Women's World Cup, it seems is forging a path for change in more ways than one. (END VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (on camera): Now the Federation is trying to push ahead with business as usual -- as you point out -- with this press conference with de la Fuente expected in under 2 hours. But you know, keep in mind, that de la Fuente was one of those who actually applauded Rubiales when he defiantly refused to resign. So there have been many calling for de la Fuente's resignation as well. And he's bound to face some questions over that in the press conference -- Bianca and Max.",
