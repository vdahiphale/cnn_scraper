      "sentences": "The U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether a ban on bump stocks enacted under former President Donald Trump should stand.Today, justices heard arguments made by a Texas gun store owner, who claims the ATF overstepped its authority when it banned the accessories. Remember, the ban came after the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest in U.S. history, when a gunman opened fire from the window of a hotel, killing 58 concert-goers and hurting hundreds more. He used a semi-automatic rifle that was equipped with a bump stock so that it fired like a machine gun. CNN senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, was in the courtroom today hearing arguments. Joan, it seems like the court was very divided over the arguments.",

And that the better reading on the text, not talking about good government policy at all, on the text, would go to the government here.",

      "sentences": "All right. Let's discuss this now with CNN contributor and senior \"news writer at \"The Trace,\" Jennifer Mascia, here.All right. So, Jennifer, let's talk about this. What did you glean from Justice Neil Gorsuch asking today why the ATF, which is a federal agency, is banning bump stocks rather than Congress? it's a similar sentiment we heard from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. JENNIFER MASCIA, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Right. Well, what they're referring to is the 1934 National Firearms Act. And they're saying, well, you know, if it's a single trigger pole -- you know, well, obviously, bump stocks are only a twenty-year-old technology, right? There's no way that Congress in 1934 could have anticipated anything like that. So they're saying, if there is a difference between the amount of effort that a user has to put into a device that makes it function like a machine gun versus the single trigger pull that was the standard at the time, was there any distinction made? And should there be now? And so that's really what dominated a lot of the talk today. But what's interesting is that ultimately this is not a Second Amendment argument. This is whether the ATF exceeded its rulemaking authority. So while the Second Amendment argument kind of dominated today, and these features of the gun, could it be considered a machine gun? Ultimately, that's not what this particular case is going to be decided on.",

      "speaker": "MASCIA",
      "sentences": "Well, what's interesting is that there was just another case this week where the ATF's rulemaking authority was upheld.So a federal judge in California -- and, of course, that's a very liberal state -- you know, said the ATF's new rules on ghost gun kits, which it implemented via or after an executive order, actually didn't go far enough, that they could have gone farther in their rulemaking authority outside of Congress. So it's really interesting to see what different courts are finding. The Supreme Court, ultimately, is weighing in on this once and for all. And that will affect the entire country. Now bump stocks are not nearly as widely owned as pistols or any other firearms. This is a small subset of the firearms community. You know, recreational shooters who enjoy, put -- you know, sending 400 bullets are 700 bullets at a time toward a target. So ultimately, this is not going to affect the majority of gun owners or anything close. But it is a gun rights argument that is held very near and dear to that particular community",

But we don't see these in a lot of shootings.So the argument could be made that it's more important to vet a gun owner and not the device, you know, whether it's a bump stock or assault weapon. Any kind of different device, these are cosmetic changes. Ultimately, it's the owner and their intent with it. And maybe it's more important to focus on that than the actual, you know, device.

And they found that daily cannabis use was associated with a 42 percent increased risk of stroke and 25 percent increased risk of heart attack. Now, this is an association. It's not a causation study. But it does parallel what previous research has found when looking at marijuana use and associations with your cardiovascular health. And one researcher specifically talking about smoking marijuana really said in a statement, quote, \"Cannabis smoke is not all that different from tobacco smoke, except for the psychoactive drug.\" We're talking about THC versus nicotine. But it's the smoke itself that one researcher really kind of homed in on as a concern and having impacts not just on -- most of us think of our lungs -- but on our heart health as well -- Boris?",

So like you said, Boris, those older in age, those younger in age, this association was found.

As you've just acknowledged, she's 50 points shy of tying Pete Maravich, 51 shy of surpassing the record. And so at her current pace, she will do it in the final game of the season, which will be against their biggest rivals, Ohio State. However, in theory, it could happen in this game tonight.

(END VIDEO CLIP) RIDDELL: So I said that she's likely to break the record in the final game of the regular season, but there is a chance that she actually does it tonight. Because, remember, just a couple of weeks ago, when she broke the women's record, she's called 49 points that night, which was a career- best.
