They're defined as \"the intent to intimidate or harass another person, in whole or in part, because of that person's actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, or their sexual orientation.\"Before 2021, Colorado had prosecutors -- prosecutors had to prove that a defendant's acts had been motivated solely by hate. But now the law requires them to establish only that bias was a factor in the case, not the sole motivation. For perspective on this, let's bring in criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky. She has prosecuted hate crime cases. So you are the perfect guest to talk to us about this, because that's been a big part of this conversation, is what -- if this is going to be, potentially, an avenue for them to go down. And I know two things that stick out. One, that this is, obviously, a club that caters to the LGBTQ community. There are only two of them in Colorado Springs, we were told yesterday by some of the guests. And, of course, this attack came on the Transgender Remembrance Day to talk about people who had been killed. And so do those two factors -- how much do they weigh on what prosecutors will be looking at here?",

When you're talking about hate crimes or bias crimes, as in Colorado, the prosecutors are going to be needing to look at a lot of circumstantial evidence to prove the motivations behind the attack.Because it's one thing to have victims who are part of a marginalized group, but to prove that that was the reason and the drive, or at least in part of the drive, behind the crime, that's what you're looking at. So of course, the location of the crime, the day of the crime. Any sort of past statements, any future statements that are made by the suspect in this case are all going to play into whether they can prove that motivation. And as you mentioned, they don't have to prove that that was the only motivating factor, but it has to be, at least in part, something that can be shown primarily through circumstantial evidence. Here, I don't think we've heard a lot of statements from the alleged shooter relating to the motivation behind this. But there are those factors you mentioned.

So, the enhancement of a hate crime isn't going to practically expand anything. Colorado repealed their death penalty a couple of years ago. So in terms of the ultimate outcome here, if he is, in fact, convicted of one or more of the murder charges, then the outcome of the hate crime isn't going to change that sentence.

We do think that this is really more of a demand issue, as opposed to a supply. It's more spot shortages that we think will hopefully resolve in the next couple of months as we see cases go down for the winter season, hopefully. But it is really this combination, unprecedented, of the RSV, the flu and the COVID all at the same time, that's really causing this.

This isn't a situation where this is the only drug that can be given if a patient needs it. Also, there may be other pharmacies that parents or patients can go to to get the drug that they need. It may be a further drive, but they can hopefully get it. And finally, I think the important point is to test, test, test. Because there are tests available for RSV, for the flu and for COVID.

And we've sort of been operating under this mantra. So many people, for example, come into my office and say, Well, I have good cholesterol. So I don't have to worry about anything else. And I think this study really points to the fact that we can't just look at the good cholesterol. In fact, in this study, good cholesterol did not necessarily predict lower risk for either whites or blacks. But the interesting finding, as well, was that low HDL was predictive only for white people for increased risk of coronary heart disease but not for black individuals.

In terms of my situation before the U.S. game, I was told by FIFA, as I said publicly and also by U.S. Soccer, that wearing a rainbow shirt, having a rainbow flag would not be a problem at all here in Qatar. FIFA was going to make sure that that was not an issue for fans, for media, for any visitors. I showed up at the stadium last night, and instantly, I was pushed aside by the security guards at the media entrance, and I was told explicitly, You need to take off your shirt. That's a political statement, and you cannot enter because of that. I refused to take off my shirt. I did get a tweet off, thankfully, about it. I wasn't really planning on putting out publicly that I was wearing the shirt until I was detained. They forcibly took my phone out of my hands for 30 minutes.
