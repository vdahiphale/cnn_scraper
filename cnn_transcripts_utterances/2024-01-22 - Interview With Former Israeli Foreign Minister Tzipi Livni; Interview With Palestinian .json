Fifteen weeks into the October 7 war, and divisions inside Israel are spilling into the open. Hostage families stormed into Knesset today to protest Prime Minister Netanyahu's handling of the war on Hamas and Gaza, and demanding negotiations to free their kidnapped loved ones. Meantime, a new poll shows Netanyahu's support to be at nearly rock bottom, and his Likud Party coming a distant second if there were to be an election today. As a senior military voice in the War Cabinet, former Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot called for immediate elections and demanded the government tell \"the truth\" to the people about the war's stated goals and achievements. Overseas, the E.U. top diplomat, Josep Borrell, blasts Netanyahu's rejection of the two-state solution, which the United States and the International Community back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: The other solution they have in mind, to make all the Palestinians live, to kill off them. Twenty-five thousand already in Gaza. 70 percent are women and children. Certainly, the way you're trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think that these are dramatic moments, not only in terms of Israeli politics, but this will define the future Israel security, the future of Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. And therefore, I think that we should all focus on what is the alternative for Hamas, how can we keep Israel security, and how to work with and not against our allies and first and foremost, the United States that stands with Israel since day one and offer some ideas about regional, security matters. The Saudis are speaking about normalization, and of course they cannot abandon the Palestinians, but this can create new opportunities for the future.

And frankly, when we need to choose who will control Gaza, so the option -- the real options are Hamas, no way. Israel doesn't and shouldn't take care of 2 million of Palestinians that are there. We don't want to re-occupy Gaza. We just need to take care of our security. So, the third option is a Palestinian regime. Whether it's the P.A. or others, but we need to deal with it. We need to give an answer to this now, because otherwise the Hamas will continue. They can, you know, try to survive the next day to be the regime in Gaza again and threatens not only Israel, but also the Palestinians in Gaza.

So, he said what he said recently that, first of all, should not have come as a surprise. Now, in terms of your other points about it -- does he not worry about going publicly against a position stated by the United States? I think when he really sees that there are consequences with actions and things he says, he would, for all he might be. I don't know if he's irrational.

And in some ways, they need to stop wanting to be as loved as they now are and have a sweet bedside manner and be tougher about saving lives to think maybe more like George Patton and less like Florence Nightingale, that it used to be that if you were public health leader, you had to make really tough decisions about how you were going to stop an infectious disease. I mean, we're very lucky now we now have. We have bottled oxygen, which we didn't have in 1918 during the 1918 flu. We have antibiotics for secondary infections. We have ventilators and echo machines and all these other things. Had we not had those things, 2020 might have been worse than 1918 if we'd had the technology back then. And you have to be able to step in at the same -- to buy time until you can produce the vaccines, the monoclonal antibodies and the drugs that will allow you to actually stop the epidemic through pharmaceutical means. And that is essentially my argument. And some countries did better at that. Nobody likes it when you use the example of China.

I mean, the death rate of every country in Asia, whether it's an autocracy like China or whether it's a semi-democracy like South Korea or Japan, but I shouldn't say semi-democracy, you know, they did much better than we did.

Did it cost too much on the economy and all the -- you know, the sort of domino effects that that had? You still come down on that then, do you, on the strict lockdowns, the mask wearings, and things like that? MCNEIL JR.: Well, you have to understand, everybody sort of focuses on, oh, lockdowns, oh, schools. Lockdowns shouldn't have lasted as long as they did. Masks shouldn't have lasted as long as they did. The problem is that if you have, you know, a sort of lockdown light, a kind of garden party version of a lockdown, if you have masks, whereas some people wear masks and some people don't, and people get tired of it and people don't want to accept the vaccines, then of course it doesn't work very well. You know, the country's the -- all these \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\" like masks, like quarantining and stuff, only work for short periods of time when people are actually scared.

And it's an ongoing battle and it's polarized and it's given the Republicans in Congress a lot of of ammunition to beat up on Tony Fauci with and beat up on scientists with. But the truth is, it doesn't really make any difference. We need better lab protocols if you are going to do any sort of dangerous research. And doing gain of function research is like doing nuclear weapons research, it's extremely dangerous, but if you're going to have a nuclear arsenal, maybe you need to do it.",

And you were on the record as warning everybody that this is the big one. Thank you so much, Donald McNeil. Now, in U.S. presidential politics, Former President Trump continues to bounce around from courthouse to the campaign trail. This morning, he was back to face trial for his statements about former columnist E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault allegations in 2019. Just ahead of the New Hampshire primary, he got a boost from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who decided to drop out of the race and back him. Conservative lawyer, George Conway, now joins Michel Martin with incisive analysis on how Trump's legal woes are playing out and shaping this campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, it's just a remarkable confluence of first. I mean, we have the first adjudicated rapist who is going to win a major party nomination, the first person who has been -- you know, who is under indictment in four separate jurisdictions with 91 counts.

They don't want to think, they don't, they're not interested in evidence. But I think another thing that's going on here, I think a lot of this is that people don't want to admit that they were wrong about Donald Trump. They don't want to admit that he's a bad person because if they admit that he's a bad person, then they, by extension, are admitting that they are not good people for supporting him, or at least it tarnishes them in their own eyes. So, they have to justify where they've been and where they're going, because they just don't want to admit that he led them astray and that they've been suckered and that they're wrong and that he's bad.

But part of it also is, there's an identity there. There's a tribalism there. And, you know, you don't want to be excluded from the tribe because you don't -- you think the other tribe, the liberals who you've been hating on for so many years, they're never going to accept you. And if you dare question the leader, you'll be cast out of your own group and you'll be homeless. The other thing that I think is going on is there's an economy that has been built around Trump and Trumpers. I think that there's a whole -- you know, you have all of these consultants and all these politicians whose livelihoods or their chosen careers or their chosen course of their lives is dependent upon not, antagonizing other people in that community. And so -- I mean, you see that with members of Congress who are -- who have to fear being primary. You see that with political consultants. I mean, for example, the -- it was reported just the other day that the Trump campaign is saying nobody should hire Jeff Roe, who was a political adviser, a chief political adviser for Ron DeSantis, that they -- he's going to be blacklisted. And nobody wants to be blacklisted. Nobody wants to be cast out of the tribe. And there is just -- there's also fear of physical intimidation. I mean, I think we saw that to some extent, with Lindsey Graham back in January of 2021, where he dared otter that he'd been -- he was done with Trump or something like that, and he was accosted at an airport by Trumpers. And you saw it also -- I mean, one of the things that you've seen when Liz Cheney was running for re-election in Wyoming, she had to have the big security detail in Wyoming, which she never owned. And there is a -- there is certainly a degree of physical intimidation. And that -- you know, frankly, that's what January 6th was all about.",

And, you know, this is a 77-year-old man. So, I think there is a very good chance he'll spend the rest of his life in jail. And that's part of the dynamic that is going on here. He knows that. I mean, he's not a strategic thinker. He's a sociopath. He's a man with a reptilian, I'm not going to say intellect, but he understands that he is cornered. And that's when people -- you know, people like him with that kind of psychology are the most dangerous.

He says he's seeking retribution on behalf of the American public, or at least his slice of the American public. But that's what motivates him. I don't think you can understand what Donald Trump says and does on a daily basis simply by saying, oh, he's a bad guy. He's a Republican. He's an authoritarian. He's racist. He's misogynist. He's this or that. You have to tie it into his fundamental psychological profile. People should not shy away from that. OK. because I do not think you can understand his behavior without understanding his psychology. And I think we're seeing that in the courtroom as it's happening today, over this week in the E.

They belong to the United States of America. They had classified document markings. And it doesn't even matter that they were, in fact, \"classified\" because the charges that he has been -- that were filed against him include charges under the Espionage Act, and those charges do not turn on specific mark -- whether they're specifically marked as classified, they simply turn on whether or not it's national defense information of any degree of significant sensitivity. And you have that, and the fact that there are witnesses and there's video and all sorts of evidence that he tried to hide those and did hide those documents from the FBI and that he failed to produce them when he was served with a subpoena by the Department of Justice and that he had his lawyers lie to the Department of Justice. And that's -- those are simple, simple, easily provable acts of obstruction of justice. And when that case goes to trial, I think -- I don't know that it's going to go to trial this year because it's hard to say what the judge there is doing in terms of scheduling, but I don't -- he doesn't have a defense in that case, just not a shred of a defense.",

And she -- he was refusing to give that concession cleanly. He was saying, yes, but, and the but was, oh, but a president could still -- certainly, a president that did that would be impeached and removed, and then he could be prosecuted because that's what the impeachment judgment clause that I described earlier says. The problem with that is that means the president isn't absolutely immune, and that was sort of the gotcha, the trap that Judge Pan was leading the lawyer into. And the lawyer realized he was being cornered and he kept trying to avoid falling into the trap by trying to talking as fast as he could and talking about things other than that weren't responsive to her answer. And then there's also the tension involved between, you know, his position that the president shouldn't be prosecutable because we fear political prosecutions, while at the same time saying, but a president can be prosecuted if the most political body in the United States, or in the United States government, which is the Congress of the United States, says so. And so, basically, when she got done with him, his position looked nonsensical. It looked ridiculous.
