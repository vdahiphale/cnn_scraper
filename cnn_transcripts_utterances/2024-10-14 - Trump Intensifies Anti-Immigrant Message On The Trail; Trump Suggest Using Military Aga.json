Donald Trump is using violent and dehumanizing language to claim without evidence that criminals will invade America if he doesn't win. It's dark, dangerous, and an integral part of his get out the boat strategy.Plus, blue wall blitz. Kamala Harris is camping out in the critical states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and she's making a direct plea to black men, as Democrats fear they could sit this election out or even vote for Donald Trump. And securing the vote, we have new reporting this hour on officials in swing states across the country working aggressively to guard against post-election drama. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and \"Inside Politics.\" We start with Donald Trump's closing campaign message. It focuses on the same anti-immigrant rhetoric that fueled his rise in politics. Here's just some of what we heard over the past few days. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third world. They're very, very, very sick with highly contagious disease, and they're let into our country to infect our country. To expedite removals of Tren de Aragua, and other savage gangs. There are many savage gangs. Ms.-13 is probably even -- even meaner. We're going to throw them out so far, you wouldn't believe it. From prisons and jails, insane asylums, mental institutions, from Venezuela, from the Congo, all over, and she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.

And, Dave Weigel, I want to read what, a text from our friend and colleague, David Chalian to me this morning who I thought said it so brilliantly. They mined more ground of Trump aligned areas and struck more oil, and they believe that there is more of that oil to strike. Meaning, there are more people who haven't voted.

Not Rogan himself. The podcast in that lane. And also nonwhite voters. Because one thing I'd add to Jeff is, the immigration message undergirds everything, and it is a conversation starter in these sorts of media. What is his plan? And I'm not saying all these plans would work. But what is his plan to lower prices, get mass deportation. What is the plan to make FEMA funded so that it's able to respond to disasters?Well, immigration. That's the problem. Mass deportation. What is the what is the solution for crime? It is mass deportation. And that is a message that it might get, a hostile reception in some media. Maybe the Philadelphia Inquirer, I don't think, is going to review that very well if he says in Bucks County. But in the media, he's reaching out to into the voters he's reaching out to, a lot of trust there. Yes. I don't trust the mainstream media. I bet this I bet this is true, what he's saying. I bet there are as many migrants in the country as he's saying. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICS ANALYST: But there are voters I mean, I disagree a little bit with Jeff just based on some of the voters that I've talked to.

There was a Mormon that I just spoke to, who said that the fact that Trump couldn't even say that he did something wrong or regretted what happened on January 6th, just further pushed him away from him. And it also is the immigration rhetoric. It's -- and all of that is under this banner of character. And the fact that he's losing these, you know, conservative, independent minded, you know, more to the center Republicans that used to vote for John McCain and Mitt Romney.

What type of person do you want to run this country? Do you want a chaos magnet? Somebody who delves in these kind of racist tropes, who talks about mass deportation when you really get to the nuts and bolts of it, that's going to be an incredibly difficult thing for any president to do?Or do you want somebody who is going to provide you what the Harris campaign feels that she's giving is kind of the steady, even keeled leadership that's not ideologically based, but it's about pragmatism and partisan. But I would say back to Jeff's point, though, I think a huge part of, the conversation is that Trump is going back to his messaging from 2016. Yes. It is evolved because he is evolved as a person, and the country has evolved since he first ran in 2016, but it is totally a red meat based of -- red meat for his base because of what motivated in 2016, he is now talking about it again.

I think that there is concern, not just with black men, but, the Vice President's softer numbers with black voters in general, particularly when you compare them to 2020 or other previous cycles of what Democrats were able to get. In part, because of this idea that I reported on in length is that a lot of folks did not feel that her campaign put enough emphasis or attention on courting black voters since August.I wrote a story last month about how the black political class across the country felt that she wasn't putting enough money into messaging for black voters and certainly not enough of that messaging or that money was going through black vendors. So this is an issue that the campaign has had been dealing with for months. And, also, it's an issue, particularly when we talk about black men, that current President Donald -- I mean, current President Biden dealt with when he was still at the top of the ticket. We report on the fact that men in general, were becoming more apathetic to Biden's campaign, particularly when we were talking about the economy. And so, certainly, there I think there are a couple of different black pollsters who believe that black men will come home at the end of the day because, black men and black women typically vote, largely Democratic and kind of the same numbers. And they don't believe that Donald Trump's insistence on kind of quoting this population will be successful. But this is not a new issue for the campaign. It's something that they've been dealing with for months and that, in fact, I think people would say that maybe the campaign is just too late.",

It's not as if the majority of black voters are going to suddenly either stay home or vote for Donald Trump. The majority of black voters are expected to vote for Kamala Harris. But this is a race that is expected to be on the margin.So like so many other demographics, the margins matter. And this just gives you what you were talking about, Jasmine, the numbers to look at. If you look at all black voters: Biden, plus 75; Clinton -- Hillary Clinton, plus 81. The polling right now from \"The New York Times\" poll is plus 63. That's a big marginal difference. And then it's even the same story, may perhaps even a little bit more so, among black male voters. BARRON-LOPEZ: Yeah. And that's a big question is whether or not this curiosity that some young black men, older black men may have about Donald Trump, whether or not it holds. Because right now in polls, it's showing that on the economy and on a variety of other issues, they seem to be a little bit more in tune with Trump versus Kamala Harris. When I was talking to black voters, specifically black men in Wisconsin and Milwaukee a few months ago, you know, they said that they wanted to hear from more from Harris on what she would specifically do for them on the economy. They felt like they hadn't seen as many of those specifics, which is why you see the campaign doing this now.
