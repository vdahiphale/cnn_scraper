And on top of that, the City of Louisville has signed this agreement to work with DOJ on further changes, so that's all in the works here. But as for this 90-page report, it is really scathing and it documents these persistent problems and abuses that have gone on for years within the Louisville Police Department. So the report it's laying out in part this way. It says, \"For years, LMPD has practiced an aggressive style of policing that it deploys selectively, especially against black people, but also against vulnerable people throughout the city. LMPD cites people for minor offenses like wide turns and broken taillights, while serious crimes like sexual assault and homicide go unsolved.\" So as we saw Attorney General Merrick Garland, he was in Louisville today, he listed through that litany of problems with the department that includes the use of excessive force, unlawful arrests, invalid warrants and then he even gave examples of the blatant racism that some officers exhibit.

But the Attorney General did point out that a number of changes have already been made. No-knock warrants are no longer allowed in Louisville.

The New York Times is reporting that House Republicans are relying on a framework built by former President Trump's budget director, it includes a 45 percent cut in foreign aid. You served on House Foreign Affairs in last Congress, could you back a 45 percent cut in foreign aid spending, which of the overall budget is about 1 percent?",

I was actually the ranking member on international organizations committee where he did oversee all that foreign aid and quite frankly there's a lot of money that's going overseas, where we don't know where it's actually going. There are no metrics in place.And that was one of the things that I constantly brought up in our hearings. If you look at Afghanistan, for example, there were billions of dollars that were spent in Afghanistan, whether it be through the Department of State or whether it'd be by the Department of Defense that went into areas where - they went to pay for ghost armies, for example, people that actually didn't exist. They built buildings that were never used. These are the types of concerns that we have with foreign aid.",

My whole thing is to make sure that money is going towards its intended purpose and it's fulfilling its specific goal.

And so what we're finding out here is that Dr. Fauci seem to not want Americans to know that this was part of a lab leak. And quite frankly, it was a lab leak that came from the Wuhan lab, which by the way American tax dollars made their way there through the EcoHealth Alliance.
