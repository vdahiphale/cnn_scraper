Well, Poppy, new video this morning of Israeli airstrikes into Gaza continue as the aerial assault continues. Hundreds more strikes overnight the IDF says they have carried out across Gaza. And that is crucial in terms of the hostage situation. We have learned new information about Israel's potential plans for a ground offensive and also the situation with the hostages. Because according to a new report, Israeli officials say that they are willing to delay going into Gaza for a few days to allow for talks on releasing a large number of hostages being held by Hamas. Let's go straight to Barak Ravid, political and foreign policy reporter for Axios. He's got this new reporting. And Barak, clearly, they have been delaying this -- delaying and delaying and delaying. I mean, it's definitional at this point. There are now four hostages out. But when you talk about a large hostage release, what is this? Is this the 50 we've been hearing about or more, or what is your understanding from your reporting? BARAK RAVID, POLITICAL AND FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Good morning. I think that what the Israelis want to try and achieve -- and for that, they're willing to wait with the ground invasion for another few days -- is to get mostly the women, the children, and the elderly out. That's dozens of people held by Hamas for two weeks now. And Hamas -- by releasing, last week, two hostages and yesterday, another two -- is trying to do this slow drip of hostages out of Gaza to try and delay. To try and play for time. The Israelis told Hamas through Qatar and through Egypt that if you want to cut a deal on hostages, we're ready. We're ready to discuss it.
