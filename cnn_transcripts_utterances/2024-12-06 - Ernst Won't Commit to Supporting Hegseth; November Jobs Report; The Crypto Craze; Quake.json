She is a veteran and a survivor of sexual assault herself. She sat down with Hegseth yesterday, and here's what she said afterward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

Revisions, we got that in this job's report. showed that actually it was 24,000 higher. But you're still think - you're still talking about only about 36,000 jobs added in the month of October. We're going to say that's a blip because we had the Boeing strike and we had the two hurricanes, which essentially employers maybe were not hiring, but also not reporting that they were hiring during that month. Key areas of job growth, traditionally what we have seen, healthcare, leisure, hospitality and government. Those are the sectors that added jobs in the month of November. What does this mean for the Federal Reserve? We always talk about them when we talk about jobs. Well, this paves the way for potential cuts. Their next meeting is in December. So, they're going to look at this in November and say, OK, this was strong. Maybe October was just a blip and we can sort of forget about that and move forward. I think one thing to note, though, is next year we're going to start to see maybe tariffs come into play, immigration, reduced immigration.

We've always talked about that. A disaster unlike anything that the modern United States has ever seen.Let's bring in CNN's Bill Weir. He's, of course, the person I want to ask about this.

That's what this quake might have been from there.But this was a big wake-up call for California, especially in the north. Oregon coast there. This is the 12th biggest in history there. And no tsunami warnings. You know, a permanent one. It was a brief one.

A big one, a 9.0, would last about four minutes or so. There was a mega tsunami in 1700 that was so legendary the Native Americans told stories of how the prairie turned to ocean and put their canoes in trees. And they ran a scenario basically, they ran computer models that if a similar thing were to happen today, they predict it would basically wipe out Highway 101, caused about $70 billion in damage, and take out 100 bridges. So, even in sparsely populated areas, down in southern Oregon, way up in northern California, where not a lot of people, that would have a ripple effect in terms of the economy and basically cutting off entire towns up there as well.You can't build for that. And these are not predictable the way hurricanes are. There's no - no correlation with the climate crisis with earthquakes. We're at the mercy of these shifting plates. If they move vertically, like if two plates, tectonic plates, shift like this, that's where the big tsunamis come. It looks like this one was a horizontal shift, or maybe the plates just pulled apart enough to rattle people's cages for a little bit.

But with that comes this volatility on the fault lines and the ring of fire around the Pacific. It goes over - I covered the Fukushima disaster in Japan after that tsunami and went to these villages completely devastated. Some of the most heartbreaking tragedies I've covered are elementary schools in the - in the tsunami zone where the kids couldn't get out of the way. That is a very real concern.

Hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other specialists worked to restore the cathedral after that devastating fire tore through in 2019. So, now the moment you've been waiting for. Maybe you didn't even know it. Did you know there is a color of the year. There is. And it's thanks to a company called Pantone, which basically does colors for profit. They say the color of the year is mocha mousse, aimed at our yearning for comfort and harmony, they say, which I think is presumptuous because how do they know I'm yearning for comfort and harmony?
