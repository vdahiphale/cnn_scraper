He paid very close attention to things that were expenditures made on his behalf. We heard the testimony about a metal announced a hot and then the $600 for whatever it was on. And we hear -- you know, he's going to -- he looked at these things. The backup from the checks that he was signed, they had backup on it. The fake invoice, what it was for? And the point about it is it's not about -- the Trump talking points here, which you hear from a lot of lawyers seems to be basically that unless he was there at the computer and he clicked that on the drop down menu, a false that he did it himself, then, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt, acquittal. It's just not the case. The statute says, did he cause this to happen? And if you look at the entirety of the evidence and not look at the way a defense lawyers, you know, and spinmeisters (ph) look at it, which is to take every little piece and not connect the dots, it's -- you can't figure out what the alternative theory is. The alternative theory that would allow a jury to say, well, we have all these facts. They're not really disputed. I think we heard one of the Trump lawyers say it's not -- the facts really not understood. What's the innocent explanation for this? And there is none.",

This is horrible for the campaign. Joining us now to discuss, Republican Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis of New York who was inside the courtroom this morning. Congresswoman, thanks for joining us. What was it like inside the courtroom? How does the former president seem, and why are you there? REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R), NEW YORK: Well, I'm here today to support President Trump. I think that he is facing a sham situation here that is very politically motivated. You have a district attorney who is going after him for political reasons. This is, remember, a matter that the FEC, Federal Elections Commission, said there was nothing -- no crime here. The DOJ, no crime. Cy Vance, the former district attorney, no crime. And yet Alvin Bragg, who, by the way, in New York City, you know, people are so concerned about crime, about illegal immigrant gang members, about repeat offenders on our streets. He either reduces or drops charges on all these repeat offenders in New York who are committing crimes and yet he's going after the former president, a political opponent for a crime that's not even within his jurisdiction or a crime that even mattered and so -- happened. So that is why I'm here to support the president against what I think is a sham trial. And the mood, he, look, he's in good spirits. I think he's obviously unhappy that he has to spend his time in a dreary, cold courtroom away from his supporters, away from the campaign trail. But that's what this is about. It's a design to keep him off the campaign trail, to keep him stuck in Manhattan, at a time when he should be out campaigning around the country, talking about President Biden's failed agenda. The fact that we have an open border with millions of people coming in, including gang members and drug smugglers. The fact that we have high inflation that's continued, high gas prices --",

It is keeping him from being on television saying all the crazy things that he was -- like in Wildwood the other day. That show in Wildwood, New Jersey. I wish it had been broadcast on this network and on all the other networks live so everybody could see how crazy he was. He's -- he -- this is actually helping him politically by keeping the attention away from the nutty things he says and does.

Not horrible for Donald Trump's marriage, but horrible for the campaign is his first reaction. \"Boss, I've got to speak to you,\" he told Trump, according to Cohen. \"I told him that one of the things that we need to do is obviously take care of it.\" Trump said, \"Absolutely. Do it. Take care of it.\" Cohen said that Trump told him about meeting with Stormy Daniels. Cohen says Trump told him, women prefer Mr. Trump even over someone like Big Ben. That's a reference to Ben Roethlisberger from the Pittsburgh Steelers. Cohen says -- who was at the same golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Sorry if you're not as up to speed as people like me who have now been forced to know that story. Cohen says he heard nothing about the Daniels matter between 2011 and learning from Dylan Howard that her story had resurfaced. Jeff Zeleny is joining us. And here is the crux of the matter.

Then after, you know, after so many other things, including January 6th, at the end of his term, Republicans said we are done with him. We're done with him. We're washing our hands of him.

They have emails and text messages about Stormy Daniels when she resurfaces and she does call the National Enquirer. So they're involved in pushing Trump to pay and he's waiting and waiting and waiting until the last two weeks and the timing also shows political motivation.
