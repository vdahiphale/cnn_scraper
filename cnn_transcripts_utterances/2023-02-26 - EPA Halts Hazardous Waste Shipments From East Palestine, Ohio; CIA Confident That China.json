Residents of East Palestine frustrated, angry, and demanding answers after being exposed to highly dangerous levels of vinyl chloride. The EPA temporarily halting millions of gallons of contaminated waste shipments to Michigan and Texas as the agency reviews disposal plans. Federal teams now are on the ground and they're checking in on East Palestinian residents door-to-door, passing out flyers with information on getting health assessments and clean water. But for many in the town, that simply is not good enough. Residents are worried about their own health and their homes. And many are questioning how this even happened after an initial NTSB report said the derailment was 100 percent preventable. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House for us. So Priscilla, you know, how is the administration responding to these concerns? And what is next?",

They are going door- to-door to residents. A White House official tells us they're trying to reach hundreds by this week and they're giving them information about how to access health assessments and also how to get testing for water in their drinking wells and also their drinking water. Now, the Biden administration has been under increasing criticism over the response here primarily that they did not get there soon enough. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg responded to that and noted that this is a priority for President Biden.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The CIA Director is now saying that the US is confident China is considering giving military aid to Russia in its war with Ukraine. William Burns also saying there is evidence Russia has offered to help Iran with its missile program in exchange for military assistance. And as the war grinds into its second year now, intense fighting continues in several areas. Ukrainian officials say there was extensive Russian shelling along the front lines in the last 24 hours, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. CNN's Clarissa Ward is in Ukraine for us.

There is a insanely high rate of attrition, Fred, for those Russian forces. They are dying in droves, but the Ukrainians are also experiencing higher casualty rates than at any other time.

The once bustling residential suburb of Saltivka, now a grim memorial to the carnage. WARD (on camera): The last time we were here in Saltivka, it was just getting smashed by Russian artillery every day. Three hundred thousand people roughly used to live in this area, but since the beginning of the war, it really became the frontline and even now, coming back here, you're just starting to see little hints of life reemerging.

People are afraid still to come back to their homes because even though they want to rebuild their lives, there is still lingering trauma, first of all, from everything that was experienced there, but also lingering fear that the Russians are still, even when they've been pushed back to their own border only 20 to 30 miles away, and that they could make a renewed push in that area which we have been seeing in recent weeks. The Russians trying to push the frontline in a place called Kupiansk, which is part of Kharkiv region, and so this feeding that concern that at this stage, it's difficult to really begin rebuilding.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, we know that this attack happened on a busy route that passes through a Palestinian town that Israeli settlers often use to get to other settlements, and it has been a flashpoint in the past. But from what we understand, it seems as though this attacker who is still on the run, officials have said that they are conducting a manhunt to try to find the attacker or attackers, used their car to ram into these two brothers who are 19 and 21 years old, to ram into their car and then apparently shoot them, in what, as you noted the local official said was point-blank range. Now, they both died on the scene and then the attacker fled.And this is of course, happening in the context of increasing levels of violence and death that we've been seeing just in the past few weeks here. You noted the military raid just about a week or so before then. There were two attacks, targeting Israelis, killing at least seven people, and then even before that, another deadly Israeli military raid. But actually, what's interesting is today, what happened just a few hours after that attack was a rare Summit in Akaba, in Jordan with the Jordanians, Israelis, Palestinians, the Americans, Egyptians, all trying to calm the situation, especially before the Ramadan holiday. Now, out of that meeting, they made some announcements, including saying that they were going to work on sort of joint security commitments with the Israelis and the Palestinians, that the Israelis have committed to essentially not work on settlements in the occupied West Bank for several months, and that the Palestinians won't push any sort of resolutions against the Israelis in the United Nations, and they also agreed to meet again, once again in Egypt before Ramadan. But then almost as soon as that meeting wrapped, and all of these statements were coming out about what they had agreed on, it seemed as though Israeli officials were negating what they had talked about at this Summit. Benjamin Netanyahu tweeting that: \"Construction and regulation in the West Bank would continue according to original planning, there will not be any freeze.\" And then Benjamin Netanyahu, keep in mind, leads now the most right- wing government in Israeli history. And one of his Ministers, actually, the Minister of National Security, tweeted out: \"What happened in Jordan will stay in Jordan.\" This is the Minister of National Security, essentially, negating what was publicly announced by both the Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, and then as night is falling, we're hearing of even more violence in the West Bank, settlers and Palestinians clashing. We're hearing of some more injuries and potentially the death of a Palestinian man as a result of those clashes. So clearly, not a lot of optimism that whatever was agreed upon in Jordan will have an immediate effect on the situation here on the ground -- Fred.",

There have been a lot of headaches, a lot of people that have been stranded and unfortunately, we're still waiting for Interstate 5 to open up. This is the highway right behind me. And as you can see, it is still empty. We've seen some of those snow trucks trying to clear, not just the highway, but you also have to remember that they're trying to clear the on and off ramps, the exits. So there's a lot that goes into play here. I've seen people who are just waiting with their suitcases, with all their belongings, just waiting for that highway to be open. And so, you have the snow in these areas, but in the LA area closer to the city, you are seeing a lot of rain, a lot of streets that were flooded and just so much wind that we had a lot of power outages as well. At the moment, more than 75,000 people are still without power because of the rain and the winds. Now, about 40 miles south of where I am in Castaic, California, that's where the ground essentially just gave in and that's where we saw multiple RVs going into the Santa Clara River, and that area, of course, many residents just so worried and also essentially stranded there because they cannot get on the highway even 40 miles south of where I am.

Tulsa, Oklahoma just north of Wichita Falls highlighted in red. That's where we're most vulnerable where conditions are a little more conducive for the threat for damaging winds. That's our biggest concern, but tornadoes can't be ruled out either. And a few long-lived EF2 tornadoes where winds are gusting over a hundred miles per hour are possible. Areas hashed in orange and red where we are dealing with some of the stronger winds here in the upcoming hours especially areas highlighted in red and have 75-plus- mile-per-hour winds are expected. Watch this line start to bow out. This is six o'clock Eastern Time. See how it bows. That's identifying how strong the winds are. That system pushes into Missouri as we get into early Monday morning to three o'clock in the morning, local time, and then slowly weakening as it moves into the Ohio Valley, but still holding the threat for severe weather, nowhere near as strong as what we are expecting this evening and overnight, but still holding that threat for damaging winds and hail, as well as isolated tornadoes rolling into tomorrow afternoon through the Ohio Valley. Even without the severe thunderstorms that are expected to bring damaging winds, we still have that wind threat. That's how strong the system is.

And this idea of not hierarchies in between, you know, forms of life is not some woo-woo thing that we just say, it is a way that they live, and I felt that giving a glimpse of their life would be special and that's how the title came about.
