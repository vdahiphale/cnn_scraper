      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson. It is 2Tehran, where the overnight assassination of Hamas' Political Leader, Ismail Haniyeh, may just have taken the region closer to the brink of conflict. In less than 24 hours, two of Israel's enemies, high profile leaders have been killed after attacks in two separate countries within the region. Hamas says its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh was killed on Iranian soil on Wednesday, after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. Hamas accuses Israel of carrying out that strike, which came just hours after Israel claimed it had killed Hezbollah's most senior commander in a drone strike in Lebanon's capital, Beirut. Israel says that was in retaliation for Saturday's deadly rocket attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, an attack which Hezbollah still strongly denies. Right. We have assembled some of CNN's best minds to break down all of these developments for you. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh with me here in London. Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa in Israel. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon in Washington, and Ben Wiederman is in Beirut in Lebanon. Nick, let me start with you. What is Iran saying about what happened, what, some 8, 9, 10 hours ago?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, very little about what actually happened, and that's kind of key becauseyou know, for a fact on the ground, they'll probably be quite attuned to the events themselves. What we do know is an explosion at about 2 o'clock in the morning in Northern Tehran, what is referred to as a special residence. Suggestions, it might be a, a home for veterans of the Iran-Iraq war, not clear what caused the explosion. The phrase being used by Iranian state media is an airborne guided projectile. That could be anything. I mean, could it be a bullet. Could it be an Israeli airstrike. It does tend to point perhaps towards something smaller, particularly because the casualties we're hearing about now are the death of Ismail Haniyeh and his bodyguard. So not necessarily a blast that took out a block like we saw in Beirut hours before that. And so, this will be part of Iran formulating a narrative, trying to explain to the outside world how badly its sovereignty has been violated, and then formulating a response to that level of offense, if that makes any sense. We've heard very starkly from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, saying that this is essentially attack on a guest in Iran's house and vowing harsh punishment against Israel. And sort of somewhat randomly actually the Iranian mission to new, the United Nations in New York has just tweeted that any response would be through special operations because they're harder to detect and prevent and can hurt the enemy worse. Now, obviously they don't set policy at all, but this is just a, a sort of sense of exactly how Iran is now going to struggle or slowly formulate its response. Maybe quietly, maybe publicly, maybe publicly debating as we see in this tweet what they necessarily do next. And of course, it has a whole region holding their breath. Jeremy, let me bring you in at this point. What's being said in and by Israel?",

Keep in mind that, you know, if you take a broad view of the region, you've got this war in Gaza. It's been going on for almost 10 months, more than 40,000 people killed. You have tensions on the Lebanese-Israeli border higher than ever before. You have the Houthis who have managed to interfere with international navigation in the Red Sea and have also been able to fire a deadly drone all the way to Tel Aviv. In addition to that, you have the Iranian back militias in Syria and Iraq. And now of course, Iran is clearly very angry about the fact that Ismail Haniyeh, the Head of the Hamas Political Bureau, was killed in the heart of Tehran, the capital of the country. And even though it's clear that nobody really wants a regional war, I mean, we are walking into, stumbling into a minefield of possible miscalculations and sort of overseeing it all is the United States, which since the beginning, has tried diplomatically to resolve the problem. The basic problem of course, being the situation in Gaza, the Americans have failed so far. They've talked a lot, but they haven't really used the kind of pressure we saw, for instance, back in the first Bush Administration with James Baker, who was able to really twist the arms of the Israelis. Even Ronald Reagan during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and the siege of Beirut was able to impose the will of the United States. It appears that the United States has become a passive observer, even though it participates by providing weapons and diplomatic support to Israel to this conflict that has gone on for so long and seems not closer to resolution, but closer to an even more dangerous escalation, Becky.",

What sort of impact his assassination will have on those ceasefire talks? We've had a very strong statement from Qatar mediating those talks. The foreign minister saying, and I quote, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side? I wonder how is the U.S. responding across the board and very specifically to that point, where does the U.S. believe this leaves any potential deal on a ceasefire and hostage release at this point?",

But the big thing, of course, that the U.S. is watching is just how this is going to escalate, particularly because as I said before, you know, U.S. forces are in the region right now. There is a you know, marine presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, and there is of course, a carrier group in the Persian Gulf that is prepared to respond to a potential escalation, potentially even engaging in a non-combatant evacuation operation of U.S. citizens that are in the region if things heat up even further. And so, the U.S. is prepared for all potential outcomes at this point. They are discussing, of course, every possible way that this could spiral out of control, but they're still conducting really intensive diplomacy behind the scenes to make sure that, that does not happen, Becky.",

And I quote very specifically, you killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment. We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.

This is an 85-year-old man who's just seen the inauguration of a president whois probably a bit more moderate than he'd like to have seen. And so, I think he's trying to project strength internally, but also internationally as well. The real question here is exactly what Iran's capabilities will enable it to do, and whether it feels now is the time to bring Hezbollah into this. But Becky, ultimately in all of this, from what Natasha was saying, I'm still very surprised at the U.S. role in this. So, what we publicly think is the U.S. role to say we were not aware of this and we were not involved after a meeting with Netanyahu in Washington with the Biden Administration and Trump as well at Mar-a-Lago to fly back after what happened on the Golan Heights. To now see potentially that Israel have gone off unilaterally without warning their key ally and taken a move like this, killing it seems the key negotiator in talks that the U.S. invested vast amounts of political capital in trying to happen. Remember CIA Director Bill Burns flying back here and there, that speaks to me of a total fissure in the U.S.-Israeli relationship. If indeed there isn't some separate narrative where, in fact, they were more aware of this than beforehand. But that's another potentially troubling thing about the unknown territory we were going into in that previous idea of U.S. traction, slowing down the Israelis potentially, or having a say in what we see in the weeks ahead, it is eroding if indeed what we're seeing on the surface is what's happened.",

And so, for the supreme leader to come out very, very quickly and lay the blame on Israel, I think it creates a lot of pressure inside of the Iranian political system for some sort of a response. Now, that doesn't mean, it's going to be a big direct Iranian response on the order of that missile and drone attack back in April. It might be as Jomana said, something that involves proxies, something that's done indirectly.

Something that he can sell to his supporters in order to go and make a ceasefire deal, which he has been very ambivalent about for months. But there's also a more cynical view that I've heard from Israelis and other people across the region, which is that if you want to make ceasefire, killing your chief interlocutor in those talks is usually not a good way to do that. This is another way for Netanyahu to try to avoid making a deal and if that's the case, and if the Americans aren't really leaning on Israel and trying to dissuade them from carrying out these kinds of actions then it tells you that America is basically absent at this point. It's continuing to support Israel in the sense of giving it military aid, giving it weapons, giving it diplomatic support, but it's not doing anything to really push for what it says is its desired outcome a ceasefire.",

Well, I think first of all, we have to recognize thatNetanyahu in particular has been pushing for a war between the United States and Iran for more than 15 years. He's done. So, using the nuclear program, on a couple of occasions, he was actually quite close. That strategy has been to start the war himself and then drag the U.S. into it, this may have been one of his best chances yet to do so. So, it is completely in line with everything else that he's done for the last 15 or so years. Moreover, we know very well, that Netanyahu has been the main obstacle for a ceasefire deal. And the Israeli media is openly discussed how he actually has been leaking intelligence in order to sabotage the talks. He's being accused by the family members of the hostages by his own officials, by military officials of being the obstacle. And he's done so for a very simple reason, the minute this war ends, his political career ends and his prison sentence likely will begin given his, the corruption charges against him. So, prolonging the war has always been a case undermining the ceasefire negotiations has been the case. And what is more effective in killing the ceasefire talks and actually killing the person on the other side of the negotiating table. And then you have the Kamala Harris aspect of this. Kamala Harris' body language, her tone, the rhetoric clearly indicated that there will be some form of a shift, how substantive it will be, we don't know but some form of a shift away from what Biden's approach to Netanyahu, which has been quite differential. But by escalating matters in this way that he is now done, potentially even getting a regional war. He will essentially force Kamala Harris into the same bear hug, as Biden voluntarily adopted after October 7, and will take the initiative away from the Kamala Harris in case she becomes president, rather than -- forcing her to react to events rather than actually being able to take initiatives on their own.",
