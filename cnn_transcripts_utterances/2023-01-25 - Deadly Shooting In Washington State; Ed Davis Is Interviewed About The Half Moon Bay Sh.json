Initially we knew that police and a SWAT team had surrounded a home in Yakima where they thought this presumed suspect who they earlier named in a Facebook post as Jarid Haddock, 21 years old, a local resident, was at.But, instead, this bystander that you mentioned saw him at a different location near some warehouses. He, as you point out, borrowed the woman's phone, called his mother. She overheard him making those horrific statements that he killed these people and also threatened to kill himself. The woman got her phone back. She informed police of what she heard and that he was nearby and that he was traveling on foot. He was later found near a marijuana store. Now, police say they responded to the scene immediately, within minutes. They arrived to the scene. They heard a gunshot. They didn't see what had happened. And when they finally came upon him, he had apparently taken his own life. Officials did try to save him, but he was later pronounced dead. And, of course, what that means, Jim and Erica, is right now we still have no motive. Three people dead in what the police chief described as random, horrific shootings. Take a listen.

This is the big player in this arena, right? It generated $209 billion in advertising revenue in 2021. You know, that's almost twice the next player, which is Facebook Meta. And the government goes out to lay out very carefully how Google, it says, controls the digital tool that nearly every website publisher uses, the publisher ad server. It controls the dominant advertiser tool, that's the advertiser ad revenue, and then - and then it controls the largest advertising exchange, the ad exchange. So it has this big flow chart showing how Google has its hands on the entire process, buys out competitors so that it can keep control, and that this is essentially an anti-competitive environment here. Google has responded saying this is the government trying to pick winners and losers in what it calls a highly competitive advertising market. DOJ is doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise ad fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.

However, here's where it gets interesting. This is a secret ballot election. And Dhillon's people believe that without that public pressure there is a possibility that they could actually change their votes when they're actually casting their ballot and vote for Dhillon. And this has become an increasingly ugly race. There have been accusations hurled. On top of that, I mean, what I have heard, just from sources on both sides, has gotten increasingly more and more nasty. You have McDaniel on one side. She says that she's the best position to unite the party ahead of 2024. This is, obviously, a critical time. Dhillon says we need new leadership because of those lackluster midterm results. And over all of this, again, as with everything in the Republican Party, Donald Trump is looming. He has not endorsed either candidate. But it is no secret that he is close to McDaniel.

He was successful in it not hitting his nephew, but he stepped on to the track. So, these snowcats, they run on these massive, you know, thousands and thousands of pounds, it's like a 14,000 pound snowcat, and he steps up and immediately - imagine, it's like a conveyor belt. He steps up onto the track and he gets pulled under and it crushes him. Thank goodness he survived. And we know it's going to be an incredibly long road to recovery. Jim just said it was 30 bones that he broke. Jeremy releasing this on Instagram over the weekend and showing himself in physical therapy. But incredibly scary. So, he gets up onto the snowcat in an attempt to pull that parking brake. Now we do know, in the incident report, that the parking brake light that comes on was not working.
