      "sentences": "Well, it is very clear that at this moment, a year into this war, that Israel is fighting a war on multiple fronts. It is not only, of course, fighting Hamas in Gaza, as it has been for the last year, but also now very much engaged in a war with Hezbollah.Not only in terms of the ground operation there that is clearly expanding with now two divisions of Israeli troops now involved in this combat effort in Southern Lebanon that could be as many as 20,000 troops, not necessarily all of them in southern Lebanon, but clearly involved in combat operations there, as dozens of Lebanese villages as far as 18 miles away from Israel's border with Lebanon are being urged to evacuate. And so even as Israel is calling this a limited operation, there clearly is the potential for this to grow and become very significant. And as Jomana has been laying out there, it is already clearly having a far more than just a limited effect on the Lebanese civilian population there, and also, of course, on Hezbollah. We have seen the Israeli military engaged in some of the heaviest bombardment of Lebanon that we have seen in decades now. And very much almost at pace with its bombardment of Gaza in the early days and weeks of that war. And then, of course, at the same time, we now have this escalating conflict directly between Israel and Iran, after Iran fired for the second time ever, now directly on Israel using ballistic missiles. And Israeli leaders are now considering how exactly they will respond to that attack by Iran. Will they strike nuclear facilities? Will they strike oil facilities? Will they simply target military infrastructure inside of Iran? What is clear, though, is that they will retaliate, and with that retaliation will come the potential for the situation to escalate even further. And so, there's no question that Israel is in a multi front war right now. What its strategy is, is less clear. Clearly it is to remove the threats that it believes it faces and to deter Iran from taking additional action in the future. But at the moment, it seems like the fighting that it is engaged in, whether it is in Gaza with Hezbollah or with Iran, is only leading to further escalation of this situation with no clear end in sight for this region to stabilize Jessica.",

You've got a government here, a country that is pretty much bankrupt. It is struggling to deal with multiple crises that are unfolding as a result of this war, whether it is the number of people, the casualties that they -- their health care sector that was already weakened by years of crises and wars has had to deal with.And we're talking about thousands and thousands of people. And as we mentioned earlier, the World Health Organization saying that there have been many attacks on health care workers and on health facilities. So, you've got that part of the crisis. Then you also have the internal displacement. This is the biggest internal displacement crisis in the history of Lebanon, according to the government, more than a million people displaced in a matter of days. And you are seeing this happening in Southern Lebanon, and you're seeing this happening here in Beirut from the southern suburbs, and also in the eastern part of the country. These areas that have been under Israeli bombardment. And I mean, and the numbers are increasing by the day. You've had in the last three days, a total of 100 more than 100 villages ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military. That's just in the south. Same thing here in the southern suburbs, every day almost you are hearing these evacuation orders for certain neighborhoods. And these shelters that the government have set up are overcrowded. There aren't enough shelters. There isn't enough room in these shelters to accommodate this huge number of people who have been displaced so fast. And so, you end up in a situation where you have people out on the streets with nowhere to go for days, with no access to facilities, to toilets, to showers, to hot meals. I mean, it is absolutely devastating. And then you have people with no other choice but to cross the border into Syria, and that really says a lot about the situation right now.",

Then the question becomes, what will Iranians do? And if the nature of that response is akin to what we saw the other day, or larger.

And they are talking, as the president suggested yesterday, they're coordinating, or at least consulting, and he's advising to use his words, not whether or not we can allow the Israelis, we're advising them.So, I think the administration's views will be considered. And I think the Israelis, I don't think the Israelis are interested in a major, multi front war. Others believe they are. So, I think at this point, the impact of the U.S. is going to be minimal. Israel needs the United States resupply. They need the United States for defensive and protective measures. Should the Iranians open up with a saturation attack of ballistic missiles. So, there is a sense of dependency. But Netanyahu government has acted unilaterally and most often, without consulting, certainly without coordinating with the United States.",

They could also hit ballistic missile sites. They could also hit nuclear facilities that are under construction, as opposed to some of the deeper facilities that we don't think they have the bunker buster technology to reach in any event. But you know, it's how much hurt do they want to cause, and how much do they want to humiliate the regime without triggering a counter response? Or maybe Israel thinks that, you know, Iran has used 10 percent roughly of its 3000 ballistic missiles.

The founder of the park telling CNN, it's the biggest evacuation they've ever had to do. Anna Coren has details.[08:50:00] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One by one against rising floodwaters, these giants of the land push for higher ground. Come, come this way, keep going quick -- but it's a slow and arduous process, especially for the elephants trapped in their enclosures waiting to be rescued. For days now, heavy rains have been falling across Northern Thailand, causing flush flooding and landslides. But for the Mae Taeng Valley just outside Chiang Mai, home to the Elephant Nature Park, it is now completely underwater, threatening the lives of the animals it provides century, four. 100 elephants who live here, along with a menagerie of thousands of other animals, have all been rescued from injury and abuse, with this natural disaster only adding to their trauma. As these three elephants quickly move through the flood waters, another follows a distance behind. Her name is Ploy Tom (ph), and she is blind, an injury from her former days in the logging industry. Unable to see. She's caught in the fence. The other elephants calling out, the sound of distress, but Ploy Tom (ph), who's endured too much in her life, manages to break free and rejoins for her. Thailand's Department of National Parks and Wildlife has sent teams to help with the rescue operation. But so far, they're unable to reach the valley that has been cut off. It's calling on volunteers to help with the evacuation of the 100 stranded elephants and thousands of other sick and disabled animals. And fear they are working against time and mother nature with more rain on the imminent horizon. Anna Coren, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
