Only about 1 percent of people will have a genetic mutation that's directly passed down. But there's a lot of other testing out there now, including what's called a phosphorylated-Tau test.",

The Ten Commandments must now be posted, in a big readable font. We'll have a former Louisiana teacher weigh in, tonight. Plus, two nuclear-armed dictators taking things to a whole new level, tonight. Beyond the flag-waving, waving pomp and circumstance, we're learning new details about the biggest international shakeup, since the end of the Cold War. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, plans of attack are being hatched, strategies are being set. Maybe even a few traps are being laid. It is all happening, behind closed doors, as President Biden and former President Donald Trump are cloistered with their teams, in two different beach homes, tonight, about 1,000 miles apart. But both preparing for what is inarguably the most anticipated face-off in years. The first presidential debate, now just days away, right here on CNN, next Thursday night, one of them staying tight-lipped about those preparations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That is squarely in the camp of the campaign. So, I have to keep that there.

The race, of course, is still very much within the margin of error. And this is just a snapshot of where we are right now. But notably, Biden is ahead of Trump, in that Fox News poll, for the first time since last October. Of course, there's no clear leader in this race, which means the stakes for next week could not be higher for either camp here. And both campaigns are clearly eager for that matchup. Biden's team marked the Juneteenth holiday, by tearing into Trump's quote, flagrant racism. And Trump, on the other hand, maybe realizing that he himself has set the bar too low, by constantly painting Biden as confused and senile, is now trying to manage expectations, in really what can only be described as the most Trumpian way possible.

Yes, it's an opportunity, for sure, to stand on the stage, and make the differences that the American public needs to hear.

Observe the Sabbath day. I'm the only God that you may worship. So, it's an inherently religious document. I should add. This came up before.

That's a conflict between his free exercise of religion, and everyone else who says it's an Establishment Clause violation. We don't want that religion to be foisted onto us. So, when you have those two things in conflict, this Court has consistently ruled for the individual, who says they're exercising their right. You don't have that side of it here. This is the Legislature saying, here's the religion that we are putting in front of all school children. We don't care if they're Christian, Muslim, if they're atheist. They all have to look at this religious document. You don't have a person saying, this is violating my individual religious freedom right.

So, when you put the history of MLB, and the fact that Willie Mays was able to break not only the color barrier, in some sense. And what I mean by that is he was an All-Star on the field. But off the field, he meant so much to so many people. In fact, listen to Joe Torre, talk about Willie Mays, and what he meant to the game of baseball. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
