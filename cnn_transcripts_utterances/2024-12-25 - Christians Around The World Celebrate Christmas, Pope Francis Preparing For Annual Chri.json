Christmas celebrations were also, of course, muted, because in parts of the world, it's a holiday spent under the shadow of war, doing the best they can. You are most welcome wherever in the world, you are joining me. It 8:00 in Vatican City. And there, Pope Francis is preparing to deliver his annual opiate or the Christmas message to the city and to the world. The Pope started the Catholic Holy Year, also known as a jubilee. It was the ceremonial opening of the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica. And the Pope delivered his Christmas Eve homily, which he pleaded for developing nations to reduce the debt burden on low income countries. Pope Francis says the story of Jesus should inspire everyone to make a difference in the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POPE FRANCIS, HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SOVEREIGN OF THE VATICAN CITY STATE (through translation): There is so much desolation in this time. Think of wars and children being gunned down, bombs on schools and hospitals. Don't delay, don't slow down. But let yourself be drawn by the good news. This is our task to translate hope into the different situations of life. Hope calls us to become pilgrims in search of truth, dreamers who never tire, women and men open to being challenged by God's dream of a new world where peace and justice reign. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Jubilee is an ancient tradition which is focused on forgiveness and pilgrimage. And during the year, 35 million people are expected to travel to Rome.The Pope began the Jubilee with the opening of the Holy Door in St Peter's Basilica, which is normally cemented shut but has been opened for this special celebration. The Pope was wheeled up to the door, it opened, and pilgrims filed in behind him, touching the bronze panels, as is tradition. According to Catholic teaching, those who carry out certain spiritual charitable acts and go through a Holy Door will receive an indulgence, which is related to the forgiveness of sins. The Pope is hoping this Jubilee can bring hope to a troubled world. And in his Christmas Eve homily, said he wanted the Jubilee to be a time where peace and justice reign. The Pope was also called for the Jubilee to be a time when richer countries forgive the debts of poorer nations and for prisoners to be offered amnesties or pardons. The day after Christmas, the Pope will travel to Rebibbia Prison on the outskirts of Rome and become the first pope to open a Holy Door in a prison. Something that he hopes sends a message to governments across the globe. Now this Jubilee Year is likely to test the stamina of the 88-year-old pontiff, but he is determined that the message of the Jubilee should resonate across the globe. Christopher Lamb, CNN, London.",

He's worried about the fees charged. The fees are charged accordingly to the size of the vessels that cross over. He's also suggesting that China has increasing influence in the region and that is another reason why the United States should retake control. It is true that China has been increasing their presence in Latin America, but that is also because perhaps the United States has not been investing as much as the Chinese government has been doing in the last few years.
