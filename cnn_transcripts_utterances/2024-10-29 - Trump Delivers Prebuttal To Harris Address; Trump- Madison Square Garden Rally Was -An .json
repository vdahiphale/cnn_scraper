The sweet, sweet symphony of CNN's election jam. So on the trail today, former President Donald Trump just wrapped up a campaign event in the crucial battleground Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, holding a community roundtable outside Philadelphia in a town called Drexel Hill, which is in Delaware County, AKA Delco. And now crowds are gathering on the National Mall here in Washington, D.C. for Vice President Kamala Harris' speech later this evening. The event is going to be held at pretty much the same spot as Donald Trump's rally on January 6, 2020, one, in the minutes before his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Let's go right to Priscilla Alvarez who covers the Harris campaign for us. She's at the Ellipse in D.C. Priscilla, what is Harris' message going to be this evening?",

Now, a Harris advisor tells me that she has been making final edits and revisions over the course of today. And now we are getting some of the excerpts from her address. Let me read you one of those which really captures what the remarks are going to be about today. It says, quote, \"Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy are the enemy.He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table.\" Of course, the vice president and her team have been trying to cast her campaign as one that has a broad tent that includes both Democrats, Independents and Republicans. And that's a push she's going to make today. But as you mentioned, the venue here is also significant. Her campaign wanted to illustrate a degree of gravity, but also draw that stark contrast with the White House behind her, the Oval Office, the office she's seeking, only 500 yards away. So the vice president here will be describing her broader vision that includes policy proposals on the economy, on reproductive rights, on immigration, and laying that out, while also contrasting each of those priorities with that of former President Donald Trump. Now advisors to the vice president that they want to reach the undecided voters, perhaps those disaffected Republicans who are tired of former President Donald Trump or those voters who are simply on the fence between the two candidates, that this is likely the last major opportunity that she's going to have to talk to the American people, be it here in the crowd, but also tuning in. So certainly they are trying to pull more people to their side to peel off those votes of former President Donald Trump. Seeing this, of course, as one of the last tentpole moments going into Election Day, Jake.",

They don't have a lot of confidence that the Harris campaign is competitive for them in terms of the issues and where it matters and what we're seeing and hearing from voters. But, but they also know that, you know, you can't really make that projection and be completely sure. Trump has been telling people he's confident there's moves for a transition happening behind the scenes. A lot of people are jostling for key roles. Secretary of State, AG, White House counsel, those top positions that will be inside the West Wing as well. So, they're certainly acting more like they are on their way to victory.

Governor, you cast your ballot for Vice President Harris today. Do you think Kamala Harris should keep talking about Trump, drawing a contrast in her closing message, or would you rather she focus exclusively on policy issues such as the economy, abortion rights, et cetera? GOV. ROY COOPER, (D-NC): This race is too important for her not to draw the contrast between her and Trump. And I'd rather have a president who wakes up every morning thinking about the American people rather than a president who wakes up every morning thinking about himself. And I think that's what she's going to do tonight when she's talking about his enemies list and her to do list for the American people. There are some people out there who are still trying to make up their mind. And I think that there are things that they don't like about both candidates and they're trying to decide whether they're going to go and vote for one or the other or not vote at all. It's too important right now for her not to draw this contrast. And I think when you have the people who were so close, ultra conservative people such as his chief of staff, his generals, his attorney general, his vice president, saying that this man should not be anywhere near the White House again, that's something that people have to think about because Donald Trump is not going to make the same mistake this time. He's going to put in people who are completely loyal to him and who will do anything he tells them to do. That message has to be out there right now as people are making up their mind what to do.",

I spoke to two voters we've been in touch with for months here in Vegas. One of them, Antonio Munoz runs a restaurant and he says he's definitely voting for Harris now. He was leaning that way.

According to an industry tracker the fast food giant has seen customer visits dropped 10 percent nationwide in the days following the announcement. And a drop of 33 percent in Colorado, where many of the initial illnesses were reported.McDonalds' announced it will resume selling their quarter pounders in all locations this week after health officials say the beef patties are safe, citing the source of the E. coli came from onions. CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is on call for us today. Sanjay, does it surprise you that the Department of Agriculture says the evidence does not point to the ground beef as the possible source of the E. coli outbreak? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Now it -- it -- it really doesn't surprise me. I think when we first heard about this, just considering we're talking about meat at fast food restaurants, the likelihood of it being E. coli from the -- the patties themselves was pretty low. And -- and there's one major reason why. Most these fast food restaurants do cook their -- their burger patties at a pretty high temperature. So we -- we have a good idea of the temperature needed to basically inactivate or kill E. coli, 160 degrees or so. McDonald's, for example, cooks -- cooks around 175 degrees. So right away, unless there were all these restaurants, Jake, that were sort of at the same time undercooking the -- the beef patties, it was unlikely. So that was then, no surprise that it was actually probably due to these slivered onions here, which you can see, Jake. I got a quarter pounder with cheese. And I don't know if you even know what slivered onions are, but there they are. And it turns out that that is likely the source of the outbreak. There is one major supplier supplying a lot of those restaurants. Some 900 of them are not going to have slivered onions for a period of time. But that is the most likely source of the outbreak.",

I mean, you may not realize the number of people that get sick from this every year in the United States, you know, 10 percent of the population a little less than that getting sick every year. Lots of people hospitalized as well, 128,000 hospitalized, 3,000 deaths. So those -- those are pretty high numbers. And the vast majority of people will not -- will not seek medical care, they'll just recover at home.I think a couple things have happened. One is that we're much better at sort of tracking these things down, using genetics, for example. That's how they really trace the source of these outbreaks. The other thing is, a lot of these outbreaks are occurring outside the home as well, Jake, restaurants, delis, buffets, things like that. So that's been a -- a big source, a big area where people have targeted trying to figure out the source of these as well.",
