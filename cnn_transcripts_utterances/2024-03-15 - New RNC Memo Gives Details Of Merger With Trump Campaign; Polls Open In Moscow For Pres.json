His lawyers criticized prosecutors, saying they publicly dragged him through a cesspool, their wording, and abused the system. The charges were initially dropped last year but reinstated in January. His trial is set for July.Now, Haiti's government has again extended the curfew in the western region of the country now through Sunday. The curfew has been in place because of the relentless widespread gang violence taking the country now, really, to the brink -- we've been seeing this over and over -- forcing the prime minister to design -- to resign and forcing the United States to send in extra security forces to the U.S. Embassy there. The Haitian government is telling police to use, quote, \"all legal means\" to enforce the extended curfew. And of all the reasons for a delay of game, bees. Tons of bees. An invasion at a major tennis match as swarms of these temporarily shut down the Indian Wells tennis match in California yesterday. The bees swarmed a camera hovering above the court, like the Skycam thingy thingy, forcing the players Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev, to leave the court. A beekeeper or maybe they prefer bee specialist if you will came to the rescue, vacuuming -- technical term -- vacuuming up the bees and the match was able to resume. The number two -- it's on the camera lens -- the number-two seed Alcaraz went on to beat Zverev and advance to today's semifinals. The bees could not be reached for comment, Sara. They just really disagreed with the -- with the ref's calls.",

This is, I think, the message to Netanyahu, like he says. It's also a message inside Israel that those of us in the United States understand that Netanyahu may be your current leader but he is not your leader if you had an election today. I actually think this is a good thing that Schumer did. Netanyahu has come to America and basically supported Donald Trump. He's supporting Donald Trump now.

The Wall Street Journal this morning reporting a flight attendant may have accidentally hit a switch that pushed the pilot into the controls causing the plane to suddenly drop, leaving dozens of passengers injured. CNN aerospace analyst Miles O'Brien joins us now to discuss. What? So, a switch is pulled and the pilot goes flying into -- like, how does that happen? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST, TECH AND AEROSPACE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. It's supposed to be a convenience switch but apparently, a little bit of a memo needs to go out to warn people about this. It's a switch on the back of the seat of the aircraft and the flight deck which makes it easier for the pilots to move the seat in and out of position as they settle in to do their job. Otherwise, they'd have to kind of reach down below and to the side in order to move the seat, which is electrically controlled. What evidently happened was this flight attendant leaned on that portion of the seat where the switch is. It activated the seat and it has a way of kind of locking into place and moving forward. At the time, the member of the flight crew was seated kind of sideways as if talking and receiving the food with his legs crossed. And so, that pushed him and his legs against the control column and initiated this nosedive. They lost well over 10,000 feet very quickly. And can I just say this, Sara?
