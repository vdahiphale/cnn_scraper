And that's a long way from where the storm is.And Leyla really hit on an important part. Our coverage of Ian and especially the aftermath focused on Ft. Myers, Sanibel, and all of those places that got devastated there. But the east coast dunes and beaches were completely eroded as well with the onshore flow. Even though Ian tracked this way, there was so much onshore flow, it ate away at those dunes, at that beach. And so now what we're seeing with these high tides, almost six feet above where they should have been for a time, went down a little bit at high tide, only three feet above high tide, but that eroded the buildings, that eroded a lot. And we know of a lot of structural damage that is there. Winds are still gusting to 52 in Daytona, even 43 over there in Tampa. Surge warnings going on here. We know there's about eight to eight and a half feet in Charleston. Now, not above the roads, but certainly on the roads in much of Charleston. That happens when you get an east wind and a high tide. There we just had the full moon. That means that these high tides are larger than they would be at other times of the month. And there's Cocoa Beach at 59-mile-per-hour wind gusts there. So, it's a large area of wind. Everywhere that you see yellow here, that is still tropical storm force winds. Those numbers go down, the size goes down as the storm decreases in intensity tonight. And eventually it even hooks up with this cold front and gets shoved back out to the ocean. But there's going to be a lot of rain and wind. And there are still leaves on the trees across parts of the deep south. And with winds of 35 or 40, some of those trees could come down. We could have power outages through the Carolinas, through Georgia and even on up toward the northeast. It does eventually get out of here. Three to four inches of rainfall possible. That's good for the water that gets into the Ohio River because that will eventually get into the Mississippi. But many areas here don't need any more rainfall. The Carolinas and Georgia does. But 60 miles per hour right now. The storm did decrease from a landfall of 75. Guys.",

But we're, obviously, not in normal times. This is actually a nine-month low and is a big improvement from the 9 percent inflation that we saw over the summer. Within the realm of what was possible, this is probably about as good as we could have hoped for. None of this means sticker shock is gone, right? People are still feeling these price hikes. We still see big year over year price increases in gasoline, food, rent. But there also has been some improvement, right? Month-over-month we saw prices decline for apparel, used cars, airlines, medical care. That is all encouraging. Now, Wall Street, as you mentioned, is loving this news. You know, within seconds of this number coming out, Dow futures spiked 600 points, up almost 800 points, 2.4 percent right now. The Nasdaq is up more than 4 percent. An even bigger move over there. These are pretty significant moves. And I think it reflects optimism. Some hope on Wall Street that maybe the Federal Reserve can stop slamming the brakes on the economy with these monster interest rates.

[09:40:05] MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: No, that's right. Kevin McCarthy has launched an aggressive campaign to lock down the votes for speaker. I'm told that he has been working the phones ever since yesterday, calling members, asking for their support, making the argument that he is on the verge of delivering them the majority, that Republicans have picked up seats under his watch two cycles in a row. And he's also been hearing from potential holdouts and critics, hearing what their demands are, listening to them, but not making any promises just yet. I'm also told that he tapped a team of allies to help fan out across the party and make these calls and try to whip the support for the speakership. And we also have seen him meeting with both allies and potential critics in his Capitol Hill office here. That includes Marjorie Taylor Greene, someone who has been critical of him in the past. She did not say leaving the meeting whether she would support him for speaker, but sources tell me that there are about two dozen members of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to vote against McCarthy. They say that they have some leverage here with a slimer than expected majority and they want to extract concessions from Kevin McCarthy in exchange for their speaker vote. And the things that they are demanding are everything from more representation on committees, more power, those -- promises related to investigations and impeachment. So, we'll see what Kevin McCarthy agrees to. Like I said, he's in listening mode right now. Some of his allies are saying that they're reluctant about the idea of him giving in to these demands because it's a slippery slope. But Kevin McCarthy might have no choice in the matter if he wants to become speaker. Erica. Jim.",

The U.S. observed Russian naval vessels preparing for a possible test of a new nuclear-powered torpedo in recent weeks a senior official with direct knowledge tells me. Among the vessels that took part in those preparations was the Belgorod. It's a cruise missile submarine modified for special operations, including launching unmanned, underwater vehicles. That includes the Poseidon torpedo, as it's known, seen here. It is a nuclear-powered, unmanned, underwater vehicle capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions with a nuclear propulsion system that gives it virtually limitless range.In the last week, those Russian vessels observed leaving the testing area in the arctic sea heading back to port without carrying out a test. The U.S. believes the Russians may have encountered technical difficulties. Joining me now to discuss this and other Russia/Ukraine news, retired Major General Mark Hertling, former commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and the Seventh Army.

It's time for Ukraine to take a look at that.I think the Biden administration has been perfectly clear from the very beginning, that they will take Ukraine's lead in terms of negotiation. Now, Mr. Zelenskyy has made it very clear, he wants to regain the sovereignty of his territory, interestingly including Crimea. Something that will certainly put Mr. Putin in the defensive position. But I've got to tell you, Russia has not been very good in terms of any of the operations they have conducted. They have continued to fail in even attempting to regenerate and move their forces around. So, there could be a potential opportunity for negotiations.

And there's a sense among economists, especially with this semiconductor war, that they might be pulling back and saying we don't need this partnership the way they did. And that's inconvenient because solar prices have come down 90 percent in the last decade thanks in large part to Chinese manufacturing.
