But it also opens up other opportunities on the criminal investigative and prosecutorial side.You can start to use, you know, statutes like the material support to terrorism statutes, and go after people and prosecute them for providing assistance to the newly designated entity.

I should start out by saying it's not -- it's not unusual that the department and the FBI see things differently, particularly in a -- in a -- in a case that's being investigated with so much attention and there's so much pressure on both sides. There are often arguments about the best tact to take whether that's access to a witness or evidence through a search warrant, or even arrest procedures, things like that. In this case, I think it's remarkable what you're seeing if the reporting is accurate, and that's a big If, what they're saying is that there was -- that there was significant reluctance on the part of some folks in the bureau to move forward with the search because essentially, they were afraid of the fallout, the fallout on the agency and the fallout on individuals from conducting that sort of a provocative step that involved the former president.They -- you know, they've even referred to it in the article as the crossfire hurricane hangover, people are very wary of seeing what happened to bureau leaders and people like me after having been involved in investigating the former president and we're still targeted to this day. The concern that I have, and it was my concern back in when I was in the FBI and making some of those decisions, is when you are investigating someone who is a political figure, that is not a political act if you are following the facts and the law, you are doing your job. When you choose not to take some investigative step of a political figure because you're concerned about the political fallout and the potential blowback that is in injecting politics into the work of the FBI and the Department. So, as hard as it may be in those moments, knowing the sort of retaliation they may be subjected to and I completely identify with all that, it's still absolutely essential to take those steps that you know are legally required and in the best interest of justice and meeting your obligations as an investigator. So, I'm glad they executed the search warrant but we all know now that that was certainly the right thing to do.",

And so, what you really see is sort of a split decision here. And maybe one of the lessons is, if you're -- if you're going to run and you're a Democrat, don't get crosswise with the teachers' union. You've got a candidate here who not only faced blowback from crime and from all of the COVID hangovers, but someone who was ultimately seen as an out-of-towner, with no core base clash with the teachers' union, and had a vote split by the candidate to her left.
