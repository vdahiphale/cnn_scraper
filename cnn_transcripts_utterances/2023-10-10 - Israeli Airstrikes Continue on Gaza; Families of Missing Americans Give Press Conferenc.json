This comes as we are standing by to hear from four American families who say they are missing loved ones, who had family members taken hostage by Hamas. This press conference is taking place in Tel Aviv, where our crews just had to take shelter because air raid sirens just went off. Israeli parents this morning are being warned that they should remove social media from their children's phones because Hamas could release videos of executions.Israel claims it has now killed 1,500 Hamas terrorists who infiltrated over the weekend. It has launched new air strikes on Gaza. More than 200 targets of what they call terrorist hubs. Even as Hamas has threatened to kill some of the more 100 hostages they hold.",

Again, as John just mentioned, at least 1,000 people are now reported dead in Israel according to the Israeli embassy to the United States. Palestinian officials are reporting at least 765 deaths are now reported in Gaza. And as President Biden is preparing to deliver remarks on this situation that is unfolding, his remarks a little later this afternoon, we do know at least 11 Americans are among the dead, several more are still unaccounted for.",

I saw, there's a cloud of smoke coming up on the horizon there just now. What we're seeing is this multiplications, plums of smoke rising up from - from Gaza after those air strikes.This town here really only came back under full Israeli control over the past couple of days. There are still a lot of police patrols, military patrols around here. Absolutely you can see from here just how frequently Israel is targeting Gaza. They're using not only the air strikes that they were over the past couple of days, but they're using artillery as well. But it's between here, this town and the border, that you have so many of those kibbutz's, so many of those small villages that Hamas stormed into on early Saturday morning. And those have only - only this past night been coming more fully back under Israeli military control. We went to one of those, Kafar Aza (ph), just about half a mile - three quarters of a mile from the Gaza fence. And you can see where the Hamas militants stormed through the gate. The general in charge there told us that there were 70 militants. They came in there at about 6:30 a.m. Saturday morning and he said it's taken 48 hours, quite literally, to fight them out. And when we went in there, scenes of destruction. Houses blown apart. There were dead bodies of Hamas fighters lying around. The Israeli Defense Force were taking out the bodies of Israelis who had been killed in the houses. Women and children in the houses. I was told of one story where the husband and wife had twins, 10- years-old. They hid them in the cupboard in their small apartment there and then they, the parents, went out to try to hold Hamas back. [09:0501] The parents were killed and their neighbors heard the children crying out from the cupboard several hours later. The children were safe. The parents weren't. I spoke to the general in charge about the military operation, about what it was like. This is a 39-year veteran of service in Israel's military forces. He'd never witnessed anything like this, he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. ITAI VERUV, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES: What I saw, hundreds of terrorists is full of -- full gear, with all of the equipment and all the ability, make a massacre, go from apartment from apartment, from room to room, and kill babies, mothers, fathers in their bedrooms.",
