Trump wasn't the final defendant to surrender in the 2020 Georgia election interference indictment. This morning, the last two turned themselves in. So, now all 19 defendants have been booked. One of them has to remain in jail until his bond is set. Another already has a trial date just eight weeks away. And one is the latest to say that she was acting at then-President Trump's direction.

      "sentences": "Right.This is very likely to be a refrain that comes up again and again and again. But, right now, this is coming from Cathy Latham, one of the fake electors who is accused as part of this racketeering conspiracy and other charges in the case against Donald Trump and 18 others. Cathy Latham is saying in a court filing that she wants her case moved to federal court because she was essentially acting at the direction of the administration, the direction of the president specifically. And that allows her some protections, she says, under the Constitution. She also says she was following the lawyers' advice when she became a fake elector, the lawyers around Donald Trump who were telling her that was the plan moving forward. And so this is indicative of a couple things,one, that we're going to have a bunch of federal court proceedings here, not just with her, but with two other fake electors who've asked for the same type of protection. We also are seeing a judge already willing to look at similar arguments being made by Mark Meadows, who was the White House chief of staff, Jeffrey Clark, who was in the Justice Department at the time, on whether the case could be moved to federal court. Trump hasn't asked for that yet, but he has some time. He still could. And the other thing that's indicative of is that it's not a defense that Cathy Latham and the others are making now. It's just a legal argument to try and get the case moved. But they very well could start building this out into what their defense would be if they are to go to trial, trying to point the finger at the people above them, specifically Donald Trump. And so we're going to wait and see if that comes into play as we wait and watch for more of these possible filings and to see what the judge wants to do here. It looks right now like the federal judge who is handling these questions of moving the case is going to take each of these people's petitions one at a time. There's already a hearing set for Monday with Mark Meadows, where there will be witness testimony.",

At the same time the former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, also charged in this case, his bid to move his case federal court is set for September 18th. Fani Willis has until September 5 to file a written court response to Clark's request. We will see if those attempts are successful. It is during that same week of September 5 that DA Willis wanted Trump and all 18 of his co-defendants to be arraigned. Exact dates each defendant will have to be arraigned has not been worked out, for the most part, except for Kenneth Chesebro right here. He is accused of being the architect of that fake electors plot, his arraignment set for September 6. Chesebro had requested a speedy trial, moving up his dates. The DA's office has pointed to that request as one of their reasons for a trial date for all the other defendants as well of October 23. The former president he has already filed a motion to oppose this date. His other legal cases, though, make for a very busy calendar coming up, particularly in an election year, his next few months littered with proposed trial dates starting possibly as early as October 2, lasting all the way up until May of next year. You can see there the New York A.G. civil trial, the GA trial, the federal elections of version plot, the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, the New York state hush money trial, criminal classified documents trial date as well. Again, some of these are proposed. We will see when they actually happen. Let's speak now to CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers. I do want to begin, if I can, Jennifer, with the latest news here. And that is, Cathy Latham, she served as a fake elector in Trump's plot to overturn the election. She has said in her case she was following the orders of then-President Trump. She's not the only one. Co-defendant Shawn Still, David Shafer have made similar allegations. Is that damaging? Is that legally dangerous for the president, the former president himself?",

So, it doesn't necessarily mean bad things in terms of what she's going to claim when it comes to the actual case if she does go to trial at the end of the day. But it's a hint, right?

You have to prove the existence of the conspiracy, the racketeering enterprise, and its scope for every single trial that you do. So the prosecutors are not going to want to do that. And defendants are going to want more time. So we're definitely not going to see a huge trial in October. And we may see some severance. So, it will depend on how many defendants exit the case. I think, in pretty quick order here, Fani Willis and her team will start trying to plead out some of these lower-level defendants and get them out of the case altogether so that they end up with a group that is manageable for trial. So we may see more than one trial depending on how many are left and depending on whether Chesebro stays with his demand for an early trial, but we certainly won't see five, six or more trials like that.",

They will be mostly focused on what he does as far as which predicate acts they prove up and that sort of thing.
