Migrants have been barred from entering the US more than 2 million times since March 2020 when Title 42 was enacted, and in recent days, an average of almost 2,500 migrants a day have been moving across the border between Mexico and the U.S. through El Paso alone. MARIO D'AGOSTINO, DEPUTY CITY MANAGER, EL PASO, TEXAS: Title 42 is only going to make that situation worse, where they're going to have more apprehensions. And so we're going to see a lot more releases into the community and we're not prepared for it. LAVANDERA (voice-over): Just three weeks ago, according to Customs and Border Protection, the seven day rolling average was fewer than 1700, 1000s of migrants are now coming not just from Central and South America, but Haiti and even Cuba according to U.S. immigration officials.",

Because as you know, Jake, El Paso isn't their destination, they are reuniting with family across the country as they await their asylum hearing.Where we don't have the help and support is in the emergency shelter area. Most of these folks have purchased either airline tickets once they've gotten here or Greyhound bus tickets, but sometimes they can't get a ticket out the same day. And you know, they'll have to wait one day or two days, and they need a place to sleep, a place to stay. And our NGOs are beyond capacity. So, I've called -- I had a conversation late last night with Rosa DeLauro, our Appropriations Chairwoman, and I see the omnibus as an opportunity. You know, your reporter just talked about the government funding that we're hoping to get done for the next 12 months and that we're hoping to pass before Christmas Eve. I'm hoping that that omnibus and I've advocated for written a letter, spoken to Rosa, to Chairwoman DeLauro. We also need in addition to robust funding, everything that was laid out in -- by your reporter. We also need a federally run emergency shelter so that we don't have folks sleeping on the street. And so my hope is that Republicans will see what's happening, will understand that we need the resources to respond immediately to this humanitarian crisis. But over the long term, Jake, Congress has kicked the can for too long. There is a way for us to address this not just in a way that promotes security, in a way that promotes our self- interest, but in a way that also doesn't sacrifice our values.

And he's been in danger all that time separated from his family because of the risk from the Taliban. But even when you get that approval, you just get in the queue, in effect. And let's just for folks at home, look at the numbers right now. At this very moment, there were 15,000 principal applicants, these are the people who worked for the U.S. military who are ready to fly as the State Department says is about -- as well as about 30,000 immediate family members. That's 50,000 people. The State Department when it's running flights, is getting about 250 out per week. At that rate, that takes four years. They stopped those flights for the World Cup, by the way, because those flights are going to Qatar. Behind them another 100,000. So you look at that math there.
