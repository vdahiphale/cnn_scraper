We don't know how quickly the deal could come together, and it's entirely possible, depending on what he says, that the deal could get scuttled. I think the White House has been working pretty closely with the Israelis to try to tone down what they fear would be the sharpest edges of that speech.

And she wanted a higher corporate tax rate. Currently, it's at 21 percent. She wanted to push it up even higher than Joe Biden proposed. All of that, leaning on the rich to pay more to make the economy work. Donald Trump points to his track record of wages rising faster than inflation in his administration. And once again, he's promising tax cuts and raising tariffs on imported goods, which some economists say actually could cost consumers but nonetheless, many Republicans think will actually work in a positive way. On abortion, she supports legislation to protect abortion rights nationally. She's the first sitting vice president to visit an abortion clinic. Donald Trump promised to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2016. And once he got the right players into the Supreme Court, that's exactly what they did. However, he opposes a national abortion ban, perhaps mindful of the fact that most Americans think it should be legal. And he favors leaving it to states to decide. And on the border, Kamala Harris backed the bipartisan border security deal endorsed by Biden back in the winter. She's worked with countries in Central America to deter illegal immigration and oppose family separation when people are caught the border. Trump blocked that bipartisan border security deal endorsed by Biden. Remember, the Republicans rose up against it in February and wiped it out. And he wants to resume building the wall, which he did not complete in his first term, and closing the border and promising mass deportations. So just a few areas, but areas in which they are substantially different from each other. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
