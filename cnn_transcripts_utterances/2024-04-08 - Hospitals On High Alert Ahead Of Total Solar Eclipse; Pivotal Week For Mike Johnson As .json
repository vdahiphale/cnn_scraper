We're going to have more on that shortly.This morning though hospitals in the path of totality are on high alert especially concerned about the millions of people, extra people who will be on the roads. CNN's Meg Tirrell is with us now. So how are those hospitals preparing?",

OK, I really do want that. You know, people are going to where they're going to get to, to watch the eclipse over time. But they all leave at once. I mean, once the thing is done, everyone is going to flee wherever they are, which is why there's so many traffic incidents, at least there were last time, I can see why they're concerned. You talked briefly about viewing the eclipse safely. I don't think this can be stressed enough. Don't look directly at it correct?",

You may not notice symptoms if you do cause damage to your eyes for a few hours. But it can cause blurry vision, it can cause holes in your vision sort of altered colored vision, a lot of different things can happen.And unfortunately, if you look at the sun for long enough that vision damage can be permanent. And so of course, what you want to do if you plan to look directly at the sun in any time, other than totality when the sun's light is completely blocked, you need safe eclipse viewing glasses, a lot of libraries are giving these out. You can go on the American Astronomical Society website to find retailers that might even still have these. But these are 1,000 times darker than the darkest sunglasses. They allow in only a fraction of the sun's visible light. And you need to make sure that they are ISO certified. And really, if you're going to use these and you're not absolutely positive that you've got a good pair because counterfeits are out there, make sure that when you're looking through them at the brightest lights, you can only barely see the outline of them. Looking at the sun should be comfortable. But don't do it even for more than a few seconds at a time if you're not absolutely positive they're completely safe. John?",

She's one of the leading scientists for NASA's Heliophysics division. So we're talking about the physics of the sun.And, you know, when we hit totality, at 3:06 in the afternoon, it's going to be all of us. Up to 50,000 people, as you mentioned, Kate, looking up at the jumbotrons. And Nikki Rayl, the scientists from Heliophysics at NASA said that she's going to be looking at the structures emanating from the corona because the song and dance is known between the Earth, Moon and the Sun. It's been predicted since the time of the Babylonians millennia ago. But we don't know what is happening with the Cronus. So much of it is still a mystery.

      "sentences": "Everybody -- yes. And we want to know is Mother Nature going to actually cooperate with all of these folks that have traveled places? And the answer is, yes, especially in some areas more than others. So let's take a look, we've got two separate areas where we're talking about pretty close to ideal conditions. That's going to be for areas of Southeastern Missouri, places like Cape Girardeau, Southern Illinois, Carbondale, for example, and then also Indiana. We're talking places like Evansville going to be very, very fantastic weather there for the viewing this afternoon.We've also got another area that's going to be far north along the path. We're talking basically from Burlington, Vermont, all the way up through Caribou, Maine. Conditions are expected to be very sunny there in that spot as well. You are going to have a couple of spots where we are looking at a little bit more cloud cover. That does include places like Niagara Falls, maybe up to Rochester, New York. And also the big concern is going to be Texas. Now we may get lucky. The bulk of the strong to severe thunderstorms are expected after the eclipse. So that will likely pose a bigger problem for people as they are leaving. The real question is before the storm start, you often get clouds that come in ahead of time. And so the real question is, how early do those clouds come in? Can they hold off at least until after the eclipse? Now, once everybody is done, and they are starting to head home, they may encounter some issues in terms of very large hail. We're talking tennis ball size or even larger, some damaging winds and the potential for some tornadoes. And especially if you live east, say you were traveling west into the path of the eclipse, but you've got to head back east home, you may encounter some of those showers and thunderstorms. But again, we are also going to have plenty of very nice spots to talk about. Dallas is going to have some increasing clouds. But it's not going to be completely overcast. So you will at least maybe fingers crossed, get at least a portion of that time where you will be able to see it. Indianapolis a different story, if you woke up this morning in Indianapolis looked up and saw some clouds, don't worry, they're actually going to be decreasing as we go through the rest of the day. So you'll start to see even more sunshine by the time we get into the afternoon. And one of the other fantastic spots too is going to be Burlington, Vermont. Yes, a couple clouds here and there. But you're talking about 20 percent cloud coverage and absolute best. So again, in most of these areas, plenty of time to be able to view it. Here you can, again, see some of those clear spots right through there. That's where we're likely going to have some of the best viewing. One thing to note too is the temperature drop. We don't often talk about this. But, yes, when totality takes place, and the moon fully covers the sun, temperatures will actually drop in several places including Carbondale and Indianapolis by several degrees. So it may even feel a little bit different not only that, you'll notice it with your eyes, but they do rebound very quickly back up as soon as the Moon starts to shift away.",

Friends, I want to ask you both about the statement from Donald Trump just a short time ago where he weighed in on his stance on abortion. People had been waiting for this. He had been suggesting he would make some kind of big policy pronouncement. In private, he'd been saying he would support a 15 or 16-week federal ban on abortion. But the statement this morning, all he said is he thinks that should be left up to the states. And he does support some exceptions. So Julie, I want your reaction to that. Is that some middle ground?",

Congratulated the justices he appointed to make that happen, and supported all the states that are banning abortion virtually at conception at this point. So I don't think there's much change from what's going on now in some of the states that are leading to horrific outcomes for women are what Donald Trump proposes to do if you were to get back into the White House.",

What really struck me John, though, in this transcript is the hard pivot he made to politics and to this election cycle. It really sounds to me like he understands there's really no middle ground here.There is no way to make both sides happy. So he's trying to do something to energize Republicans in the states where we're going to see referendums on abortion, and he has a chance to potentially lose if a lot of Democrats show up to vote. So that's what I got out of this. It wasn't about the policy, but so much about the politics.",

And so I think a lot of it was just self-congratulatory, and then trying to get out of this whole IVF debacle that that overturn of Roe versus Wade has now led to in places like Alabama, and so it's not artful. It's not skillful. And actually, it's not very Trump-like in the sense that he didn't really take any declaratory action on either side, it was kind of squishy, which seemed a little out of character just shows me that he's very uncomfortable with this issue.

A top economist is warning, rising oil prices, he thinks is the number one threat to the U.S. economy. CNN's Matt Egan is joining us now. Matt, you know, when you take a look at this, the economy is doing so well. And then to hear this, why does he does Moody's believe that oil prices are such a huge risk right now?",

But oil prices they do pose a growing threat to the economy, one that could really undo a lot of those positive. So you can see that chart shows that U.S. oil prices, they topped at $7 a barrel last week for the first time since October. And this is up from around $70 a barrel to start the year.Now Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi, he told me that, look, we can kind of live with 85 to $90 a barrel, the economy can handle that. But once you get closer to $100, that's really the danger zone because that's going to hurt consumer spending, especially low income families. As Andy said, quote, it's the most serious threat to the economy. Nothing does more damage to the economy more quickly than higher oil prices. Now, remember, the higher oil prices go, the more all of us have to pay for gas at the pump. The national average today is up to 360 a gallon that is a fresh five-month high, that's up six cents in a week, 20 cents over the past month. And if gas prices go too high, that could also unwind some of the progress on the inflation front. And that could delay when the Fed can start cutting interest rates or even by how much the Fed cuts rates. There also could be significant political consequences here. Moody's has a model out there, a forecasting model that finds gas prices are a key variable in the November election. How key? Well, Moody said that if gas prices hit $4 a gallon and stay above there, that alone could be enough for Donald Trump to win the White House. Sara?",
