According to officials on the Palestinian side of the crossing, as many as 110 foreign passport holders are traveling through the checkpoint at the Gaza border. The crossing, you remember, has been closed since Hamas attacked Israel, sparking this war. Since then, people have not been allowed through. Now they are. The first people to officially cross into Egypt were injured Palestinians, we are told. Ambulances were seen moving through this morning, you see here. This is after Qatar brokered the deal between Israel, Egypt and Hamas, all coming to an agreement on this. Now, under the full agreement, up to 500 foreign nationals, including some Americans, will be allowed to leave Gaza. Also, moments ago, we want to show you posted from inside of one of the checkpoint waiting areas. We have new images coming out of women holding a baby there in the waiting area.

This is purportedly following a second blast at the Jabalia refugee camp. Now, we do not know what caused this supposed blast. Yesterday, Israel did confirm that it conducted an airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp. It says, Israel does, that it was targeting a Hamas terror leader. Israel says it has killed that leader. But Israel also acknowledges that civilians were killed there. An Israeli official would not tell me how many civilians they believe were killed there. This is video that is said to be from another blast today. The Israeli Defense Forces, Israel Defense Forces, have not commented to us on this alleged incident at this point. We have been asking them for comment on this. Civil defense officials inside Gaza, which is run by Hamas, they say, basically, Hamas says that there are casualties here and people trapped in the rubble from a new blast there. That is the limits of what we know about this. Let's get as much more as we can. Salma Abdelaziz joins us now. Salma, what are you hearing about this?",

You can see where it's situated, not terribly far from Gaza City, which seems to be getting surrounded by Israeli forces at this time. Let's now move to the other side of Israel right now, close to the Israel-Lebanon border. That's where our CNN's Jim Sciutto has been for days now. Jim, tell us what you're seeing today.",

      "sentences": "So, today, another day where you have some cross-border fire.There was an attempt, the IDF tells us, by Hezbollah militants just across the border in Lebanon to fire anti-tank missiles across the border. That was spotted by Israeli forces in advance. They struck back, with an Israeli tank firing at that position and taking it out before they were able to fire. This is a regular back-and-forth that we're seeing really across the length of this northern border of Israel with Lebanon. The thing is, John, as you look at that map there, is that the fear in Israel today and the reason you have so many thousands of IDF forces, including tanks like the ones behind me, situated now across the northern border, is that these Iranian proxies outside of Gaza where Hamas is, Hezbollah in Lebanon, proxies in Syria to the Northeast, and then the Houthis in Yemen, which does not border Israel, but it's within missile range, that they will all make a decision to jump into this war in numbers. To date, they have been taking shots at Israel. You had missile attempts more than once now from the Houthi rebels. These are long- range, highly capable precision missiles, shot down, but, still, they have attempted. You have multiple shots per day coming from Lebanon. And you have had similar from Syria. The worry is that that all happens at once and in much greater volume to overwhelm not just the ground defenses, but also the missile defenses. And, John, with that in mind, a lot of attention in this country is focused on this Friday, when the leader of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, is going to speak. He hasn't spoken in public for some time. And the worry is that he might -- we don't know this -- he might announce a greater involvement of Hezbollah in this war, order his troops, in effect, to attack. We don't know that yet, but there is a great deal of attention being paid to that day and that speech to see if that might signal an expansion of this war. And that, of course, John, has been a worry since the beginning.",

The Iranians have proxies inside Syria that have been firing missiles, Lebanon, and then, of course, Hamas as well.So you can see Israel faced with possible rockets and missiles being shot from every direction here. And, Jim, as you know, I think the hottest position is certainly the Israel-Lebanon border in the north there, where there's been fire back and forth.",

We're joined now by Joel Rubin to talk more about this. He's a former deputy assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration. He's also running as a Democrat for Congress in Maryland. Joel, thanks for coming in. Let's talk about the Rafah Crossing and what we're learning. I mean, getting the Rafah Crossing open again has been a real priority of the U.S. State Department from really the beginning of this war. And now we are seeing some of this.

This is a significant diplomatic victory, a long time coming, several weeks now of negotiation with the United States, with our American partners in Qatar and Egypt, and obviously negotiating with Israel and Hamas to get this done. It's super significant, to use that term. It's crucial to have security for these individuals getting out. It's really important that all civilians who are able to leave, leave. And I think what this demonstrates is that American leadership diplomatically makes a difference. And, right now, Secretary Blinken, heading out to the region on Friday, he's going to lean in further -- and he's been telegraphing that quite publicly as well -- on the humanitarian side for the Palestinians to make sure that humanitarian assistance gets in. Now that we can prove that people can get out, it's time to make sure that goods do get in, in a robust way to take care of Palestinian lives as this work continues.",

I want to play a little bit more for everyone what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR:  The reality is that the Jewish community is uniquely, uniquely targeted by pretty much every terrorist organization across the spectrum. And when you look at a group that makes up 2.4 percent, roughly, of the American population, it should be jarring to everyone that that same population accounts for something like 60 percent of all religious-based hate crimes.

And five years ago, the worst terrorist attack against Jews occurred in that synagogue, massacring 11 private -- 11 individuals who were just going there to pray. Since that time, it almost feels like that's like a -- sort of a naive moment in our experience here in the United States. What we have seen now has shocked the senses beyond anything that any American Jew expected, the largest massacre of Jews in history of the world since the Holocaust took place on October 7. And it's only seemingly facilitated more Jewish hatred here in the United States. And so, to your question, yes, President Biden and his team, they have been ahead of the curve on this, putting up the counter-antisemitism strategy. They have been very robustly engaged. But I don't think anybody saw the level of vitriol coming that we now see. And it requires leadership. It requires people to speak out. It requires heads of universities to not bury their heads in the sand and to actually defend Jewish students publicly, to call out those who are engaging in hate speech and engaging in aggressive actions towards Jewish students just for being Jewish, to call out lynch mobs for what they are. It requires local leaders in local government to stand up and define what is exactly occurring and to call on citizens to not do it. We are Americans. We are all Americans. I'm a fifth-generation American. I'm proud of my grandfather and his brothers serving in World War II and on and on. Our history is tied tightly with the United States. And this is anti-American at its core. And so I'm grateful that we have a leader in the White House. I think it requires leadership across the board at every institution, as well as in our homes, in our education, in the way that we speak. But, without a doubt, this is a very frightening and very eye-opening and, quite frankly, depressing moment for the American Jewish community.",
