Kevin McCarthy has moved into that office, but the question is, whether or not he will remain in that office after he took up residence there a few days ago. Maybe a little too early. So, to talk about all of this as we are awaiting for lawmakers to return today is Republican Congressman-elect Ryan Zinke of Montana, who is the former interior secretary under former President Trump. He has voted for McCarthy six times. I imagine you will be voting for him again today? RYAN ZINKE (R), MONTANA CONG.-ELECT: Again. You know, and it's really not about a speaker at this point.

Beijing is now threatening reciprocal measures.The growing international dispute of little concern to Chinese families that are struggling with the sudden loss of loved ones. Some statistical models predict China could lose more than a million people due to Covid-19.

A month ago we were talking about desperate Chines people trapped in lockdowns and quarantine camps, these draconian restrictions that were trying to stop Covid. Now Chinese people are enjoying freedom and they're not threatened by these things. But everybody you talk to and their families, they all have Covid.
