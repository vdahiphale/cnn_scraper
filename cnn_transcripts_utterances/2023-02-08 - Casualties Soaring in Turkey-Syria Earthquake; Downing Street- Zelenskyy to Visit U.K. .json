The death toll has now officially topped 9,400, and there are growing fears that number could still rise dramatically. UNICEF says that the quake may have killed thousands of children.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three-month state of emergency, and he's expected to visit disaster areas near the earthquake's epicenter. Emergency workers from around the world are descending on the region. This crew is from France. NATO is sending aid along with the U.S., Mexico, India, Pakistan and many other countries. Northwest Syria has especially hard hit. Heavy equipment is in short, supply leaving people to dig through the rubble with their bare hands to find survivors. The Red Crescent is calling for other countries to lift sanctions and allow in international aid. It's also set up more than 126 temporary shelters to house displaced families. And amid all the destruction, there are signs of hope. Rescue crews pulled these two young siblings from a collapsed building on Tuesday. And this was the scene in Idlib, Syria, where crowds cheered the White Helmets for saving this family. Our Becky Anderson is in Turkey and has been on the ground witnessing these rescue efforts, the devastation, and the hope. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR CONNECT THE WORLD (voice-over): From underneath the destruction, a momentary sigh of relief. The search and rescue teams find a sign of life will sifting through the rubble. But seconds later, another lifeless body is found. Monday's devastating quake has left an ever-growing death toll, and it's thousands. Leaving many families across Syria and Turkey without homes and without loved ones. As the snow falls, grief is being compounded with freezing conditions. Huddled around a strong fire, survivors worry about friends and relatives still trapped under the rubble. Forbidden by authorities to intervene, Murat Alinak says he just wants to help recover his relatives to give them a proper sendoff. MURAT ALINAK, QUAKE SURVIVOR (through translator): We are under the snow without a home, without anything. We can overcome this. We can fast for 40 days and still overcome this. But let us recover for the funerals. ANDERSON (voice-over): International aid has poured in from all corners of the world. France, Mexico, Germany and India are some at the countries who pledged to step up efforts. Planes carrying supplies from Iran and Iraq also arriving in Damascus on Tuesday. As C-17 cargo planes from the UAE flew quickly to the quake-stricken area.",

And where there is hope, there is an enormous effort going on. I'm going to stand away from the cameras, so Sabeel the cameraman can zoom in and so that you can get a sense, Bianca, what is going on behind me. We know, just some hours ago, that these rescue workers made contact with a man and his two sons, who are buried underneath that rubble. They were in contact, can you believe it, buy mobile phone. So what they're doing at the moment is trying to ensure that they can get to that family, if they're still alive, and let's hope that they are. But they've got to do in a painstaking and meticulous way, because they could potentially still be people that are alive beneath them. They're calling for silence again. So, we're just going to go silent for you. Bianca, they are very, very close to the area in this apartment building where that family is situated. Let's just listen in. (SPEAKING TURKISH LANGUAGE)",

The U.K. has been a stalwart supporter of Ukraine throughout this.

President Zelenskyy as you know is a master of this. And to signal to the world that this really is a moment when Ukraine really needs its allies to step up.Certainly, we heard from Biden's State of the Union address that they are standing with Ukraine.

Finish the job, perhaps, for two years from now when he's likely is running for reelection for a second term in office despite being the oldest president in history.

The president saying in fact that they did have it on the table. That, leading to a back and forth that the president was more than happy to engage in, even as he was called by some Americans, a liar, shutting that from the audience.The president saying, he welcomed a conversion moment. Saying there wasn't unanimity on an issue. Calling for all members to stand in support of seniors. All members stood and supported seniors. It was a moment that was off script and one that thrilled White House officials. As one official told me, you could not have crafted that moment any better. It was also a window into a president, despite his age, very clearly is energized by the audience that he's speaking in front of, an audience that was engaged as much as he was throughout the course the night. There could not have been a better moment for that. For a president that doesn't command large crowds, doesn't often try and sit in the forefront of cable news or in print publications on a regular basis, this was an opportunity to speak to a lot of people who White House officials viewed as not regularly engaged in political news or political media. This was his chance to reach out to them with his economic proposals, from his kitchen table proposals, with his calls for bipartisanship. Frankly, it was a lead up, a test case, if you will, for a reelection message that the president is likely to roll out in weeks ahead. He'll certainly be rolling out in the days ahead, traveling to Wisconsin on Wednesday, a critical swing state. To Florida on Thursday, a state Democrats seemed to have lost a grip on over the course of the last couple of election cycles. All the highlight's of his economic agenda. All the highlights of his plans going ahead, all to implicitly highlight the fact that despite his age, despite his approval ratings, this president, as he demonstrated in his primetime address, fully plans on running for reelection in 2024.
