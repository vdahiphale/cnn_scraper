With the varying theories on the virus' origins continuing to swirl, what's the take from the medical community?Joining us now is one of the biggest members of the medical community, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent and the host of Chasing Life, the podcast, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, I feel like we have been talking about this for so many years now, and still there's no definitive answer. There are two theories about it, basically that it spread from animals to humans or this one that is now gaining traction with this update from the DOE that it spread from a lab in Wuhan. What kind of evidence or investigation -- what else could be learned given what we have seen from the Chinese government to prove definitively what exactly this was? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. I mean, look, it's been three years now that this question has sort of been out there and some of the new evidence that prompted I think this report from the Department of Energy that there was coronavirus research happening in these labs. Frankly, if you're a reporter covering this, we have known that for some time. I mean, this type of research has been happening in those labs. In fact, one of the lead researchers, Xi Jian Li (ph), who works in the lab, she is known as the bat lady, because there has been 20 years, really, of coronavirus research happening there over the last 20 years since SARS. Really, that research has been happening. To answer your question, though, I think there are a few things that could make this knowable. I think the answer here is knowable, Kaitlan. One is that, you know, if there was coronavirus research happening, how closely linked were the coronaviruses that were being researched to COVID? You know, you got to sequence the viral samples. Are they similar, are they identical, are they related? That would be a really important piece of data. Testing blood samples of the people who worked in the lab. If this was an accidental leak, it is likely the people in the lab were most likely to have been infected first. We understand that some blood samples were taken, but we have never seen the results of what those samples showed, and then, obviously, like a full forensics investigation into the lab. With regard to that first thing, you know, the idea of looking at the virus samples, there was a database that basically had all the data on what coronaviruses were being studied. We have asked for that many times. It's been asked for. One of the investigators on the World Health Organization investigative team, I specifically asked him about this as well. Listen to how he answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
