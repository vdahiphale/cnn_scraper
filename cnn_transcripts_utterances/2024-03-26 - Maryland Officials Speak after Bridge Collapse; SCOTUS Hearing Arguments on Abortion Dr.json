On behalf of the FBI, I would like to say that we are with you we're with Baltimore and we, with the partners, every step of the way. The FBI, on very first, looking at and assessing this matter from an investigative standpoint, I want to be clear that there is no specific or credible information to suggest that there are ties to terrorism in this incident. The FBI has been part of this response from the beginning. We came within one hour to the command post and quickly latched up with our very strong partners all along the way. We will bring whatever resources that the FBI has to bear. We've already brought our crisis response, our victim services and just recently our underwater search evidence recovery teams are on site and we will continue to provide all those resources as long as it takes. And as the investigation goes on we will take it to its logical conclusion along with our partners. To the people of Baltimore, to the public, I ask you to be patient as we go through this and as information becomes available to us. And, lastly, I want to say thank you. Thank you to our partners. Thank you to everyone who -- in the FBI and counts on the FBI, we will always bring what we need to the people of Baltimore and we are with you. Next, I'd like to introduce the Coast Guard.",

Remember, this is a dynamic situation and more trickling through as the day goes on, perhaps the most significant than what we've heard is that the vessel did alert a mayday signal. So between the alert of mayday as well as the collapse, there was a small window where they were able to stop the flow of traffic. He reiterated that the investigation is still ongoing, that details are still very sketchy but importantly that the vessel had put out a mayday signal. In terms of the numbers that we're looking at right now, what the latest numbers are telling us, six, that they're searching for, six potential people that are trapped in the water. They have rescued two; one is in hospital and one uninjured. Those numbers, of course, against in terms of what we've been seeing preliminary and they reiterated that things could change. I want to bring in CNN transportation analyst, Mary Schiavo, who is also listening into that press conference. Mary, no surprise that we are starting to get a little bit more information but I think importantly that they've said, things could change. And, of course, the investigation is still ongoing.

Reproductive rights are back on the docket nearly two years after the landmark ruling, Roe v. Wade, was overturned. Justices are hearing oral arguments right now on a blockbuster case that could limit access to the widely used abortion drug, mifepristone, even in states where abortion is legal. Now the court has to decide if the FDA overstepped its authority by making it easier for women to get access to the pill, which is one of the two drugs in a regimen for medication abortion. Now just last year, research shows it was used in 63 percent of all abortions across the U.S. CNN's Justice correspondent Jessica Schneider is live in Washington. And as we said, Jessica, the oral arguments are now underway. Walk us through this case.",

And that's when this group ofdoctors sued -- and they argued that the FDA did not follow proper procedures when it approved this abortion pill in the year 2000. They also say that they didn't follow -- the FDA didn't follow proper procedures when they relaxed certain requirements to obtain the pill in both 2016 and 2021. And those doctors actually won in the courts below. But all of those rulings have been put on hold until the Supreme Court here makes its decision, which we're expecting by the end of June, the arguments are ongoing this morning. So for now, the abortion pill, it remains widely available. But the question will be, will it continue to remain available? And will maybe those restrictions go back into place that were relaxed by the FDA in recent years? Some of the restrictions that were relaxed include women can now take the pill up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. That's up from seven originally. Also the number of required doctors' visits were lessened from three to one. And crucially, women can now get this pill via the mail, which, for many women, has proved crucial in the years since Roe v. Wade was overturned because, if you're in a state that outlaws abortion, you can still get this abortion pill by mail up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. So there was a lot at stake in this decision especially because, as you said, half -- more than half of all abortions are performed using this medication. So the Supreme Court is yet again weighing into this abortion issue just two years after saying it was for the states to decide. So the question now is to the power of the FDA to have even approved this pill in the first place. And it would be, Amara, monumental if the Supreme Court suddenly questions the FDA's power in that capacity. It's really something a court, especially the Supreme Court, has never done. So there was a lot at stake here, especially because, like we said, more than half of all abortions are now performed using this medication, mifepristone. So the arguments are ongoing now. We're about 20 minutes in. Right now there's a lot of question as to whether this doctors group that initially brought this lawsuit, whether they even have the power to bring it, a concept known as standing. Those have been the arguments so far but there's a lot more to come this morning, Amara. (CROSSTALK)",

So the FECA did not independently require that REMS restriction. And in fact, it couldn't be imposed once FDA had made that determination. Now that doesn't affect other sources of law. FDA was not affirmatively approving mailing in violation of Comstock even if you interpreted it that way. And we don't think it means what respondents suggest it means.

Many women might go because they're experiencing heavy bleeding, which mimics a miscarriage and they might just need to know whether or not they're having a complication. But in that kind of circumstance, the woman is not having a serious adverse event from mifepristone and so it doesn't call into question the safety determinations regarding the drug. And, you know, at the end of the day, FDA carefully parsed those studies. It made specific determinations about the results to be gleaned with respect to safety and efficacy.

So what - - in 2016, the REMS for mifepristone were aligned to be more consistent with the reporting requirement that applies to all 20,000-plus FDA approved drugs.

The lower court's decision merely restored longstanding and crucial protections, under which millions of women used abortion drugs. We've heard a lot this morning about standing. Article 3 is satisfied here because, one, the FDA relies on OB hospitalists (ph) to care for women harmed by abortion drugs. Two, the FDA concedes that between 2.9 percent and 4.6 percent of women will end up in the emergency room. And three, the FDA acknowledges that women are even more likely to need surgical intervention and other medical care without an in-person visit. According to Guttmacher, nearly 650,000 women take mifepristone every single year. It's no surprise that respondents have experienced an increase in emergency room visits and, indeed, treated women suffering from abortion drug harms tens of thousands of times -- excuse me -- dozens of times. Women have suffered tens of thousands of times. The respondent doctors will be forced to manage abortion drug harm is not a bug in FDA's system but part of its very design. Ruling against respondents on standing here would allow federal agencies to conscript non-regulated parties into violating their consciences and suffering other harm without judicial recourse. Article 3 neither demands nor permits this. FDA's outsourcing of abortion drug harm to respondent doctors forces them to choose between helping a woman with a life-threatening condition and violating their conscience. This Hobson's (ph) choice is intolerable on the merits. FDA failed to comply with basic APA requirements. In 2021, it eliminated the initial in- person visit based on data it says elsewhere is unreliable. And in 2016, it failed to consider or explain the cumulative effects of its wholesale removal of safeguards. These actions fall far short of what the AP (ph) requires this court should affirm. I welcome of course questions.",
