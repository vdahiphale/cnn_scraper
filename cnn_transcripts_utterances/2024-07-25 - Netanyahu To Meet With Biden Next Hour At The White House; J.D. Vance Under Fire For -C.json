You are watching ONE WORLD.It is a high stakes meeting that comes at a precarious moment in already very fragile relationship. In the next hour or so, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House. He's going to be speaking with U.S. President Joe Biden. It comes one day after the Prime Minister's really combative speech to Congress, where he lashed out at critics of Israel's war on Gaza, but did not address the status of ceasefire negotiations. Later on this afternoon, Netanyahu is also going to be meeting separately with Vice President Kamala Harris, who did not attend his speech on Wednesday. Aide say that the presumptive Democratic nominee will emphasize her independence from President Biden on Israeli policy without necessarily breaking with him. I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who joins us live now from Jerusalem. It's interesting, Jeremy, because while President Biden is certainly pro-Israel, his relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, is fraught and it has been complicated at times. What do we know, for sure, about Kamala Harris' view on the war and how will that shape this meeting today?",

And it is clear that the Trump campaign and Republicans really writ large, are still grappling with -- and scrambling with how to sort of run against a Vice President Harris. She, of course, has been on the national stage for quite some time but never in this position. So he has called her several nicknames, but they really are walking this line. And the question is by firing all of these, you know, attacks at her and calling her names and things, is that actually going to unify Democrats even more. I mean, just a couple days ago, the Democratic Party was, you know, really divided over what to do. And Donald Trump has played a very large part in unifying the Democratic Party because they are intent on trying to win.

And that could mean that some of those sporting events, for instance, the triathlon swimming event, the marathon swimming event, might be delayed and possibly not be held at all. Still, Paris officials convinced that they will take place. The other extremely ambitious target that they said for these games, as you mentioned, is that opening ceremony for tomorrow night. It will happen along the river Seine. And, of course, what that allows French officials to do is to showcase their extraordinary city. This is Notre Dame, Zain, still under reconstruction since the fire over a few years ago. But what Paris officials have told us over and over again is that they set these ambitions that many said, including Parisians, simply couldn't be achieved, because Paris was worthy of something that ambitious and spectacular.

And racism is something that is being raised in this incident. It looks from the video like there were white police officers and that the men who they were encountering were Asian. We know that several leading Muslim faith groups have come out and expressed concern about this, the Muslim Council of Britain among them, which is the leading umbrella group for Muslims in the U.K., for Muslim organizations. I should say, Rochdale, which we understand is where at least one of the men involved is from according to the local MP there is about 18 percent Muslim, so a very large Muslim population there. As to whether racism played a part, we don't know, but that question is being raised. And among the groups that are going out to protest this evening or promising to protest this evening is stand up to racism and anti-racism groups.

Then he's got Kamala Harris who is in lockstep with the administration, but at the same time she's shown a lot of empathy towards the Palestinians. And then he's got the meeting tomorrow with Donald Trump. And there has been a little bit of resentment between Donald Trump and Netanyahu primarily because Netanyahu called President Biden in 2020 to congratulate him when obviously Donald Trump believes that he won the election. So just talk us through how Netanyahu seamlessly manages these three meetings. And how he changes his message, depending on who he's going to be talking to over the next couple of days.",

Sport is something that unifies us. And so I think nations really do capitalize on that because they know that it's going to bring people there. ELIUD KIPCHOGE, EIGHT-TIME OLYMPIC CHAMPION: It's the soft part for us to tell people actually what's inside Kenya.

They took the gold in Tokyo three years ago. On the eve of the tournament, they were accused of spying on their first opponent's New Zealand by operating a drone to monitor the New Zealand training session. That, of course, did not go down at all well. Two members of the Canadian women's team have been sent home. The women's coach of the Canadian team, Bev Priestman, agreed to sit out this opening game against New Zealand. And this game is currently underway, and it's not far from being over, to be honest. And within the last couple of minutes, Canada have gone two one up against New Zealand. So I'm sure an awful lot is going to be said about what the Canadian team knew, how, of course, they got that information and whether or not that impacted the result. Meanwhile, you mentioned that the archery is happening. And we've already seen not just an Olympic record, but a world record broken here on Thursday. The South Korean women's team are so good. They are going for a 10th consecutive title here. And their star, Lim Sihyeon (ph), has just shot a world record 694 points. And this isn't even in the main competition.

His finger was hit with a stick, and by all accounts, the finger was pretty much severed. I gather he was lucky that any of it was left hanging on. Apologies for the details. But then he went to see the doctor, and the doctor said, well, you've got two choices. We can either stick some wire in it and try to reconstruct it, but that means you're not going to better do anything for four to six months, or we can just amputate the bit of that finger, and you can go to the Olympics.
