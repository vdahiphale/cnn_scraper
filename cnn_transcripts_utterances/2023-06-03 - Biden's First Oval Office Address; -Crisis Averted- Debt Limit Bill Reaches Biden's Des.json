Just 48 hours ago, there were doubts, in fact, that the highly contentious bill would even survive in Congress. But it did.Last night the president spoke from the Oval Office for the first time ever, to explain what it took to make this happen. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I want to commend speaker McCarthy. You know, he and I, we and our teams, we were able to get along, get things done. We were straightforward, completely honest and respectful with one another. Both sides operated in good faith. Both sides kept their word. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Republicans, however, made clear throughout the process what they were working on, what their priorities were. The president and his team a little bit less so until the bill actually passed. The bill's on its way to the White House. It's expected to be signed on Saturday. And President Biden made clear in his first Oval Office address, that he would be providing the last word, detailing what was in the negotiation, was in the final compromise agreement, why that compromise agreement was so critical. And also starting to frame things for a moment ahead, where the threat of crisis, which had been hanging over this White House, Washington, the country, the economy for the better part of the last six months, is no longer really there. And that an agreement, much like many of his legislative wins over the course of his first two years, underscores that his campaign promises, related to bipartisanship, to compromise, have actually come to fruition.

I think he's going to continue to emphasize this pragmatic approach which, as I mentioned, doesn't energize people, doesn't energize bases, so to speak. But at the end of the day, I think that most Americans understand that this is the path forward. And though he's got 40 percent approval rating, this is really low.

For now at least, as summer approaches, the field of Republican candidates, which will grow by three next week, with former vice president Mike Pence jumping in, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum entering, it's getting crowded.

And that tape was revealed to be in the possession of the Justice Department to Donald Trump's lawyers two months ago in March, when a witness went into the grand jury and was asked about it. And shortly after that witness exited the grand jury, Donald Trump's team got a subpoena depending they turn over that document or any documents they had in their possession related to General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whom Donald Trump was very unhappy with related to Iran and Milley's opposition to having a military strike against that country during the Trump presidency. We also know they were asking about Iran itself. And the Justice Department wanted any classified or any other records that Donald Trump and his team might have related to Iran, including maps or invasion plans. So the Trump legal team goes and looks for documents such as these, turns over what they find in just recent weeks to the Justice Department as part of this criminal investigation but can't locate that document itself. Now there could be a couple different explanations for this. It is plausible that the Justice Department already has this document in its possession and wants to make sure that there are no other copies or notes or any other information related to it still in Trump's possession. They want it back. But it's also possible that the Justice Department doesn't have the document and neither can Trump's team locate it at this time. So another wrinkle in this new reporting about an apparently crucial moment factoring into the criminal case, as the special counsel's office at the Justice Department looks at the possibility of charging Donald Trump with a crime related to mishandling of classified records and obstruction of justice -- Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

It then compares those discussions with the reporting on state media to try and gauge the difference between the official messaging and people's honest to goodness real opinions. For more we're joined by Jonathan Teubner, chief executive of FilterLabs, speaking to us from Berlin. Good to see you and talk to you about this. I want to start with your methodology. I mean, how can you help us discern Russian public opinion? And I want to ask you specifically, what changes have you seen in Russian support for this war more recently?",

And what we've seen over the time is that that's been fairly stable. It's ebbed and flowed over time, of course, but it's been stable.Where we've seen a lot of movement is Russian attitudes toward casualties. However -- and throughout the spring, where we've seen reports that U.S. officials have been reporting something about like 100,000 Russian soldiers have died since -- in the last few months alone -- not 100,000, rather died or wounded. And then that has bled a lot of support in some ways. And the way it's been manifesting is negativity toward casualties. A lot of Russians are complaining about that. But it hasn't yet really translated into negativity toward the war, although we think there's some places where that's changing.",

What we've been tracking in Belgorod, there was -- there was an attack on May 22nd there.And what we saw was like one of these moments where this negativity turned against the war itself and against the Kremlin. All of a sudden that that -- when it came into their life, it was that way. We find this in selectively across Russia. And so what hasn't translated to a broad national negativity, you also have to keep in mind that there are certain regions that are benefiting tremendously from a wartime economy, such that while, you know, Secretary Blinken has -- is right in broad strokes that Russia is not -- is worse off now than it was over a year ago, before they invaded. But there are pockets benefiting from this. So that's going to make it hard in some respects to really turn a national consensus against. And so right now, we see local places and it's about kind of continuing to track those and see whether they emerge into a national incident.",

So I was interested in the things that your program looks at. I mean, you're even looking at things like, you know, changes in the cadence of speech, incidents of irony, humor.

These were taken about every 48-58 seconds, still photos. Then they were transmitted back and over 187 million miles. That took 16-17 minutes per picture.So not live like we would know it. And it was taken from an orbiter going around the planet. It wasn't something on the surface. So in some ways, underwhelming but, in other ways, really interesting, because this was to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Mars Express Orbiter, which has been up there, going around the planet, helping us understand what surface conditions are like, what the geology is like. It's helped do research into the ideas of water and ice on Mars and the general geology of Mars. And when you put that together with all the other exploration of Mars that has been done by other probes and satellites, some from NASA, things that have landed on the surface and looked around, it's deepening our knowledge, deepening our knowledge of this planet, the next one out from the sun beyond us, beyond that big asteroid belt and then Jupiter. So it's deepening our knowledge of this planet and paving a way for what we need to know if we actually want to send people on that roughly nine-month voyage, depending on the position of the planets, and have them walk on this very surface that we've only been able to see in pictures and, now, at least in a way, live pictures.
