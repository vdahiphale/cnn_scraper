The first quote that we have is, the prosecution laying out its theory of the case, which is, \"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a coverup. The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election. Then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.\"So here, they are reframing this. Because usually people refer to this as the hush money case. Where, yes, hush money was paid to Stormy Daniels for her to stay quiet about an affair that she had with then- candidate Trump. But having an affair is not a crime. Paying hush money is not a crime. The criminal allegation here is that the former president falsified business records in order to coverup that he had to pay this money.",

He's the prosecutor that Paula just noted that is making these opening statements and starting them. They are going to lay out all -- the entire timeline of this.And what he just started with is something that's really key, which is a meeting that happened in August 2015 that we didn't know about in real time, but we later learned once Trump was in the White House. That it was Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, and David Pecker, they were all there in that meeting. And that's when David Pecker was essentially asking how he could be helpful to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. And of course, now we know the saga that it has become these three stories that are at the center of this hush money case and at the heart of what they are alleging about these payments, but that is what they are going back to. And at that meeting, we didn't initially know that Donald Trump was the third person in that room. And obviously that's incredibly consequential because if David Pecker is in fact the first testimony that the prosecution calls after these opening statements, he can talk about Donald Trump's knowledge of this agreement and whether or not he signed off on it and what he said directly.",

And the prosecutor, as part of this opening statement, they're reframing this. Again, not just as a paperwork crime, right? An effort to coverup this hush money payment by falsifying business records, but an effort to interfere in the 2016 election. And that's key because that is why this is being charged as a felony.Even though he's not charged with federal election interference, that's what they're arguing here. That these business records were falsified in an effort to interfere with the 2016 election. The prosecutor said, \"They formed a conspiracy at that meeting to influence the presidential election by concealing negative information about Mr. Trump in order to help him get elected.\" And that is really -- that is the crux of their argument. That this was all done to help Trump in the 2016 election. In fact, they reprimand me sometimes when I call it the hush money case on air.

That Trump, \"Was paying Michael Cohen back for an illegal payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the election.\" That, \"Cohen made that payment at the defendant, Donald Trump's, direction and he did it to influence the presidential election.\" This is the prosecution's allegation. And he did it -- Donald Trump did it, according to the assistant district attorney, \"Because he wanted to conceal his and others criminal conduct.\" In total the defendant falsified 34 business records to coverup that criminal conspiracy. After the election, Trump reimbursed Cohen for that payment and they, \"Disguised with the payments were for.\" \"They disguised what the payments are for. The defendant said in business records that he was paying Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement, but those were lies.\" This is again what the assistant district attorney is alleging about Mr. Trump.
