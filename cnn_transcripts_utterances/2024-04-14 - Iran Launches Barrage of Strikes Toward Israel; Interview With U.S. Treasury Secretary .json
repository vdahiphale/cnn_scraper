I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you live from New York.We'll start today's program with Iran striking back against Israel with a barrage of drones and missiles. What is next in this highly dangerous tit-for-tat. I talked to Vali Nasr and David Sanger. Plus Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her trip to China, and Ambassador Rahm Emanuel on the Japanese prime minister's state visit to Washington, D.C. I'll give you my take in a moment, but first the breaking news. The world has wondered for two weeks how Iran would respond to the attack that destroyed its consulate in Damascus and killed a handful of top military officials. Now we know. Last night's retaliation was a show of force with several hundred missiles and drones sent to attack Israel. It was also the first time that Iran has attacked Israel directly from Iranian soil. But 99 percent of the drones and missiles were intercepted before they reach Israeli territory. Indeed, Israel says there was little damage and only one known casualty. The big question is how is Prime Minister Netanyahu thinking about this. Joining me now from Tel Aviv is CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward. Clarissa, welcome. What are you hearing about what Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu are thinking about what the situation is now and what do they do?",

Once that wraps up, we have also heard a statement from the centrist war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, who describes putting together a regional coalition and acting to exact a price from Iran at the time of Israel's choosing.Now we also know of course that President Biden has told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the U.S. will not be involved in any kind of a retaliation. He has urged Israel not to escalate the situation further saying take the win. And for many here, Fareed, this is being seen as a gift or a lifeline to Prime Minister Netanyahu because it deflects away from the situation in Gaza. Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage and it also deflects from these protests that we have seen every single week. They have been gathering pace demands for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down. On the other hand, you have these sort of hardliners in his coalition. They are pushing very hard for a big response. They say its desperately important to re-establish deterrence, but important for our viewers to remember that they are not part of that war cabinet. And ultimately, it will be the three members of that war cabinet, the three observers who determine what the response will be. And we will likely learn more about that in the coming hours -- Fareed.",

Iran could not just roll over and be seen within -- by its on population and in the region to essentially taking such a provocative escalation from Israel without responding. On the other hand, they did not want to throw Prime Minister Netanyahu a lifeline of basic shifting the attention from Gaza to Iran and Syria, and even drawing the United States into a war with Iran.So they had to react, but they had to react in a way where the emphasis was not really on retaliation, but on deterrence. And I think the deterrence was achieved not just by the military act they carried out yesterday but essentially by the very effective psychological campaign that they managed through this escalation, both in Israel and also in Western capitals.",

And the question is, can he calibrate that to be modest enough that we don't get into a cycle.As you suggested, on the one hand, the Iranians went into territory here they've never gone into before. By doing a direct attack they have basically gone a last step and no one will ever be able to stuff that back in the bottle. If the Israeli's debate in the future whether they could attack Iran directly, they would probably cite this as the precedent. On the other hand, it is the greatest ad for missile defense that we've ever seen in battle. I mean, here they were able to discriminate among 200 to 300 drones, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and have 99 percent success rate, at least from the early reports. That's remarkable and 10 years ago would not have been the case, and so the question is, could the Israelis basically argue they have established deterrence? They've established the deterrence that comes from making it clear to an adversary that they could not successfully attack even with an overwhelming number of missiles.",

And yet he has had deep reservations about Bibi Netanyahu's war strategy, urging him to be more restrained, more targeted, to be careful not to escalate. My understanding of this, some reporting on this, that they counsel the Israelis against the kinds of escalation that involve the attack on Iran's facilities -- consular facilities in Damascus. Where does that relationship stand? And will Biden you think be able to have any influence on Israeli policy, which so far he seems to have had limited influence?",

I mean, I would say that Biden has been extraordinarily frustrated in his dealings with Bibi Netanyahu, in part because every time that he has gone to counsel some form of advice that Israel was not acting as long-term interests that it needed to allow in more aid, that it needed to put off a certain military strikes, that it needed to stop using 2,000-pound bombs in crowded and urban areas.He was basically ignored. And just before this incident unfolded, of course, you saw Biden hit a breaking point. One in which he said, if you don't follow our advice, including on not attacking in Rafah, this could require a broad rethinking of the relationship. So the breach was pretty open. The question now is, does it remain that way or can he use this as a turning point since it was the U.S. that was there helping intercept missiles last night. One of the big questions is, who else can we bring into this? He's meeting the G7 today, but missing in that, Fareed, are the two countries that have the most influence with Iran -- Russia and China. And, you know, I argue in \"New Cold Wars,\" but we've also discussed other moments that the defining moment, the defining issue in this particular moment is that at this point, the allies who sat or the countries that sat with the U.S. to try to restrain Iran and its nuclear program seven, eight, nine years ago have now flipped over to the other side, and Iran and Russia are part of the so-called axis of resistance.",

But as David points out in his excellent book, you know, this brewing cold war between U.S., China, and Russia now becomes much more complicated when you actually need their help in something with Iran. They may have their own interests why they don't want a war with the Middle East.But they're not just going to be letter carriers for Washington without sort of being engaged on also issues that matters to them. And also the difference between with Gaza and what's happening with Iran is that their -- the USA influence with Israel was about how Israel handle the war and what it meant for global public opinion or domestic public opinion. But the escalation with Iran could potentially actually get the United States into a war and that really does feature on China and Russia's own calculations when they themselves are at odds with the United States. So the U.S. has to have a much more comprehensive view of these sets of global relations and think in terms of the Middle East as part of that global rivalry with Russia and China.",

And I'm glad you raised it because Kissinger's idea by doing the opening to China and Nixon's of course was to create that division and it worked for 60 or more years. What's happened now is that we missed to some degree Russia's move toward authoritarianism. And we failed to understand that it would be taking over territory.We made a parallel mistake with China and then we were pretty slow to recognize the degree to which they were coming together. Putin and Xi have met more than 40 times. President Biden has met Putin one time in his time in office, and that will probably be the last one. So we're at a moment right now where the strategy we need to look at is, how do you contain the worst aspects of their behavior but also so prevent them from working together? And that's the new mission in Washington. And so far I would have to say we are not very far down that road in developing that strategy.",

And we want to engage in trade that's mutually beneficial. There needs to be a level playing field and China has agreed with us on that. And we're concerned about areas with the playing field clearly is not level. China is directing massive subsidies through their industrial policy on an ongoing basis. And when the demand isn't there, the Chinese firms do not go bankrupt as American firms do. They stay in the market and that can succeed in depressing prices to the point where very competitive American firms can be driven out of business.

They're the most trusted country in the region among the population. They've doubled their defense budget to become the third largest spender. They're acquiring very important 400 Tomahawk counterstrike capability. They're going to invest in a new joint operations center. And then the week -- just think of it this week, we started with a naval exercise in the Philippines, South China Sea, with the United States, Australia, Japan, the Philippines. We had a major diplomatic first ever trilateral meeting between the United States and the Philippines led by President Biden. And we're closing out the week with a historic military exercise between the United States, Japan, and South Korea. That tells you what this lattice architecture looks like.
