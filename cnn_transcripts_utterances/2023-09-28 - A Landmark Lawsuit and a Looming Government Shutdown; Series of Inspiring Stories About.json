      "sentences": "The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are working around the clock to come to an agreement on howto fund the government before it runs out of money just days from now. And there`s still a lot of disagreement on how to get that done. If they can`t reach a deal before the deadline, the government will shut down. And that means that all the money the government spends every single day on programs affecting all Americans get shut off. Nearly 4 million federal workers will immediately stop getting a paycheck. And that puts an enormous burden on many federal workers, especially those who live paycheck to paycheck. Now, the White House has told each department and agency it`s time to come up with its own set of plans and procedures detailing who`s essential and who isn`t. Here are some examples. U.S. service, men and women are essential workers. So they`ll keep working without pay. Still the White House` warning that a shutdown could put national security at risk. As many of the civilian workers that support them will be furloughed. And while TSA agents and air traffic controllers are all essential workers, many of them can`t afford to work without pay. And the last time there was a shutdown in 2019, there were major delays at airports across the country because many had to call out sick to find other ways to make money. During a shutdown, according to the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency would roll back most of its inspection activity at hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities, that could impact clean drinking water. And the government shutdown could also affect some of the country`s most beloved treasures like museums and national parks. All Smithsonian museums and the national zoo would be closed, according to 2021 guidance. Those shutdown would not affect zoo animal care. It`s still unclear whether national parks would close, but in past shutdowns, the surrounding facilities have closed with trash piling up and toilets overflowing. There are lots of other impacts to services we all depend on. And the key question now is whether Congress can come together and reach a deal before the clock strikes midnight on Sunday, (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is an important day, especially for the rebels. But I am afraid of failure because I grew up, with very little, that battle to survive, taught me to work really hard.
