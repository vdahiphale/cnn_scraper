The three are Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona, Michael Cloud of Texas, and Andrew Clyde of Georgia.Speaker McHenry, what is your thought on this? Surely this is not a coincidence. FMR. REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC):  This is an organized event, and Biggs was visible on the House floor. He's present in the chamber somewhere or stepped out. This is a purposeful act. What we're going to find out now is, to what end? Is it, number one, policy, number two, process, number three, embarrassment? You can't rate out embarrassment in an environment like this of frustrated Republican members about Johnson's speakership. We just came off from two weeks ago a substantial government funding package that had all the contours of an omnibus spending package that is reflexively bad for House Republicans. And perhaps this could be just the goal of embarrassing the speaker to say that he had to come to them and ask for their help to get across the line.",

What is your suspicion, Congressman Dent, about why these three have voted -- have not voted at all?

There would be holdouts here and there, usually more conservative members who didn't want TV ads saying that his first vote was voting for Speaker Pelosi.

I hate to sort of belabor this point, but Donald Trump's got some skin in the game in this one, unlike the last vote. He didn't come in to back McCarthy until three or four votes in after he had lost. So Trump's got some skin in the game here. And so this is not just a slight to the speaker.

We're electing a speaker. Today, tomorrow and IN the weeks ahead, it's going to be passing bills and trying to do what Donald Trump ran on. And if you're going through this internal fighting and weeping and gnashing of teeth every single time, it's going to be a huge drag on the morale of the Republican Party because they wanted Trump to act.
