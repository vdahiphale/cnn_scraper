      "sentences": "Welcome back. We're following the breaking news. New intensity in the war between Israel and Hamas. We are seeing an increase in explosions over Gaza, more than we have seen in recent days. The IDF just said that their ground operation is, in their words, expanding. You're looking at live images right now. We're also learning from US officials that hostage talks are ongoing. I wanna go to CNN's Nic Robertson, who is very close to the Gaza border in Sderot, Israel. Nic, what are we seeing right now? It looks like we've been watching interceptors during the commercial break. What are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, John's just pointing the camera up at the sky where we were seeing interceptions of rockets that were firing towards central Israel, I believe. Those intercepts are over. Seconds before that, there was a barrage, a salvo of rockets from Gaza fired on this location here. The sirens went off. We ducked for cover. We could see the Iron Dome firing up over our head and intercepting the missiles coming here. And right after that, to the south of where we are, again, we can see Iron Dome intercepting missiles coming out of Gaza a little bit to our south.So, I think the picture that emerges from here in the last 10 minutes are missiles fired into central Israel, missiles fired out here right at the northern end of Gaza, and then missiles fired a little further south of where we are. So at least 3 salvos in three different directions from the same area of Gaza. I think if there's, you know -- if this is a response to that very heavy barrage of fire that we saw before outgoing from here, then I think the message coming back from Hamas would appear to be that despite that very heavy barrage onto them, they're able to come out of their bunkers and out of their tunnels and continue to-- continue to fire back. This evening has really been very much a case of up and down, of a lot of outgoing fire, then pauses, then incoming rounds, then the intercepts, and now perhaps a slight lull. And Anderson, I just say, I won't be able to hear you at the moment. I'm just trying to reconnect to you now.",

There's both Nik's camera on the left, and that's an AFP camera looking at images over Gaza as well. Colonel Cedric Layden is also joining us as we continue to stay on these images. Colonel Layden, the fact that Hamas and other groups, --  Kim Dozier, global affairs analyst, -- the fact that Hamas is still, after almost 3 weeks now of incredibly heavy bombardment by Israel, is still able to fire rockets. There were a number of sirens here in Tel Aviv throughout the day, more so than we've heard in many days, and respond even now at this late hour. What does that tell you?",

      "sentences": "Anderson, that was a strange, strange set of events. I mean, we were talking about the intercepted missiles and the Iron Dome fired up from here, from further south, from just to the north of us as well. And as I was standing here, I was listening to a tinkling sound like somebody was sweeping the street. This street is deserted. No one lives here. And the tinkling was getting louder and it was coming up the street. And we suddenly realized that this is in all likelihood shrapnel that is raining down a minute after those intercepts in the sky above. The only thing that makes logical sense was that this was shrapnel raining down in the streets here. So, of course we took cover, put the helmets on and took cover. It's stopped now.But again, we've talked this evening quite a lot about things that we haven't seen over previous evenings that make the events tonight different. The expanding operational activities going into Gaza, the more forceful push that the IDF is speaking about and these intercepts, the shrapnel coming down off the intercepts are just indicative, I think, of the, the dangers of this situation, frankly, for anyone left living in this town. And we heard the IDF be very specific in their most recent briefing to the citizens of Israel saying, look, you need to know where your shelter is. You need to know that you can hear the warnings about incoming missiles and intercepts. There are audible warnings. There are apps that you can use and you can also hear the intercepts of the missiles as well. So, I think that just reinforces what the IDF  have been warning the citizens here to be careful about, to stay close to their shelters. And it's indicative of the fact that the tempo of operations here is perhaps picking up. We've seen as well a couple of flares fired in the sky towards Gaza. We've seen those over recent nights, but again, you would expect flares to be fired close to or around troops in the field who want to get better visibility on what's the ground in front of them. It's illumination for troops in the field to see where the danger is, where the enemy may be hiding, Anderson.",

I was having trouble hearing your audio there but if you are we have seen in past operations the idea of sort of making faints to see what Hamas does in terms of movement of troops and responsing -- and a response, you're saying it's possible that is also what's going on here.

It could be it could be infrastructure like a water treatment plant. It could be power plants. It could be communications facilities. And then the question is from there how do you work around it.

We heard that in our last hour from Daniel Hagari the Rear Admiral from the IDF. Nic Robertson is in Sderot for us. We also have general Wesley Clark general Clark. I lost communications with you before. Just in terms of options the IDF has, there are a lot of ways they could proceed from here. If people are expecting some massive assault on Gaza across the entire length of the border from multi -- and from the sea and from the air. That may not be what Israel has planned. This could be a much slower more methodical movement.",

They've come in in different areas. This is the third night they've done this. This could be a series of probes to see how the Palestinians -- how the Hamas reacts. It could be an effort to sort of check their weapon systems. It could be an effort to draw communications up, so they get better intelligence or all of that. Or they could decide at this point If there's not that much resistance if they're headed toward a strategic objective inside Gaza like the power plant or the decel (ph) point. Then they may continue and pour more forces in on that corridor.But Anderson what we know about urban combat is it's easier to get in Initially than it is to stay in and hold your force and move to a larger holding. So the idea that they're gonna line up their forces around the periphery and sort of charge in there, absolutely not. They're gonna pick their strategic points. They're gonna go after those points and then they're gonna expand their control outward and downward from that.",

First of all, he characterized this as a fight for the existence of Israel. But he said that there were 2 main goals, the elimination of Hamas both militarily and politically and also doing everything possible to bring back the hostages, to rescue hostages. Are those 2 goals necessarily the same? The tactics to achieve both those goals, are they in some ways contradictory? CLARKBut it's in Hamas' interest to keep those hostages safe and alive. They're using the hostages in a public relations game against Israel and against the United States. And so, they don't want the hostages to be hurt. Now you can't count on that and if you're the parents of someone who's held hostage, your heart's going to be in your throat all the time. But for Israel, this is an existential threat. They have to go in, they have to go in on the ground, they have to eliminate Hamas. And in the process, hopefully they'll get the information they need, then to conduct the special operations raids or the other things that are necessary to get to those hostages.",
