That is the latest in our voters OUTFRONT series. And George Santos's second act, making new cameos tonight. The price, guess what, has gone up. That's the old supply/demand, and people are paying up. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, surrounded. Israel says its forces have now encircled Gaza's second largest city. There's now fierce fighting inside Khan Younis. That is where the civilian population actually has ballooned over the past two months, as people have been told to go from northern Gaza south towards Khan Younis and so many cases, and now reports of house-to-house battles there. According to an Israeli commander, quote, we are in the midst of most intense day-to-day since the beginning of the ground operations in terms of terrorists killed, the number of firefights and the use of firepower from the land and air. And this ground operation now posing a serious threat to displaced Palestinian civilians, as I said, so many had come from further north here. Many of them now lining the narrow streets after being forced from their homes. And just north of Khan Younis, new video appears to show artillery fire near two Red Crescent ambulances. Again, appears, but you can see this playing out on your screen right now. And earlier, I spoke to a spokesman for the Red Cross, Hisham Mhanna, who is in Gaza, spoken to him many times over these past couple of months. I asked him today what he's actually experiencing in these past hours that the IDF says are the most intense. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I asked Mhanna if it's working and he had seen the leaflets, and he said, yes, he absolutely has seen them, and the reality he says is that they are not working because there's no 3G or 4G cell service as he has seen. There's barely 2G, in many cases, which means it's impossible to actually scan the QR code in those cases. And he said that even if people can open the link to the IDF evacuation map, the map doesn't show a person, where they are on the map, how to get anywhere near the evacuation map -- area, just literally shows this. Of course, this puts more lives at risk. And last night, I asked a spokesman for the IDF about a report that two civilians have been killed for every Hamas militant. The IDF later tried to clarify saying that it's likely less than two civilians for every Hamas militant. They didn't elaborate on the details here, though, but I asked about this report and what level of civilian suffering he is seeing right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said that tonight, the ground shook in Khan Younis and Jabalia. Khan Younis, of course, the biggest city in the south. Jabalia is a refugee camp in the northern part of the strip that Israel says has been a holdout for Hamas. Meanwhile, Erin, we are hearing some pointed criticism from the Biden administration, from the State Department. A spokesperson for the State Department saying that they do not believe that Israel is doing enough to help get aid into Gaza, aid like fuel, food and water that's so desperately needed especially as so many people are fleeing even farther south. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Israeli strikes tonight in southern Gaza as Israel expands its campaign. New satellite images show dozens of Israel's armored vehicles near the main road heading to southern Gaza's biggest city, Khan Younis. Israel's top general said Tuesday that the military's operating, quote, in the heart of Khan Younis where Israeli officials have said Hamas's top leadership has dug in. According to a journalist who filmed this video, IDF troops moving south fired on civilians and journalists. Airstrikes have been seen near the city. Chaos as the wounded are rushed to the hospital, and the dead are counted. Amid the renewed fighting, hospitals continue to overflow. We are facing a huge problem this doctor in Khan Younis says. God forbid if we get more patients, there's no space for them at all. Many in Khan Younis have gone there from northern Gaza after Israel told more than 1 million people to evacuate. Now they're being told to move again, to so-called safe zones, though humanitarian officials and civilians say that nowhere is safe.",

LT. COL.

(END VIDEOTAPE) MARQUARDT (on camera): And, Erin, a major question is how much longer can these Israeli military operations last at the scale and level that we're seeing now around Khan Younis. Officials, both American and Israeli, tell my colleagues and me that they do expect that high intensity operations will continue for several more weeks before there's a transition to what they call low intensity operations. Those more low intensity, more tactical operations could happen on a very localized scale, for example, going after specific Hamas commanders. Now, what that means for the time frame is we could see high intensity operations lasting through the end of the calendar year before that transition happens in January, but that sort of more and low intensity phase, Erin, could last for quite some time. There has been private pressure from the United States on Israel to scale back their military operations, the U.S. is also telling that they cannot replicate in the south what they did in the north, and just frankly, telling Israel that they are quickly losing international support. Now, in terms of what Israel's response was to this message, a senior administration official tells my colleague, MJ Lee, they wouldn't call it receptive -- Erin.",

So I think what is left for the Biden administration to do, if that's the case, is to basically try and influence what Israel is doing on the ground and actually, they managed to do some things quite successfully.",

If there's one thing Israel wants to achieve during this operation in Khan Younis is to capture Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif, dead or alive.

There's a lot of desire from the U.S. for that to happen. Have you been briefed at all about the timeline? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Not specifically. I mean, let's be clear. We want Israel to succeed in eradicating Hamas. Neither Palestinians nor Israelis can be safe and secure if Hamas still exists, but our concern is that Israel's tactics right now risks not just failing to eradicate Hamas, but actually strengthening its base of support, and this is a fundamental principle of counterinsurgency that you can not create more terrorists than you kill.

And the same general, U.S. general, Stanley McChrystal, actually commissioned a study on this. He determined for every one civilian you kill, it serves to recruit about ten terrorists. I mean, by that number, Israel so far has killed about 5,000 Hamas terrorists, but in the process, they've recruited about 100,000 new adherents. And this is really bad news for Israel. It's bad news just in terms of their potential for military success here, which we do want them to achieve. You know, we're talking about 10,000 negligent civilians so far are killed right now, and that just -- I mean, that's a bad situation in a place that actually when the war began, there was a poll just before October 7th that showed that 6 out of 10 residents of the Gaza Strip did not support Hamas. So Israel was actually going into a favorable situation where most of the Palestinians were against Hamas as well.

Trump, we are told, said I doubt that. And he said, they don't want me to be running. But, Erin, the interesting thing is Trump still in Iowa, he really is trying to hold on to his lead there, but there are many voters who have many open minds and our days of conversations there, but they are turning their attention here to Alabama, because that is where the Republican presidential debate is tomorrow night.
