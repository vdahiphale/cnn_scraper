We begin this hour with new developments in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A source telling CNN that after the election, former President Trump called then Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in an attempt to pressure him into overturning his state's presidential election results.Sources say Trump also push then Vice President Mike Pence to help him overturn his 2020 election law. CNN's Jeremy Herb joins us now. Jeremy, what are you learning about the pressure that Trump was putting on Ducey after the election?",

Now at the time, November 2020, we didn't know this call occurred, but we didn't have any details about the specifics. Now sources are telling CNN that Ducey has said that he was pressured by Trump to try to find fraud in his state that would allow the President to overturn the election.This may sound familiar. We've heard the President was trying to besort the of same efforts in multiple states. It's also -- we also learning from sources that the President asked his then Vice President Mike Pence to reach out to Ducey to also try and get him to work on pressuring the Vice President -- pressuring the then Governor. Pence did call Ducey. However, what we are told is that he did not pressure the Governor as he was asked according to sources. This all of course, comes as a special counsel is ramping up his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which is separate from the indictment that came in the investigation into the handling of classified documents. Worth noting here that Ducey spokesman. He downplayed the significance of this call telling CNN in a statement. Frankly, nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election, he certified the election, and he made clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by the evidence brought forward. The Governor stands by his actions to certify the election and considers the issue to be in the rearview mirror. It's time to move on. Now, Sara, it's also worth noting that D.C. spokesman told CNN that the for -- the former Arizona governor, he has not heard from the special counsel's office, Sara.",

The special counsel this week, his investigators interviewed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Now, of course, Raffensperger is at the center of one of the most famous incidents where Trump was trying to pressure state officials. He asked Raffensperger in January 2021 to find him enough votes to win the state in Georgia.That, of course, led to Fulton County in that state opening its own investigation. There are some key differences in those two episodes. First of all, we don't know according to the -- our reporting and our sources whether President specifically asked Governor Ducey to find votes as opposed to finding the fraud. Also, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on this new pressure, there is not a recording of this Ducey conversation unlike the Raffensperger conversation. So, it's possible that that plays into the difference between these two states, Sara.",

This is something that White House officials had been preparing behind the scenes in the event that the Supreme Court struck their original plan.And it includes a couple of things starting with, for example, reducing levels for income driven repayment plan from 10 percent to five percent. It also has the Department of Education -- Department of Education creating a temporary 12-month on ramp -- repayment program when debt payments restart. So, these are a couple of things that are in the works. And they're going to take months to get done. Of course, there were millions who were hoping that their student debt would be forgiven up to $20,000 in the immediate term, but the administration is trying to give reassurances and the President himself saying that they have been working on different options to try to provide some relief to students. Now he was still asked yesterday in his remarks whether he had given false hope to millions and this is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was something quite notable that has come out after the Supreme Court decision in that Colorado web designer case.The designer won her case, of course, refusing to make wedding Web sites for same sex couples. She identified a man in that case, I think his name was Stewart who requested such a web site she said but reporters have talked to him. And he says he never contacted her and has been married to a woman for 15 years. Could this -- does this have any impact on what the Supreme Court did? I mean, what is going on here? DE VOGUE: So, legally maybe it's not super significant. She basically said that she was being contacted by people who were saying, oh, will you please make a website for me? And one of the people she said did was this man, Stewart. She put that forward in court papers. And then enterprising reporters reached out to Stewart and he said, well, I have no idea what you're talking about. I never did that. In fact, I've been happily married for several years. Legally, that may not be a big deal because there were other people she says in the record, who were asking her to begin this business. But it is interesting, this case that has been in the spotlight for a long time and no one ever thought to reach out to Stewart until the week of oral arguments. So, it was an interesting twist.",

So, if you've got some travel on two major interstates here 65, 40 or if you have plans to go in or out of the airport there or may be connect there, likely going to see some delays here coming up in about the next hour or so.But that's just one of several clusters. We've still been keeping an eye on the one making its way through the Ohio Valley. Another section of showers and thunderstorms just to the west of Dallas and more expected to develop as we head into the afternoon and the evening hours. Basically, anywhere you see here along this map with these cities has the potential for damaging. Winds, large hail and even the potential for some isolated tornadoes. We also have that secondary area located just in portions of western Texas. Now, two separate timelines here. We've already got the ongoing cluster of storms. But once we get later into the afternoon and especially into the evening, another round moves through many of the same areas that have already had some showers and thunderstorms today. By tomorrow, that main cluster shifts farther east into the mid- Atlantic portions of the Northeast. But we also have separate showers and thunderstorms that will fire up across the southeast. Unfortunately triggering probably some more delays on the roads and in the air. Heat is also going to be another concern. A lot of folks, you get outside, you have barbecues, parades, all kinds of things going on this weekend. And the heat could end up causing some problems. We've still got excessive heat warnings and heat advisories across the southeast. More developing out into the West as that next heatwave begins to take shape. Now down across the Gulf when you factor in the heat and the humidity, you've got that heat index very, very high in some spots. It feels like 107 right now in Little Rock, same thing for Birmingham, 105 and Memphis. Really at this point, you're going to finally get some relief, but it's going to take several more days before we really start to see those numbers coming back down closer to where they should be this time of year. Out to the West, it's the opposite. Those numbers are going to continue to go up. Places like Salt Lake, Las Vegas, Palm Springs. Those numbers will continue to tick up especially into the middle portion of the upcoming week. Several areas also. We get it. It's summer. But these are well above average.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All of this land in leafy, lovely west L.A. must, said the United States Congress in 2016, be used to principally benefit veterans. But among other things, the swimming pool and pristine playing fields of the exclusive private Brentwood School remain. The V.A.'s own inspector general has repeatedly found the school's lease in violation of that landmark law. The V.A. and the school publicly dispute that. And now there's a new bill before the House that would essentially legalize that lease and curtail the inspector general's authority.",

Republicans balked at the cost. REP. MIKE BOST (R-IL): We currently are working on a package to address the issue. We will work with you. But we've got to actually sit down and work together to figure out the problem of the expense.",

(voice-over): This was sponsored by a freshman representative, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, of Oregon. She declined an interview. Her spokesperson told CNN she sponsored the bill \"because homelessness is at a crisis level in Oregon and her constituents consistently raise this problem as one of the top issues they would like her to address.\" The next day, she introduced another bill that includes a half- billion-dollar V.A. construction project around her district. Her spokesman says she sponsored that bill \"because it will help the Portland V.A. Medical Center expand and make necessary improvements.\" But back to her bill that would, in part, benefit Brentwood School. the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion do not support those provisions, but the V.A. supports them.",
