      "sentences": "New this morning, the CDC says the bird flu is showing mutations in the hospitalized patient in Louisiana. What this could mean for potential human to human spread as authorities try to clamp down on the outbreak.Plus, a Los Angeles county sheriff's deputy agrees to plead guilty and several others are reportedly fired after the beating of a trans man and the cover up so disturbing. And a Judge slams Jay-Z's attempt to dismiss the case, alleging he raped a 13-year-old back in 2000. Details on the judge's decision ahead. Hello, everyone. Happy holidays. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington, and you're in the CNN Newsroom. And we begin this hour with two developing stories and new suspicions involving Russia. First, quote, we are investigating grave sabotage. That's according to authorities in Finland who have boarded and seized an oil tanker traveling from Russia. The ship is suspected of dragging its anchor and causing the Christmas Day outage of an undersea power cable and three Internet lines connecting Finland and Estonia. And there are also growing suspicions of Russian involvement in the Christmas Day crash of a passenger plane in Central Asia. Today, state media and Azerbaijan, where the flight originated, is reporting that the preliminary investigation finds, quote, physical and technical interference caused the disaster. We have a lot to cover this busy Friday morning. Joining us now is CNN contributor Jill Daugherty, a former CNN Moscow bureau chief, Major Glenn Ignazio, retired Air Force special operations commander and a national security expert. And CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger, he is also the White House national security correspondent for the New York Times and the author of \"New Cold Wars: China's Rise, Russia's Invasion and America's Struggle to Defend the West.\" Thank you all so much for coming on. So, Major Ignazio, I want to start with you what do you make of that cryptic description leading up to that plane crash, physical and technical interference? MAJ. GLENN IGNAZIO (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPS COMMANDER: Yes, very interesting. As far as the first indications, or at least reports, were bird strike and so forth. And aircraft are designed to be able to take that without damage. But when you look at the actual physical evidence of the photographs, the holes are very precise and they're not indicative of something happening in flight from an engine or an air structure problem. So this is definitely something that is taken from outside. It does look more about AAA aircraft or a possible missile shrapnel. And the damage to the hydraulics and so forth would indicate why they had problems flying the aircraft. In addition to this, they also encountered jamming, for GPS jamming. And this was because Ukraine was actually launching some drones south of the Grozny area, about 100 miles away. So it really looks like this was an interference with AAA missiles and definitely damage outside of the aircraft, not from the aircraft.",

David, I mean, you know, as -- as Jill just said, Russia never accepted blame for that. Would you expect anything different if these findings point to Russia?DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITCAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Pam, I wouldn't. But it's worth remembering what happened after the 2014 shoot down. There was an international commission that was put together somewhat similar to what was assembled yesterday for this disaster. It took them about a year and a half, nearly two years, to come up with a conclusion. As Jill just said, the Russians never acknowledged what the commission concluded, which was that it was shot down with that Russian made Buk. Nobody suggested it was deliberate, but certainly seemed to be happening in a -- in a war zone as this was. And did the Russians face a penalty? They got some fairly mild sanctions. And the same year the German government under Chancellor Angela Merkel signed the Nord Stream 2 agreement with Russia to build a new gas pipeline to Europe, one that was proceeding until the war started three years ago, the invasion of -- of Ukraine. So I think it would be very easy for the Russians to conclude that the west isn't terribly serious about sanctions and doesn't have a lot left to sanction.",

But the fact of the matter is that the Russians came out of that concluding that if you just wait a few years, the United States will, you know, and the -- and its Western allies will lose interest and move on. And with the new administration coming in, whose interest in continuing to fund the Ukrainians is somewhat doubtful at this point, they probably have every reason to think that their best strategy at this point is deny everything and wait for it to blow over.Now, the cables are a more complicated thing because that would be a deliberate act.

And so it's really critical that the communications between the countries, both for cost commerce and also in military communications, will continue. To give you an idea how significant it is, now we may use satellites in the military and so forth. And even the fastest -- fastest satellite communication for internet, the cable is a thousand times faster and can carry more data.So those undersea cables are really critical for all use, commercial, military and so forth. So what Russia can do by doing this is really deteriorate some of the operations and concerns of anything that could go on with a NATO country talking to another NATO country. In addition, this also hit some of the power lines that were underneath. So you're talking about impacting infrastructure, which would be one of the things that Russia would do to cause any kind of problems or intimidation. And as we saw only 30 days ago, a Russian, excuse me, a Chinese ship was accused of dragging and hitting two other internet cable lines. So this is very interesting to see this within 30 days. And these are significant impacts to the entire region as a whole.",

Maybe he said, even more complicated than the Middle East. That's been pretty, I think, obvious to anybody who's been sort of deeply engaged in watching this for some time.A few things, Pam. First, we don't know whether Vladimir Putin's really interested in negotiation. He said yesterday he was, but as the White House just said, and -- and John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council said, he's acting like somebody who is deeply interested in the negotiation. Maybe he's just waiting for Inauguration Day. Second, is the question of if there is a -- a negotiation, are the Ukrainians front and center to it, or is this something that gets worked out between President Putin and President Trump and then President Trump goes to the Ukrainians and says, you'll take this deal if you want continued help. And the third question is what kind of security guarantee would Ukraine get? It's not a NATO member. Would other European countries, as they've suggested, come in and put troops in, peacekeepers along the line? Would the United States continue to supply arms and intelligence? We just don't know.

But of course the risk is low until it isn't low.I was just talking with Mike Osterholm from the University of Minnesota about a lot of these same things, and he was agreeing with Dr. Birx that, you know, the U.S.'s head has been in the sand bit, especially when you think about whether we are taking lessons from the pandemic we all just went through and applying them to this new potential threat. And he argued we have not done enough to take a look back at the lessons learned from that pandemic, just as you were talking about with Dr. Birx and applying those to what we might do to mitigate this threat and others going forward. So he said that's a real failing on the U.S.'s part for not having done that yet because there are a lot of things we could do in terms of looking at vaccines and as Dr. Birx was laying out, looking at what we should be doing with schools. So there are many things that not just Dr. Osterholm and Dr. Birx, but many other scientists and folks working in public health think we should be doing on this now.",

And so we're not seeing person to person spread that we know about. The good news, though, is that it doesn't appear person passed this version of the virus on to any other people. And it doesn't look like they got it from the birds from whom they're suspected to have gotten the virus in the first place. So it doesn't seem like this is circulating in the environment.
