      "sentences": "Good evening.This was already likely a sad and difficult day for survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Seventeen young people murdered five years ago today in Parkland, Florida. Today, Parkland is back in the news, but not as an example of how far we've come in making such massacres a thing of the past. Instead, it is a reminder that the sister and brotherhood of mass shooting victims, survivors, and bereaved is always growing. Today, the families and loved ones of three Michigan State University students joined that number after a gunman opened fire there last night shooting eight students, killing three of them. It was neither the first nor the 61st such killing this year. According to the Gun Violence Archive, it was the 67th. Sixty-seven shootings with four or more people shot or killed. In fact, number 68 happened today with four wounded outside a high school in Pittsburgh. Before we talk about the larger story though, here is what we know about those who were killed in Michigan. Alexandria Verner was in her junior year and came from the small town of Clawson, Michigan. Her high school principal told us she was an excellent student in addition to playing three sports and taking part in school leadership groups. He says her kindness was on display every second you were around her. She was, he says, everything you'd want your daughter or friend to be. Brian Fraser was a sophomore from the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe. He was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. His sister tells \"The Detroit Free Press\" that their family isn't ready to speak, but said she doesn't want her brother's name forgotten, and called Brian a light in their lives. Arielle Anderson was a junior also from the Detroit area in the same school system as Brian Fraser. Her family tells the local station WXYZ that she loved children, wanting to be a pediatrician. Her grandmother tells \"The Free Press\" that Arielle was kind and loving, caring, compassionate and driven. More now on the shootings from CNN's Adrienne Broaddus. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It is really -- at this point we don't have quite enough facts to sort through this thing perfectly, but what I can tell you is on the Federal level, his firearms conviction for a misdemeanor would not have prohibited him from purchasing a firearm. The disqualifier in the Brady Act is having been convicted of a felony, and he was initially arrested for a felony, but later pled that down to a misdemeanor, so that wouldn't have stopped him.The question is whether or not he violated any Michigan State laws. There is a requirement for anyone purchasing a pistol in Michigan to have a pistol purchase or a purchase license that's issued by your local Sheriff or some other official, and it is not perfectly clear to me whether or not that misdemeanor conviction would have disqualified him on that grounds.",

Now, their argument, the former President might have used him in furtherance of a crime, which would negate the attorney-client privilege.

And so what they are alleging, prosecutors, in writing to this Judge, is that they believe that the former President has used his attorney, Evan Corcoran in furtherance of a crime or fraud, that is this crime fraud exception that would allow them to overcome the attorney-client privilege and basically force him to answer questions that typically he wouldn't have to.

One of the ways you can do that is if you can convince a Judge that the communications at issue had something to do with furthering an ongoing crime.Now, the standard here is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That's what you would need to prove to a jury, in order to get a conviction. Here, you would have to prove to a Judge by a preponderance of the evidence by clear and convincing evidence more likely than not, essentially, that you have evidence that the evidence we are talking about here went to an ongoing crime. It is fairly rare for prosecutors to use this exception, this crime fraud exception and it is not assured as you say that they'll win, but it tells me the prosecutors are squarely focused on this obstruction of justice issue.",

There were no more classified documents where they had looked.Obviously, that wasn't the case, because the FBI showed up in August and found a lot more classified documents, but he didn't put his actual name on that, and one of the other attorneys put her name on that.

And it shows me, Anderson, that these prosecutors are focused intensely on obstruction of justice, and maybe even more so than any criminal issues that may relate to the actual mishandling of the documents.Let's remember, when the FBI and Justice Department got that search warrant to go into Mar-a-Lago last August, one of the crimes that they alleged that they had proof of probable cause of was obstruction of justice. So they went to a Federal Judge already, and showed that they had probable cause of obstruction of justice. Also, let's keep in mind, the biggest differentiator between the Trump documents scenario on the one hand and the Biden and Pence documents scenario on the other appears to be that obstruction of justice, and now they're going to a Judge and saying, you should let us break through the attorney-client privilege, which is a sacred privilege, because we think that communications here had to do with an ongoing crime.

But look, you know, this conversation kind of makes my head explode because we're talking about politics as if there is some sort of normal moment here, and it is as if the last President of the United States didn't attempt to end the peaceful transference of power.We are in uncharted waters here. Their official position of the Republican Party is that Joe Biden is not a legally elected President in a fair election, which means he is an occupier of the Oval Office. This is not a normal time, and democracy is on the ballot. And look, I've spent 30 years pointing out flaws in the Democratic Party, but one thing about the Democratic Party is it still believes that there is a democratic process in America and we have a democratically elected President. And until the Republican Party comes along with that, I just don't think it's about ideology or about anything else. It's about whether or not you believe in American democracy and we do what it takes to sustain it.",

More than a week after the devastating earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, a 30-year-old woman was pulled out of the rubble in the province of Hatay. This is according to CNN's Turkish affiliate. We don't know much else about her, but it was a Ukrainian rescue team working in Turkey who got her, which is pretty amazing considering the devastation that's going on in Ukraine right now.Ukraine has sent 87 emergency rescue staff to Turkey. The death toll from the earthquake has now surpassed 41,000 people. Turkey says more than 13,000 people are still hospitalized. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now from Turkey. It's incredibly, Sanjay, that they're still finding some people alive after so long. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It really is extraordinary, Anderson. And, you know, as dire as the numbers are, and the situation is, as you well know, and we've been to these places together, people rise up and they take care of people in extraordinary ways. I mean, I was at a hospital where really since the earthquake, people have not stopped working. Operating rooms have been running constantly. What has happened is so many hospitals in the quake zone were damaged, some of them rendered unoperational. The largest trauma center here in Adana has been taking on a large percentage of the patients, some 5,000 patients alone within this trauma center. And how they've been able to do it, how they all sort of came together, was something they wanted to show us today. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA (voice-over): Time is the great equalizer in hospitals all across Turkey, and there isn't enough of it here in Adana City at the Teaching and Research Hospital. (on-camera): The patients come in with fractures, with -- what sort of injury? DR. SULEYMAN CETINKUNAR, CHIEF OF STAFF, ADANA CITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL: Yes. Patients are -- consist of lymph loss, tissue crashes, tissue loss and brain trauma. GUPTA (voice-over): Dr. Suleyman Cetinkunar is chief of staff here. Within minutes, his trauma team is paged again. Another helicopter is arriving. (on-camera): We're now walking with the chief of staff of the hospital to the helipad. He tells me that they've had some 5,000 patients that have come here over the last seven days. The orthopedic surgeons, the neurosurgeons, have been operating for seven days straight basically. This is the largest trauma hospital in the quake zone. (voice-over): The doctors move fast. The goal, to care for this 26- year-old woman. Her kidneys are failing from something known as crush syndrome. Too many toxins were released into her blood after her limb was finally free. She will need emergent kidney dialysis. Over and over again, patients from the quake zone finally, thankfully, making it here for help. And one with the most remarkable story I have heard. This beautiful family of five, felt the earth's shake and then watched the unthinkable happen. NILAY FANSA, MOTHER OF MISSING BABY (through translation): Our block of flats is seven stories high. GUPTA (voice-over): They could do nothing but watch as eight-month-old baby Bergie (ph) was somehow hurtled from the window five stories to the ground. And then look what happened to their building, just flattened. Somehow, Nilai survived after being trapped herself for almost 14 hours. And she began to dig and scrape through the rubble for any sign, any sign at all that her baby girl was still alive. FANSA (through translation): And at that point, the fifth day, we thought we would be seeing her lifeless body. GUPTA (voice-over): But then something astonishing happened. Someone showed them this post on Twitter. At first, they weren't sure, but this baby girl looked very much like her daughter. FANSA (through translation): You see, we had no idea she had been saved. GUPTA (voice-over): In the chaos, a good Samaritan had rescued the girl and she was flown here, broken and battered, left leg shattered, skull fractured, a small collection of blood on her brain. But, yes, very much alive. (END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA: Such an incredible story, Anderson. I mean, just think about that building that you saw there. She was asleep in a cot next to that window. Had she been in that cot, still in that cot, she would have most likely died just by what had happened to that building. Instead, she was thrown out of the building and survived, as you saw there, into the hospital.",

But the problem is, as soon as you take, you know, as soon as you release the arm, all those toxins can now get into the bloodstream and cause problems with other organs, including the kidney.In Haiti, you may remember this, Anderson, sometimes they would find somebody who's still alive, but before they would actually unpinned them, they would start IVs, start actually giving fluids to try and prevent that problem from happening. They're doing the same thing here. They're giving IVs in the field to try and prevent that.

Over here, it is more spread out, the quake zone.But the same sorts of problems with building codes.
