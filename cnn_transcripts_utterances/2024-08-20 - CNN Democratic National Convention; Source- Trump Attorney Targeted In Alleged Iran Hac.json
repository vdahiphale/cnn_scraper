I'm Jake Tapper here at the DNC, where excitement is building among delegates for another big night of Democratic headliners, including former President Barack Obama, his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and the man who wants to become the nation's first ever first gentleman, Doug Emhoff, following a raucous and oftentimes logistically challenged day one of the convention of solutes and send-offs and emotional standoffs.

A ceremonial roll call of the states will be held to nominate Kamala Harris and as a tribute to President Biden, it will begin with his beloved home state of Delaware, the small wonder state. Vice President Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, are holding a rally tonight in battleground Wisconsin, right next door, after getting a rousing reception here in the arena last night. Milwaukee is about 90 miles away from where we are in Chicago. So we're not sure yet whether or not they will go from the arena to the rally and back, or whether they'll appeal appear in the arena at all. Tonight, we are told that former President Obama will make an appearance and deliver a forceful affirmation. The Kamala Harris this is the right leader for this moment, you might remember Obama became an overnight star at the Democrat's national convention 20 years ago when they were nominating John Kerry in Boston. He was, Mr. Obama, at the time, a little known state senator from Illinois and he spoke movingly about unity and hope.

He's right there on stage behind me, Jake, before he does perform, we're going to hear from a list of speakers that will be much more focused on Vice President Harris than last night, which, of course, as you noted, where a lot of tributes to President Biden before his big speech at the end of the evening? And that'll all get started tonight when we are hearing from the home state governor, that is Governor J.B. Pritzker, an Illinois delegation is right over there to my right. I'm standing right by the Delaware delegation that you noted is going to get that ceremonial roll call started in underway.But then we'll hear from some notable senators. Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Bernie Sanders. That, of course, will be one watch given he has not yet outright endorsed Harris. He is supporting her, but they have differences when it comes to what this policy platform is going to look like. And then for the rest of the night, Jake, expect to hear more of the personal side of Harris. We're going to hear from the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, who was seated next to her in the VIP box. Last night. He'll be trying to tell people about Harris herself, not as a politician, not as the candidate, but as her son. And what he knows about her. And then she will be -- and then we're going to hear from but former First Lady Michelle Obama, who has her own relationship with Harris. And of course, former President Barack Obama, one of the greatest speakers in the Democratic party, obviously who's going to close out the United Center tonight in a speech that everyone is watching very closely. And for those who don't know, obviously, Harris and Obama had this relationship that goes back two decades, Jake. So, it will be notable to hear from him on her as well because immediately when she was a rising star in the Democratic Party, you heard all of these natural comparisons between the two of them and their speaking styles and their presence on stage. And so that is something that people will be watching for in Obama's speech tonight.",

But she resigned after January 6. She couldn't stand by it. And since then, she's kept a very quiet life, lives in Kansas, has an animal sanctuary. This isn't something she necessarily I think wanted to do, but she's got two young sons. She said she cares about the future of the country, and she thinks it's her duty as someone who has so much insight into that world to talk about the character of Trump and why she believes he's unfit for office.

And as you pointed out, Lindsey Halligan, is somebody who was important in the Trump legal circles. She was involved in the classified documents case.

I just wanted to give you a little sense, a little a little color here. Look at these wonderful hats. They've all got these hats on. They say \"first in the west\". There's a whole contingent that has just walked down here, down to the floor but it is pretty incredible feeling especially because this is the hometown of Michelle Obama and Barack Obama. Now, a lot of people are talking about there's a long line. The line getting longer and longer and longer each day. But I want to give you some sense, just where we are now. There are so many delegates that are coming in Virginia. You see Idaho, Michigan, lot of the swing states, the all-important swing states, expect to see the large contingent of folks here. We're also expecting a special guest. Minnesota has this really famous and I know you liked sports, Jake, you ever heard of the Purple People Eaters? You ever heard of them? We're expecting one of them to show up. We're going to try to grab them a little bit later -- John.",
