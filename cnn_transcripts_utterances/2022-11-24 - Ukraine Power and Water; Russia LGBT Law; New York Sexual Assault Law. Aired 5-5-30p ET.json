This is THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Ahead, from Kyiv to Odessa, how Ukrainians are coping with blackouts, water supply is being cut off, and food shortages. Then, Russia's Duma approves an L -- approves an LGBT propaganda bill that targets adults. And a new law in New York now allows sexual assault victims to sue their alleged abusers, with a wave of cases now being filed. After enduring nine months of war and increasingly difficult hardships, Ukrainians are as defiant as ever, a vowing not to cave to Russia's attempt to freeze them into submission. Authorities are scrambling to turn the heat on and the lights back on, after Russian missile strikes targeted critical infrastructure, triggering the worst national power outages yet. Ukraine says, it has now restored about 50 percent of its electrical service. Water has also been restored across Kyiv, though not at full capacity. Earlier, residents had to queue in the pouring rain to collect water from public wells. Despite the widespread blackouts, doctors in Ukraine are still working around the clock to save lives, even performing heart surgery by torchlight. A medical services director shared this video, showing doctors wearing head lamps as they operate on a child at the Kyiv Heart Institute. Surgeons at other hospitals also worked through the blackouts to save lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, according to the text of all of this, it bans praising nontraditional sexual relationships or suggesting that they are normal. Now, all this really pertains to all facets of the public sphere. We're talking about media, radio, television, also the Internet as well, but even books. And the fines are really steep. It ranges from thousands of dollars for individuals to tens of thousands of dollars for legal entities or companies. And if you're talking about foreigners, they face up to 15 days in prison and then possibly being deported. Now, we were watching some of the proceedings in Russian parliament, essentially what the lawmakers there were suggesting is that they believe that the West was trying to spread homosexuality here in Russia and undermine traditional Russian values. In fact, the speaker of Russian parliament called this law the answer to Blinken, of course, talking about the U.S. secretary of state. We'll listen into some of what speaker of parliament had to say. VYACHESLAV VOLODIN, CHAIRMAN OF RUSSIA'S STATE DUMA:  It is the best answer to the United States Secretary of State Blinken. Stop imposing on us foreign values. You destroyed your values. We will see how it ends, but that is sad, for sure, because it is sodomy. I can't say it in any other way. The United States of America has become the global center of this sodomy. Let them live there. Do not touch us.",

There are some gay activists that we've beenspeaking to who say that right now, they are trying to lay low, trying to not really comment on this. But in the public, there are others who are openly saying that they believe that they might have to leave the country. In fact, a lot of gay people have already left the country in the past couple of months, and indeed, in the last couple years. Now, one of the things that we need to point out is that this law has not gone into effect yet. It has been passed by Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, but still has to go through the upper house of parliament, the federation council, and then also it has to be signed by President Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, the pressure continues on Russia's LGBTQ community, which has already been faced with a lot of pressure here in the society over the past couple of years. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

She says the former president had raped her in the mid 1990s in a dressing room of a New York City department store. She also says he defamed her when he denied the allegations of rape, saying that he didn't know who she was, and she made up the assault to boost sales of her new book. This is the second lawsuit brought by Carroll, but the first time to hold the president accountable for the alleged assault. Carroll is bringing this lawsuit under the new New York state law, called the Adult Survivors Act. That allows any adult to bring a lawsuit against anyone that they say sexually assaulted them, no matter how long ago the alleged attack occurred. Trump attorney Alina Habba responded to the lawsuit, saying: While I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this act which creates a terrible precedent and the runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims. Lawyer say to expect a flood of lawsuits under this new law. If you look to a 2019 law that was passed that allowed child victims to bring claims, there were 11,000 lawsuits brought in that two-year window. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
