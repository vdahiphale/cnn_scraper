      "sentences": "Well, the pace of operations on the battlefield certainly seems to be increasing as far asthe Ukrainians are concerned. We've been hearing from official Ukrainian sources, is they say that they've taken a string of villages on the south- eastern part of the very long front line here in this country. There were several videos that were put out of Ukrainian units entering some of those villages, putting up the Ukrainian flag and saying that they had, quote, liberated those towns and villages. So, the Ukrainians certainly say that, at least in some areas of the front line, they are the ones that are on the move. And it's quite interesting because we've also been hearing not from the Russian Defense Ministry, but from Russian military bloggers who are usually very well informed and also keep in contact with many of the frontline units on the Russian side. And they also say they are quite concerned about some of the gains that the Ukrainians have been making, especially in that southeastern sector where they are saying that the Ukrainians are pushing forward. However, those Ukrainian gains certainly do seem to be coming at a price. The Russians are saying that they've destroyed a great deal of armor of the Ukrainians as those units were trying to move forward and also Western- donated armor, including Leopard 2 main battle tanks provided by the Germans, but also Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, as well. So, definitely, tough battles that are going on along this very long frontline. And it still is unclear whether or not this is Ukraine's big push or the big counteroffensive that they've been preparing for such a very long time. Ukraine's president this weekend did indicate that that could be the case. However, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency seemed to strike a different tone, putting out a video just sort of sitting in his chair and then writing, coming on the screen saying that plans love silence. Obviously, the Ukrainians indicating that if this is the big offensive, they're not willing to talk about it. On the whole, however, it does seem to be clear that, right now, the initiative on pretty much all fronts of the battlefield is with the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians moving forward, for instance, also in the town of Bakhmut, which of course has seen such heavy fighting over the past couple of months.

So, what doesthis mean for his Forza Italia party and also the coalition they have with Giorgia Meloni? NADEAU (on-camera): Yeah, that's an interesting question. You know, he was the one that's really the cornerstone of the party. Obviously, it's his party, but he was the one that really wanted to stay in this coalition with Giorgio Meloni and Matteo Salvini, two other very divisive figures in the Italian political scene. It remains really to be seen what happens because it remains to be seen whether his daughter, Marina Berlusconi, is going to enter politics. That's been a rumor that's floated around the political circles here for many, many years. And, you know, the Forza Italia party is Silvio Berlusconi. There, you know, a lot of members of his party came from other parties. It really is going to be interesting to see if they stay or if they go to other right-wing parties or center-right parties. Right now, nobody's talking about that, of course. He was supposed to have a meeting, a very important meeting on the day before he was hospitalized last Friday -- the day after, I'm sorry, he was hospitalized last Friday, in which his high officers were going to be discussing what happens post- Berlusconi. Now, actually, that's going to be a priority. But none of that's going to take place until after the funeral, which will be held Wednesday at the Duomo in Milan. Zain.",

His first wife who has never spoken publicly about her settlement, lives very comfortably, and I'm sure all the women in his life will, as well. as well as his five children.

He's also a Former RepublicanCongressman who voted to impeach Trump the second time around. He joins us live now from Houston, Texas. Thank you so much for being with us. So, my question to you, Mr. Kinzinger, is what do you say to a significant percentage of Republican voters who look at what's happening today and will say, you know, this is obviously a political witch hunt. These are clearly Trumped-up charges. Obviously, many people have been making the comparison to Hillary Clinton's email probe. Of course, we know that those two cases are very, very different. However, there is a significant percentage of Republican voters who believe that Donald Trump is being persecuted here for political reasons. What do you say to them? ADAM KINZINGER, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Well, I mean, it's just simply not true, you know, first off. And the sad thing is, I mean, there's every day I still am shocked at what my party believes at the mistruths they buy into at the defense of this very flawed man. I mean, you know, one of the things that Donald Trump tries to portray is strength, like he's some strong, but for as strong as he tries to portray himself, he's been the victim of literally everything. Everything's a witch hunt. Everybody's out to get him like he has no control over this. So, what I tell my fellow Republicans is, look, it's not true at all. Either Trump is the biggest victim in the history of the country and frankly with the most powerful job in the world or he's actually corrupt. And the truth is he's corrupt and you know, what I believe and what I know is that, yes, at this moment there's going to be a significant part of the Republican base that just rallies to his defense, it's tribalism, but in the long run their kids and their grandkids will never ever believe the garbage conspiracies that they do because that will wear off and that's what I try to look at the historical context here.",

Of course, we know that it will benefit him in the short term, but let's say six months from now, is there a point at which Republican voters get tired of all the drama?",

So, here's what I see as a possible scenario if theRepublican party basically ram dumps Donald Trump, and that would be if the numbers begin to show, as they already do show, that he can't win a general election. If people are just getting fatigued of all the, you know, the victim, all the drama that exists every day. And if another Republican candidate can make the case that they are better than Donald Trump. And right now, that's the weirdest thing to me, is you have all these people running against Donald Trump, all coming out and defending him, because they're scared to death of him. So, look, I think it's possible that the Republican Party turns against Trump. I mean, there's still this case in Georgia, there's still the January 6th cases, potentially. But I guarantee you, I mean, I guess I can't guarantee anything, but I get about as close to a guarantee as I can, that if he wins the Republican nomination, he's not going to win the general election. There's not a single person in the United States of America that did not vote for Donald Trump in 2020, that now intends to vote for him. I would say it's actually quite the opposite.",

We've been hearing all throughout the day, jackhammering and heavy machinery working through the day to sift through that rubble.
