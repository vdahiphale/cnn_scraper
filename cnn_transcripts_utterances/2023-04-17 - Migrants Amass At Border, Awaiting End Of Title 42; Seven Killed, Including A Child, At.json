Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom.\" We're learning more about some of the victims of a mass shooting at a sweet 16 birthday party in Alabama. Details along with the message from police as they search for a suspect.Congress is returning from a two-week break with a high stakes debt ceiling standoff looming in D.C. Will President Biden budge as Republicans ready a spending cut bill with strings attached. Plus, chaos in Khartoum. Fierce fighting between rival generals in Sudan has left hopes for a peaceful transition to civilian rule in tatters. With a new school week starts in a few hours here in the United States, one community will be facing it with a sense of loss, both impossible to explain and yet all too common. Dadeville, Alabama is the latest city grappling with a mass shooting. Police say four people were killed at a sweet 16 birthday party late Saturday night. Twenty- eight were wounded, some critically. A second victim has now been identified by family members as high school senior Keke Smith. She was a student athletic manager on the track team who some say was always smiling. Also killed was Philstavious Dowdell, a beloved athlete and the brother of the birthday girl. Police have not released any details of a suspect or a motive for the killings. They are asking for help from the public. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They went right up to the brink. The deal virtually fell apart, and at the last minute they were able to cobble together reductions that allowed John Boehner to move through the debt ceiling (inaudible) the House. President Obama and Joe Biden came out of that experience and said never again. And in fact, in 2013, when Republicans again tried to leverage concessions in return for raising the debt ceiling including rolling back portion of the Affordable Care Act, Obama and Biden refused to negotiate. That is the position that he is sticking to now, and there are no indications that he is moving off of it. You know, I think the assumption in Washington has always been that there would be enough Republicans who recognize the magnitude of defaulting on the debt and would break from the party to allow a debt ceiling increase to go through, but that is far from clear, Rosemary.

There is majority support for those ideas, not only among Democrats who do and don't own guns, but also a majority of Republicans who don't own guns also support those ideas, according to the Pew Research center.The one group in the society that opposes those ideas is in the majority basis are Republican gun owners. But those republican gun owners as we saw at the NRA conference this weekend have, in essence, a veto over the Republican Party. And because of the small state bias in the Senate and the filibuster, that veto within the Republican Party becomes a veto over the country. It is simply implausible at this point that there will ever be meaningful action on guns without changing the filibuster. The crisis over the -- the inability of the political system to deal with gun violence is fundamentally a crisis of majority rule. And it is why that issue I think is ultimately going to come to a head very quickly the next time Democrats have unified control of the White House, the House and the Senate. Hard to see how the filibuster survives, given how it is being used on voting, on guns, on abortion, to frustrate the view of the majority of the country.",

Those are important questions we can ask in the intelligence committee so that we can have stronger oversight. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): The access that he was having to this information should have been cut off. He should have never been having access to this level of classified information that could hurt the United States. Right.
