The Israeli military says it hit two Hezbollah command centers belonging to the group's executive council in Beirut on Monday. The Israel Defense Forces also says Hezbollah fired about 20 projectiles from Lebanon Monday and warned rocket fire into Israel could ramp up ahead of Tuesday's vote.

Many thanks.Well, Special Counsel Jack Smith's mission was to prove U.S. presidents are not above the law. But Donald Trump's re-election means he will not face further prosecution at the federal level, at least not for the next four years. On Monday, Smith officially shelved the classified documents and January 6th election subversion cases. Trump and his supporters feel vindicated. Critics say he will escape accountability for one of the most serious crimes against democracy in American history. They also warn justice not served means a future president might also feel tempted to meddle with election results, knowing Trump got away with it. CNN's Evan Perez has further details now on the decision to drop the cases. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, SR. U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Special Counsel Jack Smith asked federal judges overseeing the two criminal prosecutions of Donald Trump to drop those cases, citing the longstanding Justice Department rules that forbid prosecuting a sitting president. Smith made the filings in Washington, D.C., where the election subversion case was filed against Trump and with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which has a pending appeal of a ruling dismissing charges in the classified documents case. Smith says that he consulted with lawyers from the Office of Legal Counsel, which serves as the in-house law firm for the administration, and determined that Trump is covered by that shield against prosecution even now as president-elect. Smith says in his filing, the Department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated. This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant. Smith requested that the classified documents case continue for two of Trump's co-defendants who are accused of helping him obstruct the investigation. Judge Tanya Chutkan quickly granted Smith's request to dismiss the January 6th-related case quote, \"without prejudice, meaning that the dismissal applies only while Trump is president.\" Chutkan wrote, the dismissal without prejudice is also consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office. So, does that mean that the cases against Trump could be revived after he leaves office? Once Trump is president, he also could order his Justice Department to kill the cases for good.

That was not a term that the Lebanese side was willing to accept. So the \"solution\", quote-unquote, that they've found for it is that there will be a separate letter between Israel and the United States where the U.S. acknowledges this kind of ability of Israel to go after Hezbollah if Hezbollah violates the agreement.

There are some doubts about that.The second thing we've learned, Rosemary, is that they took advantage of the fact that the U.S. telecom system is put together by assembling companies that have been acquired, different systems that have equipment in them, some of which is 40 years old. And this gave an opportunity to the Chinese to go find holes in the seams where those connect. And the result is that they were able to not only be able to monitor metadata, that is, telephone numbers called, how long a call was, things like that, where the people involved in the call were when the call was connected, but in some cases to actually get conversations, not over encrypted apps like Signal or WhatsApp, but just plain old phone calls. And we believe that part on their target list and probably successfully on it was President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance.",

If somebody wanted to get into a company or a government agency, the telecoms would be a good place to go do it. There was a meeting in the White House on Friday with the CEOs of almost all the major telecom companies to talk about restructuring their systems so the Chinese couldn't come back in. But as I said, parts of the system are so old that you might literally have to go close down some telecommunications while you ripped this equipment out and replaced it.
