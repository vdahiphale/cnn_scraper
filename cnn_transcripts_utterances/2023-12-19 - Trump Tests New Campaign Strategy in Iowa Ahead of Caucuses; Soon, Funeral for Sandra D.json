The strategy they're trying to deploy in Iowa and why they're hoping it sets a model for the general. CNN's Alayna Treene has this new reporting. She's back with us. Alayna, what is this test case?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Kate, essentially what they're trying to do in Iowa is not only go after likely caucus-goers, which the other campaigns are doing, and we're seeing the polls keep track of, but they're trying to find and create first-time caucus- goers and essentially expand the electorate in Iowa in Donald Trump's favor.And they think that by doing this, you know, they'll be able to turn out a lot more people on caucus day for Donald Trump than anyone was anticipating. And if that strategy is successful in Iowa, which the campaign, of course, thinks it will be, they will be using that in the other early-nominating states as well as potentially a general election if Donald Trump were able to get that far and receive the nomination. Now, part of that strategy as well, I'm told by Donald Trump's advisers, is this program that they've created called Ten for Trump. They've essentially picked hundreds of caucus goers in the state of Iowa, calling them caucus captains, and they assigned them to target ten specific people, first-time caucus-goers that they'd be going after, and have them call up these people and ask them to come out. That's just one way that they're trying to implement this strategy. Of course, they have an extensive amount of data that they're mining and pulling on these people in order to reach out. I'm also told that the former president has been personally making calls to these caucus-goers, to these voters, trying to ensure that they come out for him on January 15th, and also ensure that first-time caucus-goers are aware that they should be coming out and teaching them how to caucus. I think what's been really interesting, just having attended many of Donald Trump's rallies, particularly in the state of Iowa over the last several months, is that they are very focused on teaching caucus- goers essentially how to caucus, teaching them where to go, how to get there on caucus day, helping provide them with transportation to get to the polls, all of these things in their goal of trying to set a new record in Iowa on January 15th.

In 2016, it was admittedly kind of a more scattershot effort in Iowa and some of these other early states.But now, this intentionality from the Trump campaign, this acknowledgement of if we're going to expand our footprint, if we're going to be able to draw in some new caucus-goers, people who've never been through this process before, people who might be energized from what they saw in 2016 from the Trump campaign, being able to expand that footprint might be something that really could make a splash in Iowa if the Trump campaign or any other effort that's aiming to do something similar could really get that off the ground in January 15, which is going to be here before we know it.

That's something that Chris Christie, who's also competing heavily in New Hampshire, had really taken Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis to task over, saying they're really not talking about the guy who's in the top of the polls. I'm the only one going after him directly. And as you know, we see that actually starting to happen.Last night, Nikki Haley sending out a tweet, basically to Donald Trump to bring it, if he's going to start criticizing her, that she'll be willing to do the same. Yet to be known if any voters are actually swayed by this, but without Donald Trump having participated in any of the GOP primary debates thus far, it's really the only opportunity that voters in any state are really getting to see these candidates talking to him directly, even if it's just through ads.",

So, that is something that people like Kim Reynolds, like maybe Chris Sununu, not that he's really been in the pro-Trump camp to speak of, but he is endorsing another candidate in 2024. So, really kind of looking back at some of these issues and knowing that the Trump campaign being more organized now than it perhaps was the first time is really compiling all of that evidence that it would, say, could be used to try to take some of these surrogates and endorsers and at least flick at pieces of the past where they've been in support of their guys opposed to whoever they're with now.",

And so we're really hung up over policy issues being tied into this funding bill. And there is no kind of big overlap of agreement right now. And if there was, you'd still have to get it drafted. It's very complicated. So, I think it's an accurate assessment and the exclamation mark is that many Republicans have not even bothered to come back to Washington, D.C.

Because Biden's openness now to a series of border changes, cracking down harder on the border in order to get to a yes, it is angering some progressive Democrats and they're speaking out publicly about it.

It stated, any proposal considering permanent changes to our asylum and immigration system, it needs to include a clear path to legalization for longstanding undocumented immigrants There's no indication senator that that is going to be included.

And if you have legal-controlled immigration on a framework that has accountability, it's a much better place to be that has bipartisan support.So, there are pieces that Democrats are saying, we've had support for these issues. Let's include these in the conversation. But, Kate, I do want to go back for a moment to your underlying point, where you were saying maybe Biden made a big error of putting immigration in, like, if you will, our border along with Ukrainian issues and Middle East issues, but, quite frankly, that was a Republican demand. So, he was responding, trying to find that middle ground. And we can look at it now and say, well, we should have held out and thrown that into the negotiation later. I just don't think that gets us anywhere. I mean, the big issue here is Biden's willing to fund the key programs to restore the structure of law.
