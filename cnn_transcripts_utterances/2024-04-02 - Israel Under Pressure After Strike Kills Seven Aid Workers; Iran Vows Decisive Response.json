Live from New York, it is Tuesday, April 2nd. I am Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Israel under growing pressure tonight show after an Israeli military strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza. The victims were World Central Kitchen, which has been providing food to hungry Palestinians. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the workers were \"unintentionally struck.\" France, says there is \"no justification for such a tragedy.\" The British prime minister told Netanyahu today that the situation was \"increasingly intolerable,\" and the White House has now also condemned the strike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: We were outraged to learn of an IDF strike that killed a number of civilian humanitarian workers yesterday from the World Central Kitchen which has been relentless in working to get food to those who are hungry in Gaza, and quite frankly, around the world. We send our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the tragic loss of what he described as innocent lives.

We will investigate it right to the end.

      "sentences": "Yes, a very sad situation and it is absolutely causing outrage and dismay and despair. Athorough quick and impartial type of investigation that the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken called for, impartial, it is not something that the Israeli Defense Forces have in the past easily given to. They are saying right down from the defense chief that there is going to be a thorough investigation. Herzi Halevi, the top commander of the IDF says that he will review the findings of the investigation. Their plan is to learn lessons, but the lessons being taken away from the humanitarian aid givers is, it just isn't safe. And as Melissa was talking about in her report there, this was the group that pioneered an alternate way to get aid around, essentially what many Palestinians in Gaza view as a blockade of aid getting to them from Israel and through the border from Egypt as well. Israel says that it is helping and doing everything it can to get food across the border, but it is the UN's assessment as people are close to starvation. So the World Central Kitchen had found that innovative way around it, and this is an object lesson, if you will, in the words of the Israeli Prime Minister, when he says, this happens in war of what can happen in these situations, and it sends a very, very chilling message to anyone that would want to go in and help the people of Gaza. The investigation, of course, will be judged internationally. We know that the British prime minister a short time ago called the Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed to him the absolute importance of improving humanitarian aid, access and distribution in Gaza and in no uncertain terms that this was not acceptable, the killing of these aid workers. But it will be how transparent will that investigation that is being promised be and how immediate and how quick? And I think that will be the final assessment by agencies, aid agencies of how effectively they can work there if they don't feel that they are getting to the bottom of what Israel says, it will get to the bottom of, and it has a lot of information already. It knows the drones that fired at those three vehicles and those times that it happened. It will know who was behind the controls of those drones, it will know the instructions they have; it will know the  conversations that have been had -- all of that will be available in a very short space of time. So that will be where I think the next move on this rests, it will be the judgment of that investigation.",

But it doesn't appear at this time like the administration is willing to, in any way kind of rein in the weapon sales that it is approving for the Israelis, because as you heard, the Secretary of State say there, this is in the US' perspective, a long-term investment in Israel's security, not only as part of this war against Hamas in Gaza, but also as part of the larger regional context where Israel is facing threats from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Iran. And so from the US' point of view, these arms sales need to continue because the US has made a commitment essentially to allowing Israel to defend itself. And right now, although this massive weapons sale, this $18 billion weapons sale is set to be approved by the administration, it is going to set off a really important debate, I think on Capitol Hill here amongst lawmakers who are deeply skeptical of providing this kind of equipment to Israel, even if it is not going to be delivered in the next four to five years, right? Because these fighter jets, they do have to be built and manufactured, and this is not an immediate thing that the Israelis are going to get. But it speaks to, I think the larger issue here, which is that the US does not appear to be using its leverage that it has with these military sales to try to get Israel to conform to the kind of behavior in war that the US he has been encouraging them to conduct themselves by. And that is going to be the point, I think, that we see many lawmakers here make and have already started to make is that the US has this leverage, so why doesn't it start using it if it says publicly that Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians there, that I think is the big question we are going to see play out here.",

Its shares closed down nearlyfive percent, as you can see there, lower on the disappointing Q1 numbers. Tesla's deliveries were off eight percent from a year ago, that's the first drop, in fact, since the pandemic. The company is blaming production problems and Red Sea shipping delays. Tesla's challenges, however, go deeper as its share price suggests, over the past year. They include growing competition, particularly in China, and slowing demand for EVs. Colin Rusch is the managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Company Investments and he joins us now from New York. Colin, fantastic to have you with us. Now, I read your notes. You were expecting a disappointment in the first quarter, but you lowered your delivery estimates to 468,000 vehicles and it was significantly even below that. How disappointed are you? COLIN RUSCH, MANAGING DIRECTOR, OPPENHEIMER &amp; COMPANY INVESTMENTS: It is good to see a kind of a flush on the expectations here. So obviously, the first quarter was very disappointing from an overall volume, but it does point to some of the production issues that they had with the arson in Berlin as well as the Red Sea supply chain issues. But also, it allows them to reset the bar for investors on both margins and expectations for growth, and I think we will see those changes in estimates, flow through on all the street's estimates here over the next couple of weeks.",

And so what they're doing is really starting to train their system around how to navigate the streets as the vehicle, but also starting to collect data on how humans interact to really inform their robot program where they're starting to look at factory workers that are automated and really moving that optimist program forward. So for us, we think this is the early days. They've been able to monetize the FSD, this full self-driving program in a reasonable way. We think they will actually recognize some deferred revenue here in the first quarter with the bigger issues around how this really starts to transform the physical world and automating the physical world and how those programs start to come forward.

Nathaniel, to what extent has this to do with perhaps the bigger macro issues the other big retailers are facing versus the transformation plan that PVH were trying to enact to help boost sales of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger? What's the waiting here?",

      "sentences": "So, Julia, I think that it has to do more with the macroeconomic conditions and the kind of theconsumer slowdown that we're seeing in Europe and the United States, in North America. And PVH is not the only brand that has warned of a consumer slowdown. We're hearing similar commentary from Nike and Lululemon here in the United States. And you think back to 2021, 2022, these brands were doing really well when demand was really strong, supply was very tight, but there's been definitely a reversal. People were going out and spending on clothing and accessories, but there's been more of a reversal, a shift to experiences and services, as well as kind of an inflation hit. So that is impacting companies like PVH, Nike, and that's why we're seeing kind of the stock get hit really hard right now.",

What's taking place with that shift from the wholesale to the direct-to-consumer sort of fronting part of the business? Because surely that's perhaps factoring into some of the challenges that they're facing here as well.",

      "sentences": "It is, Julia. So yes, so direct sales, which are more profitable for brands like PVH, up 9 percent, but wholesale at department stores down10 percent. And traditionally these brands have relied on wholesale distributors to get out their products when department stores were really strong, but they're trying to rein in kind of some of these sales, get them more through their own stores and online. But that's challenging for these retailers. Yes, the profits are higher, but we still do see consumers going to department stores and other wholesalers. So those channels are still very important. And what we're seeing right now with PVH is how difficult it is to kind of manage the shift. You want to increase your direct-to-consumer sales, but you don't want your wholesale revenue to decline 10 percent. So a difficult balance for the company right now.",

Now \"Forbes\" has just come out with its annual list of billionaires. The usual names are on top as you would expect, to LVMH's Bernard Arnault, whose family is worth some cool $233 billion. Then you've got the likes of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, the usual suspects. There were also some high-profile newcomers this year, too. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the luxury shoe designer Christian Louboutin, and a woman who's made quite a bit of news lately. (MUSIC)",

Bernard Arnault of LVMH, and then you have the likes of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, though I have to say the gap is widening between Bernard Arnault and what we're seeing from Elon Musk, of course, in part due to the performance of Tesla. PETERSON-WITHORN: Yes, that's right. So Arnault is $38 billion richer than Elon Musk in second place this year. And its LVMH stock is doing great. You know, it was an up year for Arnault. And it's not going quite as well for Musk who's, of course, doing just fine, but Tesla shares are down from their high. His investment in Twitter has been not the best business decision maybe from a pure dollar standpoint. And he lost some stock options he might be having to give up. So it's not as good of a year for Musk.",

And obviously wementioned Sam Altman of OpenAI but there's a whole host of them that are and have had a game-changing year in terms of wealth as a result of the financial gains of AI and the optimism. PETERSON-WITHORN: Yes, it's been -- it's a great year for billionaires. It's a really great year. If you have anything to do with artificial intelligence, there are tons of new billionaires who have joined the ranks, who have AI companies or who are using AI heavily in their companies, or people who are, you know, running businesses that are producing semiconductors or, you know, cloud storage space, things like that. So, you know, AMD's Lisa Su is new. Sam Altman, you've mentioned. But also it's been really good for existing tech billionaires even, you know, because the rising tides have sort of lifted their boats as well. And so the biggest gainer of all is Mark Zuckerberg, who, you know, Meta is not directly an AI company, but, you know, they're making investments in AI and they're certainly benefiting from all this investor enthusiasm for companies that will be able to employ AI. And so, you know, Zach is $116 billion richer than he was last year. So if you have any attachment to AI whatsoever, you're seeing some dollar signs this year.",

It was nice actually that youmentioned some of the women that are also gaining in this sphere as well, which I like. Lisa Su, as you mentioned, key among those at AMD. Talk to me about Taylor Swift then because this is perhaps one of the most exciting new entrants, not the first musician, but the first to do this solely with the songs that she's producing and obviously direct associations with that. PETERSON-WITHORN: Yes, exactly. So there's more and more money to be made in music these days if you're at the top. You know, we've seen this huge sales of catalogs over recent years, and also, you know, the money you can make touring can be pretty substantial, but, you know, most celebrities who become billionaires, they have other business ventures. Kim Kardashian has Skims. Rihanna has Fenty. But Taylor Swift is the first person to do it just off of raking in money touring, recording, and of course famously re-recording her way to the billionaires list. So, yes, she's new and we have heard about $1.1 billion at, you know, age 34. So plenty of room to grow.",

PETERSON-WITHORN: Yes, it's a huge investigative project. You know, of course, we are looking at publicly traded stocks. We're also digging deep into any sort of filings we can find, legal filings, regulatory filings, annual reports. We're interviewing these billionaires directly. We're interviewing, you know, their business partners. We're interviewing industry sources and then we're trying to figure out what their public companies are worth, but also their private companies, what their yachts are worth and their jets. And I mean, you know, if there's anything out there that people are buying and selling, there are people who helped them buy and sell it. And so we're talking to those people. So when we go to value a private island we call, you know, the private island guy that everybody is buying and selling their private island to. (LAUGHTER)",
