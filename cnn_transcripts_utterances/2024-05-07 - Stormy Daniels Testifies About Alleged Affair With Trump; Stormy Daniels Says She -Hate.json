There's going to be more cross-examination on Thursday. At one point, Judge Merchan also ordered defense attorney, Todd Blanche, to speak to his client, Donald Trump, who he said was audibly cursing at points, during Stormy Daniels' testimony, behavior the judge called contemptuous. As for Daniels, she'll be back on the stand, when the trial resumes Thursday. Back with the panel, right now. Joining us CNN Legal Analyst, Elie Honig. And Norm Eisen, who served as Special Counsel to the House Democrats, during the first Trump impeachment, and is the Author of \"Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial.\" So, you've been writing courtroom diaries, Norm. What stood out to you today? What are the biggest takeaways from her testimony?",

She's principally a corroboration witness, to provide additional evidence, because all of the witnesses we've seen have credibility issues.I thought she was actually more effective, on cross-examination, just watching the jury. Under the pressure of questioning from defense counsel, her toughness and steel came out. She pushed back on some of the aspersions that were cast upon her. And she did provide corroboration about the 2006 sexual encounter that kicked off this whole case, then the critical 2016 alleged campaign finance conspiracy, and then its cover-up. And you need that conspiracy, and the cover-up. She centered on the conspiracy. She brought us back, after a very dry documents day.",

The judge pointed out that the defense had failed to object at certain points that he had to, sua sponte on his own, object, at one point. It did go too far, Anderson. There were too many extraneous issues. A reporter asked me, did she talk too much? I said the problem wasn't talking. It was a failure to listen. She was not hearing the questions and responding to the questions. She was going over that script.

She would have been a character that would have absorbed all of the energy in the campaign, had she been out front in that particular moment. For whatever it's worth, the jury saw that today.

I mean, I have been watching Trump as he was in there with Keith Davidson, the moments where he was closing his eyes, and not really paying attention, or trying to kind of pretend like the testimony wasn't happening. He made no illusions of not listening, today. He was glued to that screen. He had a scowl on his face the whole time. When he walked in and out of the room, he was downright angry. The only time he didn't seem really furious was as he was exiting the courtroom, at the end of the day, after Susan Necheles had delivered a pretty brutal beginning of that cross-examination. But Trump's anger in watching Stormy Daniels, and the two of them being in the room, for the first time in 17 years? They have not seen each other since 2007. It was palpable.

They're going to question how truthful you are, how believable you are, and how likable you are.

And the Israelis have said that that is completely impossible for them. So that's the key area. Then another issue is this issue of whether Israeli forces would pull out of the Gaza Strip entirely. Hamas has said again, in the proposed agreement that they signed on to, that it would entail Israel completely pulling out its forces. Israel has said there is no possibility of that happening. Now, while it sounds like there's a lot of daylight between the two sides, U.S. officials have said, and we heard from White House spokesperson, John Kirby, today that he believes the gaps can be closed. We know there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity talks, ongoing in Cairo, today. CIA Director, Bill Burns, who was in Cairo, will be flying to Israel tomorrow, to meet with his counterpart, David Barnea, at Mossad, also to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
