Jerome Powell is the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, which is the central bank in the United States. For the past year, we`ve seen the Federal Reserve repeatedly trying to tame soaring inflation by hiking up interest rates. Well, the Fed did it again for the 10th consecutive time since last March. The continued raising of the interest rates is hurting Americans pockets, especially when it comes to paying for mortgages, car loans and credit card bills. Our Christine Romans is here to break it all down for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The Federal Reserve has raised rates ten times over the past year. That target interest rate fromthe Fed influences a lot of other borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, business loans. The Fed`s attempt to tame inflation raises costs for all Americans. Let`s look at how it`s felt in your household budget. The rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 4.16% back when the rate hike started over a year ago. Today it`s 6.39%. So on a $500,000 loan with 20% down, that works out to be more than $500 extra a month. New car loans have jumped from four and a half percent last year to almost 7% on a six year auto loan. That means the monthly car payment is $63 more expensive for the same car. The Fed`s rate hikes make credit card debt even more dangerous and expensive to carry. Average credit card rates have soared from 14 and a half percent, already high to a record above 20%. So if you pay just a minimum on $2,000 balance say, it`ll take you nearly eleven more months to pay it off because of the rising interest rates. More recently, the Fed has signaled a potential pause in new rate hikes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
