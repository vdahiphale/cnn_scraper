It was defined in the previous ones and the current ones.What do we mean by that? China is the one country out there that geopolitically has the power potential to be a significant challenge to the United States. They are. Based on their population, their technology, and they're economy and other things, China is the greatest geopolitical challenge to the United States. China is not shy about their goal. They want to be the number-one power in the globe by mid-century, by 2049. They want to do that militarily, diplomatically, informationally, economically, and so on and so forth. They want to be number one by mid-century. By the 2030s, mid 2030s, they previously said they want to be number one regionally. So they want a military that is -- that out does the United States military by the mid 30s. They previously said that. They advanced that goal to 2027. They advanced that goal in the two- party or one-party Congress ago. And what they have said is they want to be the equal to or superior militarily to the United States. That's only five years away. So they're working on that and they're working on that very, very hard. But we are not static. We are working on it. Right now, the United States military is, without question, despite whatever criticisms people have, the United States military is the most lethal war fighting machine on earth bar none. The United States military is number one. We intend to stay number one. Our task -- militaries only have two task, single purpose really, which is to either prepare for war or to fight a war. We are laser focused on that. We intend to stay number one. China is not going to be a better military than the United States military is, but they're going to try, but they're not going to get there. We will be number one five years from now, 10 years from now and 50 years from now. We are not going to let China take number one. They have made gains in a wide variety of areas, in cyber and space and land, sea and air, so a peasant army of -- largely infantry based. When I was commissioned in 1980, that's they had when he made his reforms. So they had a very large, dismounted infantry, peasant-based army, more or less. Some tanks, not much. Then they got rich. They made a massive amount of money with a 10 percent rise overrun, drop down to 7 percent, maybe 3 or 4 percent, but the GDP allowed them to buy a military. And they believe that it's their day in the sun. They believe it's once again time for the Middle Kingdom to be number one. So that's what they're shooting for. And we're to the going to allow that to happen. The United States military is number one and going to be number one, five years from now, 2027 is not going to be the date that China becomes number one. And we're going to stay number one the entire time. As long as we remain number one, we'll deter the war that people worry about, a great power war between China and the United States. As long as we have the military capability, we have the will to use it, your adversary knows it is, then you'll deter that war. But the key is to have the military capability. We intend to stay number one.",

As you've heard me say a number of times, I think it's really important for large countries with significant military capacity to talk to each other.As I told Minister Wei, when we talked, we met face to face in Singapore, that we needed to work to keep the lines of communication open. That helps with crisis management. It helps with a number of things. And so my hope is that they will open up their communications channels not only at my level but the chairman's level and at the level where our combatant commander, Admiral Aqalino (ph), can engage with his counterparts as well. So you're right, we will both be in Cambodia here in the near future. I don't have any announcements to make in terms of any scheduled meetings, but there's an opportunity there and so we'll see how things play out.",

He'll make decisions based on what he thinks is in his national interests.As best I can tell, he's a rationale actor. I think he evaluates things on cost, benefit and risk. And I think he would conclude an attack on Taiwan in the near future would be an excessive amount of risk and end in a strategic really debacle for the Chinese military. I think it would throw off their China dream of being the number one economic and military power and so on. Would he do it? Who knows? I don't know. I can tell you that we watch it closely. We are militarily prepared. One of the keys now is to make sure that Taiwan can defend itself. And there are a lot of lessons learned coming out of the Ukrainian war. There's lessons learned for Taiwan. There are lessons learned that we're learning, lessons learned that the European countries are learning. And President Xi and the Chinese military are learning. One of the things people are learning is that war on paper is a whole lot different than real war. When blood is spilled and people die and real tanks are being blown up, things are a little bit different. There's a lot of friction and fog and death in combat. And for someone who has, for a military that hasn't fought in combat since fighting the Vietnamese in 1979, they would be playing a dangerous game to cross the straits and invade the island of Taiwan. They don't have the experience or background to do it. They do peace training. We watch it very closely. How much amphibious, airborne capability they have. They could bomb it, missile it, attack Taiwan in that sense, but attacking and seizing the island of Taiwan across the straits, putting troops on the island of Taiwan, that is a very difficult military task to do. You've got a large city of Taipei with three or four million people with the suburbs of seven million. You have complex terrain with mountains, most of Taiwan is a mountainous island. It's a difficult military objective, a very difficult military operation to execute. And I think it will be some time before the Chinese have the military capability and they're ready to do it. Now that could be wrong. An incident could happen. Some sort of political thing could happen at a moment in time and all of the decisions would change very rapidly. I think that Chinese would be high risk to take on an operation like that. And I think it would be unwise. It would be a political mistake, a geopolitical mistake, a strategic mistake similar to the strategic mistake is that Putin has made in Ukraine. Secretary?",

A short time ago, Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, says he has no doubt this was not a Ukrainian missile. How are investigators going to get to the bottom of this? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Well, they're going to have to look at the data on the ground. Secretary Austin said -- or General Milley -- we're going to see the impact crater and get other information from electronic means, probably find the trajectory, probably find out where the missile actually was launched from. And we'll also maybe even have the serial number off the missile. We'll know a lot of things. We'll probably bring Ukraine in on this, obviously. But right now, they have to get the information on the ground and the information from higher-level intelligence that would be collected about this. Is it possible that a Russian missile could have been fired from Belarus, an air defense missile used in the ground attack mode and -- yes, it is theoretically possible. But, you know, we have to look at the evidence on this and that's what United States is helping Poland do right now.",

And we know Lviv was under attack yesterday. It's possible this missile was aimed to intercept a cruise missile and some -- for some reason, it went off course.How is that possible? That's a function of the technology of the missile, the electromagnetic environment at the time, the training of the teams that fired it, and so all of that has to be worked down. You can be sure that there's a lot going on in the Ukrainian air defense chain of command right now accounting for every missile that was fired and what happened and how this could have happened. So just going to have to wait for the results of the investigation.",

I think what you heard from Secretary Austin and General Milley today, is a very, very strong, very forthright statement of the U.S. and NATO positions.Namely, that we're going to continue to support Ukraine as long as necessary and the phrase Ukraine's territorial integrity was in there and emphasized. This means Crimea. This means not going back to the February 24th positions just before the latest round of the conflict started, but all of Ukraine's territory. And so it was made abundantly clear today, and as Secretary Austin said, remarkable consensus from the NATO ministers. So I think that if Russia is watching this, which I'm sure they are, they should understand that this little tweak that happened, even if Russia had nothing whatsoever to do with it, it's a good indicator of NATO's resolve, the NATO nations led by the United States, are not about to back off. General Milley explained what he meant when he said last week that there could be negotiations. Sure. When you start to get the military momentum, yes, you can start talking about it. But that's talking. Nothing wrong with talking. That's a far cry from telling the Ukrainians what they have to do to stop fighting. And as the United States has made clear, from President Biden on down, Ukraine is going to decide when it wants to stop fighting.",
