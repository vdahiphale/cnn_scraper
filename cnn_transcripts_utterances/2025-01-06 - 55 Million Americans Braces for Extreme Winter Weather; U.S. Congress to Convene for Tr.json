Wintry thunderstorms have been hitting parts of Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, too. Roads in the region are covered in thick layers of ice, causing numerous accidents over the weekend. The mayor of Washington, D.C., has declared a snow emergency as the district prepares for several major events, including the certification of the presidential election and funeral services for former President Jimmy Carter. Some places could see more than 16 inches or 40 centimeters of snow as the system continues to move eastwards. On Saturday, CNN spoke with the mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, who discussed how the state is preparing for the peak snowfall expected later today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR CRAIG GREENBERG (D), LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: This has been a significant storm for us. We haven't seen this much snow in about a decade in Louisville, and it still continues. We're expecting snow tomorrow morning. So, our main focus is two areas. One, the roads, making sure we continue to work through the night to keep the roads clear. We're encouraging people to stay home, to stay warm, stay informed, and also power outages. Our local electricity company here, LG&amp;E, they've got a thousand people on standby that are ready. With respect to the roads, we've been plowing and salting the roads all day. We have over 200 people that are working hard on our snow team across the entire city. We're going to keep at it. With the freezing temperatures that are projected for the entire week, this is a particularly challenging storm, but we're going to stay at it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
