Now, we may see the same argument used in the classified documents case down in Florida, but in this case, Trump was out of the White House, no longer president of the United States, when he had that classified material that he refused to return to the federal government. CNN's Paula Reid is tracking that story for us in Stewart, Florida.Paula, obviously, tomorrow is going to be a big day in federal court. I think it's important because we talked so much about all of the different Trump cases that obviously we're covering very closely. We haven't talked about the classified documents case in a moment.

Now, he is currently scheduled to be tried on charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents in late May, May 20. But it was widely expected that the judge, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, that she likely pushed that back. And tomorrow, she has asked the parties to come to court ready to discuss scheduling. Trump lawyers have been pushing for additional time for discovery and some other matters.So we're going to be watching very closely tomorrow at court all day to see does she push this back. If she does, how far does she also leave the door open, as she's done in the past, to maybe pushing it back again? Because at this point, Kaitlan, it's unclear if Trump will face either one of his federal criminal trials because, of course, yesterday the Supreme Court agreed to keep his January 6 election subversion case on hold while they contemplate and hear oral arguments in two months on the issue of immunity. Now, in addition to scheduling tomorrow, they're also going to handle some other matters, like, for example, what they can put on a jury questionnaire. The Justice Department wants to be able to ask prospective jurors if they believe the 2020 election was stolen. As Trump lawyers, they want to be able to ask if people voted and what their party affiliation is. So a lot to sort out there potentially. And then the Justice Department also bringing up another really serious issue, which is intimidation and harassment of witnesses and people involved in this case. Of course, that's something we've seen across so many of the Trump cases, threats against witnesses, judges, prosecutors. So we'll see how the judge addresses that tomorrow. But the big issue, the thing we'll be going to watch all day and be reporting live is on timing, because, again, timing is right now the biggest issue when it comes to Trump's criminal cases.",

And that case is expected to go until mid-May.

ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF N.Y.: Yes. So, I'm looking for the moving chess pieces here because I think a strategy, and we've had reporting to this effect that Donald Trump's team is going to use here is to try to move the Mar-a-Lago trial so that it blocks any possibility of the Washington, D.C. trial making it onto the calendar before the election. Here's what I mean. The current date for the Mar-a-Lago trial is late May, May 20. If they can get that pushback to, let's say, July, now, you're looking at the Florida, the Mar-a-Lago case blocking July, August, September, that just leaves nowhere for Jack Smith's other case, the D.C. case, to go.

The D.C. case, the January 6 case is more complicated and a little bit of a messier fit. But your jury pool, if you're Donald Trump's team, is so much better in Florida. I mean, Donald Trump won Florida. Even if you're drawing a jury only from the southern counties, he got 40 percent, 45 percent. You're going to have a way better jury pull.

And of course, I think you would be prejudiced if you're on a jury pool and you're ruling on this if you think that, in fact, the election was stolen.It makes sense. Donald Trump is most fearful for January 6 because he thinks it can move the quickest. He thinks there is that small possibility there could be a conviction before Election Day. And that is the one that I think resonates with voters the most, that it could actually sway Republicans from voting from. COLLINS: Elie, as we've been reeling from what we learned yesterday from the Supreme Court, something that Peter Baker, who is the chief White House correspondent for the \"New York Times,\" posted today, stood out to me. He said the days between the district court ruling for Nixon and the Supreme, Nixon against Nixon, and when the Supreme Court arguments actually happened, 49 days. The days between the district court ruling against Trump and the Supreme Court arguments hearing appeal, 143 days. A lot of people are looking at the timing here.",

I think the response would be, we are still on a relatively fast track here when it comes to the immunity case. Joan Biskupic, our expert, wrote that this morning for CNN. And normally a Supreme Court case would take even more time.There are differences between the Watergate scenario and this scenario. The Watergate scenario, the time pressure there was Richard Nixon had already won his second term. He wasn't up for an election. There was no looming election. The concern was we have a criminal investigation of the guy in the White House. Here, the concern is really more political. The concern is, well, we have a looming election and how might this trial impact the election? And I think there's an argument that it is appropriate for prosecutors and courts to consider the former situation. But once you get into the game of judges and prosecutors thinking about, well, there's an election day and how should we play this?

But what I've heard from the Trump folks is they very much know they're going to lose on immunity, but they're still counting this as a victory because it gives them more time. And it just gives them a bit more time that could potentially be pushed past the election.

The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza says that more than 110 people have been killed, at least 760 injured, after Israeli forces opened fire, causing aid trucks to run people over. The IDF giving a starkly different account, saying that their troops opened fire, but that most were killed or injured from a stampede several hundred yards away. That contradicts what one eyewitness told CNN about how all this chaos unfolded. I should note, CNN cannot independently confirm the figures.For more of what we do know, CNN's Jeremy Diamond has this report on the deadly incident that has many, questioning what this impact -- what impact this could have on a potential ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Around 4:00 in the morning, thousands of Palestinians are already camped out by the coastal road in western Gaza City. Humanitarian aid trucks are reportedly en route, a rarity in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands are now on the brink of famine. As the convoy passes an Israeli military checkpoint and enters Gaza city, hundreds desperate for food swarm the trucks, as seen in this drone video released by the Israeli military. Many climb onto the trucks, grabbing what they can, when suddenly the Israeli military opens fire, killing and wounding about 20 people in the crowd, according to local journalist Hadar al Zanun (ph), who was on the scene. Pandemonium ensues. As people run away, eyewitnesses say the truck drivers speed off, killing dozens more people. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says at least 104 people were killed altogether and more than 700 injured. CNN is unable to independently confirm those numbers. The Israeli military acknowledges its troops shot people near the convoy, but says the gunfire was unrelated and came after people were already killed in a stampede. LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: In a second event, in a short distance away, we also had a group of people that approached the military forces in a war zone. The forces opened fire in the air to distance them, warning fire in order to get people out of harm's way. Unfortunately, they proceeded to advance and indeed they're a perceived threat, and the forces opened fire. Of course, I will say we're continuing to investigate, continuing to inquire in our after actions activities. DIAMOND (voice-over): That account contradicted by eyewitnesses who say Israeli gunfire triggered the mass panic. NEMA ABU SULTAN, EYEWITNESS (through translator): Our children die of hunger. They went to get a bag of flour in order to feed their children. Some were run over, others were shot. So they send us the aid so that the Israelis can keep shooting at our children. This is wrong. This is not right. This is not right. DIAMOND (voice-over): The latest victims killed on a day when the death toll in Gaza surpassed 30,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, a majority of whom are women and children. More may soon die of starvation as the World Food Program warns that more than half a million Gazans are on the brink of famine.",

He went to get a bit of bread, a bag of flour for his family displaced at the schools in Jabalia camp. Now he lies dead, killed while trying to survive. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on camera): And Kaitlan, the critical backdrop to all of this are those ongoing negotiations to try and obtain a temporary ceasefire in Gaza. This incident, of course, highlights the need for that ceasefire to get more aid into Gaza, but it could also impact those negotiations. Today, President Biden saying that he is certain that it will impact those talks. And a senior Hamas member this evening offering a warning, saying that they will not allow these negotiations to become a cover for what they call the continued crimes against our people. Kaitlan?",

The Democrats like to say Biden is OK. And I don't like Donald Trump.The interesting part with several of the Democrats, even Biden fans do say in conversations with some of their friends who are, you know, in their 60s, in their 70s, in their 80s. Some of their friends are worried about it. They do say that. So that's worth watching. And this is just -- it's a critical place in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And it's a critical constituency. Hillary Clinton lost some voters over 65 by 10 points to Donald Trump in 2016. She lost Northampton County, she lost Pennsylvania and she lost the presidency. Joe Biden also lost senior citizens those over 65, but only by seven points in Pennsylvania. Close races are one on the margins, right? So you don't necessarily have to win a voting bloc, but sometimes if you can lose it by a smaller margin, as Joe Biden did in 2020, won Northampton County, won Pennsylvania and he's the President. So they're worth watching through November.",

Meanwhile, former President Trump there stoking fears about migrants while blaming the president for what's happening in illegal border crossings.Joining me now is Republican strategist Lee Carter and former Democratic Congressman Max Rose. So let's talk about what we saw on the border today, because obviously, it's this kind of splitscreen political moment. I think what it clearly is, is a recognition from both of them that this is going to be a huge issue. But when you hear Trump's remarks today, going after this, but he's also going, you know, saying things that he has about the border of war, that aren't true talking about, you know, other governments that are always unnamed dumping their jails and mental institutions, sending those people across the border. The border is a legitimate issue. So why does he have to also make up lies that go in his speech to kind of inflame the issue? LEE CARTER, FORMER REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; POLLSTER: I mean, maybe he doesn't think he's lying. Maybe you think he's just talking big, I don't know. He's -- he has this way of rhetoric, I don't want to justify it, I'm not saying that he's not, he talks big. He talks a big game. And he's talking to what people are really afraid of right now? He pumps them up. And it just makes them more and more afraid, and more and more excited about his candidacy. And it just -- COLLINS: But even though half of some of what he says is not true. I mean, you could just talk about the numbers themselves and say, you know, this is an issue, this is an issue. And those were all being true and legitimate things.

One is their position and policies. And on foreign policy, I'm not aligned with Donald Trump, at least as I understand his policy. And domestic policy, yeah, I aligned with many of his domestic policies. But there's another dimension besides policy, and that's character. And I think what America is, as a nation, what has allowed us to be the most powerful nation on Earth, and the leader of the Earth is the character of the people who have been our leaders, past presidents, but also mothers, fathers, church leaders, university presidents, and so forth.
