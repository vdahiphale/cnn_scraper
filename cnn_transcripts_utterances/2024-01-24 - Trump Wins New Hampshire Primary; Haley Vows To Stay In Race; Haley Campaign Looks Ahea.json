The former President coastedto an easy win in the Granite State primary on the heels of a similarly easy win in Iowa. His path to the Republican nomination looking more certain than ever. Plus, Nikki Haley just released her first campaign ads in South Carolina. Can she overcome Trump's massive polling lead in her own home state? I'll be joined by the co-chair of President Biden's reelection efforts, Senator Chris Coons. Is the Biden campaign ready for likely Trump rematch? Good day, everyone. I'm Audie Cornish, in for Kasie Hunt, to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in New York, Wednesday, January 24. And there are 10 days until the South Carolina Democratic primary, 31 days until the Republican contest there, and only 285 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. As it stands now, Donald Trump is two for two in his quest to capture the Republican presidential nomination after scoring a decisive victory in the New Hampshire primary. However, Nikki Haley promises to fight on. And it was a double-digit win last night for Trump. He picked up more than 54 percent of the vote. That's compared to Haley's 43 percent. And after his win, the former President -- after his win in Iowa, the former President had struck sort of a conciliatory tone. Last night was different. Instead of celebrating, sources describe him as seething over Haley's refusal to drop out of the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory? She did very poorly, actually. Just a little note to Nikki. She is not going to win. When I watched her, the fancy dress that probably wasn't so fancy, come up, I said, what is she doing? We won. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kristen, we've talked a lot aboutsort of how Trump and his whole world is looking ahead to a possible next term. And one of the things that was interesting last night was like who was on stage with him? Can you talk more? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. I mean, look, it was the who's who of Trump world, and now the modern Trump world, which has adapted since the last time he was in office. We saw Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy. He was there with his son Eric Trump, and Laura. Notably missing, Melania, his wife, as well as his daughter Ivanka, and Jared, who have taken a backseat this campaign. There has been a lot of questions and speculation about who would be in the next Trump administration. But, one thing that is clear is that Donald Trump values loyalty. And these are the people who have pledged their loyalty to him, some of them like Marjorie Taylor Greene or Kari Lake back in 2022 when it was much harder for Donald Trump to get endorsements when a lot of Republicans were shying away from the former President. So, you're looking at a lot of kind of jockeying for future administration positions as well as that speculation around Vice President. But, his team really isn't there yet. They're not doing any sort of officials vetting. They're not talking to anyone. And part of that is because Donald Trump himself had told them not to do so until he had secured at least two of these contests. Now, he has. So, we should see some movement in that area. But, right now, it's still kind of just trying to get through this primary season and pivot to the general election.",

DIR., NEW YORK STATE DEMOCRATIC PARTY: Well, there is one element of it that I think might be concerning to Democrats, which is that a good chunk of this country doesn't want to see the rematch. I think she is right in that regard, that a lot of American voters don't want to see a rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But, I do believe that a lot of these attacks on Donald Trump, for example, including talking about his mental stability and his age, contribute to the fact that Donald Trump is seething that she won't get out of the race. So, I think he sees that as a lack of loyalty, a lack of fealty to him, given all that he may have done for her and her career, as he sees it. So, I do think that the doubling down on the attacks against him may have worked a month ago, six months ago, but at the -- after New Hampshire, going into South Carolina, even though she is up on streaming platforms, apparently, I just don't think it has the effect that it would in trying to make this about a moderate against a conservative in Donald Trump.",

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN, GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION, &amp; FORMER SPOKESMAN, INDIANA REPUBLICAN PARTY: Well, first off, as a millennial, the generational argument speaks to my heart and to my mind. Unfortunately, for Nikki Haley, it's not speaking to voters. They may say in polling that they're concerned about the age of Joe Biden, which they should be, and potentially Donald Trump, which they probably should be too. But, so far, we're not seeing that reflected in the actual voting data, in election night data. Now, Nikki Haley going to South Carolina, a candidate's home state should be like the free space on a bingo card. She shouldn't have to spend that much money to do well in her home state. But, if you look at the score card, the endorsements are going to Donald Trump. 13 members of Congress, the governor, statewide elected officials are with Trump. Only one is with Nikki Haley. She is running ads, reminding South Carolinians what she has done. And that's a problem that she has to pick up.",

They say that Trump's, what they call, extremist policies, and the fact that he continues to deny the election, that is not going to get the voters back that Trump lost in 2020. So, they feel that Trump has a really uphill battle in rebuilding that coalition that can win him a national election. We just got off a call with Biden campaign officials about an hour or so ago, and they say that, look, in Iowa, Donald Trump performed worse amongst suburban and college-educated Republicans. They look towards other sorts of sectors of the voting electorate that say that Donald Trump is actually doing worse on that they will -- that he would need in general.

And that's an important matchup for Biden and the Democrats. It's a clear contrast that the Democrats have. And if you listen to what the Democrats have been saying, particularly Biden and Harris in the last few days, they've been really talking a lot about reproductive rights. The Biden campaign and Biden himself was in South Carolina, for example. So, every step that they're making right now is a look toward the general election. It is presenting a clear contrast with Donald Trump and Donald Trump supporters, and has the -- and it has the ability to say, for example, to suburban voters that you want stability, you want good governance, but you also don't want your rights to continuously be abrogated and pulled back.

So, I do think it's been really vexing for a lot of Democratic mayors in cities. But, what the Biden administration has done is quietly said to them, look, we will find ways to solve this issue. We will create a liaison with the Homeland Security for your city to try to get you support, to try to expedite some of these hearings. I think the governors of individual states have also stepped in a little bit more. That friendly fire, if you will, is not good for the administration. But, I do think that over time, the issue itself will subside as a sort of broader issue for the electorate, but it will be a proxy for other things, for example.

And it comes as both Biden and Trump will be trying to make \"working class blue collar voters\" a focal point of their campaigns. That is something Biden has tried to stress over and over when he touts himself as the most pro-union President. You've also seen former President Donald Trump trying to win back some of those working class voters, particularly in the Midwest, disaffected voters who feel that the Democratic Party has not done enough to help them. But, this UAW endorsement wasn't always a given. They had been withholding this endorsement for quite some time, expressing some concerns about the fact that Biden's energy policies were helping to transition, the transition to clean energy and electric vehicles. You have heard Shawn Fain, the UAW President, speak out quite forcefully, saying that he believes that a Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster. Ultimately, Biden did stand shoulder to shoulder with the UAW as they were in those contract negotiations with the big three auto companies. But, one really big question going forward is, how much of this endorsement will matter? If you're getting the union leaders all on board with Biden, is this something that will actually trickle down to the rank and file members within the union? That is a play that Trump is trying to make towards those working class, everyday union members. But, if you take a look at a state like Michigan, and you look at the support from back in 2020, about 67 percent of union households backed Biden and 36 percent backed Trump. So, that is something that Biden is hoping to replicate heading into 2024. But, there are still really big questions whether Trump might be successful in wooing those working class voters, especially when you think of states in the blue wall, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",

And that's the argument that Donald Trump, that Republicans are going to make. Joe Biden supports neutrality agreements. He wants to muzzle employers from talking to their employees during unionization talks, and he is going to do everything he can to tilt things in favor of unions.
