It's now just three days away.And candidates are blanketing their states making their final pitches to voters. Several key races to watch. Today, many eyes are on Pennsylvania which could play a pivotal role for control in Washington. Democrat John Fetterman taking on Republican Mehmet Oz in a neck and neck contest and they're pulling out all the political firepower. A total of three presidents holding events across the state of Pennsylvania. President Biden and former President Obama holding campaign stops for Fetterman while former President Trump is something for Oz. CNN's Jessica Dean and Arlette Saenz are following the latest on the trail. Jessica, you first. You were in Pittsburgh. This is a critical stretch for both of Pennsylvania's senate candidates.",

Fetterman needs a big turnout in Pittsburgh and the surrounding area if he is going to win statewide on Tuesday and that is why we are seeing the former president here. And Fetterman speaking before Obama kind of sharpening his attack on Oz. Listen to this.

Now, the president has also been trying to strike an optimistic tone saying that he does believe that they'll be winning in the House and Senate come Tuesday.And over the course of the next few days, he has a series of events where he's going to be stumping for candidates starting this afternoon when he links up with his former boss, President Obama over in Philadelphia to campaign for John Fetterman. That's one of the few competitive senate races that the president has gotten into in this closing week of the election. And then tomorrow, he's heading over to New York for a last-minute stop with the state's Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul Cole who is in a much closer than expected race against a Republican challenger Lee Zeldin. The White House over the course of the past week has also been focusing on some of those blue states where democrats are vulnerable in their races as they're trying to ensure that they have as many democratic governors in state houses across the country to help enact their agenda. The president really has been trying to frame this all -- this election as a choice and not a referendum on his -- on democrat's agenda or his time in office.

And just the degree to which the economy has driven so much has been -- has been interesting, Fred. I mean, as we've seen over the year, you know, abortion rights has become an issue, certainly at times, threats to democracy have been certainly a concern in a lot of states. But we've been doing now these focus groups with voters about three a month in battleground states. And repeatedly, what keeps coming up for voters is a sense that they want the government, whether it's Washington or state capitals to do something about the economy, and skepticism about whether the Democrats can really make change happen in the economy.",

Does Washington ever actually sort of do things that has an effect on my pocketbook?And so, I think that they hear these things, especially in a campaign season, but if they're not feeling them directly and if they don't trust that the Democrats have been running all of government for the past two years and that things have gotten a lot harder for at least a good number of voters.

A sense of our democracy, something that all of us are taught about as children, something that we're allowed to vote, you know, we become citizens as we -- as we get older, but sort of a sense of either, for some voters kind of mistrust that leaders believe in democracy and are going to defend it.And for a lot of other voters, Fred, just a real sense that democracy and threats to democracy are just not something that they care about in their bones in the way that they feel like elites on some of the coasts of America talk about it. They want -- so we talked to one woman in Arizona as you noted in that focus group who said, you know, I live by the border. It is so bad here in terms of the economy, job opportunities, immigration, people coming over. I hear all of this talk about threats to democracy.

And I wonder if he's also giving a cue, perhaps to other Democrats about, you know, the issue is -- an -- the economic issue is a consequence of the legacy of the pandemic. And what voters want to hear and this is what Obama said, he said, voters want to hear what you're going to do about it. And when you just now talked about that voter, you know, and she's voting based on what the solution is what's going to be done.

People do talk here and there about the long tail of the pandemic, but people are really voting and I think moved by what they're feeling right now by those monthly bills in October as they go to do early voting.But I think there is a sense and if President Biden had maybe the communication skills or leaders in the Democratic Party were able to sometimes talk the way that President Obama can as you sort of noted. It may be more convincing to voters to understand that what they're -- that what they're going through now economically isn't because of some policy that President Biden passed a year ago. It's because of a very sort of long tail, frankly, that could go back to the, you know, the Great Recession in 2008.

So I think that's going to happen. But as Special Counsel, I think the purpose there is really to insulate the Justice Department and the political appointees to the top from this decision this way. You know, there's somebody who's not up directly appointed by Biden who would make that decision in the first instance.

And while Johnson did commit to accepting the results of the 2020 election, he didn't dispute anything there. Of course, hearing this answer this time around, sets off another set of concerns. On his front, though he did cite a case out of Milwaukee which is an election official, and now former election official that was criminally charged for allegedly obtaining military ballots for fake voters, allegedly to make a point. Now, Wisconsin election officials say well, this played out exactly how it's designed because this person was actually caught. It does not give out any sense of widespread voter fraud.
