He wants us to be talking about him today all day long.And the reality is, many Republicans across the country do not want him to get back in. Because they were ready to turn the page on Donald Trump. They were ready to put him in the rearview mirror. And then he has re-emerged himself after the Mar-a-Lago searches came about. But the truth is, Republicans have done well to date. And polling looks like we'll do well on Election Day because Donald Trump is not in the picture. Because we were not constantly talking about his tweets and his comments and his actions. Republicans were able to focus on the policies that were important to the American people. Top of mind, immigration, inflation, crime, and issues that people are really concerned with. We were fortunate that Republicans across the board focus on issues that were important to them. The Democrats tended to have the eye off the ball, focusing on other issues that weren't top of mind. But I can tell you this. There are a lot of Republicans that are hoping we can at least get through Election Day without Donald Trump putting his name in the mix because we're poised to do well on Election Day. But regardless of what the numbers are -- (CROSSTALK) STEWART: -- regardless of what the polls show, everyone should get out and vote.

It may be confusing for some voters to tell them apart.CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is here to help break it all down for us. What can people be looking out for tomorrow? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's going to be a really messier-than-normal few days on social media. What we have seen from the past few elections days is that sometimes people post things from polling stations they misunderstand. They misunderstand how to use a voting machine. They'll post it and that could inadvertently cause a kind of panic. But what we're also seeing is people creating videos, images deliberately to try and undermine people's trust in the election process. And I want to show you an example from 2020. There was a video that purported to show ballots for Trump being set on fire. And they went viral during election week. It was actually retweeted by the then- president's son, Eric Trump. And just to give you an example of how quickly that caught on, a day or two after the election, we were down in Harrisburg in Pennsylvania, at one of the first \"Stop the Steal\" events. And one woman, who said she didn't trust the results of the election, this is actually one of the first things she referenced. And we spoke to her about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
