Questions mount over a deadly operation to rescue four Israeli hostages held in Gaza. We are live in Tel Aviv with the latest here. Plus, the new rise of Europe's far right, right-wing parties see a surge of support in parliamentary elections. But, the European Commission President assuring, quote, \"the center is holding\". And Hunter Biden's defense team just decided that the President's son will not testify at his gun trial. We are live outside the courthouse with the very latest here. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that the best way to get all the hostages in Gaza back home is through a proposal, a ceasefire proposal that is now on the table. Blinken landed in Israel a short time ago to his second stop of his four-nation regional tour. He is expected to meet soon with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Mr. Netanyahu still under political pressure at home after a key member of his war cabinet resigned. That pressure despite a dramatic raid that rescued four Israeli hostages. Earlier, Secretary of State Blinken met with Egypt's President in Cairo. Egypt is one of the main mediators trying to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Blinken is urging Hamas to accept the proposal. But, he also says that it's critical that there are plans in place for the day after the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: In the absence of those plans, then one of three things. Either Israel would have to stay, which it says it doesn't want to do and we believe it must not do and would be left holding the bag in Gaza and would probably have a major insurgency on his hands for years to come, or in the absence of a plan, it leaves, Hamas returns; or we have a total vacuum, and you just have chaos, lawlessness, criminality, jihadist groups, etcetera. So, it's imperative that there be a plan, and that has to involve security, it has to involve governance, it has to involve reconstruction. (END VIDEO CLIP) SOLOMON: Now, the shakeup in Israel's war cabinet could lead Prime Minister Netanyahu more reliant on far-right members who have threatened to bring down his government if he accepts the latest ceasefire proposal. Former Defense Minister Benny Gantz resigned Sunday, accusing Mr. Netanyahu of lacking a clear war strategy. That announcement was originally scheduled for Saturday, but it was postponed, given the dramatic rescue operation in Gaza that we just spoke about. We're learning much more about that read today that freed four hostages who had spent eight months in captivity. Joyous and emotional reunions with family members now dominating the airwaves in Israel. Listen to the mother of one of the freed hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said to Benjamin Netanyahu that there were conditions for him to stay in the government. There needed to be a day-after plan, which incidentally many other countries are calling for as well, which Netanyahu has been very vague about in recent months. He says there has to be a decisive plan to get the hostages out. He is a true supporter of this deal that's on the table that at this point for a hostage deal with Hamas, and he said there has to be some kind of calm on the northern border with southern Lebanon so that tens of thousands of residents can return home. None of those conditions, he says, were met. So, that is why he had to pull out of the emergency government.It doesn't collapse the government. Netanyahu still has a majority. But, Gantz was really seen as a counterweight to the more far-right elements in his coalition. So, there is a concern that this far-right government could become even more influenced by those extreme views at this point. There are also, of course, concerns about what his departure means for a potential hostage deal as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, this proposal put forth by President Biden on the 31st of May is mired in ambiguity, frankly. On the one hand, the war cabinet in Israel has authorized the deal. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not explicitly endorsed it. And of course, with the withdrawal of Benny Gantz from that war cabinet, he is under more intense pressure from the extremist elements in his government who don't want any sort of deal that leads to a permanent ceasefire. And Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it clear that his ultimate goal after the release of the hostages is the complete destruction of Hamas.Now, Hamas, for its part today, there was a meeting in Doha, Qatar, between leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and they stressed that they have yet to reject the deal, but they haven't agreed to it either. They said that they're looking for a permanent ceasefire, a total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, a lifting of the siege, which we're talking about a siege, basically a closure of Gaza that goes back to June 2007 when Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, in addition to a comprehensive prisoner exchange. Both sides, there seems to be a wide gap between the two. Now, Mr. Blinken is now on his eighth visit to the region in the last eight months, and what we -- and we -- it's not at all clear whether he will encounter any success. We know that William Burns, the head of the CIA, was recently in the Qatar. That trip was inconclusive. Brett McGurk, the Middle East Coordinator for the White House, was in Cairo. No results from that trip as well. So, short of any progress at this point. It appears that Biden's initiative at the moment doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Rahel.",

Knesset arithmetic is the key here. 120 seats in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, you need 60 plus one to govern. The Netanyahu government even minus Benny Gantz's National Unity Party has 64 seats. And it's a very cohesive coalition, two ultra-religious parties, two messianic Zionist parties, and Mr. Netanyahu's party, the Likud, which is still the most dominant coherent and cohesive party in Israel, and it does not -- Likud does not have a history of devouring zone.So, right now, Mr. Netanyahu, I think, is actually quite secure. I think his goal, Knesset goes into recess on July 25. It does not come back until 10 days before the U.S. election. I think his goal basically is to buy time. Maybe they'll free more hostages. Maybe they'll locate Yahya Sinwar and kill him. Maybe it will be some other success. But, I think Mr. Netanyahu wants to direct to draw this out and probably make a judgment on who the next President of the United States is going to be. And I know he cannot vote in America. But, one thing I'm pretty sure, he isn't going to be voting for Joe Biden.",

      "sentences": "Well, the calculation what the Elysee Palace, what people around Emmanuel Macron say officially is that they've heard the anger of the people in that vote. Remember that the far right scored double what Emmanuel Macron's party scored in these European elections, and that they want now to put to the peak, give the people the opportunity to express themselves at a national level.But, just to your question of the calculation, clearly, this is a gamble that is designed if it goes Emmanuel Macron's way to take the sales out of the far right ahead of the next presidential election. That'll be in 2027. If he is wrong, though, and in his upcoming parliamentary elections, he fails to get the traditional parties to rally around his party and the far right go ahead and take the biggest majority, have the next Prime Minister, the next Prime Minister that could be coming in the shape of the far right, that could lead to, if his calculation is correct, the paralysis, the chaos, the anger in the country that will lead people not to want to vote for them at a presidential level. But, it could of course go the other way, and there are many people around him and here in France that were extremely surprised by the decision. Clearly, if the National Rally does as well as it did in European polls in these forthcoming parliamentary elections, that will lead to a period of what the French call cohabitation, which means that President Macron will be governing with a far-right Prime Minister, depending on how the vote goes, and that could lead to more difficulty than he has had still, since the start of his second term, in getting legislation through and certainly will change the way he is able to govern. It will also likely have implications, Rahel, for the position France has as a leading motor of the European Union.",

Remember that a lot of these parties are more or less Euroskeptic. A lot of them believe in a return of power to within the national boundaries of the member states. So, there is an existential question there about how the European Union functions, how much power it has going forward, and their ability, according, again to their levels of Euroscepticism to get in its way up.But then, there is also, for instance, on the question of Russia and Ukraine, a wide variety of views inside these far -- this new second far-right bloc, the second largest in European Parliament. Some of them are much closer to Moscow. Some are much more clearly calling for an end to the help in Ukraine. But again, at a very fundamental level, the positions of the European Union will be brought into question by this larger presence within the European Parliament. Now, one of the first jobs of the year -- of MEPs is going to be to vote for the new European Commission, President Ursula von der Leyen standing for reelection. Her party, her bloc has come out the great winner, the central right of these elections. So, she has a good chance of winning the second term that she seeks. Of course, there is a lot of executive power in her hands. And yet, a parliament made up of central right and a substantial far right bloc does change on a number of different questions, no doubt, things like the European Union's approach to things like immigration policy, climate change. There will be on specific policies, no doubt going forward, a different hue and perhaps less ability to push ambitious legislation through, Rahel.",

And if you look at a country such as Spain, for example, which also has a fairly strong far-right party known as Vox, they didn't do as well because this debate over migration has not been as present over the last couple of years. So, I think that's a big issue.There is also some lingering sort of frustration over COVID and the way that was handled in some of these countries. And the other big issue, I think, in a lot of places is the climate policies of the European Union, what they call the Green Deal that was pushed through by Ursula von der Leyen's Commission. And there is a lot of concern about a plan, in particular, to get rid of the internal combustion engine, in other words, to get rid of fuel-burning cars, and that's something that the far right has seized on.",

Some of these parties tend to be more pro-American. Some look more to Russia and China. The one issue that does unite them is migration.And there is also a general sort of Euroscepticism, as we just heard, that runs through these parties, and in a sort of sense that more power should be given back to the national capitals. But, at the end of the day, I think for a lot of these far-right leaders, people like Viktor Orban in Hungary, for example, what they really want from the EU is money, because they are not doing as well economically as their populations would like, and they do get a lot of money from the EU.

It's pared back some of those losses. But, we're seeing a much bigger reaction in France, given they have now called for a snap election. Now, French bond yields, which is borrowing costs, have spiked.And if we delve a bit deeper into some of the stocks on the Paris, CAC quarante, you saw some steep losses, particularly from banking stocks like BNP Paribas and Societe Generale. Both of those bank stocks were down more than five percent earlier today. And the pain also spread to big group, LVMH as well. So, we really saw quite a big sell-off. Now, the question is, why? Why would the announcement of a sudden French election cause such angst among investors looking at France right now? And the situation really is, Rahel, that there was a problem even before this weekend. France has a big debt problem. In fact, at the end of last month, the credit rating agency S&amp;P actually downgraded France's long-term credit rating because of its ballooning debts. Just to give you some numbers, the government debt burden in France stood at 110 percent at the end of last year. That's actually the third highest in the Eurozone. It comes after Greece and Italy. The budget deficit, it was around 5.5 percent earlier this year. So, it's got a lot of problems to deal with, and potentially a President who is going to lose control of parliament, maybe have a hostile parliament in charge.

She was trying to place Hunter Biden at a 7-Eleven store here in Wilmington, where he claimed around the time that he bought that gun that he was meeting with a drug dealer. They probably brought her back because the defense had tried to poke some holes in that theory. They said, maybe this drug dealer doesn't exist.

He lives in a triplex at the top of a building with his name on it. He has no criminal record. And yet, like many other defendants, he does have multiple other open felony cases.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

Passengers on an Austrian Airlines flight are safely back on the ground after officials say that their plane hit a thunderstorm cell. You can see just how much damage, and those were the planes, sustained on Sunday's flight from Spain to Austria. The airline says it was pummeled by hail. All 173 passengers and six crew members arrived safely in Vienna. Well, Ukraine's military says that it has destroyed an advanced Russian fighter jet with a drone attack. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency says that they hit the Su-57 on the tarmac of a Russian airbase. This attack is said to have occurred 372 miles or nearly 600 kilometers behind Russian frontlines. The Russian plane is a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet. And a new wave of balloons filled with trash came floating across the border from North Korea to the South over the weekend. At the same time, a cross-border loudspeaker battle also heating up. CNN's Mike Valerio has the latest from Seoul. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

A little later today, the tech giant is expected to announce a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and unveil its first generative AI tools for iPhones. Now, the tools will likely most benefit the Siri personal assistant feature. All this comes just after chipmaker Nvidia surpassed Apple as the world's second most valuable company.Joining us now is CNN Technology Reporter Brian Fung. So, Brian, what do we know about what these Apple AI features might look like? What they might sound like? What do we know?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. There -- that's a great question, and there are a couple of reasons. One is, as you indicated, Nvidia's market cap has surged to beyond Apple's. I think they're really feeling the heat here, feeling some pressure that they need to make some progress on AI, especially as rivals like Google and Microsoft have announced their own generative AI tools and features in their own software. And so, Apple has historically not been really a leader on a lot of technologies, but has always introduced sort of the most robust and most privacy and security conscious type features when it comes to rolling out new technologies.So, they're really kind of up against the gun here, needing to impress investors and make sure that consumers feel confident that when they buy their next iPhone or what have you, it's going to be the best AI product on the market.

We'll see you soon.All right. Let's take a look at the broader markets both here in the U.S. and around the world. U.S. markets are mixed. The Dow Jones is off, but fractionally barely. The NASDAQ is up three tenth of a percent, and the S&amp;P is also up about one tenth of one percent. A few things to watch this week in the U.S. economy, Wednesday, Wednesday is the big day this week. Wednesday, we get a key inflation report, the Consumer Price Index, and we also hear from the U.S. Federal Reserve, where they are largely expected to hold rates steady. But, we'll watch that space, nonetheless. We'll see if we get any surprises. And taking a look overseas, we'll pull up some of the other markets for you, Asian markets also mixed, the Nikkei closing up almost a percent, Hang Seng off about six tenth of a percent, the Shanghai Composite pretty much flat. And one quick look at Europe once again to see if things have turned around in the last 20 minutes or so. No. Paris still off, about 1.3 percent, DAX off about three tenths of a percent, and the FTSE 100 off about 0.2 percent. All right.
