It could dramatically change U.S. immigration law for the first time in decades.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will take the first procedural step today. But House Speaker Mike Johnson says it will be dead on arrival, tweeting, quote, \"I've seen enough. This bill is even worse than we expected.\" The $118 billion bipartisan package would empower the U.S. to significantly restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. It also includes critical aid for Ukraine and Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden says he strongly supports the deal. More now from CNN's Priscilla Alvarez who's following Joe Biden on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: President Joe Biden brought his general election argument to Nevada on Sunday as he tried to draw a connection between his administration's accomplishments and what voters are feeling in the state. Of course, it's an important state as the president stares down November, one that he only narrowly won in 2020 and especially important as polls show a close contest nationally between President Biden and his Republican opponent. Of course, all of this happening as news broke of a deal that was struck in the Senate that would address the U.S.-Mexico border. Only minutes before the White House releasing a statement saying the following, quote, \"for too long, going back decades, the immigration system has been broken. It's time to fix it.\" It goes on to say, \"now we've reached an agreement on a bipartisan national security deal that includes the toughest and fairest set of border reforms in decades. I strongly support it.\" Now, of course, White House officials had been involved in these ongoing talks to make major border policy changes. They include in this deal, for example, a new emergency authority that would give the president the ability to shut down the border if certain metrics are met while also expediting the asylum process. Now all of this is still up for debate and the Senate leader Chuck Schumer plans to set up a floor vote this week but already House Speaker Mike Johnson is coming out against it. Saying that even if it were to reach the House it would already be dead on arrival. Meaning that the future of this deal is still very much up in the air.

And they can't have this issue be resolved.If this issue is resolved, that doesn't bring that rallying cry of bringing people to the polls that Republicans need for this election. I mean, we found that in the 2022 midterms, Fox News was focusing constantly on this caravan of immigrants that were supposedly coming up from Latin America and bringing diseases and all kinds of other issues and problems. And then as soon as the midterms were over, they never focused on the caravan again. So, for Republicans, they feel that if they resolve this issue, that's going to take away one of the biggest things that galvanizes Republicans and those that are fearful of the immigration issue to vote for Republicans on election day.",

Now, for the Democrats, immigration is not the biggest issue. They're focusing on other things, and they're going to continue to be angered by the way the Republicans are behaving, particularly in the House on issues that are important to everyday Americans and the fact that they're basically paralyzing Congress so that it isn't doing anything. Now, the big question is how does this play with independents? And it's really hard to know. We do know that for independent voters, the most important issue is really the economy and not immigration, but immigration is important to some of them.

One of them is to try to ensure there is no escalation of the war, which is still very much focused on Israel and inside the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas.But as we've been seeing, has been heating up around the region, and in particular on the northern border between Israel and southern Lebanon, where Iran's most powerful proxy, Hezbollah, has been exchanging fire with Israel pretty much since the off. In fact, over the weekend, Israel is saying that it's hit more than 3,400 Hezbollah targets since October the 7th, and also more than 50 targets inside Syria, the 3,400 being in Lebanon. So, there are concerns that could still boil over into a full-blown war and obviously concerns in the rest of the region too. And that's why he's taking in all of these countries, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the West Bank as part of this trip. But as far as the Israel Hamas war in the Gaza Strip is concerned, his main objectives are to try to push along this idea, this framework deal that was thrashed out in Paris last week, which would see round about a six-week pause in fighting in exchange for a number of hostages who have now been in captivity after being abducted in that Hamas attack of October the 7th for over 120 days to try to facilitate this framework agreement. We'd see those hostages released in exchange for about three times the number of Palestinian prisoners along with this six-week pause and then have other phases that would see more hostages released for more Palestinian prisoners including IDF soldiers being freed, and also the bodies that Hamas is holding too. And those -- and that hostage issue is the key to the other main issues that are on Secretary of State Antony Blinken's agenda, namely to get more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and to get that humanitarian truce at least, or some kind of ceasefire in place inside the Gaza Strip. It's a very tall order, and he's got his work cut out if he wants to return to the United States with anything of substance, because of course there are concerns that the escalation isn't really within his power to stop, and certainly we seem to be at an impasse. As far as this hostage deal is concerned, with Hamas insisting that Israel not only ceasefire but that it withdraw completely from the Gaza Strip before it will entertain a hostage deal. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that they will not release thousands of terrorists, in his words, or do a deal at any cost. So that seems to be a bit of an impasse as well. But Secretary Blinken is in the region. He will be hoping to at least achieve some things, and to that end, at least there can perhaps be some optimism, Rosemary.",

The U.S. killed a major militia head in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, which created a lot of friction with the Iraqi government. So, I think these responses will have to up the game a little beyond that. So, I'm assuming they will try to target some pretty essential militia heads. But again, I think there's going to be an attempt to strike a balance and not lead to kind of a wider conflict, especially getting Iran into direct conflict with the United States. But again, it's very, very hard to contain and keep this calibrated and that is the constant worry.

The U.S. is still not backing a permanent ceasefire, which is what most of the region would like to see. But really, to end this war, there's going to have to be some diplomatic solution. The only release of hostages to date happened through diplomacy at the end of November. It cannot happen soon enough. This war is so devastating, even if we can keep it contained and controlled and not see it an all-out regional war. It has already been extremely costly, of course, in Gaza itself, but the wider region is already absolutely in turmoil.

A significant weekend for democracy on the continent, starting with the developments out of Senegal where President Macky Sall shocked the nation by postponing the elections. I'll get to that in a second, but first, Namibia rightfully earning a lot of international praise this morning for a peaceful transition, just hours after Dr. Hage Geingob died while receiving treatment for cancer in Windhoek in the capital.His deputy sworn in, Nangolo Mbumba as the interim president of Namibia, and he says he will not be running in the election in November. He intends to only serve out the rest of the term of the late Dr. Hage Geingob. He says his dream was just to be a school principal, and he's achieved way more than that. So, a sign of stability, but also a sign of maturity of the democracy of that Southern African nation. And his vice president now will be the ruling party candidate in the November election. So, she's on track to be the southern African nation's first female president if all goes according to the plan and according to the Constitution so far. But that is contrasted with Senegal, where President Macky Sall made this shock decision on Saturday. There's some background to this. The constitutional council recently excluded a number of prominent opposition candidates from being on the ballot, and some, at least one opposition party, had asked for the election to be postponed. But many see this as a constitutional coup. They think President Macky Sall does not have that authority to postpone the election. And that's why you saw these protests on the streets, people who are upset about that decision, and reports of at least one opposition candidate being arrested out of that. One media outlet had its signal cut off, signs of a true -- signs of true democratic backsliding in one of the most stable democracies in West Africa. Here was President Macky Sall announcing his decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACKY SALL, SENEGAL'S PRESIDENT (through translator): For my part, my solemn undertaking not to stand in the presidential election remains unchanged. I will initiate an open national dialogue to create the conditions for free, transparent and inclusive elections in a Senegal that is at peace and reconciled. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They declared 30-year-old Wyndham Clark the winner of the shortened tournament. Clark shot a course record 60 to move into the lead on Saturday. It's his third career tour win. The final round of play had been originally postponed until Monday but because of the ongoing severe weather PGA officials canceled out of an abundance of caution.Hong Kong's top sport official says the government made repeated requests for Lionel Messi to play in Sunday's match but he never entered the game and this was the reaction. Fans booed when the superstar failed to take the pitch during the match between his inter-Miami team and a group of local standouts. The Hong Kong government said the events organizer, Tatler, owes fans an explanation. Tatler expressed extreme disappointment but denied any pregame knowledge that the World Cup champion would not play. Inter- Miami's coach said Messi and another player sat out with injuries.
