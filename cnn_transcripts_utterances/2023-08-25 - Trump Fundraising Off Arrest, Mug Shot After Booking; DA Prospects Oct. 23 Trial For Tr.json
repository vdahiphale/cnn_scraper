Indeed Donald Trump use this photo almost from the moment the flash bulb went off, it is part of a new fundraising e-mail. He even posted it on Twitter or X or whatever it is, which is no small thing. This is his first post since he was banned from the platform after the insurrection.The Biden campaign since its own fundraising pitch overnight, titled apropos of nothing, and then said, I think today's a great day to give to my campaign. Now, they did not use the photo per se, but it was clearly hanging over everything. In fact, it's now seems more clear than ever, that this photo of inmate P01135809, the best lyric from Bliss Muse (ph), by the way, this photo will maybe literally but definitely figuratively be the centerpiece of the 2024 presidential campaign. For Trump, the legal battle is the campaign. Trump is listed as 6'3\", 215 pounds on the booking sheet. All of us who can dunk a basketball can see that the next big legal and campaign decision will be about the timing of all these cases against him, especially that now that one of his 18 co-defendants in Georgia is scheduled for trial in October, that is single digit weeks away.

And looking ahead, you know, the legal challenges for the district attorney, Fani Willis, as she tries to prosecute all 19 of these people, including the former president at the same time, are already starting to pop up. You mentioned that the trial date for one of these defendants, Ken Chesebro, who was a lawyer helping Trump at the time, that was set tentatively by a judge yesterday. But the judge made clear that that only applies to Chesebro and not the other 18 defendants who, again, Fani Willis said that she wants to try all together. So, we are starting to see maybe some cracks developing or at least complications developing in that effort to try them all together. Now, we also know that there's several defendants that are trying to get this case moved to federal court, and among them is former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. He's arguing that, look, I was operating as a federal government employee at that time, I should, you know, the federal government -- or sorry, the Federal Court should throw this case out. Because of it, Fani Willis does not buy that argument. And she's arguing, no, you were a central player in this broader conspiracy to overturn the election, and therefore this case should stay in Atlanta. So, we're already starting to see the legal challenges and the complications pop up with a sprawling RICO case like this. But you know, yesterday's action leading into more action looking ahead.",

But once it became clear that they were in fact going to take a mug shot of the former president, they tried to shift the media narrative around it and use it to their advantage. We know that they had multiple conversations about how exactly he should pose for that mug shot. And they came up with this idea that you should not smile and instead look quote, unquote, \"defiant.\" That is not surprising at all, as the former president cares very much about his image. And in fact, after he took this mug shot, after he looked, quote, unquote, \"defiant,\" they put it out, as you said, into fundraisers.They also posted it on Twitter or X formerly known as Twitter. This was a big deal. If you remember for months, there was speculation of whether or not former President Trump would ever get back on the platform. This was them trying to take control of the media narrative of the fact that he was the first president or former president to have his mug shot taken. And that is what Donald Trump's team likes to do. Now, just to be clear, the president himself or former president is not happy about these arrests. He was not happy being processed.

Every defendant, no matter who they are, has a right to prepare for trial and be ready to -- you know, to be able to get ready for trial.By forcing some of the other folks to trial, you could actually be jeopardizing some of their constitutional rights. And here's where you start to see cases or at least relationships between defendants' fray where they might have worked together or at least have been accused of working together on a criminal enterprise but they all have very different interests and different lawyers and different needs and some of them are going to start to break off.

But officials we've spoken with say there was no indication of a missile launch at the time of the crash, not a surface to air missile or an air to air missile.
