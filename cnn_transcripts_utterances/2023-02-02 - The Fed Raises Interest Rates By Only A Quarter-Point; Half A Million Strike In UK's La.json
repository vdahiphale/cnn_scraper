Policymakers acknowledged inflation is easing somewhat but remains elevated, and they indicated more interest rate hikes will be on the way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: But that's not grounds for complacency. Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high.

More now from CNN's Matt Egan.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER (on camera): The Fed's war on inflation isn't over, but strategy is shifting. This 25-basis point rate increase from the Fed is the smallest since last March, when this fight against inflation began. The Fed is still trying to slow the economy down to cool off inflation, but it's gone from slamming the brakes in the economy to just tapping the brakes, and that is an important shift because it lowers the risk that the fed ends up causing an accident either in financial markets or the real economy or both. And the fed is changing its tune on inflation a bit. The fed statement acknowledged that inflation has eased, and during the press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he declared that the disinflationary process has begun. He also sort of shrugged off the January boom in financial markets, even though soaring stock prices actually makes the job of the Fed to get inflation down that much harder. Now, markets seem to like what Powell had to say with stocks rallying during the press conference. But, you know, I would note that Powell did not mince words when it comes to inflation. He said it's, quote, very premature to declare victory or think that we've really got this. And listen to this clip from Powell.",

And Ukraine's leadership believes the Russians will soon escalate even more after mobilizing hundreds of thousands of men for a likely spring offensive.

And the concern for both governments, whether it be the French government or the U.K. government here, it's not just a question of striking but the ways in which it is mobilizing an opposition and weakening the power and the government in power. And part of that problem here too is that in many ways this conservative government and administration has spent more time on internal struggles and leadership challenges than really thinking about legislation. And going down the road to further oppression, rules, regulations, and punishing those that are articulating in the public space their dissatisfaction with this government is only going to mobilize their own position and further weaken Rishi Sunak.

To be clear, Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most repressive regimes with an already long history of women's rights abuses. And despite progress in recent years, to this day, Human Rights Watch notes, Saudi women still must obtain a male guardian's approval to get married to, leave prison, or obtain certain health care. Women also continue to face discrimination in relation to marriage, family, divorce, and decisions writing to children including child custody. Men can still file cases against daughters, wives or female relatives under their guardianship, for disobedience, which have previously resulted in arrests for small returns to the male guardians home or imprisonment. This is to say nothing of the long jail sentences handed down to women activists who simply tweeted a retweet criticism of the regime. Little wonder then co-hosts Australia and New Zealander were both blindsided and shocked to learn about this deal in the making. Both countries demanding a \"please explain\" from FIFA.
