As we just marked the fourth moment of silence this morning, the moment at 9:59 am when the South Tower fell less than one hour after it was struck by Flight 175. Joining me now, CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer. He's also a historian and professor at Princeton University. Julian, it's good to see you this morning. There is, I think an effort every year to talk about where 9/11 now stands for this nation, for both the people who were here when it happened and whose lives feel like a before and an after of that moment. Much like as my father would say to me he felt after Kennedy was shot. And then there is a new generation as well. And there is an effort to continue to put this in context as we move forward now, 23 years on. You've written about this, you've written about American politics in the aftermath. Where do you think things do stand today, 23 years later?",

Because we are in a fast-moving culture and there's generational change, there's the fact we move from one issue to another. And I think we're still trying, many people are still trying to continue to teach what happened, why it happened and what are some of the lessons to take from what happened. Both the things we did well in terms of counterterrorism, in terms of trying to capitalize on unity and sympathy around the world and the things we did wrong, military operations that ultimately became controversial. I think having that conversation, having those debates, we don't all agree, is incredibly important to prepare us also in terms of avoiding anything like that happening again.",

I will say, though, I don't think we're at the point where they're willing to say this was somehow a game-changing, race-changing event. I think we will continue to hear the language from this campaign that they still see her as the underdog, that they very much believe that the November election is going to be close. What I do think they're going to do is try to maximize what they feel like is the momentum that they could potentially get from last night. You know, they felt like going into last night, this was going to be her first time facing off against Donald Trump, that this was going to be a huge audience for her to try to make a really important, perhaps first impression or second or third impression to a lot of voters, who might just be starting to tune into this new election. Who may be certainly undecided on who they actually want to vote for. And they felt like she landed her message on important issues, like the economy, foreign policy and reproductive rights. And then I think, just as importantly, they were very pleased, according to the advisers I was in touch with all last night throughout the debate, with how much they felt like Donald Trump actually took the vice president's bait on everything, from his crowd sizes to comments made by his former officials. So all of that I think is going to be what the campaign will try to capitalize on in the coming days. But remember, this is an extraordinary election, happening in a really condensed timeline. They don't have many days left. So every day that they are not on the road campaigning, getting her out there, is a day lost. So given that we have now spent a couple of days with her practicing for this debate, expect that she is going to be getting back out on the campaign trail and campaigning as quickly as possible.",

So looking at conservative straw polls, it's not that surprising that those people would say they were still voting for Donald Trump and that he won the debate. But when you talk to a lot of Republicans on background, those who don't want to be named but people who are still aligned with Donald Trump, allies of the former president, they are very skeptical about how he did last night. And many of them are disappointed. They thought that he did take the bait from Kamala Harris. They -- it was something that they had prepped him on. Allies were calling him up until the debate, telling him that they would -- thought Kamala Harris was going to try to goad him into personal attacks. And she did just that. They were trying to get him to remain stoic, to not respond, to just stick to the issues. And we obviously saw that not only did he not do that but he also got increasingly angry. So when I talked to one advisor, this is how they put it. \"His worst behavior was on display last night.\" Does that mean that they thought he full-out lost the debate? No, they actually thought it was worse that he behaved like that because that overshadowed some of her answers that they thought were weaker. But at the end of the day, whether or not this moves the needle, we're going to be continuing to watch that polling. Donald Trump's team believes that they can get this back. There's still two months to go and that he obviously has a solid base that's going to show up for him in November, no matter what.",

She also will continue with the kind of dual approach of reminding voters of who he is and what a second term would be, while also offering a path forward. Offering a candidacy that centers on the possibility of change in American policy and politics. What she needs to fill in, I think, is less who she is. But specifically a few issues where she will differ from the president, Biden, in terms of how she will address the economic concerns of the nation. And she talked a little bit about housing. She has to continue to bring back some of those concrete issues that the (INAUDIBLE) care about and that's her path forward, combined again with canvassing, registering and making sure that people vote.

And we did hear remarks from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, C.Q. Brown, as well as Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin. And Austin actually made some very significant comments about just how much the force has changed over the last two-plus decades, roughly. Of all the people serving now in the military, only about 6 percent of those currently in uniform were in uniform at the time of 9/11. And roughly 21 percent of those serving now weren't even born at the time that 9/11 happened. So that just gives you a real sense of how much the military has changed over the last two-plus decades. Of course fighting the war on terror following that terror attack, many people who enlisted did just after that terror attack occurred. Hundreds of thousands of people joined the military following those events. And so this was really a day for the chairman and the secretary to honor the families of those who died here at the Pentagon, as well as those who were on that flight. And also just, you know, think about how it's -- so much has changed over the last two-plus decades here in this building as well as within the military writ large -- Erica.",

However, the city manager from Springfield, Ohio, told ABC News that there were no credible reports of family pets being harmed by migrants.

In Springfield, Ohio, according to real reporting from the local newspaper, there have been strains in the community due to the influx of Haitian immigrants in recent years. For example, there's more traffic. You know, there's, there's, there's an influx of students at school. So there are real challenges when you have a wave of immigrants arriving. But what's not happening is this idea that pets are being stolen and eaten and treated as food. This is coming from the fever swamps of the internet, from far-right-wing social media commenters. And then it's bubbled up in recent days, both to JD Vance and now all the way to Donald Trump. This show is kind of the worst ways that our information ecosystem is polluted, where an idea can take root as a meme on the internet. And by the way, it might have been a meme that wasn't even intended to be true. It might have been a joke to begin with.

Yes, this is an electionwhere celebrity endorsements do matter because the margins are so tight in some of these states. And because she is the biggest celebrity in the world, not only is she the biggest celebrity in the world but she has a fan base that is young; in some cases, these fans have never voted before. And so they're going to be moved because of her. But let's back up. I don't think anyone's surprised she's endorsing Harris over Trump. It's a little bit surprising about her timing. And I think she was very savvy in the way that she did it. She basically said to her fans, I usually would keep my vote private but because there's all this nonsense out there, because there's these AI generated lies out there, because Trump has made me part of the story, I'm going to be transparent with you and tell you I'm voting for Harris. I thought it was a very savvy, structured way to explain why she was announcing this. Because what she was saying was, I don't want to be dragged into this. I'm not trying to pressure you to vote. But I'm going to tell you what I'm doing because everyone is wondering. So a very smart move by Taylor Swift to handle the way she's handled it. And because these races are going to be so close in swing states, it is possible that this will matter. But it's also very hard to measure how many fans are going to vote because of Taylor.

He took the bait at every single step. You didn't hear a new policy pronouncement, a new what he can do better than he did in the first term. On the other hand, she was pretty evasive about specific policy ideas. She generally endorsed President Biden's approach on Ukraine and certainly on the Middle East, without delving into what she might do differently. She did the -- she played up the differences between herself and Trump on abortion issues, which play well for her, and other reproductive rights issues. And he tried with only moderate success, I thought, on the economic issues. He did a -- she did a very good job with casting him as more the incumbent than president Biden being the incumbent. I think what's really fascinating for the next 1.5 months would be if we heard from either of these candidates about their view of America in the world. And for President Biden, for president -- former president Trump, what you basically heard was Viktor Orban endorses me. So he's basically got the endorsement of an authoritarian.

And that's not a specific set of policies but we don't usually get those in campaigns. I do think it's a way to distinguish that she will be more forthright or more aggressive, she wants to argue, in bringing this to an end. And then on the economy, she tried to talk about certain structural opportunity barriers that middle class families face -- housing, for example -- that she wants to address. And that's a subtle way to say she's not dismissing Biden's efforts on the economy but simultaneously understands there's a lot of work to be done. Again, it's a start; the concerns are very real in the polls. And I think in the next 56 days, that's one of the top issues she will have to tackle.",

But the problem is she's not been particularly specific on these issues, as David said. And if these issues are indeed so deeply felt by many voters, it may take more than a good showing in a debate and a few policy speeches to, you know, compensate for that. So it could be something that she ultimately, if she loses the election, was unable to do. And it may have been an impossible task. But I think what I've been looking for over the next few weeks is two things. One, whether Trump's campaign, his conservative media friends will be able to actually fog the reality of what happened last night, to perhaps lessen the impact of this debate, get back to those issues on the economy and immigration, which the former president has struggled to effectively address, actually. The second thing is, if she gets a polling bounce, it could be significant because some of these early voting states, North Carolina and Wisconsin, they're beginning to vote in early voting and mail-in voting in the coming weeks. So the fact that this is only eight weeks, the election, it doesn't mean there's eight weeks to the election date. Some people are going to vote before that. So a bounce of even a few points, which could be very significant in the race, could actually be more significant than this after this debate, than it has been, perhaps, in decades past.",
