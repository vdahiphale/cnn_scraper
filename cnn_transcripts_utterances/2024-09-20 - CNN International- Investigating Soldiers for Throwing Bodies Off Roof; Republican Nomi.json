All right, the stock markets in New York opens in around 30 minutes from now. Let's check in on how the futures are fairing -- remember, was a big week for markets, as we saw that fed dropping interest rates by 50 basis points. As you can see, DOW is up slightly, everything else in the red. We'll check in on those numbers in about 15 minutes from now. Well, tensions are ratcheting up further along the border between Israel and Lebanon, where there's been an intense new exchange of fire. Israel launched more strikes into Southern Lebanon earlier Friday, a day after carrying out one of the heaviest rounds of attacks this year. The Israeli military says it hit about 100 Hezbollah rockets launches late Thursday. More than half of those strikes reportedly carried out in a single hour. And the IDF says 130 rockets were fired from Southern Lebanon in the past hours. Now, the cross-border strikes come despite calls for calm after those attacks on Hezbollah electronic devices. CNN's Ben Wedeman is standing by in Beirut for us. We've also got Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv for the latest on what's happening on the ground. Jeremy, I want to start off with you. Look, we know this week, Israel clearly said that this is a new era in the war. Is pretty evidence this week with exploding devices. We also saw one of the heavier strikes overnight as well over the past year. So, give us a sense of what we're seeing today, given this tension, this intensity over the past few days?",

They say that they took out some 1000 barrels that would be used to launch rockets towards Israel. And today, we saw a number of Hezbollah strikes being carried out in Northern Israel. 120 projectiles were identified by the Israeli military crossing into Israeli territory in areas across Northern Israel, from the western portion of Northern Israel all the way to the Golan Heights. There are no reports of injuries at this time from those strikes, but there are fires that were sparked across Northern Israel as a result of that. And we are already getting now very early reports from the Israeli military saying that they have now conducted a quote targeted strike in Beirut.

There doesn't seem to be much will on the part of the international community, led by the United States, to do anything to prevent this. And all indications are coming from Israel that they are preparing to seriously ramp up their offensive actions against Lebanon. We know that the 98th division of the Israeli army has been shifted away from the Gaza front to the Northern Command. As far as Hezbollah's response yesterday, Secretary General of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah indicated that a response would come to the pager and walkie talkie strikes. He didn't -- he specifically did not get into the details.

Authorities evacuated some 1000 people. Reports say that some people had to climb onto their roofs to escape rising water. Scientists say the extreme weather in Central Europe right now is a direct result of global warming. Let's turn to another area where climate change is taking its toll. Now, scientists have only been studying the effects on ice melts in Antarctica for a relatively short period, but what they found inside the Doomsday Glacier could spell potential disaster for the planets.

It's a chunk of ice the size of Florida, and if it were to go into the ocean and melt, it would raise sealevels by two feet, over 60 centimeters around the world. But it also is like a giant cork holding back all the inland ice in Antarctica there. And if that releases, we're talking 10 feet, you know, 30 meters of sea level rise. And it's just three meters of sea level rise rather. And so, the idea of this thing not being part of a stable Earth is given at the Doomsday Glacier, very grim sort of moniker. And after six years of studying this thing, a team of international scientists, including the British Antarctic Survey. They've been using these torpedo shaped robots called Icefin to go down to the grounding line, that's where the bottom of the glacier meets the sea floor. And they've discovered really alarming trends, like warm ocean waters from the Southern Ocean creeping underneath this glacier and then up into it, like in a staircase formation, weakening it further and further. They expect it to accelerate the ice loss in coming years. There's no scenario really where it's going to do a big cannonball and immediately sea levels. This is a gradual, chronic problem, and you're seeing it in places like Miami, where sunny day king tide flooding is increasing. Very vulnerable coastal cities around the world are just going to have to deal with this one way or another, and it just comes down to the speed of the melt down there. It's so hard for us, I think, to connect ourselves with a place that's so far away, Eleni, bottom of the world, most people will never go there.

Just 20 percent think that Trump is going to win. Now to be clear, this is not who they want to win. This is who they expect to win. And this is not representative of all CEOs. It is representative, though, of these 60 or so business leaders that are put in a room and pulled anonymously by Sonnenfeld, who is known as the CEO Whisperer. And what's telling here is that even though only a third of them identify as Democrats, and undoubtedly some of them do not like part of Harris' campaign and her agenda, they do think that she's ultimately going to win. And as far as why, what's interesting here is the CEOs were also asked who is a threat to democracy? And again, overwhelmingly, 73 percent say that they fear that Trump is a threat to Democracy. Only 4 percent say that. For Harris, 8 percent think both of them are and 15 percent say neither. Now Jeff Sonnenfeld, he told me that the CEOs that he's in touch with are, quote, horrified by Trump's leadership model. He said, they depend upon the rule of law, and they want a president who respects that law. Now I did ask the Trump campaign about these findings, and the press secretary said to me, does anyone think a straw poll of business leaders from Yale represents the views of the country. And I think the answer there clearly is no, but that's not the point.

Of course, we have yet to confirm that Akil was indeed killed in this attack. But certainly, this is going to mean if Israel crossed red lines Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Nasrallah. It's yet again, going beyond those red lines, and it's putting more and more pressure on Hezbollah, from its base, to somehow respond in a meaningful way to these Israeli attacks. And what we saw, for instance, on the 25th of August, when Hezbollah responded to the assassination of Fuad Shukr that the Israelis were able to blunt the more the attack by Hezbollah of more than 300 drones and projectiles fired into the heart of Israel.

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Listen, we have all the ingredients now, sadly for an escalation on the northern border of Israel between Israel and Hezbollah. You think about this strike inside Beirut, it's not the first time. But I know that U.S. officials see, Israeli strikes in Southern Lebanon against Hezbollah targets as fundamentally different from strikes inside Beirut itself, in part because it's such a heavily populated area. You add to that this unprecedented, wide ranging pager and walkie-talkie attack from a couple of days ago, certainly an escalation. And then if you look back just to two, three weeks to last month, when Hezbollah attempted an escalation of its own, a major rocket and missile attack on Israel that was only thwarted about 30 minutes before supposed to happen, according to Israeli and U.S. officials, when Israel did a preemptive strike. So, you have both sides raising the ante here in ways that make it difficult for the other side not to feel compelled to retaliate. Add to that, Israeli officials now speaking quite publicly about changing the focus from the war in the south in Gaza against Hamas to a war in the north, or a more expanded military action, at least against Hezbollah in the north, which, Eleni, is not entirely new, going back to just in the wake of October 7th, when I was in Northern Israel soldiers, citizens, Israeli officials, spoke then too about the need to deal with the northern problem once Gaza is -- once operations in Gaza have ended, or at least tailed off. And remember, you still have a large portion of the north of Israel that is uninhabitable, many tens of thousands of Israelis forced to flee south. So, you throw all that together. And if I could have one more ingredient, it is the -- what seems to be the collapse of cease fire talks in Gaza, which had been seen by all sides as a way to head off an expansion of military action in the north.",
