KeirStarmer, Britain's newest prime minister, is vowing to rebuild his nation through trust, stability and inclusiveness after what he referred to as an era of noisy performance. The dust is now settling after a political earthquake led to a record- breaking victory for the Labour Party, ending 14 years of Conservative leadership defined by chaos and divisiveness. The new prime minister will now govern with a powerful majority in Parliament. CNN's Nic Robertson has more on this seismic shift in British politics. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  Number 10 Downing Street has a new tenant and the United Kingdom, a new leader. After the Conservative Party's worst defeat in its history, Sir Keir Starmer and his Labour Party are now in power after a landslide victory in Thursday's general election.",

ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Both men made their mandatory visits to the King and now the transfer of power is complete. As dawn broke and newspapers hit the stands, there was no doubt who won. Many well-known Conservative lawmakers lost their seats, among them Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, Penny Mordaunt, and, most significantly, the short-lived Prime Minister Liz Truss, was booted out.

And of course, that's fundamental to democracy, very much in the same way that President Biden sees the values of democracy and its strengths and where its weaknesses are. He wants to change that. He wants to reverse it. This is why he was talking about, you know, if you -- if work hard, if you play by the rules, then you will get, you know, a fair chance that you will be respected by the government. Everyone will be respected across the country. He is trying to encourage that faith in politicians. He does want to turn it around. So, you know, that's what he'll try to achieve. But it will be difficult, because he will be judged on his record, and his record will be, in part, what he said he would do in power and what he achieves in power. And he did lay out that some things, like building houses, building schools, will take time. They have big ambitions over the next five years. But it's sort of indicated the horizon on that is a little bit a ways off. And that will depend on improving the economy, his number one job, which depends, for instance, improving trade relations with the European Union. Many steps need to be taken to improve the economy, to bring the changes he needs. And if he isn't able to deliver on that, then he's not going to win the trust and confidence of the public, you know. And just to underscore that, and we've talked about it a bit today, 59.9 percent of the population voted. The last time it was that low was 1997. The time before that, it was at its lowest over a century before. So, you can see that the turnout was low. And in that turnout, only 35 percent of the population actually voted for Labour, even though they won 412 seats, so far. So, you know, it looks like a staggering majority, and it is in effect for governing, but it's not a massive, you know, rounding support from the public. Only 35 percent of the people voted for them.",

But I don't know that there is apathy,especially because you saw the votes for independent M.P.s and for smaller parties, which is something extremely unusual for British politics to see independent M.P.s win against the two major parties. That's something very, very unusual. Now, I think a lot of Conservatives will be looking at the results and will be thinking that the reform votes, reform being the more populist right wing party, winning votes from the Conservatives means that the reason why they are in the situation that they are is because they weren't right wing enough. But I think that a lot of the voters, what they will say is, it's because very obviously the government was not working for the last 14 years. So, what Keir Starmer now has to do is he has to make sure that at least the basics are taken care of. And he has the opportunity to do that. July 17th is the date to look out for. That's the King's speech. And this is when Keir Starmer will be setting out how he's going to be reforming the public services. So we will expect to see quite a bit about the NHS -- NHS reform. Remember, we still have junior doctor strikes here in the U.K., which is something that people are very worried about. And we will be hearing more about the budget that's going to come out in the autumn. We will be hearing about GB energy. How is Labour going to tackle the cost of living crisis? If people see their energy costs going down, that this is going to be the best, perfect signal for the voters that they can trust their politicians again. Y",

When you think about all the different issues facing the U.K. at the moment, the debt burden, housing shortage, infrastructure issues, the public, you know, just issues when it comes to the NHS, you talked about junior doctors and the number of strikes we've seen and the fact that junior doctors want a wage increase or salary increase of up to 35 percent, what is it that Keir Starmer has to do specifically to get the U.K. economy back on track?",

Left-wing and moderate groups are trying to prevent the far right from sweeping into power. In an exclusive interview, National Rally's Marine Le Pen sat down with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday, where she addressed the issue of racism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN HOST, \"AMANPOUR\":  Can I ask you, because you have spent a long time trying to rebrand your party to the extent that here you are on the verge of potentially taking power in government. But there's still a lot of troubling statements from members of your actual current party, including people who are currently, you know, candidates for this election, like North Africans came to power in 2016. These people have no place in high places, in high positions. Ministerial positions must be held by Franco-French people, un point c'est tout.

Now, of course, this is the message that the president will be taking on the campaign trail, as he, again, tries toconvince voters who have sort of expressed their hesitations about whether he is suited to be the Democratic candidate nominee. The campaign also releasing a memo today laying out the month of July. Now, in many ways, this memo is a \"we hear you\" to the many allies who have come out over the last week saying that there should be more unscripted and candid moments by the president on the trail. In addition to these two stops that he's doing over the next few days, he's also going to go to Nevada for two conferences targeting Latino and black voters. We also anticipate more travel being announced, not only for him, but for the vice president, the first lady, and the second gentleman. They will also be doing a $50 million paid media blitz. So, this gives you a sense of them sort of coalescing the conventional methods and also trying to strategize around travel to show an aggressive and vigorous president out on the campaign trail. But there is no doubt that the interview today is going to be crucial into all of this. Everyone will be paying attention not only to what he says, but how he says it. And on that front, campaign officials tell me that they, too, see it as a high-stakes moment, but they also acknowledge that the president is prone to verbal missteps, something that he has grappled with his entire life and something that has come into more focus now, especially as he is older. And so, his allies will be watching this closely, and the next few days will certainly be critical to the trajectory of the race and whether or not he remains in it.",

And I think the question really is, are these episodes that are sort of these intermittent episodes, or are they reflective of some sort of, you know, bigger underlying condition? And we don't know, and that's why the testing, I think, is so important. Some of the things that I noticed, and, by the way, many brain doctors from around the world, frankly, called me, many of them noticed these same things, the slowness of the speech, the halting of the speech at times, sometimes a confused rambling, and also something that you may see more than hear, but sort of the lack of expression on the face. These are all potential signs. By themselves, they may mean nothing, but I think the message is that if you see these things, it should warrant some further investigation.

We've got to show discipline, and we've got to show that although we're a broad internal coalition, there's a church stretching from the one nation side of the Conservative, perhaps the more small L, liberal end, to the more sort of Eurosceptic, right wing, potentially Thatcherite side of the party. But the Conservative Party has always encompassed both of those dimensions, and it needs to do so today. I think these results obviously were very depressing. But within some of the figures, there's also some quite interesting nuance. We saw that the kind of the games that Boris Johnson made in the north of England weren't entirely reversed. Quite a lot of those seats in the so-called red wall seats that were Labour for a century, and then flipped to the Conservatives in 2019, many of those were lost, but not by large margins. We haven't seen the sort of wholesale reversal to the Labour Party. So, I think there's everything to play for in the next election. Obviously, politics is particularly volatile now, right across the West. And I think it's we saw Boris Johnson's historic majority overturned within just one term. And I could imagine the same happening again.",

Imean, there are a lot of people within the Conservative Party who have made names for themselves and who are well-known because of some of their controversial policies. Do you think the leader is going to be someone who's a little bit more to the right or someone like James Cleverley, right, that a lot of sort of moderate conservatives can really rally behind and some people might say is somebody who can bring both wings of the Conservative Party together?",

So, unlesshe changes his mind, I don't think it will be him. But I think the most important thing rather than the individual is I think that they, as I said, ground themselves in the sort of sensible mainstream policies of the country. And I think that the country still is largely in the same place that it was before, country that would like to see lower taxation, but also wants to see effective public services. And I think that the rise of reform is, to some degree, but not entirely related to the failure of the conservatives to control migration, both legal and illegal. But it's also a sort of wider rejection of potentially mainstream politics. And that's something that I am worried about. And I think that any party in government has got to be able to show that it can deliver the change that the public want to see. And I think one of the problems the Conservative Party recently is, as I said, we spent more time arguing with each other. It certainly seemed that way than we were actually delivering change. I agree with you about the concern in terms of voter disillusionment. That's something that Keir Starmer actually addressed, saying that he really wants to sort of regain public trust, that people can believe that politics can be a force for good. But we did see the lowest voter turnout in 20 years, participation at 60 percent. These numbers have to be concerning to both parties. Henry Newman, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much.

Records are expectedto be shattered through the end of next week. Las Vegas could exceed its all-time high temperature of 47 degrees Celsius or 117 degrees Fahrenheit. The dangerous heat wave is also feeding wildfires in Northern California, where firefighters are battling blazes in record high temperatures. Right now, Hurricane Beryl is hammering Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The storm has lost quite a bit of steam, weakening to a category one hurricane while it makes its way over land. But Beryl is still packing strong winds of nearly 136 kilometers per hour, 85 miles per hour, while bringing torrential rain to the area, too. Beryl is expected to weaken further now that it's cut off from the warm waters of the Caribbean, where at least nine people died as the storm carved out a path of destruction earlier this week. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking Beryl. Elisa.",

We could still see some heavy rain across the Yucatan Peninsula, but the next place that we're looking for some of these heavy rain totals will be northern Mexico and south Texas, where we could see maybe four to six inches of rain, maybe more than 150 millimeters of rain as we go into the weekend as that track starts to head towards the U.S. So, as we go into tonight, it emerges into the Gulf of Mexico. These are warm waters again, very warm, so we could even have more organizing and reintensifying, yet again, before it heads to that south Texas coast. Probably late Sunday going into Monday could be a hurricane yet again. We are watching this kind of turn to the north into Texas because we have this area of high pressure that's bringing us some heat in the southern U.S. Well, it's weakening and kind of getting out of the way, opening up the door for this turn to the north going into Texas by the end of the weekend. So, we are finding increasing chances of at least tropical storm force winds from places like Brownsville up to Corpus Christi and Victoria, Texas, as we go through, you know, the weekend, the next couple of days, something to watch. So, here's that track. It should weaken into a tropical storm soon as it continues to get interaction with land, gets back into the Gulf of Mexico. There's that reintensification could be a category one hurricane as it makes another landfall on the border there of Texas and Mexico. Rip currents though will be a problem all weekend, which is dangerous. It's a holiday weekend here, so a lot of people will be at the beach. Zain?",
