The president is going to be delivering this primetime address to the nation that he said earlier in the week that he would deliver to provide some detailed behind his decision to withdraw from the 2024 campaign.In that official letter that he posted to his Twitter and Instagram accounts on Sunday announcing his withdrawal. He pledged to tell the American people more about what went into this decision. And that's what we expect to hear from the president tomorrow night as he continues to recover from Covid. Yesterday, his doctors said that his symptoms had resolved almost completely, and that he had received a 10th and standard final dose of Paxlovid. Shortly after that disclosure, Biden called into what had formerly been his campaign headquarters that had just been assumed by his Vice President Kamala Harris, to pledge his support to her and to assure his campaign staff that he will continue to be on the trail fighting for her -- fighting for their ticket in the months to come. Now, this of course, Dana, as the Democratic Party has supported her at a breakneck speed, she's now locked in enough support from delegates to secure the nomination. Just a really stunning pace for a candidate that just a few days ago was still the number two. Dana?",

So, this is an emotional time for him.I'm told, but some aides we were talking to pointed to his remarks yesterday when he called into the Harris campaign headquarters. And he sounded a quite upbeat, but this is going to be a couple things. One, finishing the job in the Oval Office, focusing directly on his foreign affairs agenda, which of course is very important this week, that critical meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But also, he clearly will give a nod to what comes next. By doing it in the Oval Office that was a choice, not doing it in the Rose Garden. So, he could have the vice president standing with him.

KANNO-YOUNGS: I mean, it's -- it really was a remarkable week and it's going to be looked back on. And when -- you know, in the history books. Make no mistake. At the beginning of that trip in Las Vegas, President Biden was still intent on staying in this race. His aides were bullish as well. They were dismissing criticism from Democrats. He went into that NAACP conference speech on Tuesday. And I -- you know, I thought it was actually one of the more enthusiastic, energetic speeches he had made since the debate.

As you speak to people here, they are very excited about this shakeup. I've asked him, do you think that it came too late? Is there enough time? And they said, yes. She is prepared. I spoke to a woman, who works in corrections, who likes her background in law enforcement. And felt as though that she has s struck the right balance between accountability and justice and compassion.

In the suburbs and among voters of color, she was performing stronger. So that is a key part of, let's call it the Harris coalition now. We have talked a lot about the Biden coalition that has done. This is the Harris coalition. So, by going to Milwaukee, they're doing a couple of things. A, talking about abortion rights, but also Milwaukee and Milwaukee County. The way you win Wisconsin is by driving turnout up among African American voters in the city and getting some suburban voters in those counties. But this map could be entirely different once we have a fresh set of polling and once the campaigns do. So, what we do know is this. There's a race to define Vice President Kamala Harris. We think we know a lot about her. But she's never been in this context before. So, all of her old speeches, all of her old record, and it cuts a little bit differently than it did four years ago. And she ran for president, which was -- it started off as a very high-flying campaign. And then it changed throughout that year. So, she'll be viewed in a new context, without question.

Now, Kimberly Cheatle, there was very - there was very little, Dana, as you know, that creates any kind of unanimity on Capitol Hill these days. But she managed to do it with that performance yesterday where she struggled to answer questions. There was one point where, you know, she was asked the same questions 16 or 17 times. And it wasn't until like a few hours in that she managed to finally say a couple of new bits of information about how long it was that they knew someone was suspicious before they realized that this person was a real threat.
