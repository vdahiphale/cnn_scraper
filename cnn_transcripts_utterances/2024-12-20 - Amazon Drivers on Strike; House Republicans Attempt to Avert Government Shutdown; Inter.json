So what is plan C? That's what they have been negotiating all morning long. And, essentially, what they have settled on is this, try to separate this package to keep the government open into several smaller bills and try to move those three different bills individually. Among those bills will be a three-month extension of government funding, a $100 billion package to deal with natural disaster relief, things that -- parts of the country have been hit hard by hurricanes and the like, and $10 billion in aid to farmers. That had all initially been part of a larger package. Of course, Donald Trump scuttled that package in the 11th hour earlier this week, when he criticized it and then demanded that this Congress address the issue of the national debt limit, of course, a politically fraught issue, one in which they have battled on over for years, and it takes months typically to resolve. He wanted it done in a couple of days. But what we are hearing now from our sources is that the discussion about the debt limit, given the pushback from Democrats and conservative Republicans, is going to be punted until next year. It's in defiance of Donald Trump's demands, meaning that they have to address it when Donald Trump takes the oath of office and when the Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress. Now, right now, they're trying to get buy-in from their members, but there is ample frustration, including from one congressman who told me going in, this is just another example of the swamp.

And what we were told from our sources is that the Democrats are weighing whether to accept this. They want to see what happens in this Republican Conference meeting first. Will their members come out and they revolt? Will they decide to do it under that two-thirds procedure that requires a significant number of Democrats to get behind it, or will they try to go along the majority vote, which will push it until tomorrow, which they could essentially do on their own with just Republican votes, assuming they don't lose more than a couple of defection -- defectors? So, Jeffries and -- Hakeem Jeffries, the White House and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, are all having discussions at the moment to try to figure out how to proceed, whether to back this, because Democratic support essential, not just in the House, but, of course, the Democratic-led Senate and the Democrat who still occupies the White House -- guys.",

We will have a vote, it looks like, soon, as Manu was explaining on suspension. We would need two-thirds on what largely was the bill from last night without the debt ceiling language. Or, if that doesn't pass by the two-thirds, we then go to Rules. We have various procedures, and there's a pretty good chance before midnight we have a majority vote on another bill, a C.R., into March, which would also include the disaster relief and economic assistance, but without some of the other things that were in the last -- yesterday's bill.
