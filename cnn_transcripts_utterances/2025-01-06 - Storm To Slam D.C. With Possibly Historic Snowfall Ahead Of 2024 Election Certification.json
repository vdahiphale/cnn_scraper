This is a live look at Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital, and those are snow plows right there if you squint really closely.This morning D.C. is facing a snow emergency. The emergency is in effect right now. Just about everything in the city is shut down. D.C. notoriously struggles when even a dusting of snow falls to the ground. So all is shut down except Capitol Hill as Congress is preparing to certify the 2024 election, but a record amount of snow could be coming to them. Up to 16 inches possible. So, of course, we have to send CNN's Gabe Cohen out into it to help us understand what is going on. Gabe, what are you seeing?",

If you look you can see there's already several inches accumulated here on the ground. Expecting maybe six to 10 inches in D.C. by the end of the night.It's shaping up to be the biggest storm to hit the nation's capital in at least three years. That's why there's a snow warning into effect -- in effect until late tonight and emergency declarations here in Washington and in at least six states right now. Schools are shut down across this entire region. Federal government offices are also closed today. And it's possible this could extend, Kate, into tomorrow -- maybe into the rest of the week. Because as you mentioned, D.C. sometimes has a little trouble getting back on its feet when we experience snowfall like this, especially potential record snowfall. And it's happening right now on the critical day as we're waiting for the election to be certified here at the Capitol. You can see this line of police cars going in right now to the Capitol. We've seen dozens, Kate, maybe even hundreds this morning. It is a fortified center right now. You can see the fencing that's gone up around the building there. MPD -- that's the local police department here -- as well as federal law enforcement really on high alert right now not just because of what happened on January 6 four years ago but also what happened in New Orleans a couple of weeks ago. We know that the local police department fully activated today. Every office on the street working 12-hour shifts, Kate. That's going to continue through the rest of the week. The question for them is how does this storm affect things? They're hoping it's going to mean less security concerns -- that people stay home. But we'll see, Kate, as the snow continues coming down, and it's going to keep coming down into the night.",

Thank you, John.Donald Trump's return to the White House is already upending hundreds of pending prosecutions against his supporters who attacked the Capitol four years ago today. Federal prosecutors and the Justice Department are feeling the pressure as defendants talk of Trump pardoning them and are not eager to cut plea deals. The vast majority of January 6 cases have been resolved with plea deals. Eighty percent of all the cases prosecuted so far have ended with defendants pleading guilty.

They're still running down new leads, making new arrests, and they are actively prosecuting about 300 pending cases in court.A federal law enforcement source told CNN that Trump's election has already upended those ongoing efforts to hold the rioters accountable. A big reason for that is because prosecutors, like you said, were hoping to resolve most of those cases with plea deals. But with Trump taking office in two weeks sources say many of these defendants are in no mood to negotiate. Many of the plea talks have simply broken down. Yes, it's been four years, but arrests are still trickling in. The FBI recently nabbed a member of the Proud Boys from New York and a man from Alabama who allegedly stabbed police with a flagpole. This investigation, four years later, is very much ongoing. But a source says that after the November election the FBI issues new guidance telling agents to prioritize felony cases instead of misdemeanor cases. With limited time and limited resources investigators are focusing on rioters suspected of assaulting police or using weapons. That means man of the Trump supporters who breached the Capitol but didn't contribute to the violence will likely never face justice if they haven't been charged yet. And Sara, morale has tanked inside the DOJ division that's been working these cases. One official told me, \"That sometimes it feels like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\" And you can understand why. They just spent the last four years of their lives hunting down and prosecuting more than 1,500 rioters and President-elect Trump might wipe that all away when he takes office just two weeks from today -- Sara.",

To tell us we didn't see what we all saw with our own eyes. To dismiss concerns about it as some kind of partisan obsession. To explain it away as a protest that just got out of hand.

But then the Lions' Jahmyr Gibbs erupts, scoring three touchdowns in the second half and a franchise record-tying four TDs on the night. Aaron Glenn's defense keeping Minnesota's top five passing offense out of the endzone as Detroit rolls 31-9 in the win, back-to-back NFC North titles, a first round playoff bye, and homefield advantage throughout. Stop what you're doing and watch this. Chicago fooled the entire state of Wisconsin and the Green Bay Packers. They made it look as if the guy at the bottom of the screen was fielding the punt but it's a stealthy Josh Blackwell who actually fielded the ball. Now, the Packers, on the punt team, can't see where the ball is going. They just look for the returner. It's a 94-yard punt return for a touchdown. Then on the final play of their season the Bears would beat their longtime foes for the first time in six years on that game-winning field goal for a 24-22 win. Here's a look at the playoff matchups. The Chargers and Texans get wildcard weekend started on Saturday, followed by Steelers-Ravens. A tripleheader on Sunday with the Bills hosting the Broncos. The Packers taking on the Eagles in Philly. And the Commanders going to Tampa to face the Bucs. The action wraps up Monday night with the Vikings flying west to play the Rams. Now, the Patriots -- they were all set to land the number one overall pick in the next NFL draft after an abysmal season -- sorry, John Berman -- but they beat their division rivals Buffalo, who sat a lot of their starters, losing the top pick. Afterwards, New England firing head coach Jerod Mayo after just one season. Now the four-win Titans secure the number one overall pick.
