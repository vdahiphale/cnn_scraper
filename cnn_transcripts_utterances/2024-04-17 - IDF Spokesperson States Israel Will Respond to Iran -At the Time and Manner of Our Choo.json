On Tuesday, the only official word on Israel's plan came from the head of the Israeli military, who warned Iran will face consequences for its actions. Iran is now facing consequences from the U.S. and the European Union, both announcing plans to impose a raft of new sanctions on Tehran. According to the U.S. National Security Advisor, President Joe Biden is working with allies and partners, including the G7, for a comprehensive response. That includes sanctions targeting Iran's missile and drone programs, as well as groups supporting Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

It reads, these new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors. The U.S already has an arms ban on Iran as well as an almost total economic embargo. Companies doing business with Iran face sanctions. All inputs from around a banned. There are heavy sanctions on Iranian financial institutions. Almost a total ban on selling aircraft or repair parts to Iran. It's already one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world but yet it's still firing missiles and drones and supplying arms to proxies like the Houthis.

You cut off a million, a million and a half barrels of oil a day from the global market, you're going to have an impact on prices, and this is what the Americans don't want. The other sanctions, unless you're willing to sanction third-country parties who are dealing with Iran, are not going to be much more effective than you've been thus far.And as we know, looking at Ukraine and the drones and missiles that have been captured in Ukraine, there's American technology leaking all over former Russia, and some of it's coming through Iran, some of it is going to Iran. So, I don't hold much hope for sanctions, but it's a diplomatic measure. The real question is, will the United States really extend its nuclear guarantee to Israel, and will that be sufficient to keep Iran back from this ring of fire? That's the question.

Tabassum had come under criticism over a link she posted in her Instagram bio to a website about Palestine that says, quote, \"Zionism is a racist settler colonial ideology.\" CAIR says what Tabassum did was not antisemitic. And in an interview with CNN, she said the university taught her to stand up for her beliefs.",
