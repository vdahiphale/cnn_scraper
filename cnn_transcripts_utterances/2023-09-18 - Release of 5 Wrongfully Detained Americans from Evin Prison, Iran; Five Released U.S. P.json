You have been watching as these negotiations have been going on for months and months and months now. Can you give us some sense of how this happened. And I do want to, sort of, reiterate what we heard from John Kirby who talked to our Kate Bolduan, he said, there are seven people actually there. The five who have been detained and two family members who were not allowed to leave Iran. So, we're talking about seven people, not five who have, sort of, have been stuck in Iran.

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. The Biden administration really hailing this as a victory, and I should note that we did just get a statement from President Obama, who said that, today, five innocent Americans who were imprisoned in Iran are finally coming home. He says that they will soon be reunited with their loved ones after enduring years of agony, uncertainty and suffering. And he went on to thank the emir of Qatar and also to the sultan of Oman.Really key intermediaries here, Oman and Qatar and Switzerland as these negotiations played out over the last several months, last six to seven months when the U.S. was using these intermediaries to communicate with Iran with whom, of course, the U.S. does not currently have diplomatic relations. Now, in the statement from President Biden, he did reiterate here that the State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Iran. That the State Department has a long-standing travel warning saying that U.S. citizens have -- they face a risk of kidnapping and arbitrary arrest and detention. So, really, the U.S. trying to convey here to the public that while this is a victory by the Biden administration, while this is a sigh of relief, of course, for the families and the people who have been detained there for over five years. The U.S. is saying, do not go to Iran because of course Iran does not recognize, really, Iranian-American dual citizens. They recognize these citizens as purely Americans and they may use them in the future as these kinds of bargaining chips. So, again, President Obama issuing the statement, confirming that this is moving forward. Of course, we are about to see them land on the tarmac there. And when they do, we are told, they're going to have access to their cellphones where they can then call their families back in the United States. And then, we expect them to, of course, head back to the U.S. on that very long journey from Doha back to the Washington, D.C. area, guys. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  So, what we are looking at -- Natasha, thank you so much. It looks -- we have -- this appears to be the plane on the ground in Doha, which is a huge moment.

But I think, you know, we've discussed over the hours since we knew this was happening that this, at least, diplomacy in action. And diplomacy worked today. Whatever happens next on the nuclear file, whatever happen next with the reengagement by Iran certainly by this region and beyond, that's for tomorrow.

You know, in cell that was incredibly small with no bedding of any kind, on a concrete floor. No toilet, going into a bucket every day. Taken out daily for interrogations. Repeatedly beaten and tased. Just lots of horrific things done to him. And that was just the begin of the horrific journey, because unfortunately, you know, he was left behind by President Biden in -- sorry, President Obama in 2016, President Trump left him and his father behind two more times, and finally President Biden has gotten the deal done and brought him home. But I'm just so happy for the family who have become like family to me. And I'm so excited for them to finally be all reunited as a family for the first time in so long in just a couple of hours.",

He had a cellphone given to him by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to use. And he had a smile on his face. And I've been talking to him for years and years and years on a regular basis, just, you know, from Evin Prison. And you could tell that this just an unbearable pain that he was carrying, not just for what happened to him, but extraordinary guilt about his father becoming a prisoner because he tried to go visit him in jail. And so, this family has been through more than anyone can imagine. And I am just glad that their suffering has finally come to an end. Obviously, there's a long road ahead in terms of their healing, but this is nothing but an extraordinary day.",

One of the worst things that they did to Siamak was actually not even physically touching him, but after his father became a hostage and he was shown videos of his father being taken into custody at the airport. A couple of weeks later, they came in and told him that his father had died of a heart attack, and we're very sorry we're not going to be able to let you out of here in order to bury him.
