Trump insiders say he has been working with his vice presidential possibilities, testing out responses and messaging on policy. A brand new poll from Fox News shows President Biden with a two point lead. That is well within the margin of error. But this is a shift toward Biden since the last Fox poll in May. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Steve Conterno are with us now. Arlette, first to you on how the Biden campaign is getting ready for this huge moment.",

He's not doing that this time around, as far as we have heard, but he has held somewhat informal policy sessions, bringing in some of his potential V.P. picks, like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio. Senator Marco Rubio, and meeting with some other advisors as well, like Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, some of these advisers who have been talking the president through some of the policy issues they expect to come up, the economy, border, crime, abortion, as well as these wars in Gaza and Ukraine. And they have been preparing former President Trump for how he might respond to some of these attacks about his now criminal history, and as well as what happened on, on January 6th. There has also been a fair set amount of expectation setting from Trump and his allies heading into this debate. Listen to what he said on Tuesday in Racine, Wisconsin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Is anybody going to watch the debate? He's going to be so pumped up, he's going to be pumped up. You know all that stuff that was missing about a month ago from the White House? I'll probably be negotiating with three people, but that's okay, I've done that before. I'll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But, first, let's go to CNN's Rosa Flores, who is live in Corpus Christi. Rosa. You were there yesterday. We watched things happen, and now we're seeing way more flooding than we did, as this tropical storm now, the first name to the hurricane season is really battering or close to Mexico, not so much where you are.

Here's a look at Alberto right now, still a tropical storm at 50-mile-per-hour winds. We are very close to landfall this morning. But as you saw Rosa standing in the water, this is the perfect example of impacts far outside of landfall, impacts far outside of the cone.We still have a tornado watch in effect this morning from Corpus Christi down towards Brownsville, Texas, because some of these bands have a little bit of spin to them. And that's where you can get some brick and weave tornadoes to get on shore as well. Some flood watches continue, although we are expecting about an inch more of rain of parts of Texas. You can see though the coastal warnings continue as we again are still looking at some of the storm surge. Rainfall totals since yesterday, we're looking at widespread two to four inches in a lot of the yellow, but look at some of the oranges where we're seeing four to six-inch totals. In fact, for Rockport, Texas, we've got more than five inches of rain, which is an entire month's worth and then some of rain. Here's another image of some of that storm surge, the ocean water that just pushes inland with some of that onshore flow. Some of that could continue today as we still have some of those onshore winds. Two to four feet of the storm surge as possible around Galveston, some one to three feet around Corpus Christi, will continue with some of this heavy rain in parts of Mexico. Some of the showers actually stretch up into New Mexico, where we have those wildfire concerns. Sara?",

Detractors of it, critics of it say that it's blatantly unconstitutional to display them in schools and, in fact, a violation of the establishment clause of the Constitution. That is a clause that says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.Now, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed House Bill 71 into law just yesterday. It mandates poster-size displays of the Ten Commandments in large, easily readable font. This is in all public classrooms. This is from kindergarten up until state funded universities. Landry said that House Bill 71 is one of his favorites with respect to education bills that he has signed so far. Here's what else he had to say during the bill signing just yesterday.
