We're continuing our coverage of breaking news out of the Middle East where Israeli troops are still fighting against Hamas on the ground inside Israel.Two days after the militant groups' large scale surprise attack. The Israeli military is also keeping up strikes on Gaza and says it has severely degraded the capabilities of Hamas. Palestinians in that area say more than 430 people have been killed since the Israeli strikes began. Meanwhile, Hamas is claiming to have launched a major missile attack on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, with Israel saying an apartment building was hit. This comes as the militant group claims to now be holding more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including high-ranking Israeli officers. Inside Israel, the death toll from Hamas' attack has climbed past 700. At least 260 were killed at a music festival near the Israel-Gaza border. Elliot Gotkine is following all these developments for us from here. I mean, we're getting more images, aren't we, from the music festival, which is one horrific part of this story. And can only imagine what it was like to be there, but also to be a hostage from there and the families watching people taken away.",

They were performers from Brazil, France, Japan, and also attendees from those countries. We know that some of the hostages who have been taken by Hamas do hail from other countries such as Mexico, for example.And this was clearly not something that was expected. We know that there was this initial barrage of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israel. And then festival goers reporting that they heard, you know, gunfire. And we've seen, you know, dash cam footage. We've seen footage from people's phones as they were just running in terror to try to get away. And of course, we've seen those harrowing scenes of people being dragged off and hauled off on motorbikes or just taken away, their current fate unknown. And we know from the IDF and also from what Hamas was saying in terms of the hostages, there are dozens, if not more than 100 hostages now inside the Gaza Strip, and that is going to really complicate the response that Israel now takes or undertakes. We're expecting perhaps some kind of ground incursion, but what does Israel do when you're going into the Gaza Strip and you know that there are Israeli citizens and also Israeli soldiers inside the Gaza Strip being held by Hamas and other militant groups.",

Five years he was held captive He was released in exchange for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners and you can do the math. I mean, I don't even know if there are that many prisoners in Israeli jails to exchange for that kind of a map.",

And of course, this is going to be a long operation, and we are now really in the early stages of beginning to mourn a horrific massacre that we experienced two days ago, what is the biggest massacre of Israelis since the establishment of the country.

It would be a very high probability that they would be leaning towards doing a ground invasion now. There was a push for that back in 2014, the last time there was a big war between Israel and Hamas. That war was started when Hamas kidnapped three Israelis and killed three Israelis.The trigger for war is much bigger right now. Prime Minister Netanyahu has a much more right-wing coalition. So I think there's going to be a real push within Israel for a ground invasion. But yes, the presence of those hostages. really complicates matters. You run the risk that people will be killed in crossfire. If there is a ground invasion, it looks like it's going to unseat Hamas from power, remove it from power. The group could perhaps decide it has nothing to lose and execute hostages.

Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza in 2005.It doesn't have a foothold on the ground.

There is nowhere to flee.They're hemmed in on two sides by Israeli and Egyptian blockade and on the third side by the Mediterranean Sea. So the civilian casualties will be quite high, especially if there is ground fighting that goes on. street to street in densely populated neighborhoods. And with Arab states, I think it's interesting how for all of the talk in recent years about Arab-Israeli normalization, about the Abraham Accords, the response that we've heard from many Arab states has not been at all full-throated support for Israel.

That's just not going to be possible with the political situation next year. So I suspect what happens now, the Americans are still pushing for it, but the attack on Israel this weekend will certainly delay it as will the Israeli response and the scenes of war coming out of Gaza. That is not a good backdrop for the Saudis or anyone else to normalize with Israel. And I think if this gets pushed off into next year, there's a good chance that it's going to remain tabled until after the election in November.",

And from that moment, we understood that this is out of the ordinary. In other words. It's not just an attack that is maybe one or two missiles and then it's over, but there's something different about this time. And it's a high holiday for us. So we generally don't have phones, we're not connected. We don't have the ability to know what's going on. And a few hours later, we understood that once we were hostile inside the bomb shelter, we went to check our phones and we saw that there's terrorists roaming in the streets, shooting, there's missiles, that it's not possible to even leave our houses.

So it's a very volatile market to begin with.So this hasn't even reversed those losses that we saw over the past week. But I think, yeah, concern about the conflict spreading, the spectacle of things like the U.S. carrier group heading to the Eastern Mediterranean, pockets of violence seen elsewhere, the question of Iran, which is of course a major oil producer in itself, and really the only major oil producer that backs Hamas. And then of course, as you say, the diplomatic context with Saudi Arabia, this puts in doubt that diplomacy towards a normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia and potentially reduces the likelihood that Saudi Arabia would be willing to raise production, which would in turn stabilize oil prices. So there's a lot of uncertainty around this market at the moment, Max.",
