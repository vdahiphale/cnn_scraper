(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Vice President Kamala Harris, returning to Pennsylvania on Friday, where she visited two counties that were won by former president Donald Trump in 2020 and by double digits. It's a glimpse into the strategy that the campaign has been deploying, looking at those rural red counties to try to build some of her support but also peel voters off from former president Donald Trump. Now of course, the campaign has been looking at multiple pathways to get to those 270 electoral votes. But Pennsylvania is crucial in that calculus and in those strategy sessions.

Do you see him actually committing and what would be the benefits of him entering another debate with her? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think pretty clearly after this first debate, he's losing in the race, certainly at the national level. And usually the candidate who was losing is looking for opportunities to debate and calling for more debates. The twist this time is that, even before this debate, I was hearing from Republicans that they did not think that they were going to win this race, if they were going to win this race, through the interactions between Trump and Harris. Whether it was at the debate or in the daily back-and-forth in the kind of campaign dialogue. Republicans, I think are putting more of their faith in just an enormous grinding operation in the swing states, targeting her mostly with blue-collar white voters with negative advertising. They portray her as too liberal, soft on crime, soft on immigration. If they're going to win, that's how they think they're going to win. And they were skeptical even before this kind of disastrous performance by Trump, that he still, I think, had the capacity to drive the message in an effective way in these one-on-one encounters.",

BROWNSTEIN:  We're talking about seven states that are truly competitive but they are hyper competitive. I mean, polling right now has them all within basically 2, at most 2.5 points. It is an extraordinary situation where there are very few states in play. And those states are all on a knife's edge. We are talking about perhaps 100,000, 200,000 people deciding the direction of a nation of 330 million. Harris is in a pretty good position in three of them -- Michigan, Wisconsin and probably Nevada. And that means that she only needs one more of the remaining big states in order to get over the 270 Electoral College votes -- Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina. And those first two, Pennsylvania and Georgia, really look like the focus for both campaigns above all, between now and November.",

Trump is running on a much more militant agenda than he was in 2016 for 2020. He's talking about mass deportation. He says he will start in Springfield or (INAUDIBLE). He said it will be a bloody story, in some cases. He is hanging around with very far-right figures like this Laura Loomer, Laura Loomer figure that has been traveling with him in the last few days.

And yet because of their partisan loyalties, are refusing to definitively say so.

But recently the U.S. has also been arguing that actually lifting those restrictions wouldn't make much difference on the battlefield because it claims many high-value targets including aircraft that dropped those deadly glide bombs are out of range. But what exactly is in range? Well, this map from the Institute for the Study of War suggests that there are well over 200 targets still in reach of U.S. ATACMS. Those are the red dots you see there. And among them is also the headquarters of Russia's Southern Military District in Rostov and dozens of command centers, storage depots, weapons production facilities and military regiments, including, for example, the 52nd Guard Heavy Bomber Regiment believed to be responsible for a deadly cruise missile attack on an apartment block in Dnipro last January.

There was a sort of a drumbeat of expectation that this would happen. And I'm concerned that the diplomacy of this issue is not being handled effectively by Britain, the United States together.

They brought us to this place called the Philadelphi Corridor. It's emerged as a sticking point in the negotiations to get a ceasefire and to get the hostages released. As you can see, it's right up against the Egyptian border. And it's important because the Israelis say this is an area which has been used over the years as a way of smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip. Some of the smuggling has taken place over land, through presumably holes in the fence and through other border crossings. But a lot of it has been taking place right under our feet. OK. Well, this is one of those tunnels. It's right on the border with Egypt. And you can see, it is absolutely huge. Wide enough to drive a car right the way through it. The Israeli military say that this tunnel, because it's so close to the Egyptian frontier, has been used by Hamas and other militants to store weapons in and to fire rockets from. You can see here, the back of the wall, it's completely collapsed down. Apparently, it was closed for some time now. We're driving now through the neighborhood of Tel Sultan.

And those changes that you mentioned are going to roll out gradually over the next 15 years. But this is a major change for the Chinese government, which hasn't adjusted the retirement age in some 70 years. And this is playing out as the economy is slowing. And there's a number of looming demographic challenges that China's facing. Those include a rapidly aging population, a shrinking workforce as well as sinking birth rate. Right now, some 20 percent of China's population is already over 60. And that number is expected to balloon to upwards of 40 percent by the middle of the century. And we're definitely seeing that fewer young people are interested in having children. That's even as the government has relaxed that one- child policy. And so this is definitely one of those moments where the Chinese government feels a lot of urgency that they need to act. And this is going to put a lot of pressure on the pension system. So that's why we're seeing these changes now.",

It's certainly been something that has widespread attention in China.I think on Chinese social media, about 10 or five of the top 10 trending topics were related to this. And certainly some people are saying that, OK, well, this isn't as drastic as we thought it was going to be. And there are some flexibilities in terms of people being able to extend or delay that retirement age in certain situations. But at the same time, there's a lot of concern and criticism that we're seeing. And that's largely because of those economic challenges. Right now, there's high youth unemployment in China. Many people are feeling the sting of a stock market rout and a property sector crisis that's caused a lot of changes to people's livelihoods and how they're thinking about their future. So we're seeing a lot of people commenting, not just, OK, I have to delay my retirement for a few years but actually, am I going to be able to draw from that pension bucket when I get to that point? Am I going to be able to have a job when I'm 63 or 58 or 55? And a lot of young people who are struggling with unemployment are saying, OK, well, we can't find jobs and older people can't stop working. So I think we can see that, while this is addressing some of the challenges that are taking place in China right now, it's also dovetailing with a lot of these larger economic anxieties.",
