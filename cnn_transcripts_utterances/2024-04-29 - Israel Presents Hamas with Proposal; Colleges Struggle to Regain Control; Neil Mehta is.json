He is in - he's back in the Middle East right now trying to push those negotiations forward to get hostages released as they are still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza.This assessment from Blinken comes after a call Sunday between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during which President Biden also was focused in on those hostage and ceasefire talks. Let's get over to the White House. CNN's Arlette Saenz has much more for us. Arlette, what are you hearing about all of this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spent just under an hour on the phone yesterday. And a source familiar with the call said that the majority of the conversation did focus on those hostage negotiations. You really have heard U.S. officials speaking in a bit of an optimistic tone in recent days. A senior U.S. official, just days ago, said that they do believe there is an avenue for a deal. And this morning, while he was in Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel has offered a very generous proposal and said that the onus now is on Hamas to agree to this.Now, Hamas officials are currently in Cairo where they are meeting with the Egyptians and Qatari mediator to talk through a potential deal. Sources have told our colleagues in the region that it could potentially lead to the release of as many as 33 hostages in exchange for a weeks-long ceasefire. But there still, of course, is much more work to be done. Now Hamas, in recent days, has offered two proof of life videos for two of the living Americans who are believed to be still held hostage by Hamas. So, there is real - a real optimism that something could potentially come together. Now at the same time, the president also used that phone call to make clear his position when it comes to a potential Israeli operation in Rafah. U.S. officials have been warning for quite some time now that Israel must go to great lengths to try to protect and move the more than 1 million civilians who are currently in Rafah. The U.S. has been offering their counsel and advice to Israel as they are considering this operation. But the president did bring that up in his phone call yesterday with a White House readout saying that he made clear his position. But officials did tell us that the majority of that phone call was about hostage negotiations. They are quite eager to get these five Americans and the other hostages out of Gaza as soon as possible.",

New CNN polling showing Donald Trump's - Donald Trump maintains his advantage over President Joe Biden in a national survey.

So, David, what do the - what - tell me what you see in these new matchup numbers. Is their movement? DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Well, let's start with that overall national horse race again. This is a national snapshot right now. And you noted, Donald Trump maintains his lead. Here it's 49 percent among registered voters to Joe Biden's 43 percent. If you compare that to your question about movement to where we had this race in January, it's basically the same. Then it was 49 percent for Donald Trump, 45 percent for Joe Biden. That difference for Biden there, it's well within the margin of error. So that is statistically the same race you're looking at. And, Kate, quite frankly, it's been the same for the last eight months that we've been polling this race in terms of our national surveys.

Look here, 55 percent of Americans in this poll say that Trump's presidency was a success. That's almost a complete reversal of where Trump was on that question when he actually left office nearly four years ago, or three-and-a-half years ago. Joe Biden, though, you see a completely different assessment by those polled here. Thirty-nine percent called Trump's presidency - Biden's presidency currently a success, 61 percent call it a failure.And, Kate, I just want to show you his overall approval rating for the president right now. It's at 40 percent approval, 60 percent disapproval. This has just been a stubbornly consistently low approval rating for Joe Biden as he's now closing in on the final six months of this quest for a second term.

Sixty-six percent disapprove.And when you ask, how is the economy going today? What's your rating of it? Thirty percent - thirty percent of Americans say its good, 70 percent of Americans say its poor. I just want to note here that the economy is overwhelmingly the most important issue for voters. This is not insignificant. And so, while there are a ton of other issues that we discuss, and even issues that the president performs worse on, the Israel Hamas war, immigration, the economy is still front and center for people.

If he happens to have another trial before the fall election, that's a big issue. The big advantage to Democrats - two big advantages the Democrats have, one is the popular vote. Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. There's no indication that they won't win the popular vote in this election. The Electoral College still skews unfairly toward the Republicans. But the other issue is fundraising.
