And I think the president's message here is going to be about moving forward that Good Friday peace agreement. One of the signature things that it did was not just bring peace. It brought into place a power-sharing government, but that power-sharing government has stalled over disagreements about Brexit. But of course, underlying Brexit, it's all about business. So when the president does his ribbon-cutting ceremony at the university here in the center of Belfast -- a huge investment there in the future, potential education and the needs of the business community here -- that will be, I think, underscoring his message that -- develop business, improve the economy.

The street-by-street fighting has occurred. Now, certainly, Russia has more than it would probably a month ago. Absolutely. They are certainly fighting hard for the central parts of that city: the railway station, the central square, as well. That's where some of those videos over the weekend were posted from. But those scorch-earth tactics are leaving a city of questionable strategic value but now massive symbolic value, with very little left of it, frankly to conquer. And that brings to mind the essential question about what Russia's tactics really are. If they're seeking, in their warped view, to save Ukrainian citizens from their government here, then how are they destroying so much of the country they're claiming to be here to try and rescue? And also, too, strategically, what do they have left to try and defend or even get covered in, if so much of these towns they're trying to take are, in fact, destroyed? But there are still Ukrainian forces in the West, holding on quite persistently, frankly. This fight for Bakhmut, though as I say, of questionable strategic value, becoming more of a sideshow as the noise grows around Ukraine's counteroffensive, long planned by their allies -- with the assistance of allies in the West, U.S. and NATO. A lot of equipment coming in.
