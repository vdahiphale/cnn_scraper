Those are really hard things to figure out, and she has had only a couple days to go through all of the material that has been gathered here.

Her team has already conducted some rounds of interviews with them, so we got the six finalists. But right now, it's a figuring out of their strengths, that rapport. You know, the top contenders amongst the six finalists that we consistently hear mentioned is Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, it is Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. So, like you mentioned, three white men of the six, also six white men. So, there's this feeling that there should be some type of balance on the ticket in terms of gender and race. But when it comes down to it with the three of them, I mean, they do bring three different strengths with the Pennsylvania governor, Pennsylvania being such a key battleground state that Harris needs, need in her path to victory in November. Tim Walz, I mean, he's kind of the preferred candidate amongst progressives, but also has sort of that Midwest charm that could help in those battleground states in the Midwest. And then, there's Arizona Senator Mark Kelly that is very popular in his state, has more of a moderate voice, and can really speak to the immigration issues that we know are a challenge for Harris and that Republicans are really honing in on.",

So, it would be, it would obviously not be a surprise to many of us if it ends up being Shapiro and it's in Philadelphia. But they are cautioning that this decision has not been made.

Vance. And we heard Shapiro just yesterday speak very forcefully, calling him the most inorganic candidate I've ever seen.

I do not think that we can expect Kamala Harris to be agreeing to a big arena-style show of a debate. Whether it moves networks or not, I think, is an open question.

So, those sandbags are absolutely going to be necessary. So, let's take a look at where the storm is now, because it's still centered just on the southern side of Cuba, ways away from the U.S. The sustained winds are 30 miles per hour.It's got to get up to 40 miles per hour before we see that get named into Tropical Storm Debbie, but it is expected to become Tropical Storm Debbie later on today. So, because of that, you have the watches and warnings in place already, and yes, you'll even notice this pink area up here across the Big Bend area. That's a hurricane watch. That's because Hurricane Center is saying it's going to get so close. It's going to be in that 70 to 75 mile per hour range this afternoon, but a lot could change. So, there is the potential. Elsewhere along the southwestern coast it is tropical storm warnings as this storm is expected to continue to slide north. And then, the concern is it goes back out over the open Atlantic, could perhaps strengthen again, and then it's really just going to slide along many of the Atlantic Coast states, bringing a tremendous amount of rainfall to those as well. Here's why -- so, the steering mechanism, you've got a lot of things involved here. Several different high-pressure systems and the front. So, the storm is here. It's going to start to get pulled up towards this cold front here. This high-pressure system is wanting to push it a little bit off towards the east, but this high-pressure system is blocking it from going too far east. That's why it's essentially just going to ride along the coast over the next couple of days. We talked about rain, but there's also storm surge. Two to four feet for all of this yellow area you see here. That goes from basically just south of St. Mark's all the way down through Naples. And then the surrounding areas likely you get about one to three feet. And then, rainfall itself, you're talking widespread, six to 10 inches, but there will be some spots, especially if this starts to move slower, that could easily pick up a foot of rain, if not more. And then, as it continues to slide up the coast of the Carolinas, you could end up having maybe, say, four to six inches for some of those areas, even though that is still several days away.",

Take a look, you can see the entirety of it on your screen right now. In it, Austin wrote that it was his authority alone to enter into a plea agreement like this and that he had revoked the plea agreements announced only two days earlier, as well as relieving of authority the person in charge of reaching those agreements. The agreements themselves had been in the works for at least two and a half years, so can't have been a surprise to the Pentagon in the White House that these discussions were ongoing. We reported on it as well as other media outlets that there was an effort to reach the plea deal, and the deal itself was viewed as a bit of a victory in the case of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, or are more commonly known as KSM and two of his alleged co-conspirators. And that's because the cases against them were so long and complex, delayed over more than a decade, and there were significant legal questions about whether evidence could be admitted that had been obtained from KSM under torture. That made these incredibly difficult and complicated cases. In the plea deals, KSM and his two alleged co-conspirators agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy charges, as well as all of the other charges they faced, in exchange for a life sentence. The death penalty had been taken off the table. And that is why it received significant bipartisan backlash, as well as ferocious backlash from the families of the victims here. Now, the question is, where does this go from here? Austin wrote in that memo, the authority is his alone, so it's now up to the military prosecutors who have been looking at this case for so long, who had seen it delayed so long, where this goes from here, in what promised to have been a very lengthy and complicated case.

It has been on pause for several months now because the Supreme Court was working out questions of the immunity bubble around the presidency.And now, they've written an opinion that has laid out what the courts will need to decide next. Everything was on hold for procedural reasons for 32 days. And on Friday, that is when the Supreme Court formally notified the lower courts of its opinion, handed it down. And so, the case is now able to pick up speed again in the trial court. It's before Judge Tanya Chutkan of the D.C. District Court, and Judge Chutkan has a lot of leeway to do what is next or decide what she wants to do. It's very likely in the coming days that she will be asking both sides, the special counsel's office as well as Donald Trump's team, how she should be interpreting things and what they want to see happen next. And it could lead to many hearings, many filings in court, and a lot of activity in this case that has been very sleepy as the Supreme Court was working out this bigger issue. It is the only remaining federal criminal case against Donald Trump after the classified documents case, the separate case in Florida has been dismissed and closed by the judge down there. Now, the one thing, though, to remember here is that there would be a long road to trial because of the work the Supreme Court says the trial court needs to do now in this case against Donald Trump, and so don't expect any trial to happen before the presidential election in November.

Do we have Brett, you guys? Because I don't see him on the screen. OK. Just wanted to make sure. There he is. Hello, Brett. Yes. I do want to reference that sound bite that we heard, you know, from Jason's piece there, where the woman was talking about, you know, she doesn't want this to get political, but of course, it has. And of course, there is a little bit of -- there has been some criticism about these kinds of prisoner swaps. You know, that it can make Americans less safe, incentivizing more abductions of innocent Americans. And, of course, Trump is also chiming in. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Russians made a great deal. I'm not going to be criticizing it, because it's good to have him home, but they got a phenomenal deal, and that sets a very bad precedent. Very, very bad precedent. The deal is very complex because it just came out. So, nobody understands the deal yet, and they make it complex so you can understand how bad the deal is for us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

When you look at the totality of everything, there is such a contrast between the Russians getting back, basically, assassins, cyber criminals, and other criminals, and us getting back innocents. And it's always good to get back people who are innocently accused, and in some cases, you have to pay a price for it. But these people that the Russians got back are basically useless in their old jobs, in essence, and that, that is also a significant, frankly, a victory for the West.",

And now, the Iranians have talked about special operations and should now is, what do they actually mean by that? That could mean something like the missile barrage in their -- in their terminology, but it could also mean the type of terrorist attacks that we have seen the Iranians do in the past in the Middle East, as well as in other parts of the world.

What we saw in April was while, on the one hand, certainly overwhelming numbers of drones and missiles. It was also a symbolic retaliatory step.If Iran goes in that direction, then, I think we can go back to the negotiating table. But as Colonel Leighton raises, there is a real possibility, and Iran has these capabilities to strike, not only within the region, but elsewhere in the world, in retaliation, both against Israeli interests, American interests, and other allies. So, I think we have to be certainly on guard at this point, because Iran, obviously, has been filled with a new fury, and they may well exact revenge in ways that we can only start to imagine at this point.",

      "sentences": "Danny and Amara, the jobs market has clearly weakened, but it's too soon to say whether or not this is a slowdown or something more serious.Let's look at the actual numbers from the jobs report, we saw the unemployment rate unexpectedly went up to 4.3 percent that's the highest level in nearly three years. Economy added 114,000 jobs. That was a big miss. Clearly, the pace of hiring has slowed down back in March, kind of it was adding 300,000 jobs. This is significantly slowed down since then. Still adding jobs, just not by as much. Unemployment rate has gone up, noticeably higher in the last few months. The important thing to stress, though, is one bad jobs report that's not enough to say that a recession is inevitable. In fact, Moody's economist Mark Zandi, he told me that he thinks the odds still favor no recession, though he conceded the risks have gone up and it is good looking like a closer call than it was previously. Now, all of this not sitting well with investors on Wall Street, where U.S. stocks were down before the Jobs came out, and they fell even further from there. Wall Streets also pricing in a greater chance that the Fed is going to have to come to the rescue. The odds of a big rate cut, a 50-basis point cut, were pretty low before the jobs report came out. They've moved sharply higher. Economists at J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, they are predicting a 50- basis point cut at not just the September meeting, but the November meeting as well. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Jerome Powell, she went on social media to say that Powell made a serious mistake. He needs to cancel his summer vacation and cut interest rates now, not wait until September. Of course, the problem with doing an emergency rate cut is that could just undermine confidence on the -- in the market, and on Main Street even further. So, the Fed is going to probably have to wait and see how the economy evolves before deciding whether or not to cut rates in September and by how much. Danny and Amara?
