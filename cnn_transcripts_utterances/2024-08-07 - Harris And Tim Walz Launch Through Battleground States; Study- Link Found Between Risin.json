This hour, we are following breaking news out of Europe, where three of Taylor Swift`s concerts have just been canceled over an alleged planned terrorist attack. What we are learning from police about the two suspects and what all of this means moving forward for Swift`s World Tour.Plus, both vice presidential candidates are proud veterans who serve their country honorably, but Senator JD Vance is accusing Governor Tim Walz of lying about his military service. We`re going to fact check it all ahead. Leading this hour, it is their first full day as running mates, and Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Walz are blitzing the battlegrounds. This afternoon it was Wisconsin, tonight it`s Michigan, two of the blue wall states that helped deliver President Biden to the White House. But the two are also going to have to confront another challenge with polls consistently showing the border and immigration crisis as a serious concern for voters. Border State Governor Greg Abbott of Texas is going to join me in just moments. But we`re going to start with CNN Eva McKend in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the site of this afternoon`s Harris-Walz rally, as well as CNN`s Kristen Holmes in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Trump`s Mar-a-Lago resort. Eva, what did we hear from Harris and Walz in Wisconsin earlier? What can we expect to hear in their Michigan rally this evening?",

Voters here telling me they`re thrilled that Walz is now on the ticket because they say that he speaks to their Midwestern values of kindness and compassion. Walz and Harris introduced by the owner of a small family farm that argued that the ticket really could connect with rural voters. And as for the vice president, her argument really remains the same. She says that this election will boil down to fundamental freedoms, reproductive freedoms. And she maintains that if she`s elected, she will fight for everyday Americans, union workers and the middle class.

As bad as Joe Biden has been on the border, Harris-Walz will be even worse on the border if all you do is look at the policies and pronouncements they have each made. Talk about Walz, listen, he, as governor, was a magnet for illegal immigration by providing state funded benefits for illegal immigrants, by supporting things like sanctuary cities. He will be a disaster, as will Kamala Harris. If you look at the policies that she stood for when she first ran for president, and what she`s done is the person that Joe Biden handpicked to be in charge of immigration issues, you can see under Biden-Harris, we set an all-time record for the number of people across the border illegally.

Because I got to tell you with -- when you look at the concern that people have in Pennsylvania, Midwesterners in Michigan, Wisconsin, these other key states, these are people who are against the open border policies that America has separate through over the past three and a half years.
