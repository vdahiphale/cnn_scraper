Is this the leadership challenge of your life? And if you on the page, it just says, Trump says no. But when you hear the tape, and he's like, no. And it's just like, it's just, it's different.

But it does -- it did needed it to be one where it did change the trajectory for Crist, given where he is in the polls.
