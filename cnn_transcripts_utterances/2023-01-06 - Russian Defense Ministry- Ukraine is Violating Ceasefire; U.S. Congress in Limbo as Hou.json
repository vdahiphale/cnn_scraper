Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister is even warning people not to attend orthodox services due to the threat of terrorist attacks in churches. Here's what Ukraine's President had to say about the ceasefire in his highly anticipated and nightly address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, President Zelenskyy said, look, we offered a truce, a ceasefire back in mid-November that was part of President Zelenskyy's temporary peace plan. And he said at that point that we're 82000 Russian fatalities, he said then in the middle of December, we actually offered a truce for Christmas the 25th of December. That was also rejected he said by that point by mid December 95,000 Russians have been killed and he said by now 110,000 Russians have been killed. We can't verify those numbers. But what Zelenskyy is saying is look; Russia had plenty of opportunity to meet our demand for a ceasefire and a ceasefire that would have been based on Russia pulling its troops out of all the areas in its annex unoccupied inside of Ukraine. That was always a non-starter for Russia. So this was, you know, Russia's proposal was something that was never going to be accepted by Ukraine. Only going to be treated with suspicion because Putin has past form of calling for ceasefire in many different conflicts, not just in Ukraine over the past almost nine years now, but in Syria and other conflicts and then starting up the fight when he wanted to again and the way that the war is being fought in some of those intense conflict areas in the East like Bakhmut is a real, you know, not quite hand to hand, but very proximate battle for tiny gains and losses of meters of territory. So any chance that Russia had to bring troops or bring material forward to the frontline that was always going to be threatened by concern for Ukraine.

The U.S. House of Representatives is set to reconvene less than an hour from now, asthe historic leadership stalemate in Congress drags into its fourth day. Republican Kevin McCarthy is trying to secure the required numbers of votes to become House Speaker. So far, he's come up short 11 times as a handful of members in his own party refuse to support him. A short time ago McCarthy sounded optimistic about what's ahead today. So what can we expect in the minutes and hours ahead? CNN's Jessica Dean joins us now live from Capitol Hill. Eleven votes later 20 holdouts for McCarthy. We're sitting with an unprecedented scenario. There was a Republican call in the last hour has anything come from that? Do we know anything more?",

He needs to show that he can make progress that he can pull some people to his side. This continues to go on and on and on, as you just lay out. And his supporters want to see him make it to the finish line, but they don't have bottomless patience. They want to see some progress that he can actually start to move some of these members. So he is, according to him close on that. But again, there are some questions about just how many? And even if he can bring over say 10 or 12, he still doesn't have the 218 that he needs. So the question becomes when they meet today at noon, will they immediately go into another vote to try to show some of that progress? Will they have more votes? Or will they immediately adjourn and try to continue negotiating? The negotiations do continue. They're trying to cross the \"T's and dot the I's\". But what I think is important to remember, Eleni in all of this is, this is group isn't coming with two or three specific asks, each of these members kind of have their own specific asks that they want that are individual to them. And that is a lot harder to kind of cobble together. So he continues to make concessions and continues to try to do the splits between these holdouts, and then also the more moderates who honestly are starting to get a little nervous about what's being given to the hardliners.

They are concerned somewhat that he's making a lot of concessions, meaning that he is turning over certain rules that normally wouldn't be given to what is called the House Freedom Caucus, a very conservative or very far right wing of the Republican Caucus. We've outlined those rules they have asked for a position on the Rules Committee. They've asked for votes on term limits on budgets. They've also asked for one person to put forth a motion to vacate, which could in essence, mean that Kevin McCarthy could anger and frustrated one person and they could hold a vote to remove him from that position.

Now, if you're sitting at home, and you're worried about the price of groceries, you know, you're not happy that wage growth is slowing down. I mean, have you seen egg prices? Egg prices are up by 49 percent year-over- year in November. But believe it or not, this is actually what the Federal Reserve wants to see? They want to see that wages are cooling off, because it's going to give them more confidence that inflation is not out of control. It's going to lower the risk of a wage price spiral where the high cost of living causes workers to demand higher and higher wages, which forces businesses to pass the cost along to consumers, causing them to demand higher wages. It can become a negative feedback loop and it's exactly what the Fed doesn't want to see. So that's why markets are responding so positively to the wage number of the fact that payroll growth itself actually slowed down. That is encouraging. The one part of this report that doesn't look as encouraging from the standpoint of trying to get a Goldilocks jobs report is unemployment, right? Because unemployment rate actually went down to 3.5 percent, that's tied for the lowest level since 1969. Big picture, though, right now investors are focusing on this idea that the jobs market is slowing down, and maybe Eleni that means the Fed can pause this interest rate hiking campaign sometime later this winter or the spring.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Bryan Kohberger clad in an orange jumpsuit appeared in an Idaho courtroom Thursday. The 28-year-old is charged with the brutal stabbings of four University of Idaho students more than seven weeks ago. In newly released court documents investigators detail the evidence that led to his eventual arrest. According to the affidavit Kohberger's DNA profile obtained from the trash at his family's home match DNA on a tan leather knife sheath left behind at the crime scene and was found lying on the bed of one of the victims. That same document says one of the surviving roommates says she was awoken around 4 am her crying from Xana Kernodle's room and heard a voice say it's OK I'm going to help you and that she heard the crying and saw a figure clot and black clothing and a mask. She describes him as 5.10' or taller male not very muscular but athletically built with bushy eyebrows, saying he walked past her as she stood in a frozen shock phase. But questions still remain about why no one called 911 until almost eight hours later? The document also details multiple sightings of a suspect vehicle from surveillance footage showing a white Hyundai were like this one that helped lead to Kohberger's arrest. About two weeks after the murders police from Washington State University where Kohberger attended school flagged his vehicle later seen at a traffic stop in mid-December in Indiana while driving with his father to Pennsylvania. And before the cross country drive and just five days after the murders Kohberger received a new license plate for his car according to Washington State Licensing Documents. Cell phone records also show that Kohberger's phone was near the victim's residence at least a dozen times since June, including about five hours after police believe he committed the murders according to court documents. Kohberger seated with a new court appointed attorney responded to each charge of murder. While no evidence was released that connects Kohberger to the victims or any indication of motive.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Moscow wants to use Christmas as a cover to give Russia time to resupply. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the 36 hour unilateral ceasefire Thursday saying it was for Orthodox Christmas. Meanwhile, the war has battered Ukraine's economy but not as harshly as initially feared. The projected contraction in gross domestic product for 2022 is just over 30 percent. Experts initially forecast it would plunge between 40 to 50 percent. The Economy Minister says this is still the largest economic downfall since Ukrainian independence in 1991. For more on how the war is impacting Ukraine's economy, let's bring in Alexander Rodnyansky, he's an Economic Adviser to the Ukrainian President and an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. Good to see you, sir. The economy falling less than expected good news, but 30 percent wiped off GDP is significant. Could you describe the economy right now?

But you're right, that this is surprisingly good news, actually, given everything that we've observed and given the expectations. So first of all, that goes to show how resilient the Ukrainian economy really is. And we've seen that despite a huge collapse in the industry, in the heavy industry, we've seen all the destruction in the east of Ukraine, there's been a lot of relocation and even maybe some little amount of growth in the services sector and perhaps in some of the high tech sectors like IT. And what's also important is that there's been a lot of heterogeneity across Ukraine. So while certain areas that are very exposed to the, to the combat to the fighting to the actual warfare, they've been really clearly losing up. Some of the areas of Ukraine have perhaps in certain sectors even gained some of the output because of the relocation that's occurred throughout Ukraine. So there's, you know, there's a huge amount of heterogeneity differences across regions. And finally, we've also seen as in the banking sector, so surprisingly, you know, I've been on the Supervisory Board of our biggest bank for nearly two years. And what we see is a lot of growth in small medium enterprises that come to us asking for working capital loans, for example. And again, that's mostly in agriculture and some of the services like IT. So long story short, the Ukrainian economy is resilient. But of course, to a large extent, a lot of this has been possible because we have been receiving international support. I'm very grateful for that because if we hadn't received international support financial aid, that is, we would have faced the real currency crisis, and we would have lost our macroeconomic stability so none of that would have been possible.",

And we were working on that, we had a strategy of privatization. But right now, the share of the state is actually rising rather than falling. So it's around 60 perhaps, 60 percent perhaps as, as of total assets. But that's obviously you know, during more time, so it's not really the primary objective to have it privatized now. But it is very resilient, it's healthy, because we've run through history of reforms in the banking sector, we've adopted a lot of the Basel regulations, you know, modern state of the art banking regulations. And we are working on ensuring that we have a healthy and resilient financial sector that is primarily banking based. So it's not really we don't have really developed markets or capital markets, you know, bond markets, as in the U.S., but we have a very strong banking sector. So there's little, you know, not very much bank to bank lending, as you said, there is a fair amount of lending to small medium enterprises. Now it's actually growing to some extent.",

I'm also justcurious in terms of whether you've become a lot more indebted since the start of the war. You spoke about international assistance.

So that is really the primary force. But we're also obviously, you know, building up the amount of debt that we're having. We're issuing bonds; we're asking for international credits, a lot of international support comes through loans, but mostly through grants, thankfully. And of course, we're hoping that, you know, at some point towards the future, when we've been when we will be victorious after the war, perhaps we'll have some more, you know, reconsideration of how we're going to structure that debt. Or perhaps we're just going to have very strong economic support and real high economic growth such that we will be able to stem a lot of that debt repayment. But that's again, secondary right now, although we are monitoring what's happening to the debt to GDP ratio, it's probably around some 100 percent right now, it used to be around 50 percent before the war.",

It is important for the worldat large, obviously, because you remember what happened when Russia was using, you know, essentially the food crisis as a way to bargain for whatever they need and to extort whatever decisions they wanted internationally and then try to blame us. We have to say we are very careful with mentioning the numbers that we're making through that grain expert, because again, if the Russia, if Russia decides that we're benefiting too much read, there is real chance that they will sabotage. But I will say the numbers are far and few between much smaller than it used to be before the work of course. We have a very open economy used to have very open economy before the war; about 50 percent of our GDP was exports. Much of that was through the ports of Odessa. So again, a lot of that was grain, but now it's really it's very little relative to what we used to export, but we're hoping we can keep it running. And obviously once we're victorious, we can reestablish those supply routes.",

Now, anew Alzheimer's drug could soon be approved by the U.S. Food Drug Administration. The experimental medication has shown potential, but has also raised safety concerns because of the potential side effects. Dr. Sanjay Gupta breaks it down for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): At first, the signs can be subtle, missing your exit on the freeway, forgetting what you need at the grocery store, misplacing your keys. JACK DRISCOLL, ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL PATIENT: I'll look at my phone and read the names and a lot of them don't mean anything to me. DR. GUPTA (voice over): Your life marches on independently, but the markers of memory slowly, surely begin to fade. That's what early Alzheimer's feels like. When 80 year old Jack Driscoll got his own Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2019, he was doing OK. But he worried what his future would eventually have in store.",

GUPTA (voice over): So in 2021, Jack enrolled in a clinical trial for an experimental drug called Lecanemab. Now pending approval by the FDA, this drug could help postpone the fate of those with early Alzheimer's, in part by removing amyloid plaques from the brain. DR. RICHARD ISAACSON, PREVENTIVE NEUROLOGIST: We're finding that this specific type of amyloid when removed actually associates or correlates with a slowing of cognitive decline. DR. GUPTA (voice over): Most importantly, clinical trials of the drug found that it slowed cognitive decline in people with early Alzheimer's by 27 percent. What does that mean? According to models by the drug maker, someone who was 80 like Jack could experience a two to three year delay in progression to worsening of his Alzheimer's disease. DR. ISAACSON: We've been targeting Alzheimer's disease at the end stage when people have dementia where they can no longer take care of themselves in the pathology and the plaques and the tangles have built up. And by that time, there's not as much we can do. DR. GUPTA (voice over): But nothing comes without risks. And the ones that come with this type of drug have raised red flags. DR. SHARON COHEN, MEDICAL DIRECTOR, TORONTO MEMORY PROGRAM: We have known for many years that with almost all of the drugs in this class, there can be a side effect of ARIA. DR. GUPTA (voice over): Dr. Sharon Cohen has been studying Alzheimer's drugs for 30 years and was part of the clinical trial for Lecanemab. What she is talking about ARIA is amyloid related imaging abnormality. It can look like this, or this. It's brain swelling or brain bleeding. Though Cohen says these types of side effects were mostly mild in the trial. DR. COHEN: We do know that Lecanemab has a low rate of causing macro hemorrhage not necessarily fatal, but a low rate less than 1 percent. DR. GUPTA (voice over): In the phase three clinical trial, there were seven deaths in the placebo group and six deaths in Lecanemab group. According to the investigators, though, none of the deaths were considered to be due to Lecanemab or ARIA. The New England Journal of Medicine recently published details of an additional death of a patient on the drug who had been given blood thinners raising additional concerns. DR. COHEN: It's pretty hard to say Lecanemab caused that when you're giving a drug that itself can cause significant bleeding. However, the combination gives us pause. DR. GUPTA (voice over): Neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson agrees that while this drug shows promise, it must come with caution, for example, avoiding blood thinners while taking the medication. DR. ISAACSON: I will prescribe this drug in the right person at the right dose and in a very carefully monitored way. But this drug is not for everyone. DR. GUPTA (voice over): For Jack, the possibility of continuing to live a full life spending quality time with all four children and all nine grandchildren, even for just a while longer. Well, that is worth the risk.",
