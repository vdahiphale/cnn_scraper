I mean, stranded vehicles. This aerial drone shot just really speaks volumes to what they have had to deal with. That was again on Wednesday night. But, of course, we still have our flood warning in place for Fort Lauderdale. This includes the airport. That is valid through 8:00 a.m. this morning. The current radar generally quiet, there are a few pop up showers starting to form just east of the coastline there. But when you look at the rainfall totals, this is interesting because we have to put an asterisk next to Fort Lauderdale. Climatologists are out kind of assessing the rain gauges that are in and around Fort Lauderdale, and they're going to determine whether or not a 24-hour state rainfall record was actually shattered by over two and half inches, previous record set back in 1980 Key West. So that really puts this into historical context, right? That is a lot of rain in a short period of time. No wonder we saw the flooding. Look at the storm system responsible. It's pulling away kind of weakening. There are a few showers that will pop up later today. They could cause locally heavy rain in Fort Lauderdale, maybe adding to some more misery, won't take much for that saturated ground to start to see rapid rises in rivers and ponding.

There are many things, there were many of the problems before they were already the yellow vests before the pension reform. So there has been anger for a long time before.
