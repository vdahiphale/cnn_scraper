There were allegations that he showed pictures on the House floor of naked women telling other members, I had sex with her. I had sex with her. Gaetz has denied all of it. He says none of it is true, it is all a big smear campaign against him, but the question of this report is important because, look at the timing here. This report was supposed to come out today. We were all supposed to have it today. It was going to be public today. He gets this nod from Donald Trump Wednesday.

Washington considers Syria a state sponsor of terrorism, when she says Assad is not the enemy, because Syria does not pose a direct threat. Pete Hegseth, Fox presenter, potential DefSec is against women serving. He says it makes it more complicated. Women account for nearly a fifth of active duty for our forces. And Matt Gaetz, who we've been talking about, has called on the Justice Department to abolish the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the ATF. He was objecting to its regulation of firearms. If he becomes AG, he is pretty much in charge of it, along with the FBI. Jim Sciutto is in Washington. We talked about it and I said we were going to do this today.

Look at Tulsi Gabbard. She has, you know, the week that Russia invaded Ukraine, she assigned blame for that invasion on the Biden administration and NATO, as opposed to Russia that was sending the tanks across the border. In addition to as you say, saying, Bashar al-Assad, the murderer of many thousands of his own people, is not necessarily the enemy of the US. You know Hegseth against women in the military, but also is a proponent of Trump's America First agenda, which will mean real changes around the world.
