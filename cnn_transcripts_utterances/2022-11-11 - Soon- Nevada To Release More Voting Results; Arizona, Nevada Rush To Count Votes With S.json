At This Hour, we are expecting a key state to release new voting numbers, control of Congress still hangs in the balance of course. In the Senate, Republicans are holding 49 seats and Democrats with 48.In Arizona, the states are outstanding and remaining the one of the key ones being Arizona, no winner has been declared in Arizona. In that key race, the Democratic Senator Mark Kelly holding a small lead over his challenger the Republican Blake Masters. We're also moments away from getting these new numbers in Nevada, where Republican Adam Laxalt is narrowly ahead of Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. But Masto as we've been seeing has been closing the gap as the vote totals have been coming in for watching this one very closely. Let's look at the House right now. Republicans, they need just seven seats to win back the majority. But more than two dozen House races are still outstanding. So, we will see after that much talked about red wave failed to materialize in the way that was expected. Donald Trump is waging something of a war against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, as Trump is lashing out. The former president is slamming his fellow Republican just days before he could be announcing a 2024 run for the White House. Clearly a very fluid situation that we've been tracking, recovering all of it for you across the country. Let's start with John Berman on these outstanding races. What are you seeing now, John?",

And so, Adam Laxalt, the Republican leads by about 9,000 votes, that gap is shrinking, yesterday it was 15,000. Most of the day, votes had been tabulated and released overnight.In Clark County, also on Washoe County, which helped Catherine Cortez Masto the Democrat close this to 9,000. Again, I'm very curious to see where these new counts are reported from. And if they close the gap, and Kate, I put this slide together just for you. I wanted to point out in Nevada, this can be very close. But you know what? It's been very close in Nevada before. This was the 1998 Senate race between Harry Reid and John Ensign, two people who I know you covered actually on Capitol Hill. And just look at the difference in vote total there. Harry Reid won that race by 401 votes, 401 vote. So, things can be very, very close in Nevada. While I have you, let me just tell you quickly about Arizona. Nearby, you have Mark Kelly, Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat ahead by 115,000 votes, Blake Masters, he is trailing. I put it out last hour that Maricopa County has, you know, 340,000 votes left to report, 290,000 of that are mail ballots that were delivered on election day. What we saw two years ago, is those ballots tended to tilt more Republican than the other mail ballots. We are very curious. We just don't know if that will be the case this time. So, when those votes are reported, and what we will see tonight from Arizona will include stuff from that batch. We will have a much better sense of which way Arizona is headed. Blake Masters has to do very well. I mean, very, very well, in that vote total to have any hopes of closing that gap of 115,000. Kate?",

He's standing by in Phoenix, where that vote count still very much underway. Josh, our official saying, explaining more because it's starting to become a question, you've been reporting on it.

      "sentences": "Yes. Actually, the head of elections here in Maricopa County, Republican Bill Gates told us yesterday that in his words, the goalposts are moving a bit. And that is because they're still trying to process these 290,000 votes that John Berman was just talking about.And the reason that is key is because if you vote on election day, that is typically tabulated here very quickly that night or the next morning. But what they actually end up finding out in this county, the most populous county in the state of Arizona, is that a record number of people had mail-in ballots, but rather than dropping them in the mail, they decided to take them to a polling location on election day and drop off those ballots. And so that takes additional time, because they have to go through and look at signatures. They have to ensure that the voting information matches up. And so as far as timing, we're all wanting to know when this will be wrapped up and that is going to take some additional time. Those 290,000 ballots are going to be key for us to watch. As these tranches continue to come out, we expect another release today, perhaps throughout the weekend, we're going to be looking for patterns. Are they skewing more towards Democrats? Are they skewing more towards Republicans? We're trying to discern where this is possibly going to go because we know that some Republican leaders in the state actually urge their supporters to vote just by this very method to take the ballot on election day to the ballot box. So, we can learn a lot about what is coming ahead. And as John was mentioning, these vote totals are so close these margins and the Senate race and obviously in the gubernatorial race, we're keeping our eyes on the votes here. But election officials are telling us to please be patient. They know that the country wants these results, but they're doing it as fast as they can, Kate?",

But again, we should point out that this does not mean the process is not working. It means it is working. But of course, all eyes as Josh was just saying, there are on Nevada. But particularly Arizona, there's a sense that once we get sort of an idea of what that universe of those ballots are that were mailed, the 290,000 ballots.Once we have a sense of a sampling of those, you know, who has more of a share of those. Mark Kelly or Blake Masters, there will be a sense of where this race is going. Yes, Senator Kelly has the lead and they're pretty optimistic. The Democrats I speak to pretty optimistic about Arizona. But we've seen many examples of how this can change. And as Josh was also saying, Republicans were urging their voters to vote exactly like this, so late early they call them near election day, and then taking them in. So, we'll just have to wait and see. But Arizona is closer to a resolution or a result most likely than Nevada. But look, all eyes are on Arizona and Nevada. Even at the same time as Georgia right now, both sides are descending on the state of Georgia to prepare for that runoff. We don't know if that will hinge on control of the Senate.

If Democrats continue to perform well in these late counted votes, then they're in a prime position in both Arizona and Nevada and their campaign seem pretty optimistic. [12You do hear Democrats saying that the path is very clear for them to be able to win both of those seats. And if they are able to win Arizona and Nevada that makes Georgia slightly less important because it doesn't determine who's going to control the Senate. It's still going to be an important race. It's still a six-year term for whoever wins that race. But if Democrats can win Arizona and Nevada, they'll breathe a very big sigh of relief, even as they try to put in a lot of support into Georgia, did to make sure they win that state as well, and have a little bit more breathing room with a Senate majority of 51 as opposed to just 50-50.",

You didn't have to scratch the surface to find Republicans say, oh, no, we got this one in the bag. Even on Tuesday, election day, they, well, very confident about what was going on there.But the mail vote, the MAIL vote, the mail-in vote has been very favorable to Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic incumbent and she's been getting margin. She's been over 60 percent here in Clark County in the mail-in vote, even though her overall total in this county is right around 51. Her totals for the mail and that's what's being counted now is well over 60 percent. And if she maintains those margins and the 57,000 votes here, and the 22,000 votes here in Washoe County. Again, she's been getting over 60 percent of the mail-in vote here and she's only at 50 percent. Overall, you know she could overtake Adam Laxalt. One thing I should point out well, I have control of the wall here. You can see the margins in the Senate race. You know, the governor's races are a little bit different in both Arizona and Nevada. In Nevada, Joe Lombardo the Republicans in a better position than Adam Laxalt. Steve Sisolak, the incumbent governor has more ground to make up there for sure. And it's the same situation in Arizona. Yes, Katie Hobbs, the Democratic Secretary of State is ahead of Kari Lake, but not by as much as Mark Kelly. A much bigger margin for the Democrats here and there is some feeling that Mark Kelly might hold on even as more Republican leaning votes are counted in Arizona, but that Kari Lake will be able to overtake Katie Hobbs because you see the margin is much, much smaller in the governor's race.

Really surprising a lot of people on the Biden campaign and he traveled there repeatedly during the runoff last year.He traveled there a few times in 2021, earlier this year, but since then, has not been there. But it almost doesn't matter because Joe Biden is so present in Georgia, in television ads, in billboards, in mailers coming up in people's mailboxes, with Republicans trying to tie Senator Warnock to the policies of the administration and to Joe Biden himself. So, I would be stunned if President Biden went to Georgia. We also didn't see Vice President Harris going to Georgia during this period.
