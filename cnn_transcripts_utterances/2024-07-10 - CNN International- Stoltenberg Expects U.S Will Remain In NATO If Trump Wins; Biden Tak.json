I'm Paula Newton in New York.Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, all eyes on Washington, as NATO leaders huddle in the U.S. capital alongside President Biden. We are live at the summit with a look at today's agenda. This comes on the heels of the Ukrainian President's meeting with top lawmakers on Capitol Hill. His urgent message to them, Ukraine can't wait until after the November election for help. We are live in Kyiv with the latest. Plus, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pleads with Democrats to hold their criticism of Joe Biden until after the NATO summit. But, will her call to calm fears now -- will her call calm fears now gripping the party? I'll discuss with my political panel. So, it's fair to say U.S. President Joe Biden has the eyes and the weight of the world on him today, as the firestorm over his candidacy spills onto the world stage. Next hour, Mr. Biden is expected to officially welcome more than 30 leaders from NATO member states to the summit going on right now in Washington. On Tuesday, the President kicked off the summit by sending a very clear message, the United States will not waver in its support of Ukraine. Now, earlier, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addressed growing global concerns the U.S. could pull out of NATO if Donald Trump returned to the White House next January. Listen.

One is that it is in the U.S. security interest to have a strong NATO. NATO is good for Europe, but it's also good for United States. It makes the United States stronger and safer because in NATO, the United States has something no other ally -- no other major power has. And that is more than 30 friends and allies. Russia doesn't have that. China does not have that. The United States has NATO, makes the United States stronger.(END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON: CNN Senior White House Correspondent MJ Lee joins us now from the summit.

I want to thank you for your insights here, as we try and parse what is supposed to be a celebration. And I want to bring your framing of this to viewers. You say this summit will either celebrate history or make history. You say those allies need to do more than show unity and stand for a photo op. So, I ask you, how consequential are the coming hours in terms of delivering? FABRICE POTHIER, FMR. NATO POLICY PLANNING DIRECTOR, &amp; CEO, RASMUSSEN GLOBAL: Well, sadly, I think the answer is already saved and prepared. There is already a declaration that is -- we are waiting to read. And it seems that we are going to see more celebration of history than NATO leaders, including the U.S. President, willing to take the risk of making history, and by this, I mean of welcoming Ukraine as a new member of the alliance. Until we do so, I think the war will keep on going, and we will have to keep on managing a war with more of basically a survival strategy for Ukraine and a winning strategy.",

The anti-missile and drone systems were promised after Monday's deadly missile -- Russian missile strike on Kyiv's children's hospital and other attacks, of course, right across Ukraine that killed more than 40 people. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live for us in Kyiv. Fred, I do note that Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the F-16s will be flying in Ukraine by the summer. Also Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General, said earlier that what you are seeing right now on the ground are hostile acts that are trying -- that Russia is really trying hard to make sure that they weaken NATO's resolve with Ukraine.

We heard that in President Biden's speech when he was speaking about additional Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, but also dozens of short and medium range surface-to-air Missile systems as well, obviously, to keep Ukrainian cities safer than they are right now. You see the damage behind me from that missile strike that took place on that children's hospital. But then, of course, also the Ukrainian Air Force, and that's something for the Ukrainians is very important, as they are -- for their frontline troops, but very important for the cities in Ukraine as well. You mentioned to Secretary of State Blinken speaking about those F- 16s, which he said could be flying here in the summer. I want to listen in to a little more of what he had to say. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm also pleased to announce that as we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is underway, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands, and those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.

He said \"This is a clear signal that Russia's ability to terrorize Ukrainian people, cities, and communities will continue to reduce. F-16s will also be used to bolster Ukraine's air defense. I am confident that they will be -- that they will assist us in better protecting Ukrainians from brutal Russian attacks, such as this week's strike on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv\". That, of course, is exactly the place where I'm standing right now.So, the Ukrainians certainly hope that getting those F-16s and getting additional surface-to-air missile batteries and also of course interceptor missiles as well will help them a great deal in defending not just the civilians here in this country, but their frontline troops as well, Paula.",

It was interesting, because one of the things that the Ukrainian President talked about is that he was looking forward to drastic action by NATO, obviously increasing not just air defense and those jets, as we've seen now from NATO, but also, of course, many other areas as well. And I think it's a mix of several things.One of the things that Ukrainians have been saying that they haven't been getting enough of, and we talked about this so much over the past couple of months, is pretty much all forms of munitions, whether it's artillery rockets, whether it's artillery ammunition, especially 155- millimeter shells, the Ukrainians say that is something that needs to happen. It needs to happen quickly. Now, of course, we know, Paula, that European countries and the U.S. have been ramping up their production. And certainly, it seems as though some of that could hit to the Ukrainian battlefield fairly quickly, if the production does continue to scale up the way that it has been. But, the other things that the Ukrainians have also been talking about is more longer-range weapons, like, for instance, those U.S. ATACMS missiles. And of course, the thing that really the Ukrainians really want is they want to be able to use weapons like that to strike deep into Russian territory. The Ukrainians, of course, saying that is where Russia's jets take off from. That is where a lot of Russian missiles are launched from. And those are the areas that the Ukrainians wants to hit. So, it's really a mix of a lot of military gear that the Ukrainians need, sophisticated military gear that they say they need, but also the ways that they want to be able to use them, and that's definitely going to be something that the Ukrainians have said that they are going to raise at this NATO summit, Paula.",

But, it does really symbolize this closing chapter of Nikki Haley and Donald Trump being complete and total political enemies in many ways. And she did say, I will argue, earlier this year in May, she dropped out of the race in March, but in May, she did come out and say that she would vote for Donald Trump. But, this is really a symbolic move of her releasing these delegates to him at the convention. I say symbolic because there was no question at this point that Donald Trump is going to receive the Republican nomination next week in Milwaukee. He already has the necessary amount of delegates to do that.But, this is just another sign of more skeptical Republicans who are stepping up and lining up behind Donald Trump, even those who have previously and repeatedly attacked him in the past. And I will argue as well that Nikki Haley had said in her statement on this that part of the reason she was making this move is because if you look at Joe Biden, she does not think that he is fit to serve for another four years, questions that many people within the Democratic Party itself are currently grappling with. Now, another interesting thing I want to point out is that Haley is not expected to attend the convention next week. Her spokesperson said that she was not invited. So, I think the fact that Donald Trump and his team did not personally invite the former South Carolina governor to Milwaukee to attend the convention just shows again that they're not completely on great terms. We know that Trump had shut down speculation that perhaps he would pick Nikki Haley as his running mate. That is not something he is considering, I'm told, according to my conversations with many of Donald Trump's advisors and allies. But, this is a step toward more of that unity again, even though, like you mentioned, Paula, Nikki Haley had very sharp words for him in the past.",

I want to note the news just into CNN that George Clooney now saying that the Democratic Party needs a new nominee. Add to that, Senator Michael Bennet, in a CNN interview Tuesday night, saying this in the face of Biden resolve to stay in the race. [11:25:00] Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House. So, for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country. And I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face, if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again. (END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON. Meghan, to you first, and also the news that George Clooney has said, is being very categorical and blunt. He obviously feels that he in defiance of Joe Biden has to come out and say this. Why? MEGHAN HAYS, DNC CONVENTION CONSULTANT, &amp; FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE AND PLANNING: Look, I think that this is what the campaign and the White House would refer to as the elites, the chattering class. So, I don't know if they're going to put a lot of stock in what George Clooney is saying here. But, I do think that the President has been taking his case to the American people since the debate happened. He has been in Pennsylvania. He has been in Wisconsin. He goes to Michigan on Friday. He has been at NATO for the past few days. He did an interview. He has been speaking to folks and out talking to voters. So, I think that he is doing what he needs to do to show people that the debate was a bad night, and that he is ready to serve for another four years. The press conference tomorrow at NATO will be a really big determinant of where the party stands with him, if the House members and the senators still continue to stay in his corner. So, I just -- there is a lot of pieces moving around here. But, the President has been really affirmative, and that he is not dropping out, and that he is not stepping aside. So, I think that the Democratic Party needs to make a decision at some point, whether we're going to continue to fight about Joe Biden's age or if we're going to continue -- or we're going to turn and fight to Donald Trump, because we're kind of missing the plot here on what the important thing is in November.",

And that's one thing that I think Donald Trump has gotten right, in listening to his advisors and rather keeping mum on the issue of everything that's percolating within the echo chambers here in D.C., but also looking at the situation and pulling back and saying this could be a very different convention for the Republicans. For many months, folks like myself, and I'm a former convention delegate, and longtime party insider, having served in my local Republican Party at various levels in years past, I can tell you, we thought we were looking for at a broker convention because of Donald Trump's convicted felon status. So, again, in this very changed moment, a very charged moment, the Republicans could really benefit from a convention that sounds more hopeful than Donald Trump's rallies, that continues to take the message to voters that says you can't trust the Democrats. That's how Republicans can win. Now, do I trust Donald Trump to exhibit this type of message, discipline at the convention? That's a different story. I don't really think he'll be good at it.

The nationwide death toll in Ukraine has reached at least 44 after Monday's Russian missile strikes. Meantime, the UN said a direct hit by Russia likely damaged Kyiv's children's hospital. Meantime, at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, in light of recent Russian hostilities, he expect allies to agree on substantial aid package for Ukraine. So, at this hour, a manhunt is underway in and around London, as police search for this man who they say may be armed with a crossbow. 26-year-old Kyle Clifford from north London is being sought in connection with the deaths of three women.
