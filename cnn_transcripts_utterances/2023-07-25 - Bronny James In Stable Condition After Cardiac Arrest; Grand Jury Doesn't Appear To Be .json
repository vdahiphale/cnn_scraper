We begin though with Bronny James now in stable condition after suffering cardiac arrest. This happened while the 18-year-old son of LeBron James was practicing yesterday. The family said that medical staff were able to treat the young basketball star, take him to the hospital where he is now out of the ICU where he was originally, and in stable condition. The 11th ranked college recruit in the nation committed to Southern California just back in May. CNN's Natasha Chen joins us now from outside the athletic facility at USC. Natasha, what do we know? What's the latest on his condition and how this happened?",

There was a call about an unconscious player, and we know from astatement from the James family that Bronny James suffered a cardiac arrest, that the USC medical staff were able to treat him right away, take him to a hospital, where as you said, now he is out of the ICU in stable condition, so that is good news. The heart of the James' family statement, I want to read to you here. It says: \"LeBron and Savannah wish to publicly send their deepest thanks and appreciation to the USC medical and athletic staff for their incredible work and dedication to the safety of their athletes.\" Now the James family was just seen in public about two weeks ago at the ESPY Awards where James was receiving an award, standing up there with his children that he called his greatest blessing, and he specifically referenced his two sons saying how proud he is of these two young men standing there on their own basketball journey. LeBron James saying that no matter how far they choose to go, \"They are not cheating this game and that inspires me.\" This is actually the second time in about a year that USC staff here have had to jump into action like this. Just last July, forward Vince Iwuchukwu also had a cardiac arrest right here in the same place also during a practice. In that situation, he took about half a year or more to recover, and wasn't actually cleared to play again until this January. So the fact that we're hearing about Bronny James now being out of the ICU and stable is good news. We will be tracking this to find out more about his recovery process -- Jim.",

He is 20 years older than his son and we have watched them both grow up. And so in many ways, they're ours. You know, we have a feeling and a spirit, a kindred spirit with them that might not occur with other athletes. And with LeBron saying that he would like to stick around long enough so that he could play with his son or sons, Bronny being the older of the two, Jim, I think that really, you know, that hits home because so many people can think of their son or daughter. We know Tiger Woods has talked about his two kids playing sports, his son playing golf, his daughter playing other sports, and they want -- you know, he wants to be able to play with them. And so I think it's the same thing with LeBron, which makes this all the more poignant and meaningful for so many millions of Americans today.",

Well, LeBron, there were so many paths that LeBron could have taken himself, being so young, so famous, cover of \"Sports Illustrated,\" going right to the pros out of high school from Akron, Ohio, and the path he took was perfect.You know, he's never been in trouble. He's never -- we've never heard stories about him. The worst thing that LeBron himself may have done is say he wanted to take his talents to South Beach, which is nothing in the scheme of behavior problems or issues that we've seen, certainly from other athletes over the years, especially those athletes who have so much happen so soon in their lives. LeBron got it. He understood he needed to have adults around him, he understood he was a role model for Northern Ohio, for the NBA. He has such a presence about him, such intelligence, and such poise, and he has passed that on to his kids, his two sons, and then his daughter, with his wife, of course, and he has understood the meaning of sport, the meaning of role models, the understanding that you're going to be watched as young kids. He has instilled all of that on his two boys in particular, of course, his daughter is younger, and that's what we've seen. And so I think that's why there is such a -- you know, a sense of, wow, you know, LeBron loves to be a dad. He loves to be a pro- basketball player, but he really loves being a dad, as you said, coaching his sons, also just being there to cheer them on.",

It comes as special counsel, Jack Smith continues taking steps in the investigation. Former New York City Police Commissioner and Trump ally, Bernie Kerik just turned over thousands of pages of records. He, alongside former Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani led the Trump campaign's probe into false claims of voter fraud. National security reporter, Zach Cohen joins us now.

Prosecutors, as you mentioned, just received hundreds of new documents from Bernie Kerik, who was acting really as an investigator on behalf of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney at the time and Kerik's job was really just to find any evidence that could back up these baseless claims of widespread voter fraud that we know Trump and his allies, including Giuliani were pushing at the time.And what these documents show is really the baselessness of the claims themselves. They really provide no concrete evidence of anything that Trump and his legal team were pushing at the time including in their lawsuits at the time. So interesting new evidence there. It remains to be unclear how this will fit into the investigation itself. We know Trump has already been told he is a target in the probe. So we want to keep an eye on that. And we're also learning new details about another avenue that Jack Smith is exploring. He has been asking witnesses about a February 2020 Oval Office meeting. This meeting happened months before, you know, December 2020 Oval Office meeting where these ideas like seizing voting machines were pitched, right?",

Even if he found absolutely nothing, and I'm not surprised, given that they claims that Trump made were baseless. You know, his -- you know, the documents, he found, his statements, what he was communicating to Rudy Giuliani and ultimately what Giuliani was communicating to Trump tells prosecutors what was Trump's state of mind at the time. It will help disprove claims that he had a genuine belief that the election didn't go, or that it did go his way, that he had actually won. It goes to disprove claims that he had an actual legitimate case to be made in the court, so very important evidence. And obviously, in a case like this, Smith wants to make sure he gets it right.",

It kind of reminds me of the prior president where he would divide the mothers from the kids.So let's not confuse -- I ask the state not to confuse strong border security, with treating people the way the allegations are. Again, they're allegations, and we have to look at it. I mean, they're trying different things, and I can tell you this that, look, let's put one thing in perspective. Texas has a 1,241 mile border. The buoys are only about a thousand feet. That's less than a quarter of a mile. So I think what the governor is trying to do is just do something symbolic, because if you have 1,241 miles, and you've got a thousand feet of buoys, that kind of tells you what the big picture is.",

One, Mexico at one time, had about 140,000 National Guard and other people at their southern border with Guatemala. The second thing were the policies that the Biden administration imposed, where they were saying, hey, we are going to provide you incentives to come in the right way. But we're going to provide disincentives for not coming to the right way.And I support the policy, and in fact, I've been asking the administration to do this for the last two years. Since they implemented the policies and Mexico has done a little bit more, the numbers have gone down by 30 percent. In fact, last month, we have about 99,000 -- a little over 99,000, which is the lowest since February of 2021. You know, the first month that President Biden has been there. So again, it's knowing how to do border security in a way that you still treat the migrants with respect and dignity.   SCIUTTO: We've just learned that the DOJ is going to appeal that court decision, but in previous decisions by this judge, the appeals court has actually approved his decisions here. Without this piece of the administration policy that turns away folks who have come through or come from another country other than Mexico, do you envision then another inflow -- a larger influx, an increase in encounters at the southern border?",
