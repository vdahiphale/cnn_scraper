We have reached out to Payne's representatives. We have reached out to former members of One Direction, who, of course, are going to be devastated about this news so young, at the age of 31 and also a father to a young son that he shared with Sheryl Cole, who is a incredibly successful and famous English singer.

A lot of it is really a rebranding of their existing wish list that if implemented, would President Zelenskyy says, force Russia to negotiate and strengthen Ukraine's position in those negotiations.Now, militarily, Ukraine as expected, wants permission to use Western long range missiles on military targets in Russia. It also wants neighboring countries to be able to help shoot down missiles and drones over Ukraine, something Poland, for example, has signaled it might be willing to do, and it intends to hold on to some territory inside Russia as a buffer zone also, and this was new, wants to deploy a, quote, comprehensive nonnuclear strategic deterrent package inside Ukraine, without specifying what that would look like. Now on the political side, the plan makes it very clear that only a concrete invitation to join NATO will prove to Russia that its war goals have failed. Now this plan comes amid criticism of Ukraine, especially in the United States, that it's a drain on taxpayer funds. So there's clearly an effort built into the plan to include sweeteners for Western allies, joint investments, for example, in Ukraine's natural resources, with a return on that investment. And post war, Zelenskyy is also proposing that Ukrainian troops could replace some U.S. troops stationed in Europe as part of NATO's defense, making use of their battlefield experience. Now all of this, of course, still requires Western buy in, and Zelenskyy was pretty open about the challenges of that. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I want to be frank with you on certain behind closed door communication with Ukraine. We hear the word talks from our allies much more often than the word justice. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but to the fair one. That is why we have the peace formula. It's a guarantee of negotiations without forcing Ukraine to injustice. Ukrainians deserve a decent peace. The Victory plan will pave the way for this.",

So that's a challenge.Secondly, trying to get some NATO states to sign up to this, who would be opposed to either bringing Ukraine into NATO or be opposed to increasing NATO assistance to Ukraine directly, I think could be a challenge, but I think that Zelenskyy had to put this forward. He had to make it clear that he had a plan for victory, or he would have faced the prospect that maybe that NATO support would have faulted and fallen off. So he's done this.

They can't essentially go to a peace agreement or a peace negotiation cap and hand begging for mercy. That's not going to work. They have to win.

And the outcome of that is it sets the stage for a Russian threat directly against NATO. And when you have President Trump saying the Russia can do whatever the hell it wants to NATO, that's a green light for Putin to be very aggressive towards NATO's Eastern frontier.",

The Israeli military killing at least 16 people in multiple strikes in the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh. 52 others were injured, according to the Lebanese health ministry.One of those who was killed was actually the city's mayor. He was killed when one of those air strikes hit a government building in the heart of that city. The Israeli military says that they were going after a Hezbollah compound that they say was underground belonging to Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces, and they accused Hezbollah of using Lebanese civilians as human shields. But the Lebanese prime minister is accusing the Israeli military of deliberately striking that government building at a time when local officials were holding meetings about emergency relief operations in southern Lebanon. No immediate comment from the Israeli military on that allegation. Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, we are continuing to watch as the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is continuing to deteriorate. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza now in the crosshairs of that deteriorating situation, also, of course, in the crosshairs of Israeli bombardment and fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants in Jabalya, one of those key cities in northern Gaza. This is, of course, the fourth time that we have seen Israeli troops carry out a major ground operation in Jabalya, but this time, they are also calling on hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate northern Gaza, forcing many to flee, but others have been trapped amid the bombardment, and the humanitarian situation is simply worsening, with United Nations now calling the situation in northern Gaza catastrophic. The UN's Human Rights Office said it took one of their teams 10 tries on Wednesday to actually be able to reach hospitals in northern Gaza, where they were delivering fuel and supplies. Meanwhile, of course, we're seeing the United States putting major pressure on Israel to improve the humanitarian situation.

Russian air defenses frantically trying to take them down before they slam into their target.This massive drone strike carried out in late September by Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, the GUR. And they granted CNN unprecedented access to the entire mission. Their target, a Russian ammo depot the Ukrainians say is storing missiles supplied to Moscow by Iran. Even though Tehran vehemently denies giving Russia ballistic missiles. All of these missions have to move extremely quickly. They have to be very precise because obviously, if they get discovered by the Russians, the Russians want nothing more than to kill everybody around here. When you're as badly outgunned as the Ukrainians, even strategic airstrikes become hit and run operations. The launch location totally secret. The mission run in near complete darkness. We can only identify the unit commander by his callsign, Vector. How fast do you guys have to be able to do all this now?",

The Ukrainians believe they hit hundreds of missiles and explosives.And in July, they hit an oil refinery on Russia's Black Sea coast, causing a major fire there. In total, the GUR says, these drone units are responsible for about a third of successful strikes deep into Russian territory. It all starts with accurate planning. In a secret location, the team gets the mission brief from their boss, whom we can only identify as Serge. Serge tells me he's overseen more than 550 missions into Russian territory since Russia's full-on invasion in 2022. Vector takes the laptop with the mission details and they're off. Staying on the move means staying alive. Operational security is extremely important for this team. So we're on our way to the next secret location right now. They remain on the move almost all the time. Right now, we're going to a place where they're going to do the detailed planning for the flight paths. And where we'll see the actual drones. The weapons depot is about 400 miles from the Ukrainian border in the southwestern Russian village of Kotluban, a major problem, a mesh of powerful Russian air defenses guarding the area. How good are the Russian air defenses and how difficult is it to overwhelm them? VECTOR, COMMANDER, GRU LONG-RANGE UAV UNIT: Unfortunately, especially last year, it's really good.

It began when a fuel tanker veered, lost control, and rolled into a ditch and residents began to siphon fuel from this tanker.Part of the reason could be, and this is speculative, because fuel has become so expensive in Nigeria after the removal of fuel subsidy with the election of President Bola Tinubu. Unfortunately, a fire broke out and burned through this area quite quickly. Some graphic social media video appeared to show this entire area and got enflamed. More than 90 people died on the spot. But as more getting treated in hospitals, the death toll continued to climb and police warning that the actual death toll could be much higher because some are in serious condition. Unfortunately, this is not the first fuel tanker tragedy in Nigeria. Truck accidents are quite common in the country. There was one just last month where more than 40 people died. And there have been so many more across the country. They're partly blamed on poor road conditions, sometimes on reckless driving and often on vehicles that are unroadworthy, they are not in good mechanical condition to be on the road. But the effect is that these accidents cause very high death tolls when they happen. Sometimes people siphon fuel, sometimes there are people caught up in these accidents.
