You're watching CNN Newsroom, I'm Robyn CurnowAhead this hour on CNN, Mawar is once again a super typhoon and gaining strength as it moves away from the island of Guam. The very latest of where the storm is and where it's heading. It seemed like a good idea at the time. The first ever presidential campaign launch on Twitter melts down and the internet erupts in mockery of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. And remembering Tina Turner, her incredible voice, her unforgettable live performances, as well as her own personal resonance (ph). Thanks for being here for another hour. We begin with Super Typhoon Marwar, which continues to strengthen. At last report, sustained winds were 155 miles, or 250 kilometers an hour, just shy of a Category 5 hurricane. The storm is now moving away from the island of Guam after making landfall on Wednesday. The most powerful storm hit Guam in decades left tens of thousands without electricity. But according to the governor, no fatalities have been reported. For now, officials are urging residents to stay indoors until conditions are safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. LOU LEON GUERRERO, GUAM:  I am so glad we are safe. We have weathered the storm, the worst has gone by, but we are going to continue experiencing tropical storm winds up to about 40, 50 miles per hour. So, I ask you again to please stay home for your protection and your safety. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE:  Storm chaser James Reynolds joins us now live from Guam with more on this. So, James, apart from what seems like a pretty widespread power outage, Guam escaped any major damage. Really, it's just kind of a mess. It needs a bit of a cleanup.",

But, thankfully, due to a slight wobble in the change of the track of the storm and some unexpected weakening, that didn't unfold. So, that's a relief, John.",

That's according to state media, which first reported emergency services were on the scene after a blaze began on a balcony. Local officials now saying no fire, no fire, no fire has been detected.But there is video from Moscow which shows smoke surrounding the building, and a woman can be heard complaining about a horrible burning smell. This coming as new U. S. intelligence indicates despite all of their denials, Ukraine may have launched a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Sources say U.S. officials picked up chatter among Ukrainian officials blaming each other for the attack. That contributed to the assessment that the Ukrainian group may be responsible. USA has not been able to reach a definitive conclusion, but they believe it's unlikely that its senior Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were aware of the attacks. Now, two pro-Ukrainian, anti-Putin paramilitary groups say their operations across the border in Russia are far from over. They're now back in Ukraine after claiming the cross border military raid earlier this week. They say the raid was only one step in a bigger operation, which is ongoing. CNN's Sam Kiley has details.

The album is a landmark not only in the career of the 45- year-old singer, who's been recording since the late 1950s, but in the evolution of pop soul music itself. So, what specifically was it about that album that was so groundbreaking?VOZICK-LEVINSON:  Well, so, Private Dancer, this album that she released in the mid-1980s is an incredible album, incredible vocal performances on songs like the title track or What's Love Got To Do With It. But just as remarkable, as you said, when you were quoting that review, she was 45 at that time. People in their 40s weren't expected to make pop hits at that time. This is something really kind of revolutionary that she did that she was able to restart her career and show how much charisma and power and how much story she still had left to tell at that time. And I think that really resonated with people. VOZICK-LEVINSON:  Yes. And for the small town of Brownsville, Tennessee, this is an especially sad moment. Listen to the city's mayor. Here he is.

Food inflation has barely shifted from last month. Prices are 19.1 percent higher than a year ago, with some staggering increases for basic food staples. Sugar is 47 percent more expensive than last year and there had been huge increases for things like eggs, bread and milk. A major concern here is that food inflation hits everyone but it impacts poor households the worst as a greater portion of their income is spent on food and household bills. Now that puts huge pressure on companies to increase wages, so people can cope with the increased cost of living. That could make the situation worse. So the IMF warned on Tuesday that higher wages could result in high inflation lasting longer. The reason food inflation remains so high, according to U.K.'s Office of National Statistics is a combination of factors. The Russian invasion of Ukraine sent global grain and fertilizer prices soaring, as well as energy input costs. Labor shortages continue to be a problem, a consequence of both the pandemic and Brexit. And then there is the issue of weather abroad from droughts to cold snaps, impacts on the cost of imported food which the U.K. is heavily reliant on. In fact, the ONS says the price of imported food has been rising at twice the rate of domestic food. There's also a transmission lag to price shocks as they travel through supply chains, from farm to producer, and on to the retailer. The Bank of England has already raised interest rates 12 times in a row, and now it is more likely they will raise them even higher next month. Anna Stewart, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
