Ukrainian sources telling CNN Ukrainian Navy and its secret service are behind the attack on a Russian naval base. And I report for you just ahead plus, Navalny in court, the Russian opposition leader expected to be sentenced this hour on extremism charges, a fresh conviction and what many are calling a politically motivated legal assault by Moscow on Navalny. And here in the U.S. an important new looks on the health of the U.S. jobs market. We just got these numbers about half an hour or so ago showing that the U.S. added about 187,000 new jobs in July that's below the 200,000 jobs that had been expected. U.S. unemployment meantime ticking lower to three and a half percent for hourly earnings coming in stronger than expected, Wall Street reaction to the positive U.S. Futures now firmly higher tech stocks set to rise for the first time since Monday chocolate up to strong gains for Amazon pre market.

I want to bring in Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics. So Mark, 200,000 jobs that was what was expected 180 -- 187,000 jobs added? Is it a sign that the fed's actions are working, just walk us through it break down the numbers for us. MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Indeed Zain, I think the numbers were about as good as they get right down the fairway as they would say, you know, a couple 100,000 shows that the job market remains very resilient, strong, recruiting lots of jobs, but growth is moderating, slowing, just like the Federal Reserve would like to see. And everything is headed in the right direction here. Wage growth is a little strong for the Feds liking. You know, obviously, they're focused on inflation and want to get that back in the bottle. But even there, I think we're -- all the trend lines look pretty good. So you know it's about as good a report as one could ask for.",

I mean, I think they like to see the job growth numbers moderate, because that's key to easing up the labormarket and taking some of the pressure off, and ultimately getting that wage growth number down. But you know wage growth is critical to inflationary pressures, particularly in the service side of the economy, which is very labor intensive. And we need wage growth to moderate a bit more to be consistent with underlying productivity growth to be consistent with the feds 2 percent target. I know I'm saying a lot there. But, you know, it's not quite where they want to see it, but it is moving in the right direction. And my sense is if job growth continues to moderate like it has, we will see those kinds of wage growth numbers that the Fed wants to see. And I don't think most importantly, I don't think any of what I just said requires any more rate hikes by the Fed.",

And they've been threading the needle, you know, we are getting inflation is coming in here pretty quickly. It's not back to target yet, but it's getting there pretty quickly. And they're doing that without any increase in unemployment. You mentioned the 3.5 percent unemployment rate. That's about as low as it gets.

A lot of people have greater during the pandemic, and they've held on to those devices. When it comes to the emerging markets, China did better than expected. But the real sort of Holy Grail for them the future, when it comes to emerging markets is India, that is a huge opportunity for Apple. How did they capitalize on that? O'DONNELL: Yes know, and that's exactly right. And you know, the interesting thing about the iPhone numbers, while they were not good, obviously, they weren't as bad as they could have been. Because the China numbers were much better than a lot of people expected. And they started to talk about India, now, India is coming from an extraordinarily small base for them, because the Indian phone market is extraordinarily price sensitive, and of course, Apples at the ultra-premium side of things. So I think with India, there's going to be a couple of things to bear in mind. Number one is Apple does continue to sell a full range of products. Remember, not everybody buys the iPhone 14 some people are buying the older versions that Apple is selling at a lower price. And I think we'll see more of that in markets like India. The other thing is attach rate on services in some of the other developing countries is also lower. So it's going to be a little bit harder, China attach rate on services has been OK. But again, nothing like it is in the U.S. and Europe. And in India, I think it's going to be even lower. So there's certainly a lot of opportunity. And a lot of those markets, it's just about getting the hardware out there first. But they've got to get a couple of years of building up that installed base. And then they can start to do more of the content, local content, obviously, for them in terms of like Indian content, TV, etcetera, etcetera, to really drive that forward.",

I mean, who is that the future? Just in terms of, you know Apple hardware products? Can you really see it taking off with a price point like that? O'DONNELL: No, it's not going to, and I actually got a chance to try it, I was at the launch event, and I was one of the few people that got to try it. And its look, it's a great product, but it's a great virtual reality product. And I emphasize that because VR has been around for a long time, we've had Meta. We've had bunch of other companies, and it's never gone to the mainstream. So even at a lower price point, my concern is that notion of really getting fully encompassed with this thing wrapped around your head is not something a lot of people want to do. And so I think it's going to be a long time before we see vision Pro, get to the point evolved as a product and a price point to make it mainstream. So specifically, no, I think it's going to be a while it's going to be an interesting distraction for a while to be honest.

So, Richard, of course, what the Fed has been looking for quite a while in terms of jobs, especially is a broad sort of cooling in numbers, is that what we're seeing here? Is Jerome Powell going to be happy with this particular report? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Yes, I think he is, because it is showing not only in the instant month of July, but in the revisions of May and June, that the number of jobs being created is slowing down. They're still being created, but just not at the same higher levels. And when you look at the revisions of the last few months, and you look at the lower number for July, it is painting a picture of an economy gradually slow, because let's face it, when an economy slows, fewer jobs are created. I know it's sort of a perversion, that bad news is good news. But actually fewer jobs means the economy is slowing.

On the basis of thisnumber, although there is a component here about the amount of average hourly earnings, which was a bit higher than they will be happy with. But the bit that doesn't change, Zain, is you stay higher for longer. And that's the bit so you may not raise rates more, but you're certainly going to keep them at these elevated levels for longer than you normally would. And that's also going to continue to slow the economy. We also saw, for example, numbers only if we get into the plumbing of the financial system. We saw, for instance, that the banking crisis earlier this year, the banking crisis means that tighter lending, that in itself is slowing the economy.

And he started providing this officer with images of the U USS Essex as well as other Navy ships, including photos of their layouts and the weapon systems on the ships themselves. And in exchange according to the indictment, he received thousands of dollars from this Chinese Intelligence Officer. Now in the other case, which again is related but separate from the first one another U.S. Navy sailor, he apparently was communicating with the Chinese Intelligence Officer between 2021 and 2023. And he was an electrician, but essentially, he fixed electrical equipment at U.S. military facilities around the world. And he began providing this intelligence officer according to the indictment, with photos of U.S. radar systems in Okinawa, Japan as well as other information related to U.S. military exercises in the Indo-Pacific. And an exchange, prosecutors say he received about $15,000 from this Chinese Intelligence Officer. Now, way who was the first defendant here, he pleaded not guilty yesterday according to prosecutors. We still don't know how the second defendant here is going to plead. But this is just an example, according to the U.S. government of how far China is willing to go to try to steal U.S. military secrets from U.S. service members apparently targeting U.S. Navy sailors in an attempt to gain military advantages that they can then use to pursue, of course their own national security interests. And so what the U.S. is saying here is that look, this is very, very concerning not only, of course, that China would target these individuals, but also that these U.S. service members allegedly would provide this information to them. And we should note that the U.S. military is still reeling from charges filed earlier this year against another U.S. service member who allegedly mishandled classified information by simply posting it on the internet. So this is at least the third time this year that U.S. service members have faced charges related to the mishandling of classified and sensitive national security information.",

A day of mourninghas been declared for the more than 200 victims who died and the thousands more who are hurt. The blast originated in a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate that had been improperly stored for many years. The shockwave was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded to date. No official investigation into the cause has been completed. Tamara Qiblawi joins us live now. Tamara, so much anger, so much pain because there has been no justice for the victims and really no accountability. Walk us through.",

You see people pouring into the streets of Beirut, not only to mourn their dad, not only to commemorate this terrible tragedy. But also to demonstrate against what has been essentially a stunning obstruction of justice orchestrated by Lebanese political elite, many of whom have been prosecuted in an investigation into the port explosion. Now, that investigation has more or less been frozen because of repeated legal petitions against this the current investigating judge which is of course fueled anger on the streets. However, it's really important to note that people, the relatives of the deceased, leading lawyers, members of civil society are now planning to take their pursuit of justice elsewhere. There is an overwhelming demand on the streets in the media. Among these leading figures for a U.N. fact finding mission increasingly, they are calling upon the international community to intervene. But as it stands, yes, it frozen investigation, more questions than there are answers. We still don't know what caused the port explosion. We know that the ammonium nitrate was exploded. We know that they were improperly stored. We know that corruption was a major culprit in this however, the specifics are incredibly elusive. And as you will see from the streets of Beirut, the wounds are raw. Relatives of the deceased are still teary eyed. But we are none the wiser. And there are real questions as to where the pursuit of justice goes from here, Zain.",

His messages to the unfaithful don't be afraid to stir things up. Take care of the planet and be aware of the pitfalls of online addiction. Catholic -- have traveled here from all over the world for this event, which is held every three years in a different location and is dubbed as the Catholic Woodstock. And it really does feel like a festival with live music and lots of singing and dancing around us not only here in this farm, but in the whole city. The Pope started his day by meeting and praying privately with 15 Ukrainians who traveled to Portugal for this event. He then met with students and staff of Lisbon's Catholic University. And during that speech, he urged young people to keep seeking and to be ready to take risks in a world which faces enormous challenges. The five day trip is taking place in the shadow of clerical abuse scandal here. Earlier this year, a report published by an independent commission found that some of the Catholic clergy in poor school had abused thousands of children over a 70 year period. On Wednesday evening, the Pope did meet privately with 13 victims of clerical abuse. The Vatican described it as a time of intense listening, and during an address he said that the Catholic Church needs to do better when dealing with victims of clerical abuse, saying that the church is in need of humble and ongoing purification and must listen to the anguished cry of the victim. Despite his recent surgery and struggles of mobility, the Pope has an intense schedule with some 11 speeches during his trip and more events than in the past trips this year, including a trip to the country's popular shrine of Fatima. The 86 year old pontiff wasn't very good form on the papal flight from Rome's Fiumicino airport. And he joked with journalists saying he would come back from this trip rejuvenated.
