The report by special counsel Robert Hur ripped apart today on Capitol Hill. Republicans questioning why no charges despite a report finding Joe Biden knowingly mishandled classified documents, Democrats on the other hand, accusing Hur of playing politics with lines in his report about Biden's age and memory. What did today's hearing really achieve? We'll talk to a Democrat who was in the room. Plus, why did the Justice Department release a transcript of President Biden's interview with Robert Hur just as the special counsel was showing up on Capitol Hill. Coincidence? We're going to dig deeper into what that transcript reveals. And confirmation today of tragic news that an American-Israeli hostage was killed by Hamas back in October.

EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, one of the still one of the mystifying things, Jake, has to do with the reference to Beau Biden, which of course made the president and Democrats so angry by dimension of Beau Biden and the fact that the president didn't remember the year that he died, at least according to the transcript.

Now, we reviewed the transcript and you see a lot more of the context there and you see that President Biden is the one that brings up Beau Biden and it comes as part of a question, a discussion about him thinking about his political future and looking at how he referred to documents that were having to do with that. And President Biden brings up the context and says, you know, the 2017, 2017, 2018 era. And then he says, I remember the time-frame -- I remember the time frame. My son was either deployed or dying and then he says what year, what month did Beau die? Oh, God, May 30th. And then there was another -- a couple of people in the room who say 2015. And the president says, it's 25th -- 2015. And so that is one of the, again, one of the most important parts of this report because it has been the thing that has that Democrats say was abused to portrayed the president as someone who is elderly, who didn't really have it all together.
