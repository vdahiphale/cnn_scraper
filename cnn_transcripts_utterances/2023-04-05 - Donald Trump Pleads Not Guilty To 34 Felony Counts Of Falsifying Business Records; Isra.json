Donald Trump addresses his supporters describing the criminal charges against him as political persecution. Right now, 60 million people across the U.S. hunkering down under various severe weather threats. And while the heart may be wheeling the body especially the leg a week, Tiger Woods back at the Masters.Just hours after he was arrested, fingerprinted, and appeared in a New York courtroom to plead not guilty to criminal charges. Donald Trump was back in his safe space at his Mar-a-Lago Country Club in Florida. But he told supporters he never thought anything like this could happen in America, a claim so many of his opponents and critics would agree with, but for very different reasons. The first U.S. president ever to be criminally charged seem to similar with anger, as he had a long list of grievances filled with misstatements half-truths and lies. He also lashed out at the justice system, the judge, the judge's daughter, he called them and had a difficulty who brought the case a criminal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: He knew there was no case. That's why last week he delayed for a month and then immediately took that back. And through this ridiculous indictment together came out today. Everybody said this is not really an indictment. There's nothing here. I lose came to me and they said there's nothing here they're not even saying what you did. The criminal is the district attorney because he illegally leaked massive amounts of Grand Jury information for which he should be prosecuted, or at a minimum he should resign. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The former President heard the charges against him for the first time Tuesday.Prosecutors allege Trump sought to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election, overseeing a criminal scheme paying hush money to women who say they had extramarital affairs with him. The indictment says for all 34 counts, Trump had quote intended to defraud and attempt to commit another crime. Prosecutors allege the unlawful plan to suppress information which would harm his campaign included an illegal payment of $130,000 for an adult film actress. Trump's legal team has until early August to file motions including motions to dismiss, the prosecution must respond by mid-September. The next in-person hearing is it for December 4 of Donald Trump. CNN's Kristen Holmes was there when Trump addressed his supporters in Florida. She filed this report now from Mar-a-Lago (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Former President Donald Trump given uncharacteristically short speech after his arraignment on his Mar-a-Lago club, he did talk about the New York case briefly. He attacked the district attorney there as well as the judge, but he spent more time talking about other investigations into him. He talks specifically about the Department of Justice's investigation into classified document handling at his Mar-a-Lago club. Now, he had a crowd here full of supporters, everyone here was a, well I would say is a MAGA fan. You saw members of Bikers for Trump, members of Club 45 as well as support of lawmakers, allies, advisors, family members as well. Now I am told that after he made those remarks, he went up to the patio where he often eats dinner at Mar-a-Lago, and during his time there they actually started playing the J6 song that he had recorded with the J6 choir we were men that had been incarcerated for their alleged actions. On January 6, he did the Pledge of Allegiance the entire patio stood, and then he sit back down -- sat back down and then continued eating dinner. Now I am told that he afterwards DJ with a laptop, something he is want to do when he is at his Mar-a-Lago club. So clearly a very long day. He is now surrounded by some people who adore him the most. We obviously are just starting this process with this arraignment, something that we will be watching very closely, particularly as it pertains to his 2024 campaign.

His rivals in the presidential field have taken a pretty soft approach to attacking him over this alleged scandal. And then beyond that, he is continuing to raise large sums of money. And on top of that, his supporter -- his support in the Republican primary field has only gone up in the past few weeks. So the sense that he's trying to telegraph to his supporters in the broader public that he is the victim of a so called Witch Hunt, and is really just in the crosshairs of overly partisan district attorneys in two states really seems to be resonating with his supporters.",

The same sense is going on with Trump here. The Americans have some feeling as that CNN poll illustrated that there is some politics driving his indictment, but they don't really care. They still see over all that he should be indicted, and that there is reason to take a serious look at his conduct in allegedly paying off a porn star over to keep quiet over an extramarital affair.

It's not entirely clear from the indictment. That's the first place I'd start. I do think there are some potential motions that could be brought by the defense here. I do. I think that, actually, if you are looking focused solely on the legality, I actually think that Trump will be well served to try to speed up the trial here. Try to get this trial before the more difficult cases ahead as you point out. There's many other cases that he's facing. I don't think he's going to do that. I think he's going to try to delay. And frankly, he could be at a very difficult position if he doesn't win the presidency if he is, in fact, facing multiple criminal indictments at the same time.",

HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENTSo behind me, you can see the old city of Jerusalem. On this side you can see the golden dome and then on my right with the building with the black top -- that is actually the al-Aqsa Mosque. Now, this entire compound is the third holiest site for Muslim and it's the holiest site for Jews, so it's often a place of confrontations. But the confrontations we saw overnight, they were more aggressive, I think than what people were even expecting for what's already been a very tense period. Now, dramatic footage we're seeing from inside the mosque itself. We see police entering fireworks being fired at the police responded with stun grenades as well as rubber bullets being fired back and forth. Now Israeli police said in a statement this morning that they entered the mosque after trying to remove groups who were trying to stay there overnight. They say that several law breaking news and masked agitators brought into the mosque, fireworks, sticks and stones. They locked its doors from the inside with obstacles and fortifications at the entrances. And they say that's why they entered the mosque and they began to respond. And that's where these clashes started from. Now police say some 350 people were detained and removed overnight. Those are massive numbers, the Palestinian Red Crescent saying 12 were injured, 3 of them were transferred to hospital. The Israeli police say one of their officers were injured. But we're not only seeing the dramatic images of the arrest, we're also seeing images of damage to the mosque itself. And I will remind you how holy of a place this is for Muslims, especially right now during the holy month of Ramadan. Now just Israel -- I want to give you some context because just Israeli police stepping inside the mosque is considered incredibly provocative and aggressive and then to see them engaging with stun grenades, rubber bullets and assaulting people trying to get them out. Arresting people -- that's seen as even more incredibly provocative. And we're seeing other images as well. Israeli police being aggressive with worshippers at the site even into this morning. Now what happens here at al Aqsa at the compound ripples, of course across the Muslim world, and we're seeing condemnation from Saudi Arabia, from Jordan which holds a special role here as the custodian of the holy sites. And then we also have the aftermath of what happened because then we saw rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. Hamas the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, issuing angry condemnation to what was happening at al Aqsa. Keep in mind that two years ago, similar clashes at al Aqsa helped spark that 11 day war between Hamas and the militants in Gaza and the Israeli military. Now the Israeli military responding to those rockets, saying that it struck a Hamas training camps and weapons manufacturing sites, now. Right now we can see from where we stand that the situation at the compound is quiet, but it's a tense, quiet. We are still seeing some moments of agitation and it's going to -- we're going to have to see what happens throughout the rest of the day. Keep in mind, Passover is starting tonight whether the situation will remain calm or whether this will potentially escalate and spill over into something even bigger, John.",

But in reality, they don't have actually as much control over the site of Israeli police who controlled the area around the old city and are often the ones to go in and enter this.Now, according to the status quo, which is the agreement over how the holy sites are administered, there's several rules around it, for example, you know that Muslims are the only ones who are allowed to pray, and there's even certain rules about who was actually allowed to stay overnight at what points in time. But at the end of the day, it's often the Israeli police who are the ones to engage. We are hearing condemnations from Jordan, from Saudi Arabia about this what they call this blatant assault on worshippers. Like I said, this seeing Israeli police going into the mosque, even just stepping foot into the mosque and then engaging at the way they did it is considered incredibly aggressive, incredibly provocative, so we should expect to continue to see condemnation throughout the rest of the day. And we may continue to see further clashes at the compound.",

Tiger Woods said that his game is better than it was a year ago when he was making his first appearance after that dreadful car accident two years ago. He says his endurance is better. But he said that he aches more. Perhaps that's because he's pushing his body more. He knows that he's not going to have that many more opportunities to play in this tournament so the conversation with the media was less about how he defines success, how he finds joy.
