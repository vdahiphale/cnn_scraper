Right now, you're looking at live pictures there. President Biden addressing supporters in Atlanta, President Trump taking the stage. This is the second day in a row that President Biden has visited a swing state that helped deliver him the presidency in 2020. You can see both of them there now speaking to crowds, as this campaign is fully underway for the election in 2024. The Biden campaign is saying that the president or vice president will visit every single battleground state over the next few weeks as they ramp up their re-election pitch, and just about an hour down the road in the northwest Georgia city of Rome, you can see right there President Donald -- former President Donald Trump is speaking to supporters. It is Trump's first visit to the crucial battleground states since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee and taking over the Republican National Committee. We are monitoring both of these events as both the candidates are on stage. We start with Steve Contorno, who is in Rome, Georgia at that Trump rally. So Steve, Donald Trump just taking the stage. We're also learning that Trump met today with the parents of Laken Riley. What do we know about that meeting?",

Now, he has spoken to them by the phone before, but tonight they are here.We are not sure if they're going to come out with the former president, his advisers aren't clear on that. But we do know that they gave permission for the campaign to use a picture of her on a poster that is being distributed tonight, to people in the audience, and it includes her photo and the phrase \"Say her name.\" So this is a continuation of the confrontation and immigration politics that we saw at the State of the Union where they had President Biden and some of Donald Trump supporters in the Congress clashing during that speech over immigration and over Laken Riley's death, and clearly that is continuing tonight. This is a window into how President Trump is going to campaign over the next eight months. This is not only a message that they hope resonates here in Georgia, but in other swing states. Now, obviously in this room, it is a message that is well-received and likely in this area of the state as well. This is a party statement that is represented in Congress by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a very conservative firebrand Republican for whether or not that message sways the voters that will decide this election in the Atlanta suburbs. Well, that remains to be seen. And talking to Republican strategists here, they remain worried that Trump is incredibly divisive, especially when it comes to re- litigating the 2020 election and whether he can avoid that on the campaign trail will remain something to be seen, and so far in his first appearance as presumptive nominee, we have seen little change from him. He came out tonight to speak to the Jan 6 choir of individuals who were arrested for their role in the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol. That is something he did throughout the campaign when he was running for the nomination. Well, now, he is the presumptive nominee, and still coming out with that same music.",

But that's how they feel. What a great gift to Biden, because now he can say we had a solution. I worked hard on a solution. We brought both parties together just like Americans want and Donald Trump killed it because he wanted a campaign issue. He didn't want to solve the problem.

And I have to tell you, Alex, in talking to voters in the crowd, just before the president took the stage, this was clearly top of mind for them, as well. And all of them had really been excited about what they had seen at the State of the Union Thursday, and this was a president that got on stage and clearly tried to capitalize on that moment. He invoked the State of the Union, the crowd erupted into cheers, clearly excited by what they had seen. But there was also realities that the president faces that still we're here today, and that is that the president sought to navigate this complicated political landscape when it comes to the Israel-Hamas war.

That is really going to be the uphill battle here in Georgia where there aren't those key statewide races that before bolstered voter turnout. The voter turnout is going to hinge on enthusiasm for President Joe Biden.And of course, Alex, is this to say that President Biden only narrowly won 2020.

It's true that right now, this may be benefiting Donald Trump, but I think that is one of the reasons why Biden was stressing democracy. Just -- I think it was last night, Donald Trump had dinner at Mar-a- Lago with Viktor Orban, the authoritarian from Hungary. Look at the good things he said about Vladimir Putin and attacking NATO and the dictators in North Korea and China and a couple in South America, and I could go on and on.

And there is a deep concern as well, that this starving of the Palestinians is in some way being used as leverage to pressure Hamas to release the hostages, to come for a deal. That's not the way this should be conducted. The president, unfortunately, from a humanitarian perspective, doesn't have a lot of cards to play, so he is putting our forces and our assets straight into the field. And I have to say, to add to this, this needs to be embarrassing for the Israeli Defense Forces, to have the American military have to go into a country, to a territory that Israel controls, and provide aid to those civilians that Israel itself should be supporting and feeding.

And that means how are we creating pathways for people to be able to have real measurement of economic mobility and own more than they owe and pass something off to their children besides debt. But it also is important to talk about social freedoms, reproductive health and reproductive freedoms.And when we're talking about patriotism, that does matter. In the president, we have a person who's devoted his life to public service, a person who's devoted his life to supporting others, a person who's devoted his life to being able to make sure that all of our neighbors are protected. And truthfully, he's running against somebody who the only freedom he's talking about is his own. The only future that he's talking about is his own future. So I do think it's important for the President to be able to highlight the importance of freedoms inside these moments and how it's necessary for us to have a leader, a president and a commander in chief who's going to fight for our freedoms instead of a commander in chief and a president who's going to spend his whole time fighting for his own.",

And I think it's why the President has been so sincere about making sure that we have to get real border reform and real immigration reform inside of our country. The President worked with Republicans, conservative Republicans, on putting together a border bill that was eventually killed by the State of the Union by the Speaker of the House and other members and extreme members of the Republican Party.And so I think the president understands how important it is. And as a governor, I can tell you how important it is that we get a Congress that is willing to act on this, because we as chief executives in our own states end up dealing with the consequences of it.",
