Right behind me is the compound where Imran Khan is actually being held at the police headquarters here in Islamabad. We've been told by Imran Khan's lawyers who have been coming here in an attempt to meet him that they haven't had any contact with their client for more than 24 hours now.The internet remains shut down. (Audio gap). Just about a kilometer from here there are clashes that are taking place between riot police and Imran Khan supporters who are trying to come close to the compound where he's being kept. We can actually see tear gas when we go around the corner from where I am standing. There is a sense of unease in this country. This is a state of political tension that has been brewing ever since Imran Khan was ousted as prime minister back in April. The country's economy is in the doldrums. There is an IMF known that has not been completed. Pakistan's current government has been attempting to make that happen. There has been a lot resting on certainty on this happening in this country but Imran Khan is an incredibly popular politician. The police tried to arrest him about two times in the month of March and it is paramilitary troops that eventually went out and got him at Islamabad high court. They actually broke through the glass when he was sitting there trying to get his biometric verification done, and then he was dragged away. Nobody has heard from him since, let alone his lawyers. We are waiting to see when he will make an appearance in this special court behind me. It was supposed to happen at 8:30 in the morning. It's now 2:30 in the afternoon. There is a continuous sense of unease -- Christine.",

When I talk about the demeaning, I'm speaking about the defamation.And so, yes, there was the absence, Christine, of the finding of rape, which essentially relates to the intercourse. But they did find the touching as it concerns intimate parts of the body -- that would be unlawful. At the end of the day, in English, battery is essentially the touching of someone without their consent. The jury found that happened. And the jury additionally found that she was defamed by Mr. Trump calling her a liar and a hoaxer. And so I think ultimately, with that and the finding of a $5 million verdict, I think this is a win in all respects for Ms. Carroll who brought this forward, and I think in a very brave and courageous way.",

Emily, where are the workers? I mean, this has been the big story, right, in the recovery from COVID. There just aren't enough workers. Why, and why are you arguing those labor shortages could be here to stay? EMILY PECK, MARKETS CORRESPONDENT, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, absolutely, there aren't still enough workers. Americans of working age are back to where they were before the pandemic. It's something like 83 percent of Americans of working age are working. The big problem is Americans are getting older, right, so the population over 55 has doubled, or something like that, over the past 20 years. That means more Americans are, in fact, too old to work and that's a problem that's going to worsen over the coming years unless steps are taken to ameliorate it.

Demand for low-wage health care workers -- think like home health aides -- is going to soar again because the population is getting older and there's going to be more of a need for these kinds of workers. And there's likely not going to be enough and that could be a long-term problem. Other sectors will probably figure out ways to automate.
