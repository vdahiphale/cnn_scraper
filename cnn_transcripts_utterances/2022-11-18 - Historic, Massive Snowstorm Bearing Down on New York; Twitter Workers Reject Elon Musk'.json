That's the area east roar (ph). Those are the areas that are picking up the heavy snow now. On the other side, Upstate New York here from Lake Ontario, it's snowing back in Watertown. Williamstown has already picked up two feet. Now, this is not Williamsville near Buffalo, where Wolf Blitzer is from. This is near Syracuse. But the numbers here from Hamburg to Orchard Park, where the game would have been played, already a foot- and-a-half. Lake-effect snow warning still in effect. What's going to happen today? Well, the wind is going to shift. Where we are right now, the winds are south and south of Buffalo. So, that's where the snow is. But later on tonight into tomorrow, those winds shift a little bit farther to the north and Buffalo, Williamsville, Tonawanda, you're back in it, Kenmore. These are the areas that are going to pick up two to three inches of snow per hour, up to six or seven hours at a time. So, I guess we are going to see significant snow today and then into tonight, and then the snow comes into Buffalo as we work our way into tomorrow morning, Buffalo proper, and we're talking south towns. There's an awful lot of Buffalo around Buffalo and an awful lot of people there. It finally ends during the day, tomorrow and into Sunday. But there's three additional feet. No, I've already shown you numbers that are 20 inches, 20 inches-plus another 36, you're up to 56 or more in some of these snow belt areas, Poppy, dangerous, dangerous stuff here for these people.",

Each one of those ballistic missile launches goes against the United Nations. But even when you have the vice president, Harris, convening that emergency meeting and getting leaders of Canada and New Zealand and Australia and Japan and South Korea, to condemn the launch, frankly, China is the gatekeeper. They're the ones that either enforce sanctions or they don't. And as much as the United Nations tries to step up sanctions this year consistently, they haven't been able to get a unified statement out of the U.N. Security Council because Russia and China have veto power and they're refusing to veto these launches. And this launch, Kaitlan, it traveled more than 3,700 miles up into space.

More than a million migrants have been expelled under this immigration policy.Let's go to our colleague, David Culver. He is in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, right across from El Paso. It's so important you're there, David, because the question is what does this mean actually for those migrants?",

I mean, there is so much confusion, there's a lot of uncertainty, and they have been camped out here, some of them for several weeks. They've been traveling from their origin countries, many of them, the vast majority, from Venezuela, which is dealing with a huge humanitarian crisis right now, and making their way here over the course of several months.So, as they've been camped out here, let me show, this is where hundreds of tents are actually set up behind me, and then you can see over there, that's the border, that's El Paso. They have been hearing trickling out of the U.S. some of the news about this U.S. federal judge's ruling. The problem is, the fine print isn't coming across here. And that fine print states that the policy is still in effect for another five weeks, meaning, the folks who have been going over, there has been a steady surge, and we can show you some of the video that we captured yesterday, a lot of families, a lot of people who have just said that perhaps this is now their time to be able to enter the U.S. illegally, they're going with a lot of false hope and confusion that perhaps this policy is no longer in place. But it is. And so what happens once they get to the other side? Well, depends who you ask. It's a case by case basis. It's been very much determined on the individual and some individuals have said they've been managing to get through. We know that through some of the migrants who have been in touch with family and friends who say that their loved ones have been successful. Others have ended up back on a bus, if they're lucky, being dropped off back here in Ciudad Juarez, but others, even though they started here, have been taken to places much farther away, cities that are far more dangerous, and that has been their concern. From the U.S. side of things, Poppy, Department of Homeland Security says that they are stepping up resources, that they expected this to happen, that they anticipate it, to be able to handle the influx, which could be, Poppy, as many as 18,000 people a day. So, it's going to be overwhelming. HARLOW:  Yes. And the federal judge in overturning this saying, look, when this was done, it was arbitrary and capricious, but still things don't change for these folks for five weeks.
