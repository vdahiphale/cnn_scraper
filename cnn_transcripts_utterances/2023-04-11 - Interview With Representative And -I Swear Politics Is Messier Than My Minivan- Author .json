Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. President Joe Biden flies to Belfast, Northern Ireland tonight for a major celebration, 25 years since the historic Good Friday Peace Accords and America's vital role in making that happen. Biden's four-day visit to the island comes as he signals ever louder his intention to definitely run again for president in 2024. Just as hot button election issues around guns, race and a woman's right to choose ask vital questions about the state of U.S. democracy. A Trump appointed judge in Texas wants a nationwide ban on an abortion pill that's been approved for use by the FDA for more than 20 years now. While in Tennessee, Republican state legislators expelled two black Democratic members who took part in an anti-gun protest, one of them, Justin Jones has now been reinstated. Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter has become a star in Washington by holding what she calls this abusive power accountable. She's known far and wide for her tough questions and trademark white board. She's now running for Senate in California, and she's out with a new book for the campaign called, \"I Swear: Politics is Messier Than My Minivan.\" And I've been speaking to her about the challenges that rock America right now, and also about how to maintain America's role as a global beacon of democracy. Congresswoman Katie Porter, welcome to the program. REP. KATIE PORTER (D-CA) AND AUTHOR, \"I SWEAR POLITICS IS MESSIER THAN MY MINIVAN\":  Thank you for having me.",

There will be -- obviously, be an appeal of this decision, and I fully expect it to be reversed. It's -- the basic argument here is that the FDA did something wrong in its scientific work.

And so, I think the hope is that this won't have any practical effects that the decision will appeal and be reversed before that. But it's certainly discourages people. It makes them fearful. There's a lot of misinformation out there. We saw the exact same, by the way, set of effects after our United States Supreme Court decided the Dobbs decision limiting the -- taking away the constitutional right to an abortion, reversing Roe. A lot of fear, lots of misinformation.

What are we fighting for? We're fighting for liberty. We're fighting for freedom. We're fighting for justice. And this is an issue that touches on those very values. So, I absolutely think it will drive people to be politically active, to remain politically active and to come out into the polls. And I think that the Democrats who have taken a unified and strong stance on protecting the right for each person to make their own decision about abortion are going to be the winning party in 2024 on this issue, as well as on the issue of gun violence, where we're also seeing Americans, again, pushing and pushing Congress to pass laws, their government leaders to act in accordance with their wishes.

That's something we take a lot of pride in the United States, historically. Something we compare ourselves favorably to with regard to other countries. We assume in the United States that if you're duly elected, you'll be able to serve. That's an attack on the legislature, which is what you've seen in a legislative branch of government, which is what we've seen in Tennessee.

And so, I think what I showed a willingness to do is to stand up to power. And I think that's remarkably rare in Washington. That's something I talk about in the book, the power of corporate donors, the power of lobbyists. I'm one of 11 members of the House of Representatives, which has 435 members, one of 11 who doesn't take contributions from federal lobbyists.

And I think some of that is inherent in our democracy and I think it is sort of baked in to the very idea of representative government, of having a bicameral legislature with the house and the Senate and the checks and balances that we have, for example, between our legislative branch and our executive branch. But I think the reason I wrote the book is to reveal to people some of that math. I think it's OK to show the American people what democracy is really like, that's it's not that easy, that it is hard, that there are corrupting influences. What you often hear from people in politics is this condescending attitude that you just -- you, the regular voter, just couldn't understand how Washington works. That's nonsense. And the American people can and must understand how Washington works and why a lot of times it doesn't work.

He's going to be able to talk about addressing the climate crisis with his initiative and bringing down home energy costs for people with the Inflation Reduction Act. So, he's someone who has accomplished a tremendous amount as president and he's going to be able to run I think a very strong campaign on policy because he's actually delivered things that improve Americans lives. President Trump, on the other hand, I think is simply going to cast accusations. He's going to be divisive. He's going to continue to incite a kind of brand of, I think, very damaging and extremist politics. And I frankly think Americans, even those who are more Republican or more conservative, are tired of that. I represent Orange County, California right now in the U.S. Congress, and it's a very split area, about even numbers of Democrats and Republicans. And even folks who have voted for Donald Trump in the past I think are tired of him.

So, as we mentioned earlier, there are numerous challenges facing the health care system in the United States, with millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for a doctor's visit. Affordable health care is hard to come by Dr. Ricardo Nuilia works at a Texas hospital where cost is second to care. In his new book, he chronicles the lives of five patients who turned to his help after facing financial barriers.

What is a safety net hospital? DR. RICARDO NUILA, AUTHOR, \"THE PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL\":  Safety net hospital is a hospital that provides health care even if people don't have health insurance. The safety net hospital that I'm writing about is Ben Taub hospital. It's part of a system, as health care system in Houston, Texas, that provides health care for people who can't access health care or can't afford health care, which is becoming more and more in our society. Again, the safety net hospital is part -- in Houston is a public health care system. This is generated by property taxes to help assure that everybody has health coverage, health care in the city.",

And Houston, Texas is one -- is the highest uninsured state in the country, percentage wise. And that's more than 5 million. In the United States, that's 40 million people who are uninsured.

We're in a crisis of burnout in our profession, and a lot of that has to do with the bureaucracy that comes with our health care system. But when that is spread away and you can just deal with what you are in -- you're trained to do, which is to sit and think through problems with people, I think that that's one of the reasons why people come to the safety net hospital. They also come to see the different pathologies, the different illnesses that manifests in patients. And that's why lot of students really want to come to safety net hospitals to learn how to train, it makes them better doctors.",

But one of the things that set safely net hospitals apart, one of the things that we strive for is those -- that transparency and that conversation and that knowledge that we're going to be trying to help the person make the best decision for their own lives, and that has changed now because of the abortion laws in Texas.",

But when he started to get his disability payments, it put him over the -- he wasn't poor enough for Medicaid. And so, it was taken away from him. That was right at the moment where he needed a liver transplant to survive. The safety net system does not have transplant capabilities. The infrastructure that's needed to build transplant centers and to have the personnel so much high investment that, you know, a safety net a system really has to be utilitarian with these funds and say -- and transplants, it's just not something that it can afford. So, you know, one of our goals was to try to see if you could qualify for this insurance. Because in America, in order to get a transplant, you do need insurance, by and large.",

Explain how. DR. NUILA:  What's plagued us in America is trying to bring these two big concepts together. And they're represented by different political sides. I think we want to get costs under control and we want to provide health care for everybody in this country. But because it's so expensive, it's very difficult to provide for everybody. What I found in the system where I work in is that these conservative values of cost cutting have come together with the more liberal values of providing to everybody, regardless of citizenship or insurance status. And I think that one of the reasons that that's happened is because there's been conversations in order to make this system work. And that's what we really need to look for in designing a health care system, is that everybody needs to weigh in and we have to look at our similarities. Seven out of 10 Texans believe that the federal government has a role in providing basic health insurance to everybody in the country. I mean, think about that. That means that across the political spectrum there is agreement, we just have to focus on that agreement. And what I am really proud of is that I work in a system where we found those political ways through those political ideologies.",

So, how can you keep the costs where they are and still have a level of expertise that the rest of the country hasn't got yet? DR. NUILA:  I think that is the philosophy of quality improvement and making sure that the health care goes to what's needed, OK? There's just not waste in the system like there is waste in the private health care system, since it's evidence-based medicine and since we are not performing more health care than is necessary, then we can focus on emergencies like heart attacks, strokes, trauma and build -- break protocols to identify those and to take care of those in a timely manner. You know, if you think on the other side, you know, those -- the resources are used for other things that are not as essential and vital for those things.

DR. NUILA:  Yes, that's a great question. And so, there's ways to look at how much Medicare is paying per patient per year. For instance, this year it was $15,000 per patient per year that Medicare is paying. Private insurance pays less, but only because Medicare is for patients that are 65 and older, who usually utilize health services more. So, if you take apples and apples, private insurance is actually paying more. But at that our health system, you can look and see what the overall budget is and how many people are in the system and it's -- more or less, it's less, it's 30 percent of the total costs. And one of the things that I do in my book is follow a patient and the medical bill that he occurs in our public health care system where there is that profit motive. One of the patients who had treatment for (INAUDIBLE) cancer that involve x-ray therapy, surgeries, admissions, his total bill was, what he calls it, less than a pickup truck, $40,000, which is for people who have been in the health care system, they know how little that is compared to the equivalent in the private system where there's a profit motive.",

And I just went through what the algorithm on how to deal with that, you know. And when the algorithm -- she got a test and it was a normal test, I just chalked it up to, OK, your symptom -- I don't know what your symptom is due to. And later, I found out that she got another test when she went back to El Salvador that showed that she had esophageal cancer. And it just showed me that I had been subject to something that I call algorithm mania, which is that the over reliance on algorithms. I had stopped thinking about the symptom, stop thinking about the person of my grandmother, the moment that that test came back. And what I wish that I had done was followed that symptom and said, OK, this test was negative. What -- do you still have symptoms? What else can we do to figure this out? What ended up happening was is that it led to a spiral, really, where she ended up getting an unnecessary surgery in El Salvador and she -- I think she suffered greatly from that.

And -- but we can solve this problem if we just think about what we aim for, which is we need to decrease costs and we need to give health care access to everybody. There's strength in numbers.
