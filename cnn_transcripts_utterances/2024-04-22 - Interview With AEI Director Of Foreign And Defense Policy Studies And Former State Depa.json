I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Opening arguments were heard in the first ever criminal trial of an American president, as a jury of 12 determines whether Donald Trump engaged in 2016 election interference over the payment of hush money to an alleged lover. This just six 2024 election, where he's vying to get his old job back. Foes and allies of the United States around the world will be watching closely, some with increasing alarm, especially Ukraine. The embattled nation did get that much delayed, badly needed boost from the House this weekend after Speaker Mike Johnson defied the Trump wing of his party to pass a crucial aid package that'll also benefit Israel and Taiwan. But whether the U.S. continues such support to Ukraine in the future will depend on what Americans decide in November. Joining me now from Taipei is Kori Schake. She's a former state and Pentagon official now at the American Enterprise Institute. And joining us from Rome is Nathalie Tocci, a former special adviser to the E.U. foreign policy chief and at the International Institute in Rome. Welcome, both of you, to the program. Kori, can I ask you first, since I assume you're getting a lot of questions as an American overseas, about what's going on. I'm sure about the election, but can we first ask whether just this trial is raising any questions from people you meet in Taiwan and on the road?",

You've heard President Zelenskyy, you know, be really sad and complaining about how the West and all the allies went to the help of a of another non-NATO ally, Israel, when it was being attacked by, you know, missiles and drones from Iran, but never helps -- and certainly the anti-aircraft systems are dwindling, never helps Ukraine against Russia, or hasn't in the last few months.

You know, the analogy that they used to me is, you know, this really is like, you know, being thrown into a ring. And being told that for every 10 punches that you receive, you're only allowed one back. And doing all this while avoiding a K.O., right? So, this, in a sense, is the predicament that Ukraine is going to be in over the next few months, regardless of what happens.

It assists in us rebuilding our defense industry and it helps us prepare for future conflict. And I think that argument has been accepted by representatives. And so, this was a bellwether vote about America and the world in addition to being a vote about the specifics, and I think that makes me more confident than it sounds like Nathalie might be that we've laid a foundation for continued American support, continued American engagement.

She was living in Washington, D.C., and she moved back to Louisiana, and she moved back with this hope of -- from a legal perspective and from an organizational perspective and as a member of her community, seeing if she could get help rebuild and help keep that community in place and kind of prevent this migration this diaspora. And her story is a 15-year battle to do that. And sort of slowly coming to realize that, in some sense, it is a losing proposition or a difficult proposition in Southern Louisiana, and that's because Hurricane Katrina, so many years ago, was really the start of a shift of population out of that region. And we see, you know, along Louisiana Coast, which is sinking and being subsumed by sea level rise already a gradual decline in population. And so, Colette's story is kind of an example of the nuance of American climate migration, where it's not black and white, it is not a disaster happens and people move, but it is sort of a long and emotional battle and a difficult decision to make you try to stay, you leave for a short time, you come back, you try to rebuild, the rebuilding doesn't work out, or it's too expensive, and then slowly, you kind of give up.

And what that means is a potential revitalization for a lot of those communities, or at least a lot of the opportunity for growth that comes with a growing population, maybe an influx of younger families, you know, energized middle class families. But to seize on that growth, a lot of the experts that I talked to talk about the need to carefully plan, develop policies that support that migratory movement, that prepare things like infrastructure and prepare things like housing and -- you know, and are ready to witness and smooth the path for that movement.

But there was a recognition of the need for the kinds of things I said, like investment in infrastructure. And you see cities like Buffalo, New York, claiming that there'll be a climate refuge and marketing themselves that way, but not really developing the policy yet, but presumably that would come. And another interesting case study that I looked at in my reporting is the City of Atlanta, which, in some ways, is the furthest along. Atlanta is modeled to be a real recipient of potentially millions of American climate migrants, and Atlanta has spent the last decade greening and improving its infrastructure across large parts of the city in really positive ways that make parts of the city more sustainable. But now, it's grappling with a new set of challenges, which is sort of a teaching moment, you know, which is defending against the gentrification that's resulted from some of their greening and the need to -- you know, to protect some of those communities as you plan for incoming climate migration.

But one of the sets of reasons is a host of perverse incentives that the United States has always had to attract people and effectively blind them from the risk that they face in moving to places like Coastal Florida. And one of those subsidies is the provision of homeowners insurance or property insurance. And Florida is a great example of this. After Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, insurers were leaving the state and it might have suggested that property was uninsurable, but the state stepped in and said, we don't want all these people to leave the state because of this economic risk. We are going to provide our own insurance. And so, they created a state subsidized plan that basically said, anybody can get insurance and will promise it's going to be cheaper than any other insurance on the market. And that's the type of thing that has attracted many more people to Florida and has been replicated across 30 odd states in the country and that's a kind of just one example of policies that tend to sort of blunt the risk and the personal economic household decision-making that people have to make about where they live in this country.",

So, the smart thing that China is doing is establishing its leadership in a renewable economy in -- you know, in electric vehicleproduction and producing batteries and in creating renewable energy resources. So, that's all great. And I think that's what that analysis was about. And I have no bones with that, but its emissions are still astronomical. And those initial those emissions, they just have to plateau or decline as quickly as possible, almost immediately. And the sooner that that happens, you know, the more the global effects of warming will be blunted. And by extension, again, you know, the migration that will result. So, yes, there is a positive example that China is setting. It's opportunistic, which is great. It should seize that opportunity to shift its economy towards renewables.

ZOYA EL-MIARI, PALESTINIAN AND UKRAINIAN REFUGEE AND PEACE AMBASSADOR, ONE YOUNG WORLD: Thank you for the introduction. My name is Zoya. I'm half Palestinian, half Ukrainian. My dad is Palestinian from Lebanon. My mom is Ukrainian. I grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp, Ein El Hilweh, which is the largest refugee camp in Lebanon. These Palestinian camps were built after the Palestinians were forced to flee their homes back in Palestine in 1948. And after that, the communities, they're kept on growing and growing. And I lived in this refugee camp, which was a community filled with child abuse, mental illnesses, ongoing clashes until the age of 15. And later in 2021, when the situation in Lebanon was getting worse and worse, we decided to move to Ukraine for a fresh start. And later in 2022, the war starts in Ukraine, and we have to escape the war for a second time in our lives and becoming refugees for a second time.",

And with the good quality education that I got, the children there were coming from richer communities. And in that situation, I was really scared because of the associated stereotypes. So, I remember when other students were worried about their grades. I was really scared that they would ask me where do you come from, that they would discover my reality living in a refugee camp. So, I was really scared to tell them that I live in a refugee camp or I was really ashamed about this reality.",

EL-MIARI: When the war started in Ukraine and we were escaping the war for the second time, because back in 2006, the war between Lebanon and Israel, we were also forced to flee Lebanon to Ukraine because Ukraine always represented a safe space for us, a safe haven. So, whenever something bad was happening in Lebanon, we would always go to Ukraine. And this time that the war was happening in Ukraine, we had to escape the war for the second time. And I remember when we were in the train heading to Poland, my mom told me, Zoya, we should sing. And we started singing Ukrainian folk songs. And with each song, our resilience was growing stronger. And this time, I promised myself that if I make it out alive, I refuse to become the victim I once was. But rather, I would become a warrior and a fighter. I would fight for those in Ukraine and I would fight for my Palestinian side, the side, that as a kid, I was afraid to fight for.",

And I can talk about the language that is being associated with Ukrainian refugees, for example, and my other half being Palestinian. For example, growing up, we always got used to Palestinians being portrayed as barbarians or terrorists. And on the other hand, now as Ukrainians, we were refugees, European refugees who the world saw as part of them, you know, part of those people. So, often the language that is being used in western media, European media, always portrays the Palestinians as terrorists. So, in a way, that is how the genocide that's happening in Gaza right now, in a way, people are not able to see that what's happening is terrible because of the media that has been portraying the Palestinians over and over again as barbarians or terrorists. So, that's the conflicting double standards that's happening when the media portrays the Palestinians, one side of me in one way and the other side of me in another way. And it's very important to point out that both sides of me are worth living, whether I'm Palestinian or Ukrainian, or wherever I come from, I am worth of living. I deserve to live. So, yes, we are not terrorists. We are actual human beings. Even as refugees, we are not just numbers or statistics to be portrayed on a screen or mainstreamed on the media. We are actual human beings. We are children who are full of dreams and aspirations. We are mothers and fathers who really love their children unconditionally. So, no, we are not terrorists. We are human beings just like everyone else.",

How do you stay a family when parts of your family are here, parts of your family are there, and you knowthat they're both in lands where there is danger? EL-MIARI: This is a very sad reality, and this is what refugees have to go through when the families are scattered all around the world because of the lack of safety and security. So, there is some type of survival guilt, of course, because in a way we were saved. But also in Lebanon, the situation is very bad, in Ukraine as well. So, it's always continuous worrying about what could happen here. What could that could happen there? Also in West Bank, also in Gaza. So, it's continuously really being in a survival mode, of course. And in a way, that really also makes me question, like, what is home to me? I grew up questioning myself, what is home to me? Because so many people, if you ask them, like, what is home to you, they can really specify, like, that's my home, that's my home. And to me, like, how can I say that Palestine is my home, if I'm not even allowed to visit my home country? Or how can I say Lebanon is my home if I grew up as a Palestinian refugee there? Or in Ukraine now, there is a war. So, this also reminds me of the conversations I used to have with my grandfather who was forced to flee Palestine back in 1948, and he was sharing with me that, at the time, they thought that they were leaving their homes just for three days, and that they were going back home. And they left Palestine with their keys that they kept on holding for so long, wishing that they can only use them back home. And my grandfather died in Lebanon, Palestinian refugee died in Lebanon with his only one dream, to use those keys and go back home buried with him. And this really makes me question like why some people from Brooklyn or Europe can come to Palestine and take the Israeli citizenship and take the -- enjoy their human rights when us as Palestinians who grew up outside of Palestine, around 6 million Palestinians outside of Palestine, and we are not even allowed to go and visit our country, not only not go back to our home, but not even visit. So, my dad even -- my dad, who grew up in Lebanon, he's never -- he has never visited his home country in Palestine, because he's not even allowed to go there and visit.",

For so long I was questioning what peace means to me, because as a child growing up in a refugee camp, honestly, all what I wanted was peace. I did not understand in my community where, I hated that community growing up, honestly. For so long, I couldn't understand or comprehend why people that were so angry all the time or resort to violence as a way of expressing themselves or their pain until I grew older and understood that those people, my people are actually oppressed. They were never taught ways to express themselves in a more healthier way. And that's where I felt that that need to become a peace ambassador, to teach people how they can express themselves in a way that their pain could actually be used as a peaceful weapon. So, I became a peace ambassador after participating in a One Young World Summit back in Manchester. And I was questioning myself, what does peace mean to me after the situation, the genocide and Gaza started. And I came to realize that peace is something I value. That's one of my top values in life. But I also understood that with peace comes justice. If I'm fighting for peace, that means that I'm fighting for justice as well. Because when there is no justice, there is no peace. So, today, that is what peace means to me. Peace means fighting against the occupation, ending the occupation. Only then we can achieve peace.",
