We have all of that straight ahead.But we are going to begin with this, President Zelenskyy's surprise trip to Washington D.C. It's his first trip outside of Ukraine since Russia's invasion and it comes at a very pivotal time as the U.S. prepares to announce nearly $2 billion in military aid for Ukraine's defenses, including Patriot missile systems. And moments ago, Zelenskyy was seen arriving in Poland. You see the pictures right there. We have learned that he traveled by train to a town near the Polish/Ukrainian border as part of his journey here. So, it is under way. Straight to CNN's Will Ripley in the region, in Ukraine for us.

Although the reality is that the war continues.Just hours after President Zelenskyy tweeted that he was on his way to the U.S. to meet with President Biden, the air raid sirens sounded here across Ukraine, pretty much like every other day of this conflict since this began on February 24th. But the difference, of course, is that Zelenskyy physically no longer in Kyiv or actively in the country on his way out is the first overseas trip by the Ukrainian president. It shows from the perspective of commentators here a level of confidence that he's willing to go to the United States for this major announcement, not any concern about the security of Ukraine or his own security leaving. But nonetheless, the Ukrainian people understand and he has a big challenge ahead as he meets with lawmakers in the U.S., some of whom are growing increasingly skeptical that the war should drag on as long as the Ukrainians say it needs to. They want to see the return to pre- 2014 territorial by Ukrainian, which would include retaking illegally annexed Crimea. Of course, Russia took that almost nine years ago. That pretty started this whole thing. And so from the Ukrainian perspective, this war doesn't end until they get back everything that Russia took but he might find a different message meeting with U.S. lawmakers. He's certainly gotten some pressure members of NATO, including the French president, calling for peace talks with Russia, Don.",

They are assembling troops up to the northern border in Belarus. There continues to be very intense fighting on the east, into the south.

You're two experts in this area, so we're so glad to have you this morning.And, Ambassador Taylor, I'd like to start with you on just how critical the visit is and what you're going to be watching for as President Zelenskyy makes such a historic trip to the United States, his first time out of Ukraine since Russia invaded his country. AMB. WILLIAM TAYLOR, V.P. USIP STRATEGIC STABILITY:  Kaitlan, you're exactly, Kaitlan, a great visit, a great opportunity. He will certainly -- President Zelenskyy will certainly thank the American people. He will thank President Biden. He will thank the Congress for all the support and it has been major. It has been significant. It has been overwhelming. It has been huge, the support that we've provided. And the Ukrainians really appreciate it.

And that is a huge focus. It's one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. arsenal. But do you expect President Zelenskyy to also ask for more given this is not signaling that the war is coming to an end any time soon?LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET.), FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Yes. So, to me the delivery or the announcement of the Patriot missile system is important but it's frankly less important than a signal that the U.S. government is prepared to provide other advanced capabilities and that the U.S. is going to start training Ukraine on how to operate everything, from aircraft, U.S. aircrafts, like F-16s, F-15s. Tanks are in the mix, starting to train forces on those tanks. These are systems that are complex, require a lot training, not just for the operators but for the (INAUDIBLE) to be in working order. One of the biggest challenges that the Ukrainians face at the moment is that they need an enormous amount of equipment. And over the course of ten months, a lot of it has started to break down. So, a broader, kind of more strategic relationship and a more strategic view on sustaining this war for the next six to nine months is going to be absolutely critical. And I think that's exactly why President Zelenskyy is making this trip now. He's -- it's halftime, he's run up the score real high. The endgame is the spring and summer and he's going to push through until he liberates the entirety of his country. And he's looking for the U.S., his strategic partner, his strategic ally, to wade in in the same way with the same kind of commitment.",

Let's increase the resources for the processing of asylum claims so it can be done timely. Let's have more immigration judges there so that they're not caught and then released into our society and we don't -- are not able to -- whenever their asylum claim is denied, we can't find them at that point. And so that has to be done. So, I think there can be bipartisan support for border security bill. But we also have to have a replacement for Title 42. It can't last forever.

They've shown incredible courage in this, but it's a long struggle and we need to continue that support and give them the support they need.
