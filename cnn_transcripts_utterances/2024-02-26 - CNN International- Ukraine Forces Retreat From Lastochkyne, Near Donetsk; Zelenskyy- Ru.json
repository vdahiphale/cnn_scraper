      "sentences": "All right. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is joining me now live from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. I mean, a stark warning there from President Zelenskyy. You've been covering the war since the very beginning, more than two years ago. What are your thoughts on what he had to say - what Zelenskyy had to say? And what's the outlook for Ukraine if they don't get further aid, $60 billion from the United States?NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTL. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Ultimately, Zelenskyy has for the last month been trying to tread this very difficult path between not immediately expressing to Ukrainian troops and the population here that they don't get that aid they've done for because it's very possible they won't, and they'll have to rely on meager European contributions to get them through. But, at the same time too, sounding the alarm to Western allies about how urgently this all is. Now, I think in that interview, he certainly made that point, suggesting that in the gap between what Ukraine wants to be able to do and what it will be able to do if it doesn't get the aid, that many more millions of lives will be lost. But, I think it's also important to point out, we are today seeing the slight possibility of what Russian momentum on the battlefield looks like. The key thing he said to Kaitlan there is, without that ammunition, we also can't defend. And we've seen that on the front lines too. Without the ability to use artillery to pound Russian positions on the offensive, by definition, Ukraine finds itself way more vulnerable than it would have done months ago. And around Avdiivka, a town we talked about over the past 10 days, Ukraine announced the withdrawal of its forces from there after a months-long bloody battle two Saturdays ago. Well, we're seeing today recognition from Ukraine that it has pulled out of a small village, a tiny thing, you probably wouldn't notice it if you drove through it, frankly, Lastochkyne, three miles to the northwest of Avdiivka. Ukraine have pulled out of that. Now, they have packaged this as essentially a strategic decision again, like Avdiivka, to pull back to more easily defendable positions. But, ultimately, this is Russian pressure continuing and yielding results. Now, when Avdiivka fell, Ukraine said the Russians have got forces there. They can continue to pressure. The Russian said, we've got enough momentum. We're going to keep moving forwards, and that has now been realized in Lastochkyne and that is indeed also leading to suggestions from some pro-Russian sources that actually they're able to pressure the next villages along as well. [08:05:00] Now, many Western analysts think that Russians simply haven't got the juice for any kind of breakthrough. But, the slow relenting attrition we're seeing are multiple positions along the front line, it's not just Avdiivka. They've been trying south of where I am, near Robotyne, one of the key successes of the southern counteroffensive, again, a tiny village, frankly. They've been trying to push there too. They're trying around Kharkiv. They're trying around Bakhmut. A lot of bids to yield some kind of momentum. And this is happening just when Zelenskyy is having to give this lengthy appeal for aid. It's a position, sadly, of weakness for Ukraine because of failure by the West to do what they promised they were going to do. And it is now translating into territorial changes, and starkly, as he said, the likelihood of many, many Ukrainian lives being lost, because Russia will now feel significantly more resurgent.",

But, in my new shy of a rump of extremists, Republicans holding up an aid package and not even allowing it, frankly, to come to a vote, that's not even something they can contemplate till the end of this week. That is something remarkably has become part of the Ukrainian consciousness here. They're having to work out quite how the U.S. is going to push that through.And when we were here in December, seeing that initial strange behavior on the Hill, there were certainly an impact on morale. I remember one medic saying to me, without that, we're just done. I'm out of here. And that's translating now slowly into, I think, a recognition amongst Ukrainians that for the first time in two years things may not go the way they had hoped. There has been such a sense of resilience and resourcefulness. We're watching people make up for the lack of artillery shells by fashioning $500 drones with huge batteries and RPG shells zip tied to them, because they haven't had the artillery shells they using in the past. And so, yeah. I think there is a real sense of gloom here amongst many Ukrainians, but they don't really have a choice but to fight on, Amara.",

Mohammad Shtayyeh says the next stage and its challenges require new political arrangements. It's not clear when the resignation will take effect. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has not responded to the resignation. Now, this is happening as the Israeli military presents a plan for evacuating civilians from areas of fighting in Gaza. The proposal does not specifically mention the city of Rafah where Israel has been talking about a potential ground offensive. The UN Secretary General is once again sounding the alarm, warning that a ground attack on Russia will be \"the final nail in the coffin\" of the UN's aid operation in Gaza. CNN' Nic Robertson is live in Tel Aviv with the very latest. Hi there, Nic. So, tell us more about the resignations that we're seeing in the government of the Palestinian Authority?

I think when we heard from the UN Secretary General speaking in Geneva today, where he was talking about Rafah is, this is the main point, the core, I think you call that, of the humanitarian operations for the whole of Gaza because this is the easiest to access the two crossings, Kerem Shalom and the Rafah border crossing, very close to Rafah, 1.5 million people are estimated, Palestinians estimated to be there now. So, the bulk of the Gaza population is there. So, this is where the bulk of the distribution has been. So, if that goes into the situation that we've seen in Gaza City or in other parts of Gaza where the IDF goes in with a massive ground force, the idea that there can be distribution of food and water to people just goes out the window.Now, this idea that the civilian population could be moved out of the way is something the Prime Minister here continues, Prime Minister Netanyahu continues to talk about it. He was saying just a few minutes ago that he got a briefing from his chiefs of staff inside their security cabinet last night. Now, he didn't go into detail. The IDF has not gone into detail. The only sense that we can have of what an evacuation plan looks like is what the IDF has done previously in Gaza, which is warn the civilian population in certain neighborhoods. You need to get out. You need to get out now. You need to take this route and go to this place. But, what we've seen happen in that scenario, that version of an evacuation plan, civilians get killed in their homes, killed on the roads for the safe places, and killed in the safe places. It is not a failsafe everyone gets to be safe and live to the next day scenario. But, what's precisely planned this time, we haven't seen that yet.",

He was sent to a very harsh penal colony in the Arctic, north of Russia. And every time he appeared on camera, even though he seemed in good spirits, you could see him getting thinner. You could see him looking more pallid. And so, there were concerns consistently about his health.And the circumstances of his death have not been fully explained. We understand from Navalny's team that Navalny's mother, Lyudmila, who has been at that penal colony and has seen his body and taken reception of it as well, signed his official birth certificates on which it said he died of natural causes. But, obviously, the suspicion amongst Kremlin critics and amongst supporters of Navalny is that that's not the case. And there was something else at play. But, there is no way for us at the moment to sort of investigate that without sort of an independent autopsy, which I think is not being given by the authorities. In terms of the Russian citizen, Vadim Krasikov, who the Russians want back, I mean, they've made no secret about that. I mean, Vladimir Putin has himself spoken on several occasions about wanting this individual, Krasikov, back from German custody, where he was convicted of murder some years ago. He is sort of said to be sent -- said to have been sent by the Russians to carry out a hit against a Chechen dissident inside a park in Germany. He was convicted of that murder. And so, yes, this is the one individual who the Russians want more than anyone else to be returned as part of any possible prisoner swap, Amara.",

They saw it as the enemy. That mindset sort of persisted as Mexico City was built. Lots of concrete, lots of sprawl. So, when the water falls, it runs off and doesn't sink into the aquifer. About 60 percent of Mexico City's water comes from that aquifer, which has been overpumped so dramatically. The city is sinking at up to a foot and a half a year in some places there. The other portion of the water comes from outside the city is often pumped uphill, or 40 percent of that water leaks through leaky infrastructure as well.So, these compounding problems as El Nino and La Nina cycles, change weather patterns there. It sort of varies it. But, overall, 22 million people depending on this water system at a very high elevation, over 7,000 feet, is leading up to what some are worried about a day zero where they could ultimately run out. It wouldn't be like Cape Town, South Africa, a few years back because they only had one source of water. There are multiple sources.
