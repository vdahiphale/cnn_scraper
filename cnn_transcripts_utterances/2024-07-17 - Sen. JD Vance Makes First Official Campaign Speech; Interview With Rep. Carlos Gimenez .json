We were only allowed to listen to about the first 10 minutes of it. He said he would keep his remarks short because he has more to say later tonight. He said he is very excited about this evening to make what he says is the very easy case to reelect Donald Trump. He also then went on to attack the media and its coverage of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump over the weekend then began talking about Biden's economic policy, what he described as rampant inflation and he cited statistics from his home state of Ohio as well. Let's get the latest reporting now with CNN's Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene, who has been tracking the latest from the RNC since before it even began. Kristen Holmes is with us now. What should we expect to hear from JD Vance later tonight -- Kristen.",

He actually has to do that. Remember, he has been on the national republican scene for a very short while. He has been a senator, he is the junior senator from Ohio since November of 2022. He has almost no exposure out there other than what we have seen and other than the years we saw of him trashing Donald Trump and there are a lot of people in the Republican Party who don't know anything about him and who really want to learn who this guy actually is. All he has done right now is won over President Donald Trump, President Donald Trump's family, and really the kings of the MAGA movement, talking about Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump, Jr. et cetera, but not the rest of the Republican Party. They still don't know him, so that is one of the things that he really has to spend the next couple times doing. What he has to do on stage tonight is tell the American people who he is. He has done a couple of interviews here and there. He has had a media presence, but not really explained his life story other than in his book, and a lot of America obviously hasn't read that book. Now, what we are expecting tonight from him, he will be up on stage. He is obviously the keynote speaker. He will be introduced by Usha Vance, his wife. She herself is a fascinating human being. She was a trial lawyer. She met him at Yale Law School. He credits her with all of his success, and the entire theme is Make America Strong Again, so what they're focused on is veterans. You're going to hear from Gold Star families. You're going to hear from a family of an Israeli hostage. But the keynote speaker here is JD Vance.",

Congressman, great to see you, as always. You were supportive of Marco Rubio, Florida senator for the vice presidential nomination. I am wondering if you think it is a missed opportunity for Donald Trump to not have selected Rubio. REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): Look, I think that President Trump has every right to choose who he wanted. He feels that Senator Vance is somebody who is better suited. I mean, he did a lot of talking to different people. He vetted a lot of people, and he took this is a very deliberate process. And I think that the last statement was true. He knows that whoever it was that he chose to be his vice president and once he got elected, that that individual will be the presumptive nominee in 2028, and somebody that will carry on the tradition or his policies, past his four years and I think that was very important to him. And so, he felt that Senator Vance was the best person to do that, and so the entire party will be behind Senator Vance as we are behind President Trump.",

I mean, I have a different background, I come from Cuba obviously, right, and the Russians were there for 60 years. They have been part of the oppressors of the Cuban people. And so my experiences with Russia are somewhat different from Senator Vance, hopefully Vice President Vance, but also part of this experience will be a learning experience as he is vice president, learning from a great president and views change. I mean, even his views have moderated, changed over time, and so we are human beings and we need to grow. And I am not saying that hit if he grows, he is going to change his view, but I think that that disagreement is not necessarily bad.",

He was way ahead of the curve on that.He understands the threat that China is, not only to the United States, but I think also to the rest of the world. Look, China is getting alliances now with Russia, North Korea, Iran, making this axis of evil, right, a new axis of evil that wants to establish a new world order, and guess what? The United States isn't part of that new world order. I sit on the China Select Committee. I see the threat that China is. I know that the president sees the threat that China is. If China were allowed to take over, invade, and actually conquer Taiwan, they would now control 90 percent of the world's chips and guess what? The world kind of runs on chips right now. And so China would control commerce, all kinds of things and to the detriment of America, to the detriment of the free world, because look, China, without a doubt, is a communist regime, a brutal communist regime. It has been accused of genocide, been accused of all kinds of things and so, yes, I don't -- I don't want to see China be the dominant world power, especially for my children and my grandchildren, and I don't think that President Trump -- I think he sees it the same way.",

We can look pre-debate, we can look post-debate, and then we can look post the events of Saturday, and what we see is really there is just not any real movement there. Trump was ahead by two, then you get a tie, then you have Trump ahead by two. So look, this is a race that has no clear leader. It is within the margin of error. I should note that the Reuters-IPSOS poll has tended to be one of Biden's better polls. So the fact that Trump is even ahead there, even though it is within the margin of error is a good sign for him, but in terms of movement, which is what I am talking about here, there just hasn't been significant movement, which isn't such a surprise given how stagnant things have been so far.",

I want to really take our viewers through each of these new photos that were able to obtain from our CNN affiliate, WPXI here in the Pittsburgh area just to give an understanding of like you said, what may have been leading up to this shooting.So the first photo is of Thomas Matthew Crooks. That's our suspect here and it was taken by local law enforcement, according to WPXI before the shooting happened, like you said, potentially about at least 30 minutes or so before. Now, this photo was taken specifically in reaction to something that we've been discussing that local law enforcement spotted Crooks being a little bit suspicious near the metal detectors, and specifically because he had one of these rangefinder devices, kind of looks like a pair of binoculars and it is used to tell the distance between two points, often used by hunters or other marksmen. Then we have another photo, and it looks like a backpack next to a bicycle. And the reason that WPXI was able to obtain this photo is because they are reporting that the last time that local law enforcement saw Crooks before the altercations on top of the roof, he had this backpack on his person. And then we have these two other photos that really are stunning to see, these photos shot basically what was found on Crooks' person after Secret Service killed him. You can see there is that cellphone, which we know we've reported for the past few days, the FBI worked very, very hard to crack. They did access, but were unable to find anything that pointed to motive. And then there is that transmitter device, which we understand from law enforcement sources is used to detonate things like fireworks. So again, as we are learning bit by bit more about what happened leading up to the moment of the shooting, these pictures are really filling in some of the gaps so far in this investigation -- Brianna.",
