She made that finding.Two, Donald Trump engaged in that insurrection. Three, that means he's not qualified to be on the primary ballot in Maine. And four, she found it is her responsibility to make these decisions. So putting that all together, this came because voters had asked her to look at this, to make a ruling under the way that the state lays out. She can, as the Secretary of State, to determine if people are eligible for the ballot there in Maine. She looked at the evidence. Some of that evidence was much of what the House January 6th Committee found. She looked at statements by Donald Trump. She said, you know, it's even kind of a close call on whether Trump engaged in this insurrection. It would have been easier if he had been tried already in criminal trial, either acquitted or found guilty. But she did come down on the side of saying yes, indeed, Trump does fit this profile and that I believe, as a Secretary of State, he cannot be on the ballot. Here is what she wrote specifically, \"I am mindful that no Secretary of State has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\" That's the insurrection clause. \"I am also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection. The oath I swore to uphold the Constitution comes first above all.\" Her ruling is on hold for a little bit. But this is a very clear ruling from the Maine Secretary of State coming down on Donald Trump as an insurrectionist and saying he can't be voted for in the primary.",

It shouldn't be the sort of thing that states are even allowed to do, to remove Donald Trump from the presidential ballot. And they say they're going object in state court. Under the law, they are allowed to do that. She does say she's going to wait to see the next court's ruling here.

The 14th Amendment Section 3 says no person shall be a senator, representative in Congress, or elected president and vice president or hold any office -- it goes on to say -- if they shall have engaged in insurrection.

So it is not uncommon for states to have different ballot access requirements. We do, however, have to uphold the constitution and the rule of law equally. We do not set the qualifications. But under Maine law, the Secretary of State is tasked with assessing those qualifications when presented with a challenge by any registered named voter. And in this case, we had two former Republican state senators, Kimberley Rosen and Thomas Saviello, former Democratic State Senator Ethan Strimling, as well as two individuals -- Ms. Royal and Attorney Gordon -- who brought challenges under Maine law to the ballot access. We had qualified Mr. Trump for the ballot. They challenged that. We're required to hold a hearing. And then when we looked at the weight of evidence, it became clear that January 6th was an attack not only on the Capitol, on government officials, but also an attack on the rule of law that it was an insurrection, and that the US Constitution does not tolerate an assault on our government on the foundations of our government.

Again, it was an interesting discussion and an interesting take from the Maine Secretary of State here. The 14th Amendment Section 3 says, in plain text, that if you shall have engaged in insurrection, you can't be in office. She takes that to mean that if she determines that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection, he can't be on the Maine primary ballot. Is it that simple?",

The complicated part and where we are going to see this play out in the courts is who gets to decide and by what process.Now, it's important to note -- and in the ruling -- the Secretary of State we just heard from says, she's basically following the same legal reasoning as the Colorado Supreme Court did last week. And she says in her ruling, if this gets struck down in Colorado, we're out of luck, too. So, she is basing it on the same legal argument. Let me sort of lay out the arguments both sides. And by the way, it's worth saying we're all theorizing here. We're in legally unknown territory. The argument against is, first of all, the 14th Amendment Section 5 says Congress has the authority to pass laws to implement this. They did. They passed the criminal law. And the argument is that means Congress, not the states. But perhaps -- and this is the argument that the Maine Secretary of State and Colorado made -- the states can do it, too. If that's true, then Section 2 -- question two is were the processes -- were these hearings fair? Did they comport with due process? And I think there's a question there with regard to what Maine did because if you look at the hearing, and she details this in the ruling, they heard from one fact witness, a law professor. She based her ruling on a lot of documents, but also YouTube clips, news reports, things that would never pass the bar in normal court. She's not a lawyer, by the way. It's a smartly written decision, clearly consulted with lawyers, but this is an unelected. She is chosen by the state legislature.",

And later, the remarkable story of a woman's murder. Her daughter who was just freed from prison today and the horrifying abuse she suffered. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:21:46] BERMAN: At the end of a day that just saw Maine's Secretary of State remove Donald Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment, his opponent, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley was trying to clean up remarks she made about the war, which inspired that amendment. She was talking today about her answer last night to a basic question about the civil war. It's one that most fifth graders have no trouble answering. It's a question many applicants for citizenship are asked. Question 74, in fact, quote, \"Name one problem that led to the civil war.\" The first of three acceptable answers, slavery. And it's not like this is some new idea. In 1860, South Carolina lawmakers said so themselves -- it's about slavery. They said so, in writing, repeatedly in their declaration of secession. In it, they complained about, quote, \"an increasing hostility on the part of non- slaveholding States to the institution of slavery.\" The document uses one form of the word slavery or another 18 times. Last night, Governor Haley did not mention it once until prompted. And today, she blew right past it, saying that if you grew up in the south, it's a given that the civil war was about slavery -- of course. But to her she said, it was about freedom, which is true, but only in the biggest, broadest, blandest sense. And maybe that's intentional. But if serving up such word flavor comfort food was her aim, it's worth asking, why? Why is what South Carolina's secessionists said in writing 160 years ago so hard to talk about now? We'll ask distinguished historian Michael Eric Dyson. First though, CNN's Eva McKend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course, the civil war was about slavery. We know that. That's unquestioned, always the case.

MARSHALL COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John, well, we have known bits and pieces of this story before, but this is the first time that we're getting the full picture. It comes from Ken Chesebro, who, in many ways, was the architect of the fake electors plot back in 2020. We have obtained recordings of his recent interview with Michigan investigators and hundreds of emails that he also turned over. They reveal that last minute scramble on the eve of January 6th to get those fake certificates to Washington, D.C. Take a listen to Chesebro here describing what happened when Trump campaign officials realized the day before that the ballots from Michigan and Wisconsin were stuck in the mail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNETH CHESEBRO, PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEY: The general counsel of the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the sorting facility in Michigan, which doesn't look like they're going to get to Pence in time. So the general counsel campaign was alarmed, and was chartering -- they didn't have to charter a jet, but they did commercial. This is like, yes, so this is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there. And they had to enlist a, you know, a U.S. senator to try to expedite it to get it to Pence in time.

Once they got to D.C., there was a series of handoffs and couriers. It even included some help from Senator Ron Johnson's office.
