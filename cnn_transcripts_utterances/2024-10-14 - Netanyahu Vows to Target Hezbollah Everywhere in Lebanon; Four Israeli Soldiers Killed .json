Coming to America to giant pandas leave China as the beloved bears head to Washington, D.C. And teleporting tech. Holographic communications platform Proto explains how they can transport you from one place to another, virtually, at least. We'll bring you that conversation and plenty more to you later on in the show. But first, a defiant message from Israel's prime minister vowing to target Hezbollah everywhere in Lebanon. It follows one of the bloodiest attacks on Israel since October 7th. Four IDF soldiers were killed after a Hezbollah drone targeted a military base Sunday. More than 60 people were injured. The U.S. now sending an advanced anti-missile system to Israel, along with U.S. troops to operate it. This, as Israel continues to pound targets inside Lebanon. On Monday, at least 19 people were killed in a Northern Lebanese village, according to the nation's Red Cross. The attack on the Christian majority village destroyed a building that was housing those who'd escaped from Lebanon's south. Nic Robertson has the very latest from Jerusalem for us. Nic, good to see you. I want to talk about that drone attack on Israel. I guess the key question is now, how did that happen and how do the Israelis prevent that happening again?",

There's that, there's all the undermining that goes on there. And here you have the UNIFIL troops on the border with Lebanon sort of on the blue line there. This line that was supposed to demarcate and separate and keep Hezbollah away from the border per the agreement 2006, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701. Israel doesn't believe those UNIFIL troops have done their job keeping Hezbollah away. They also believe that Hezbollah hides behind those posts. So, what happens when the conflict begins? The IDF has had strikes that have caused, up until this weekend, five casualties that we're aware of UNIFIL troops. It's drawing outrage from the countries that contribute troops to UNIFIL, it's drawn condemnation from the U.N. secretary general and others in the peacekeeping mission at the U.N. It doesn't seem to be going to a good place, and the prime minister has doubled down. And he says, look, we are not targeting those troops. We've been telling them to get out of the border. They're in the way. Hezbollah is hiding behind them. Hezbollah is using them as essentially human shields, they're saying, and witness the situation at the weekend, where the IDF say that they were ambushed. They were ambushed right by one of those U.N. bases. They used smoke to get the -- their troops out of that ambush. The smoke caused problems for the troops, for the U.N. troops hiding on that base. It seems very clear that the conflict is happening around the U.N. and it would -- this wouldn't be the first time in these cross-border conflicts going back to 2006 where the U.N. has literally had to pull its troops out of the way. The difference now is they're refusing to do that and saying that Israel may be constituting war crimes, as you say.",

So, you know, he is now delivering on that promise when he told us that he was going to be filing these lawsuits. Now, this all come from anonymous plaintiffs, both men and women. There are four John Does, meaning male accusers, and two Jane Does. These allegations, allegedly, you know, occurred over the course of decades, one of them coming from a 16-year-old male who says that in 1998 that he was at one of Combs' infamous white parties in the Hamptons in New York, and that is where he alleges that he was sexually assaulted. He said that he was excited to meet Sean Combs. He was excited to even be at that white party and that he was shocked. He even got the chance to talk to him. In his lawsuit, this John Doe, who again claims that he was 16- year-old at the time, he said that he was talking to combs about his career and that is when this alleged sexual assault occurred. Now, another one of these lawsuits coming from a then 19-year-old college age female She says that she had met Combs, that she was going to an after party for an event and that is where she alleges that she was raped. The details are very graphic, Julia, in all of these six lawsuits. I do want to note that I have reached out to representatives for Combs, I have not heard back from them yet, but they have denied all wrongdoing from all of these civil suits over the course of nearly a year. You'll remember that it was back in November of 2023 that his ex-wife girlfriend, Cassie, came forward with the first lawsuit, and that is what started this domino effect. And of course, he is incarcerated right now. He is awaiting his criminal trial. He has denied all criminal charges. He is facing three charges, and his trial has been set for next May.",

So, this is the coolest weather of the year so far, for sure. And a lot of times, Julia, when this cold front gets all the way down into the Gulf of Mexico down here, then all of a sudden that's where the hurricanes go, kind of following it along. The high pressure pushing them into the Central American area rather than the pushing them or pulling them out up into Florida or the East Coast. Not a lot of snow, one to two inches. I mean, less than 10 millimeters in most spots, but it will be very cold. Temperatures well below freezing, almost 30 million under freeze warnings, which means if you still have tomatoes in your garden in Upstate New York, all the way through the Upper Midwest, you need to get them out of there because temperatures will be plummeting here over the next couple of days, even the highs in Atlanta, only in the 60s, on up Chicago, you'll be 51 degrees tomorrow. Just to give you an idea of where we were, 84 down to 63 and the morning low is somewhere around 40.

Threats against relief workers have escalated as disinformation spreads about the Biden administration's handling of the storm's aftermath. In Hong Kong, authorities are investigating why eight monkeys were found dead in a zoo on Sunday. You're looking at De Brazza monkey, one of the types of monkeys that were discovered. The Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has closed its mammal sections as tests are carried out. North Koreans are being sent to help Russian troops in Ukraine, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He claims that ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have grown beyond the exchange of weaponry. A Ukrainian intelligence source says some North Koreans have been helping with the use of their ammunition. The Kremlin calls Zelenskyy's claim a hoax. And 22 days until Election Day in the United States, and no clear leader in CNN's latest poll of polls. Presidential hopefuls are stepping up their efforts to reach undecided voters. Democrat Kamala Harris will sit down for her first ever interview with the Fox News network on Wednesday, taking her message to a conservative audience that's unlikely to be open, perhaps to what she has to say. The interview will air just hours after a Fox town hall where Republican Donald Trump meets with an all-female audience in the battleground State of Georgia. Joining us now to talk about is pollster and communication strategist, Frank Luntz. Great to have you on the show, Frank, as always.

And I still believe that based on the polling and the focus groups, that Harris has the most narrow of leads nationwide. And that the swing states are completely up for grabs right now, those seven key states. So, I've begun to look at this as quite similar to 2016, when Donald Trump surprised viewers -- surprised voters, and beat Hillary Clinton, because even though he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million people, he still won the Electoral College. And that's what we're looking at in 2024. And one more point, you see all these candidates now doing interviews in places that they never spoke to before. Trump reaching out to women, his weakest group. Harris talking to Fox News viewers.

It could be a combination of the two. But I think if we go back to 2016 and the surprise of the Hillary Clinton loss versus the Trump win, is that the same degree of complacency for the Democrats in particular at this moment, or do they recognize perhaps the danger?

The New York Times poll that we got over the weekend had Harris leading Trump 56 percent to 37 percent among Latino voters. And I think the message is look, she's winning the black vote. She's winning the Latino vote. It's just at a lower percentage than we've seen in previous elections for Democrats. And that's sort of where the alarm comes. In terms of the black men in particular, again, she's making an outreach today. We've got a rally that she's going to do later on today. You did a focus group for young men, men under 40.

And in fact, what I have found in the last couple of days is that there's been a hostility to the pandering of the Harris campaign. Just tell it straight, be authentic. And that's not what they see from Harris. That is what they see from Trump. And frankly, they believe that he's going to make their lives better. And they do not have the same faith in Kamala Harris. So, we're seeing this 23 days, 22 days before the election. And for voters that really care about what's coming up, which is almost every viewer in this show, they need to understand that unless you're authentic, unless you are candid, you say what you mean, mean what you say, and you're clear that you're going to do what you say, you're not going to win these last undecided voters, and some of your own people won't turn out. This is the challenge that is facing the Harris campaign right now.",
