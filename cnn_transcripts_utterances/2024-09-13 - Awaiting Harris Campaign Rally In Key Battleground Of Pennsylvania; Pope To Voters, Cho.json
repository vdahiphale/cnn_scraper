Why his message may not have given Catholic voters any clarity. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Vice President Kamala Harris is doubling down on her battle to win Pennsylvania as she's about to make her second stop of the day in that crucial swing state. We'll go to the rally live once it begins this hour. But let's go first to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. She's at the scene of the Harris rally in Wilkes-Barre. Priscilla, what are we about to hear from Harris in Pennsylvania?",

And that has been the strategy in coming to these two counties today, two counties, by the way, that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 by double digits.But the idea here from the campaign is to try to peel off those voters, cut down his margins, to try to have a play in this part of the state, a crucial state, one that the Vice President spent the last seven of eight days visiting. So, clearly, the campaign sees it as a pivotal state, and one that she told reporters she's feeling pretty good about. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I am feeling very good about Pennsylvania because there are a lot of people in Pennsylvania who deserve to be seen and heard. That's why I'm here in Johnstown. And I will be continuing to travel around the state to make sure that I'm listening as much as we are talking. And, ultimately, I feel very strongly that you've got to earn every vote. And that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live. And so that's why I'm here.

They're also looking for these opportunities to continue to keep the energy and momentum. Another possibility that they hope for, and this one with Taylor Swift, of course, she endorse the vice president shortly after the debate. And I asked a senior spokesperson in those moments whether she had been invited to be on the campaign trail. They said that if she was willing, they'd love to have her. So, that is a question that remains to be seen, but certainly she continues to bring in this star power to try to keep the momentum in this campaign in the coming weeks. Wolf?",

Specifically on Pennsylvania, Republicans feel great about it. They think that she doesn't have the same kind of personal connections to Pennsylvania that Joe Biden did, so swapping her in actually may have disadvantaged the party in Pennsylvania in some ways because Biden had a personal connection there. He was Scranton Joe. Now, I will say this, North Carolina, I do hear a lot of concern about North Carolina. I know the Harris campaign feels good about that. So, there may be some jostling going on in the Sun Belt.

That does mean that her messaging is quite different there than it's going to be in some of your bigger urban areas because the population, quite frankly, is different. So, she's leaning in on an economic message. She's leaning in on the values that matter to them. She's making sure that she is speaking to them and I think also utilizing Governor Walz a lot in addition to some of her surrogates.",

So, they want to hear more about that. They want to hear more about how she's going to bring jobs to that state. And I think largely, though, Wolf, they are trying to position the vice president as a change candidate, somebody that can change what's happened, not just the last four years, but the last ten years. And so the vice president is going to speak to that, particularly when it comes to economic policies, trying to show folks in Pennsylvania that she can bring a new day in a way that the former president can't. But, of course, right now, we know in polling that the former president still polls higher than her when people talk about the economy or who has, who they have more trust in when it comes to the economy. BLITZER:  Economy, such a critically important issue, as we all know. Scott, the Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro won his race in Pennsylvania by nearly 15 points.

I'm just excited as more and more people get to know her, and I think that that's going to draw them to her, especially at this point, where we have such a contrast with what Donald Trump seems to be saying these days, which seems to get more and more radical and nativist and just plain crazy.",

She's in Las Vegas where Trump has an event later tonight. Alayna, there's a new post from Trump about the far-right conspiracy theory promoter he's been traveling with lately. Update our viewers. ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  That's right. We did just get a Truth Social post from him moments ago, trying to distance himself from some of the controversial things that Laura Loomer, as you pointed out, a far-right conspiracy theorist, has been saying, and the reason this has come up at all, Wolf, is because she has been increasingly traveling with Donald Trump, including this week, she went with him to the debate as well as traveled with him to New York. And that travel -- that trip with him came just moments after she had issued a racist post about Kamala Harris. Now, I want to read for you wealth exactly what Trump posted. He said, quote, Laura Loomer doesn't work for the campaign. She's a private citizen and longtime supporter. I disagree with some of the statements she made, but like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the radical left Marxists and fascists of violently attack and smear me. So there you have him saying that he does not agree with some of what she had said, but look, this actually comes after our own Kristen Holmes had questioned Donald Trump earlier today in an event in Los Angeles, asking about him traveling with her, and specifically asking for his response on how many Republicans are saying, including telling us that they're concerned about their close relationship. Take a listen to what Trump said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I just don't know. Laura is a supporter. I don't know. She is -- she is a strong person. She's got strong opinions and I don't know what she said, but that's not up to me. She is a supporter. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
