I'm Laila Harrak.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, the scale of devastation in Hawaii becoming clearer by the day on now the deadliest wildfire in more than a century and the death toll is expected to rise even further as crews continue a grim search for victims. And former U.S. President Donald Trump could be facing a fourth indictment in the week ahead over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results here in Georgia. Plus, the Matildas waltz into the Women's World Cup semifinals after toppling France in a nail-biting penalty shootout. Also, quote, the governor of Hawaii, what his state is going through is heartbreaking. And days after wildfires decimated parts of Maui, the death toll is still rising. Authorities have now confirmed 89 deaths, making the fires the deadliest in the United States in more than a century. And that number is expected to climb even more in the coming days, as crews sift through the devastation caused by the fires. Some 2,200 structures are damaged or destroyed. 86 percent of them homes, while the governor is urging Hawaiians to come together for what will be a long road to recovery. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH GREEN (D-HI):  This is the largest natural disaster we've ever experienced. It's going to also be a natural disaster that's going to take an incredible amount of time to recover from. So, in the next few days as we characterize how many people we've lost and how many people are coming into our community, please understand that we come at this like an ohana because it's going to be in the short-term, heartbreaking, in the long-term, people are going to need mental health care services. In the very long-term we'll rebuild together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, things are deteriorating for Bazoum. As you indicated, the ex- president, in fact, is being held, according to reports, in the basement of the presidential palace. He's being deprived of clean water despite the heat and medicines. Although there was one report yesterday that a doctor did get in to see the former president. No verification of that, however. And now we have this ECOWAS delegation once again trying to make contact between ECOWAS and the coup leaders. They've tried it before without success. So, I think that's exactly where things stand this morning. And for the French, it's a very difficult situation. Basically, they've had troops in the region for the last ten years. They had at many as 5,000 troops there that reduced the numbers over the years, especially in the last three years because there have been three successive military coups in Burkina Faso and Mali and now in Niger. And each of those new incoming regimes have basically told the French to leave. So, they're under mandate and have reduced the troops to 1,500 in Niger, nut now Niger looks like it may also want to kick out the French troops.",

They originally went into Mali ten years ago at the request of the Mali government to help fight the jihadists in that region of Africa, which they call the Sahel, which is a band of countries straight across Africa. And they had as many as 5,000 troops there at one point.But, in fact gradually, the French troops have been resented. They've been viewed as being part of a neo-colonialist kind of effort by the French, which, of course, the French deny. But it puts them in a very difficult position. And if this new regime in Niger comes to power for real and the ex-president is not restored, then they're probably going to have no other choice but to pull those troops out.",

Officials said the purpose of the deployment was to establish control over weapons, ammunition and explosives within the prison as part of the operation and the leader of a local drug gang was transferred to another prison.Also Saturday, the coalition of Fernando Villavicencio, the murdered candidate, chose a replacement to run in the August 20th election. It will be his running mate, Andrea Gonzalez Nader. In a CNN exclusive, she told us she knew Villavicencio and herself were at great risk but never imagined she would be in this position only a week before the election. She also told me the international community should realize that drug trafficking and organized crime are not solely Ecuador's problems, an effect that countries need to work together to find a solution.

Aussie keeper Mackenzie Arnold making a total of four saves, twice she would thwart Kenza Dali, who gets to retake her original penalty after Arnold has moved off her line. Dali goes again. It matters not, though, because it's saved again. The two countries still level after 18 kicks, would you believe, and then a really crucial pivotal moment as the French teen, Vickie Becho, striking the post, a really tough moment for the 19-year-old player. And then comes the moment of the match, the all-important to decide, the 20th spot kick and all the focus now on Courtney Vine, who somehow keeps her calm, playing in her very first World Cup, nerves of steel. And she makes no mistake from 12 yards out to seal her place in history, her country's place in history as well. A winning kick, sending the capacity crowd into joy, unconfined heartbreak for the French, history and hysteria unconfined for the Aussies, who win an amazing shootout 7-6. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
