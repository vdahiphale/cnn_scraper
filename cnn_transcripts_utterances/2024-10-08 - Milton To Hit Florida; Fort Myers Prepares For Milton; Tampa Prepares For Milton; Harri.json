Officials on the ground seem to be happy with what they've seen so far because they've seen this, long lines of traffic stretching for hours all along the interstate. The latest from the National Hurricane Center is that Milton is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday. The storm is right now a monster category four. It could become a category five once again in the coming hours. The head of FEMA telling me this morning they are ready to respond (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what we're noticing now with the latest update from the National Hurricane Center is that dreaded northeasterly turn, right, that's going to bring it on its inevitable path into the west coast of the Florida peninsula.New this morning, we do have hurricane warnings stretching from the west coast of the Florida peninsula, all the way to the east coast. And there's tropical storm warnings newly issued across extreme southern Florida, including The Keys, as well as Miami. But let's talk about the trajectory of how Milton will approach the state of Florida. Unlike Helene, if I can use an analogy, that sideswiped like a - like a small sedan along the parallel coastline of the west coast of Florida, Milton will actually be coming in and create a perpendicular approach to the state, meaning it will reach the state and maximize its potential, almost impacting us like a t- bone crash from an SUV. So, this will maximize the wind, the surge threat, and, of course, there are other hazards associated with it. The National Hurricane Center explicitly talking about how the wind field will expand and double in size from its compact size that it is now. So, we will feel the threat - the impacts of catastrophic wind damage far inland. And then there will be a moment in time late Wednesday into early Thursday morning when we anticipate landfall. We could experience hurricane conditions from the gulf coast, all the way to the Atlantic coast. So, if you've perhaps evacuated to Daytona Beach, this isn't necessarily the right spot to go. You either need to go north or far south. Ten to 15 foot storm surge means catastrophic damage right along the coast. We all know it. Kate.",

A lot of the folks here bringing their own bags, getting the sand here, right on this beach, on Davis Island, and then taking it back to their cars packed right here. It's been very busy, Kate, all morning long. And a lot of people who I've spoken with who have been here at this specific area where we are of Davis Island say that a lot of residents have already evacuated because after Helene there was a lot of damage, a lot of devastation left behind. Still, a lot of debris here in these neighborhoods as well. And that's also a big concern that officials are worried about all that debris getting picked up by wind gusts. They could become dangerous projectiles. If not, they could flood and clog sewer lines or just impede specific areas here. People bringing in these sandbags to their trucks as well. And, Kate, after these people put in these sandbags, from what I've been gathering, people I've spoken with, a lot of them are going to also be evacuating here. One gentleman I spoke with said he's going to be putting these bags in front of his sister's home, and then they're going to be evacuating as well. Highways in the Tampa area have been jam packed all morning long. We're going to continue to see that throughout the rest of the day.

Again, they're - I - their hope here is to not - is to perhaps try to reach those who are not die-hard Democrats, but they're the disaffected Republicans. And they think that if they can bring those in, in some of these counties, which are probably going to be decided by only a few hundred or thousand votes, that that can certainly help boost them in November.So, this is certainly welcome news for the Harris campaign.
