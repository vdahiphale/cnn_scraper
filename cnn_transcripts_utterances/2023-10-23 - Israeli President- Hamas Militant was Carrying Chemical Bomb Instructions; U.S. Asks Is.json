Erin Burnett live with us on the ground in Tel Aviv, Israel.And overnight, the Israeli military launching raids on the ground and ramping up those airstrikes on Gaza. The IDF says troops are preparing for the, quote, \"next phase\" of the war against Hamas. Take a look at this. This is video of the aftermath this morning. Sources tell CNN the U.S. is urging Israel to delay a ground assault in the hopes of getting more hostages out and humanitarian aid in for the millions of Palestinians who are running out of food and water. But a senior Israeli official tells CNN there will be no ceasefire. The IDF now says 222 people were kidnapped during the Hamas attack and massacre just about two weeks ago.",

Right?You'll see a big increase for a few hours and then a bit calmer. So that's the best way to describe it right now. Our Nic Robertson has been there for the past two weeks, and we're on day 17. These increased strikes overnight, the IDF just a few moments ago, putting out the latest numbers saying that they had 320 strikes, Poppy and Phil, on Gaza overnight. Three hundred and twenty targets. And they specifically say that they hit done [SIC] -- tunnels, I'm sorry, and what they say are dozens of operational command centers. And just to sort of do the math here, that's 320 overnight. Sunday, they had said that they had done more than 200 the day before. So when you look at, say, 500 over a two-day period, you look at the 17 days since this has begun, there has been an incredible, incredible number of strikes already on Gaza. They say they have taken out the chief, for example, of the rockets command of Hamas, who was in charge of rockets that have been firing into Israel. So they have taken out a bit of the Hamas command. But as we say, these sort of strikes have been picking up. We'll see, though, during the daylight hours what happens.",

And I've seen some of the documents that were on Hamas operatives, in Arabic, that showed the attack plans for some of the kibbutzes on that border. Incredibly detailed battle plans dated on them about a -- for a full year. Showing the operational level of planning.This specific chemical weapons claim that the Israel -- the IDF is saying, they're saying they found a USB on one of the terrorists that had on it chemical weapons plans or how to -- instructions on how to make accrued chemical weapon, with a drawing that -- that referred to distributing cyanide. They say that this specific plan was from an al Qaeda manual from 2003. So it's -- in a sense, shows the crudeness of this, right? They didn't have anything new, but when it comes to something like mass cyanide distribution, that isn't something that you necessarily, you know, need technological innovation on. So they would say the significance of this is -- is obviously notable, but they don't -- they don't have any evidence that there was anything with this individual that would enable them to do this. It's just the presence of the plan existed on the USB. And that's the latest we have from the IDF. As you point out, Poppy, we haven't confirmed it ourselves.",

They have been talking to Hamas about potentially releasing even more hostages. So that is what the U.S. wants to see. They want to see if, before Israel launches a ground incursion, they can secure the release of even more hostages, because of course, there are several Americans who are believed to be being held by Hamas inside Gaza. And the other aspect of this, of course, is the humanitarian aid. The Biden administration wants to see whether more humanitarian aid can flow into Southern Gaza before Israel launches that ground incursion and just give that an opportunity to work. Now, of course, it remains unclear how Israel is responding to this behind closed doors, but the fact that they have not yet launched that much-anticipated ground incursion does suggest that they are perhaps heeding the U.S. calls here. And Israeli officials have said publicly that the U.S. has been pressuring them very intensively to allow that humanitarian aid, food, medical supplies to get into Gaza. And so it does seem at this point like that delay is working. But still, the Israelis are obviously very keen on launching this invasion, something that Israeli officials have said publicly they plan to do -- Erin.",

It follows two IDF strikes in Lebanese territory on Sunday.At the same time, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expressing concern about a wider escalation toward American troops in the area. Let's bring in CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, thanks for joining us. To start with the -- the concerns about escalation, we have seen U.S. assets move into the region. We saw the comments from Secretary Austin. How real is this concern right now? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's pretty real. Good morning to you. And when you look at the whole region right here, you've got so many different areas that you can actually look at from the standpoint of what could potentially harbor possible threats against -- against U.S. forces. And that includes, of course, Hamas and Gaza plus forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, even; and of course, down South in Yemen. So all of these areas could potentially harbor places that could affect U.S. troops in the region. And in fact, they've done that, because they've gone after targets, U.S. bases, that have been targeted in places like Iraq and Syria and that of course has been a significant aspect to this deployment of U.S. Forces as well as the overall balance of forces in the Middle Eastern region.",

So sort of doubling down with the specificity on Iran. And my question about that is the fact that the U.S. has deployed this additional missile defense system to the region. We know that there is the interception of those shot by Houthi rebels in Yemen, Iran-backed, as well, last week. What does this deployment tell you?",

This is the terminal high altitude area defense system. So if you think of this as complementary to the Patriot system and to other air defense systems that are out there, this is the kind of battery that would actually be used in a situation like this. And it fires from a tube-like system here, multiple launching possibilities here, multiple missiles. And they, of course, are designed to come into an area and take out targets that, you know, would be out there. So this is what the U.S.S. Carney did when it came to the missiles that were fired from Yemen. And they were able to, of course, knock those out of the sky, as well as the drones. So it's basically a force protection measure for the U.S. forces. But it also serves to send a message to any of the forces that are thinking about doing things against the U.S. that we will respond.",

We have brought in, for example, the U.S.S. Eisenhower and moved that over here.So we've got two carrier battle groups, one over here, one possibly in the Persian Gulf, depending on which part of the Arabian Sea area and the Persian Gulf that they've come into. So what we're doing with the prepare to deploy order, it means get ready. Get your stuff ready, so -- Because when you are given the order to actually deploy, you will have 24 hours to get into theater. And that is what that means for the U.S. forces that have been given that direction. And it also puts everybody else on notice that we're potentially coming in with more forces into places all around the region that would help us protect Israel, as well as protect our own national interests.",
