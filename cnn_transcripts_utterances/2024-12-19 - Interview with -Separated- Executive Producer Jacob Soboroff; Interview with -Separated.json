Forcibly removing children from their families was purportedly intended to act as a deterrent. But it shocked the country and divided even Trump's own cabinet. The policy was eventually ended. But even today, our next guests report there are more than a thousand children still separated, effectively orphaned.

These newinterventions or predicted interventions by the new administration come January. What is the status right now of the border, the plans, people, crossings? What are you finding in your reporting right now? JACOB SOBOROFF, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, \"SEPARATED\":  What I learned, Christiane, in covering the family separation policy of the last Trump administration is that when the incoming Trump administration says they're going to do something believe them. And in 2016, they said they were going to deliberately separate thousands of children from their parents at the border, and they did just that, what a Republican appointed judge called one of the most shameful chapters in the history of our country. And I reported on the floor of the Republican National Convention during this period and I was standing in front of the White House presidential election and I stood, you know, feet away as thousands of people held up those signs saying mass deportation now. It's a part of the policy platform not just of the Republican National Committee, but of the Trump campaign and now the incoming Trump administration. And what is a mass deportation policy? It's family separation by another name. It's not taking children away from their parents at the border, but it is taking parents away from their children in the interior of the country, in their schools and their workplaces, potentially. And certainly, in their homes. And I think, you know, how many people are we talking? This would be a supersized policy compared to family separation. There are something like 20 million people in the United States of America who live with an undocumented family member in their household. So, it would be orders of magnitude greater than what the world was outraged by in the summer of 2018, what Errol Morris so beautifully documents in our film. And I think that the American people may not be prepared for what's to come.",

And you mentioned the narrative portion, if I may, of the film that Errol has created here. I just want to stress why that is so important and why this makes this a story told in the way only Errol Morris can. When I was invited inside those facilities by the Trump administration in the summer of 2018 as a television journalist, I was invited without cameras, pad and paper only. And so, that footage simply does not exist. There is no footage. The government did not allow us to take any of them deliberately ripping children apart from parents because they wanted us, as reporters, to go outside and describe it to the world in order to scare other people from coming to the United States of America and in order to scare Congress into enacting more restrictive immigration laws. What Errol Morris has done with Eugenio Caballero, our production designer, and Gabriela Cartol, the actress who plays the mother in the film, and Diego, and the entire Mexican cast and crew, is get to an emotional truth of what these families have gone through in a way that I hope one day all the families will be able to speak out and talk about. But the U.S. government only allowed propaganda images and handout photos to come out of those facilities. And so, Errol Morris has taken that agency back from the U.S. government, the Trump administration, and show everybody who sees this film what these families actually went through at the hands of United States immigration policy.",

The IDF has had a policy of repeating this kind of standard answers to questions about the conduct of the soldiers that are, to my mind, increasingly not to be believed. Just as they often say that they will investigate this or that incident, and we never hear more about that investigation. They have lawyers that accompany them where they go, but it seems that these lawyers are not there to stop illegal acts, but rather to cover them up. So, by now, with the numbers of those lost, of those killed so high, coming close to 50,000 with at least another 10,000 presumed killed under the rubble, with over a hundred thousand wounded, with tens of thousands of people who seem to have died because they can get no hospital care at all, people with chronic illness and so forth, the numbers are vast, and one cannot really any longer take the response of the IDF at face value.",

And he said to me, yes, this is what is going on, and I know about it because officers on the ground have contacted me and asked me to speak about it, to say what's going on there. And the extraordinary thing is that, you know, Ya'alon was Netanyahu's minister of defense. So, he became very right-wing, much more than when I knew him. And despite that, when he came out with his statement, he was not only attacked by the right-wing, who were saying he's crazy, he's gone out of his mind, but also by the opposition, who said, no, this cannot be. So, there is this very strong sense in Israel, among many people, across the board, that, yes, maybe some things are not going well, maybe there's some indiscipline in the army, but by and large, our boys, and these -- the people who are fighting there are the children and grandchildren of most people in Israel, cannot be involved in this systematic campaign of war crimes and genocide.

In 2000, if top people in thenational security sphere told us that another country had weapons of mass destruction, the idea that they might not be leveling with us, that they might be taking us to war on false pretenses was inconceivable. I mean, I did conceive of it, but I got an amazing amount of pushback from people saying no. Are you really saying that a president of the United States would take us to war for bad reasons? And of course, so it turned out. People thought that people running the financial, running the financial regulators, economic policymakers, and the bankers themselves knew what they were doing and could be trusted. And then, came this, you know, horrific financial crisis, and it turned out that nobody knew what they were doing, and a fair number of people were basically, running scams, you know, and down the line. I talk a lot -- I talked in the column. It's one of those -- you know, I am to have an international focus and I spend a lot of time in Europe, know a lot of Europeans and the creation of the Europe was supposed to be a wonderful event, it supposed to bring Europe together. And in the end, you know, there was a euro crisis, which the currency itself survived, barely, but the optimism, the faith in Europe's future did not. And again, this was all of the great and the good. We're telling Europeans we have a -- this is a fantastic idea. Trust us. And so, you know, there's accumulation. And I think it's also -- it's something I probably should have said in that column is the fact that nobody seemed ever to have paid a price. You know, that in the '30s, you know, bankers got hauled off to jail. In the aftermath of Iraq, there were plenty of arguments that said that people should at the very least be paying some kind of personal price for having misled us into war. And nobody ever did.

And as a result, it took years to recover. And Biden said they understood, which Obama didn't, that they really had one shot at taking strong measures. And so, they did, they spent a lot of money, which temporarily boosted inflation, although in the end, cumulative inflation in the U.S. is similar to that -- of the whole rest of the world. But they really did put money behind, you know, Building Back Better was the slogan, but building back on spending. And I think that is the secret, that there were other things that went right, but the fact of the matter is that the United States -- the administration and the razor thin Democratic majority in Congress said, OK, we have a crisis.
