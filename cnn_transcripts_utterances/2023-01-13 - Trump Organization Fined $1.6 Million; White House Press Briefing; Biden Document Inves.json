I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York.Well, less than 24 hours after a special counsel was named to investigate the potential mishandling of classified documents, President Biden is avoiding questions and the special counsel is making moves. The Justice Department has interviewed Biden's former executive assistant who was on the team that packed up his office at the end of the Obama administration. We're also told that process was messy. Then-Vice President Biden was completing high-profile work right up until President Trump's inauguration. And that led to a mad dash to close up the office while Biden was still using it. CNN's Phil Mattingly and Evan Perez are covering all angles in Washington for us. And, Evan, we know Biden's former executive assistant had been questioned. We're also learning more about the materials that were found with the classified documents. Tell us exactly what the special counsel, Rob Hur, will be looking at here.",

But a lot of work has already gone on, already happened during the investigation that was being handled by John Lausch, the Chicago U.S. attorney who did the initial preliminary work on this. And, as Phil Mattingly reported, the president's former executive assistant Kathy Chung was already interviewed. A number of other interviews already took place. And then Rob Hur is coming in and he's going to probably want to talk to a number of other people. They want to -- one of the things they're going to want to make sure is that there are no other documents out there. And that's something that he's going to have to work with the president's team. Rob Hur is a career prosecutor here in Washington. He did serve as a political appointee in the Biden administration. And the documents that we're talking about, we know a little bit about the initial batch, the 10 documents that were turned over first in November. They included a briefing memo from the vice president then, Joe Biden, to President Obama. There was also some briefing memos that were prepared for Biden before he made phone calls with foreign leaders, including the U.K. prime minister and an official from the European Union. So those are the types of documents that we're talking about. The question is, what else is there, Bianna, and the level of classification on some of those? Are sources and methods at risk in the way those documents were being stored, Bianna?",

We also have an update on the other classified documents probe headed by the other special counsel, this one centered on former President Trump. We have learned those investigators want to interview the Trump staffers who searched his properties in November for additional classified materials. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is tracking all of this for us. So, Kaitlan, I know you're reporting the prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith's team have gone back and forth for the past couple of months with Trump's defense lawyers about whether Trump has fully complied with a subpoena issued last May for classified documents.

But this investigation into the handling of presidential records and national security information after Donald Trump less left the presidency, that criminal investigation has been going on for a year. Part of that investigation is an obstruction of justice investigation, whether Trump and his team could have obstructed justice or wanted to obstruct justice after there were classified documents discovered being kept at Mar-a-Lago in Florida a year ago. They -- we also know that the Justice Department still, to this day, they're investigating that criminal probe. They're also trying to secure the national security secrets, make sure there's nothing else out there. And to finish or at least to continue that investigation, Kaitlan Collins and I confirmed that they want to interview the two people the Trump team hired in November to do searches who found two classified documents just this past November. It's very likely those people will talk to the Justice Department, but we know the Trump team is trying to negotiate and narrow that a little bit, if they can -- Bianna.",

So, here we have two special counsel's investigating how classified documents were handled by two different presidents. I know the circumstances are different. And, as we just heard from Katelyn, Trump has not been complying with that investigation, Jack Smith's team not confident that all the documents have been turned over.

And, frankly, they ought not even be communicating with each other or sharing each other's work because of how different the two investigations are.

So, perhaps the argument is that it was an inadvertent mistake by other people and not the president himself. Now, you don't need to interview the president to confirm that, but, certainly, I think it's in their interests, if law enforcement wishes to speak to him, to comply with that request.",

How could something like this have happened?And well, now, he's facing a very similar problem, where documents that should have been turned over to the government at the end of his time in the White House were not. And that's a that's a real problem. It's a political problem. It's a public relations problem. And those problems matter too. I think people's perception of how egregious Trump's behavior was will be colored by the fact that it has happened in another instance with this very president who's in the White House right now when he was vice president. And I think it's going to make it difficult. Not only that, but if you look at what's happening on Capitol Hill, this is getting folded into all of these investigations that Republicans were planning on doing anyway. They're bringing in the president's son Hunter Biden into this. They're bringing in China into this. And we don't know if any of those things have any merit.

Now that we have two investigations going, what happens in the scenario that Jack Smith, who's investigating former President Trump, comes to Garland and says, I recommend that the president be indicted on obstruction or whatever charge?

And to the point that Abby was making a moment ago, lord knows how that's going to go, when he has to testify before Congress about recommendations that he's made.

And, again, we -- this has been done in a transparent way when it relates to how this was dealt with, with the Department of Justice and the Archives. The president takes this very, very seriously. Any other questions that you may have about this particular issue, about the review, I would refer you to Department of Justice. You guys have been in touch with my colleagues at the White House Counsel's Office, and I would suggest that you continue to reach out. Go ahead, Stephen (ph).",

You describe a process, but it sort of feels like a strategy, a communications strategy to protect the president from political damage. Was it the hope and expectation here that this would have remained a private matter and not have been subject to public disclosure? JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, Stephen, that's your version of the case. I have been very clear here. And I have answered that question multiple times in different versions, right, in the last couple of days. Look, want to be very clear. There's a process here. We are going to respect the process. This is all part of the Department of Justice process, and we are cooperating fully. We are cooperating fully in this process. And, again, the president believes that the Justice Department and its independence needs -- needed to be restored. That's what you have seen under this administration the last two years. And I want to be consistent in what I'm saying. I want to be prudent in what I'm saying when I say that we are going to defer any questions related to this to the Department of Justice. And any other items that you have, if you want to talk to the Department of Justice, you're free to talk to the White House Counsel Office.

What I can say more broadly... (CROSSTALK) JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, what I'm saying is that, more broadly speaking, not going to get into the specifics of that, what I can say is that we believe, when it comes to the debt limit, it has been done in a bipartisan way over the years and decades. And it should be done in a bipartisan way. And it should be done without conditions. That is important here. And so we're going to continue to encourage and ask Congress to take action. And that's where we're going to leave it at this time. We're not going to do any negotiations or -- and it should begin -- again done without conditions.",
