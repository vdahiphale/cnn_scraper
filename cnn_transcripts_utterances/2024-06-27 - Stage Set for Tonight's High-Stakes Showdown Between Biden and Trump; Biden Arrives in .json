The Biden team suspects that Trump has done more preparation than ever heading into a debate, despite what they have been saying from his camp. They've also taken note of how over the last few days, Trump allies have shifted their tune on how they think Biden will perform.All right, we have CNN's Harry Enten with us yet again. OK, so, you know, who do voters think is going to do well?",

Who will do well in tonight's debate?Well, the majority of voters think Donald Trump's going to do well. Look at that, 59 percent. Less than a majority, however, for the current president, 48 percent. But of course, it's all about those undecided voters, right? Those people who might change their mind because of tonight's debate. Well, on this score, they both do worse. But again, you see more undecided voters think that Donald Trump's going to do better than Joe Biden is. And so you can look at that and you say, Joe Biden, well, you know, the fact is voters may not think that much of me. But the floor, it's so low. It's so low. So he can't help but potentially exceed expectations.",

And you can go all the way back, all the incumbents in this 21st century.George W. Bush was a favorite in 2004 over John Kerry. [15:35:OO] Barack Obama, a very heavy favorite over Mitt Romney going in that first debate in 2012. Last time around, Donald Trump was only the tiniest favorite at one point, but still a slight favorite. This time around, however, look at this. Donald Trump, the challenger, is the favorite. This is extremely unusual. Normally, folks think the incumbent is going to do pretty well, right? Because they're the president. They're somebody that they're used to. They can see them being in the Oval Office. But the fact of the matter is this particular cycle goes against that grain. And so maybe Joe Biden coming in this debate, you know, perhaps trailing a little bit, but no clear leader nationally, not doing as well in the swing states as he was four years ago. The expectations game is on his side, because the fact is the expectations for him are so low, maybe he can't help but exceed them.",

The question is exactly by how much.Pollster and communications strategist Frank Luntz is here to discuss just how much presidential debates can move the needle at the ballot box. Frank, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. You've said that this will be the biggest moment of the campaign cycle thus far. But you know that news cycles quickly, right? They're still five months out before Election Day. So what kind of effect could that kind of timing have here? FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER AND COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST: Well, it's true that this is early. We've never had a debate this early ever in modern American politics. However, the idea of Donald Trump and Joe Biden at the same time, on the same stage, addressing the same issues, that is what changes. That is what makes this so significant. Voters will see them side by side, not campaign ads, not speeches, the actual policies themselves. They'll be able to see whether Joe Biden is ready for another four years. They'll be able to see whether Donald Trump can actually keep his temper under control. The fact that it's happening now, I can't imagine a more important moment but I do want to clarify one thing. There's only 4 percent of Americans that are truly undecided. And there are really only three states that matter. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. So the truth is about one third of 1 percent of America is what matters. But it's so likely that they're going to be watching tonight to see the comparison, that that's what makes this evening so significant.",

You have also alluded to the idea that these candidates have to have a winning one- liner. So if you were writing for either President Biden, former President Trump, and you were trying to encapsulate their message and break through the spin and get reposted on social media or perhaps even become a meme, what would your one-liner for each of them be?",

      "sentences": "Let me do this because this is what's essential. And this works for both candidates at the same time. The very first thing is they need to be able to ask a rhetorical question that has no answer for the other side.For Donald Trump, are you better off today than you were four years ago? Most Americans would say no. Do you have more money in your pocket today than you did four years ago? Most Americans will say no. For Joe Biden, do you feel safer, more secure? Are you tired of the chaos of the previous administration? Would you like some calm, some predictability in your life? It's the unanswerable rhetorical question. Second, they have to have three unassailable successes. For Biden, it's getting through COVID. For Donald Trump, it's securing the border. So the issues are different, but the strategy is the same. Third, what are your key priorities for the future? Because in the end, it's not the last four years that Americans will be voting on. It's the next four. Give me three examples. One is random. Two is a trend. Three is proof. And finally, one audacious mission. Something that comes from out of the blue that gets people to think, wow, this individual is different, is special, is someone worthy of attention. Now, I don't believe either candidate is going to do either of those instructions. But that is exactly what the candidate should be doing. And exactly what I'd be advising them, knowing that I've tested 30 out of the 32 presidential debates in my lifetime.",

Bush, the expectations were very low. He put forward a very strong performance, exceeded expectations. I don't see how Joe Biden doesn't exceed expectations because Donald Trump has done a brilliant job of telling people that the guy can barely complete a sentence. So if Biden simply stands up there, talks with these four items here, and does so efficiently and effectively, he's going to exceed expectations. I think this is an inherently bad strategy in the Trump campaign, and I think that Biden is going to benefit from it. But remember, the most important thing is not exceeding expectations. Are you likable? Are you presentable? Are you credible? People are going to be looking at what kind of person you are. The truth is, we don't vote on policy. I know that people's heads explode, but it's true. We're not voting on the details of policy. We're voting on character, attributes, who you are as a human being, and that's going to be critical. Does Donald Trump lose his cool? Does Joe Biden blow a stack? That's what the audience will be looking for. And in the end, it's the person that's going to make my day-to-day life better. That is the final decision in all of this. Who's going to improve my day-to-day quality of life? That's the person who gets the vote.",
