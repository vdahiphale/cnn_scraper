Number one, in terms of the conflict of interest itself and actual conflict, the judge finding there was not. There was not this sufficient connection between a monetary motivation to move the case forward.Why? Because the facts behind that right, what happened? The reality is, is if there was this dependence upon money and connections of money, the prosecutor may have prolong the case. Instead, they asked for the case to move forward. Quite expeditiously, there was a motion to sever the defendants meaning, Amara, there'd be plenty of trials. They oppose that. Certainly, if there was a financial interest and you were making money, you wouldn't oppose it, you'd want to make more. And so I think as the actual conflict, the judge said there wasn't. And that was actually right, based on the facts and the law that applies to that, in terms of a perception of an conflict of interest, the perception, the judge said there could be. And as a result, he found that there was. However, the remedy, meaning the cure of that was not to dismiss the indictment. The cure of that was to do what he did, which is to remove the special prosecutor. And as to the comments at the church, the judge feeling that there was nothing with respect to the merits, that Fani Willis says. I'm referring to the remarks that we saw in the clip where she went to the church Fani Willis did, and wax poetic about her being attacked because of the case, the judge saying they were illegally improper, but didn't address the merits and didn't really relate to fundamental unfairness to the defendants in the case. So just with respect to the entirety of the ruling, Amara, I just found it to be appropriate to the law. And I think it was the right call for the judge.

What do you know about the case? Do you have any special inclinations? Are you supportive Mr. Trump? Are you supporter Fani Willis?Does any that impair your judgment with respect to listening to the facts?And so before you impanel, a jury to sit on a case, Amara, you ask questions, you qualify them for that case. If they're not qualified, they should be dismissed. If they're bias, they should be dismissed. If they have any other inclinations, they should be dismissed.

Live for us there at the White House.Joining me now to discuss is former U.S. State Department Middle East Negotiator Aaron David Miller. Aaron, good morning to you. First off, I just want to get your reaction to Chuck Schumer's remarks. I mean, this is a -- the top Democrat in Congress, a Senate majority leader. He's the highest-ranking Jewish-American in U.S. government. And of course, also hearing President Biden saying he basically supports those comments. What's your take? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: I guess my -- thanks for having me, Amara. My take, I guess, is that in decades of following this issue under both Republican and Democratic administrations, no Senate majority leader, no pro-Israeli politician has ever, ever given a speech which is as bold and clear, calling literally, for the removal of the current Israeli prime minister in an electoral process. I think what it reflects are two things. Number one, there's a huge growing divide between the democratic establishment, longtime supporters of the state of Israel and the current Israeli government. No surprise there. And second, given the Republican reaction, it really does reflect the reality that Israel, like so many other issues in our argued culture today has now become a polarizing rather than a unifying issue. The Israelis, by the way, including putative successor to Benjamin Netanyahu, Benny Gantz, member of the war cabinet, reacted very badly, I think, to the -- Schumer's speech. Indicating that Israel is not a banana republic and, essentially, the Americans need to allow the Israelis to make their own choices.",

Where it's not waning is the reality that -- inconvenient reality, I think, for some, that the vast majority of the Israeli public supports the ongoing war effort. And I think the problem for Senator Schumer is he criticized the Israeli positions on two issues, oppositional Palestinian state and support, I think, for a ground campaign in Rafah. And yet, those are two issues on which there is broad consensus among the Israeli public, at least for now.So, I'm not sure what impact this speech is going to have, either on toughening up U.S. policy, or allowing the Biden administration to tread the very narrow line between a Republican Party that has emerged as the Israel can do no wrong party and a deeply divided Democratic Party.",
