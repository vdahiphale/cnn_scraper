With all the excitement around the upcoming total Solar eclipse, people are trying to cash in by polluting the marketplace with fake eclipse glasses. Of course, looking directly at a solar eclipse without proper protection can lead to severe eye damage, even blindness. And if your glasses are fake you're going to know really fast. Regular sunglasses don't cut it. The American Astronomical Society has a list of approved eclipse glasses. You can also find it on CNN.com. And join CNN for special live coverage of the eclipse across America Monday, April 8th at 1:00 p.m. Eastern or stream it on Max. All right, everybody, welcome for another hour. You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Omar Jimenez in New York. We're going to begin this hour in Jerusalem, where Israel's prime minister is underscoring a key message today that the IDF is going into Rafah no matter what the U.S. thinks. Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier today that no amount of American pressure will stop Israel from going through with an operation, and that there's no other way for Israel to defeat Hamas. Those remarks come in the midst of widespread anti-government protests in Jerusalem as demonstrators call for the release of hostages. At least 16 people were arrested on Saturday.

And this has been a protest very much about the way the government has handled the war. Urgent calls for elections to be held in Benjamin Netanyahu to go. Anger expressed in fact that more than 130 hostages, nearly six monthson should still be in the hands of Hamas, but also anger about what has been done to the Palestinian people. We've heard a lot of that tonight, and also the displacement of Israelis in the north of the country. And what the protesters have done is they've set up tents down there by the Knesset. They intend to stay here for the next four days to keep up the pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, we heard from the Israeli prime minister just ahead of this protest. He's getting surgery tonight. A hernia operation underway for which he'll undergo general anesthetic. But he told the people before going into that that he believed his policies were responsible for half the hostages having been brought home. And he doubled down on the idea that a ground operation in Rafah will be necessary in order to flush out Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Not Ramadan, and here is a fact. We operate during Ramadan in Shifa, Khan Younis and other places, nor the American pressure. And I'm already telling you that, and there is no hesitation as a reason for delay. It requires certain preparations. I won't go into them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And now you see how this sort of desperation that was -- that took place over the last few months turning to anger and exploded yesterday and today. It is still a question, where is it going to go.

The Israeli War Cabinet had a relatively short meeting, like an hour and a half earlier today, and it is still the bottom line is that it is still unclear whether it will be possible to break the logjam. The main issue that is the main sticking point in those talks is the Hamas demand that Israel will basically withdraw from this area in the middle of the Gaza Strip that divides the enclave into two parts and prevents people from going from the south back the north.Israel is willing to allow some gradual return from the south to the north, but it does not agree, at least at the moment, withdraw from this corridor. And the main thing the Israeli cabinet needs to decide is whether it agrees to this demand by Hamas because it seems that at the moment if Israel does not agree and Hamas takes to its position, which is the case right now, there's not going to be a deal.",

To go back from a six-week ceasefire to a full-scale operation in Rafah, that's a very, very, very complicated thing.And everybody knows it. Nobody wants to say it. Everybody knows it.

Trump tonight is also appearing to test the limits of his gag order in the New York hush money case, where he's going to face trial in two weeks.

Glad to have both of you. Scott, I want to start with you. Obviously, we just went through a list of what appears to be on brand Trump messaging in some respects. But what is your reaction?

And that seemed to at least rile up a good portion of the current Republican base. JOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL ANALYSTriled them up. I think you do exactly what he did today, calling for unity, talking about bringing people together because this election will be decided on turnout and turnout particularly in the suburbs with independent voters and what were formerly Republicans are now this little small caucus of the former Republican Party, the non- Trumpers. If you look at an ad he did this week, which is now explicitly going after voters who voted for Nikki Haley in the primary. So that's what they need to do. And I think the other thing that it hurts Trump is there is a lack of enthusiasm about President Biden among the Democratic core voter, but this fires them up. This fired them up into 2020, and will fire up again. So, you know, its on-brand, but it's a bad strategy.",

So any hacker who is both skilled enough and lucky enough to get inside a telecom company is going to find a digital treasure chest. The information that's available there will be large in numbers. These telecom companies handle tens of millions of people when T-Mobile was hacked to last year.They had a data breach affecting tens of millions of their customers. And the information is, of course, quite significant as we've said, it's all the kind of information used to verify your identity now. Now many of these companies to be sure don't necessarily, necessarily have lax security practices. AT&amp;T in this particular case, I think this is important to say, hasn't said whether the data which they admit is AT&amp;T customer data came from AT&amp;T itself or whether it came from one of their vendors?

Ultimately, we're going to have to move past passwords. We're going to have to move toward greater use of two- factor authentication. Possibly some biometric identifications, and get to a system that's much, much more secure both for the individual user and the companies themselves. But that's expensive and that's a long way off.",

And this afternoon's big win for Purdue and the showdown happening right now between Duke and NC State and the women's tournament has some big face-offs tomorrow with four of its biggest names clashing in the Elite Eight.Rachel Nichols is host of \"Headliners\" on Showtime and joins us now. Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Page Beckers, Juju Watkins, some would call that cinema. Is tomorrow one of the biggest nights for women's college hoops that we've ever had? RACHEL NICHOLS, HOST, \"HEADLINERS WITH RACHEL NICHOLS\": Yes, 100 percent. This is poised to capture the attention of the country and we have been able to say that time after time in women's basketball. There's a combination of a few different things. Women's sports in general have just really reached terminal velocity over the past couple of years. You've had them breaking free out of more of a niche audience to just general sports fans, understanding how good these games can be, how talented these athletes are. You also have the fact that in college women's basketball, you've had this NIL licensing money coming into players, which means for some players, not all, but for some players, it's been more economically beneficial. They make more money staying in school than they do go into the WNBA. And that means that stars are around longer, rivalries can form. Teams can recruit better players to come in after them because, oh, you will get to play with Caitlin Clark. She's still going to be here at Iowa. So we've gotten these really complete full teams and then I said the rivalries, man, last year, Caitlin Clark's Iowa team versus Angel Reese's LSU team, that was theater in the final of the women's tournament last year. The fact that they're meeting this early in the draw has gotten people just all a flutter. And I hope for this game is that it is as competitive as we expect, and that people who are watching allow it to be as competitive as we expect. I think Angel Reese got so much unfair criticism last year for just celebrating the fact that her team won in the way we've seen so many male athletes do, showing the ring finger and making the John Cena pose and all of that stuff. And, you know, there's this idea that women athletes still have to be more polite, that they have to be more sportsman like, that they can't be as competitive. Get that dirt under their fingernails the way that men can. And it's such a shame and I hope that we see something different this year. I think we're going to. I think we're going to allow this to be as competitive a game as it should be. And it's going to be amazing for women's hoops.",

It's just unbelievable that at this level that's allowed to happen. And Texas, which lost the game, the coach said afterward, he said, I'm sorry to have to say this, but a lot of my colleagues would tell you only in women's hoops, only in women's basketball. You know, the NCAA still has a long way to go and the way that theytreat these women, especially as this tournament has become so popular. There is no excuse for the fact that the women playing it don't get the same benefits. It was only a few years ago that the women's tournament was able to even use the term March Madness. I want you to let that sink in. The NCAA's is own women's basketball tournament wouldn't allow the women to use the term March Madness because that was for the men. Apparently making sure that the court gets their proper dimensions is still for the men, too? And we hope that that changes.
