We begin in the Middle East, once again, on a knife's edge as the U.S. and allies urge de-escalation and restraint between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel today launched airstrikes into southern Lebanon that Israeli forces say hit terrorist infrastructure sites after the IDF says its top military commander has, quote, completed approval plans for the northern arena. Hezbollah in Lebanon says it launched at least 17 attacks into northern Israel. The group said it struck Israeli military targets with drones and rockets and they are also now making threats. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, asserted today that Israel, quote, quote, crossed all red lines in a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions that killed dozens and injured thousands. Nasrallah hinted that Hezbollah would retaliate, saying the fight would not stop until the war ends in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN NASRALLAH, HEZBOLLAH LEADER (through translator):  We say to Netanyahu and Gallant, I say, clearly, no matter the sacrifices, consequences, or future possibilities, the resistance in Lebanon will not stop supporting Gaza.

      "sentences": "Well, I think that they are certainly preparing for all scenarios. We have heard this language of preparing for offense and defense. We have heard the language of reading the plans for the northern arena this is not the first time that we have heard comments like this from Herzi Halevi, that chief of staff of the Israeli military. What is new is this rhetoric of a new phase of the war, for example, which we heard from the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant a couple of times over the last couple of days as he talked about the center of gravity of this war in Gaza, moving north, away from the Gaza Strip towards the northern front.And in addition to that, we've seen the movement of some troops, the 98th division moving north. We're now learning of training exercises slated for this weekend in the northern part of Israel, warning civilians to stay away from those areas. So that is interesting as well. But I think we also have to inject some caution here because it is clear that the preparations are being made for war. It is clear that we are at a state of heightened tensions and Hezbollah is vowing retaliation, but it is also possible that as we have seen in the past, that these two sides could ultimately step back from the brink of war. And that's because we know that as tensions have escalated several times over the course of the last year, most notably in late July, we have ultimately seen those two sides choose to step back. And if you listen to Hassan Nasrallah today, he was talking about retaliation, talking about the unprecedented nature of this Israeli attack, but he was also downplaying how successful that attack was talking about the fact that Israel tried in his view, to kill thousands but only killed several dozen people. And so that was notable as well. The question though is, once that retaliation happens anytime you see retaliation, anytime you see kinetic action on the ground, there is always the possibility of miscalculating those actions. And so certainly that is very much in the air and also the Israeli -- Israeli governments leadership, they have been holding security consultations tonight. There is also the possibility that Israel could make additional moves before that retaliation comes from Hezbollah. So it's just very uncertain. I think we need to keep people lot of different possibilities open in our minds at this moment.",

So let's speak more about this attack, the tactics, the strategy with CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. Sir, always good to have you on. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Jim, good to see you. [15:05:01] SCIUTTO:  So, first, I want to talk about your view of where this conflict in the north is going. As you heard there, Israel military, the Israeli military commanders said they've now completed approval for plans for the northern arena. We're hearing about this new era description of the state of the war. Do you see Israel having laid the groundwork now, including massing the forces necessary for a significant ground action in southern Lebanon, or do you see an expanded version of what we've seen so far, which is not just the pager and walkie-talkie attacks but significant airstrikes but then you were in northern Israel for a long time, the last time you were in the nation, you know, what the situation is like there tens of thousands of Israelis have been moved out of that area. There's an average of about 30 to 50 rockets and missiles coming across from southern Lebanon into Israel when the first mobilization was announced back in October after the horrible situation, October 7, you know that the mobilization of forces was more than what they needed for Gaza. So the Israeli forces had been preparing for a multi- front war for a very long time. One of the ominous things that happened today was I heard and got feedback, I follow the Israeli Defense Forces, the chief of the general staff of the northern command, General Halevi said, quote, every time we work on a certain stage, and I'm assuming mean he's talking about what's been happening with electronic devices over the last few days. He said the next two stages are right, are already ready to advance. So that tells me that they had been planning some type of operation to contribute to a disruption of Hezbollah in the north. And I think what we've seen in this preparation stage over the last two days with the electronic warfare that they've conducted, is probably an indicator.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think it's both. And I said yesterday, Jim, that certainly it was just an unbelievably coordinated and effective tactical strike, but it certainly has strategic implications. And what I mean by that is having been in a terrorist fight myself, you know, so that one of the main things you have to do is eliminate or at least destroyed part of a terrorist organization's ability to communicate with other terrorists.If you can do that, half the battle is won because if they're not talking, things aren't going well. In fact, I had a -- I had a guy once tell me in a very Arkansas drawl that if they ain't talking, they're just out there camping. And that's what Israel wanted to do to Hezbollah. They wanted to disrupt their communication system not only at the high level, but even at the lower level, their ability to launch rockets. But the second thing I'd say is that disruption of communication systems probably caused a lot of other actions on the ground. And if Israel's intelligence is good as I know it to be, they were waiting for the after effects of those strikes on the pagers, on the walkie- talkies, on the computers to see what would happen because -- I say that because that's what I would have done as a commander. And in fact, that's what I did do as a commander. You wanted to cause a turn in your terrorist organization to see where people were going, what was happening next? And I think that may have contributed to some of the airstrikes that we saw today as another phase.",

There were a number of civilians, including children killed in this attack, nine- year-old girl died because the pagers went off without Israel knowing who was in the vicinity.And was there sufficient -- was there any consideration that you can discern by the Israeli intelligence, services and the military here to make an assessment of that? I mean, this is thousands of electronic devices going off at once, often as the video showed in crowded areas, I don't see how you could make any possible judgment as to whether there were civilians presence -- present and therefore make a calculation as to what the -- I always hate to use this phrase -- collateral damage was, but that's part of the calculation as based by the law of war, as part of the law of war.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's a great question, Jim.And what I would say in response, two things, number one, from what I understand in hearing reports, the amount of capability in each one of the devices that allow them to blow up was not significant enough to say, hey, there's going to be a lot of collateral damage. You know, there may have been a child standing right next to an individual who had a beeper on his hip or a walkie-talkie in their pocket and it caused collateral damage. But when you're talking about going after terrorists who were swimming in the sea of the population, you have to understand that there is going to always be collateral damage and that leads me to my second thing. As part of the reports that Israel saying, there were 36 individuals killed by these explosions a which 34 are indicative of Hezbollah terrorist. The Hezbollah is making a great deal of propaganda and press videos about the two small children that were also killed. That is unfortunate but if you can disrupt an entire terrorist network and you can kill a lot of terrorists in this kind of synchronized attack, you know, as a military guy, that's part of the calculation. It is unfortunate and it sounds like I'm being just devilish in my approach, but when you're talking about individuals who are controlling the launch of 30 to 50 rockets the day into Israel territory attempting to kill Israeli citizens, I think it may have been part of the calculus, but truthfully, it's a small part. And that sounds horrible, but I have to say it from a military perspective.",

      "sentences": "Jim, this is kind of the next piece of information that we're learning about from the FBI investigation. We knew already that the Iranian government link attackers had tried to hack both the Harris and the Trump campaigns and in the case of the Trump campaign, they were successful.CNN has reported in breaching the email account of Roger Stone the long time GOP operative, who is still close to the Trump campaign, and then using his account to try to target other members of the campaign in the Biden-Harris case, the Iranian hackers, we don't have any evidence that they were able to successfully breach them. However, what's new here is that the Iranian hackers apparently taking information, stolen from the Trump campaign and then sending it to people affiliated with then-Biden campaign to try to apparently based on our information, try to get the Biden campaign to use that information somehow to perhaps still up some more divisions between the campaigns finger-pointing, and the like. That didn't happen as far as we know. It got treated as almost like a spam emails, some weird email you get from somebody don't know and it wasn't opened. However, the former President Donald Trump last night was pointing the finger at the Harris campaign, baselessly claiming that they had somehow been involved in this and that's a false allegation. But according to intelligence experts and people who track these groups, that's exactly what the Iranians might -- might be wanting the reaction to be, to stir up divisions, to have the campaign blaming each other for this. So we think this is still like an 11th hour attempt by Iran to try to disrupt the campaign, disrupt the election and sow divisions. Whether or not it's working is still to be seen, but we've seen from 2016 until now a maturation of the way that the media and others process this information, Jim.",

So they are entering into net territory, child (ph) trafficking is still the major source of income, but they are also more and more involved in trafficking migrants, people smuggling, environmental crime and other commodities that are being trafficked use the same routes of trafficking.

I mean, a lot of Democratic voters writ large are really didn't have the confidence, Jim, that the president could win again.So, here comes Vice President Harris. She is a woman of color. She is younger. She brings a lot of enthusiasm and you're seeing that in the a massive amount of money she's raised and the massive number of volunteers that have signed up across the country to support her candidacy. However, when you begin to look down beneath those top line numbers, you do see some potential vulnerabilities for the vice president, particularly with men. I'm seeing vulnerabilities with African Americans generally speaking. I think one poll that just came out from Howard University today suggest that she's around 82 percent. She needs to be around 90 to 92 percent. So she has a lot of room that she needs to make up for there. Though she has increased her margins on the economy and immigration and voters appear to sort of be given her an interesting pass, unlike the pass they were willing to give President Biden, she's still is marginally behind Donald Trump. Now the question, Jim, for Trump is, can he become disciplined enough to not only bring his critique of immigration and the economy of the Biden-Harris White House rather, can he turn that critique to a more palatable, forward-looking vision for how he would address those issues. So far, I don't think he's figured that out, which is why I do think the vice president still has more room to grow. But look, I want to withhold judgment and give the foreign president than an opportunity to see if he can sort of change things around a bit.",

He brought age really as a core focus.And when Biden was off the table, this has now become an issue that is at the forefront and he made himself appear quite not in the same way that he was, and he's -- he's really brought this issue which at the table and when you see him unhinged and you're not seeming in the same way, I think its really going to be a little bit more of an issue for him.",

And as far as his desire to retaliate, I -- having listened to many of his speeches over the years in this one, it was somewhat subdued. He said we would respond to the Israeli attacks, but at a time of our choosing. And during that speech, what we heard a -- rather what we saw from here was two Israeli planes flying over Beirut, dropping flares and then about 20 minutes later, more Israeli planes dropping, breaking the sound barrier.

Hollywood is still facing repercussions today. Media mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs now sitting in federal custody, his appeal for bail denied Wednesday as he faces sex trafficking, racketeering, and conspiracy charges that prosecutors called a criminal enterprise. They say for decades, Combs engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse towards women, at times verbal, emotional, and sexual. Diddy's legal battle began in November 2023 when his longtime partner, Cassie Ventura, filed a lawsuit alleging her own experience of his sexual assault and physical abuse. That indictment recalled one incident that mirrors video CNN obtained. We should note that video is disturbing. This is exclusive footage from 2016, hotel security tape that appears to show Combs kicking and hitting Ventura multiple times, just difficult to watch. There you go again. Well, for more on how this case fits into the larger #metoo movement, the impact of Cassie's decision to come forward is Caroline Heldman. She's a professor of critical theory and social justice at Occidental College. Thanks so much for taking the time this afternoon.

I really think it speaks volumes to how we generally don't believe survivors, which is probably why only 1 percent of rape is will ever see a day inside a jail cell because oftentimes, these crimes are not reported, and then when a few brave individuals come forward, others survivors watch how they're treated, right?And so, they're watching how Cassie is treated. They're watching how other courageous women and some men who are coming forward to report sexual violence are getting abused in the press, or getting, you know, were harassed by fans, and it really discourages them from reporting.

The right response is, hey, let's make a workplace and work environment that's better.I think what's remarkable, you know, about Cassie, as you noted, she's coming forward after the #metoo movement and I would like to say that we put in a lot of laws and practices that are better. The problem is not fixed, but she's coming forward at least where survivors aren't dismissed out of hand, whereas, a decade ago it would have been. And I thought it was amazing what the #metoo movement did with suddenly starting to believe survivors, but also acknowledging when they come forward, they're still going to face so much antagonism.

Is this sustainable? And what are we doing that as helping with this that we can keep doing?So, as you said, this is a 10 percent decline in the last years' worth of data which ended in April of 2024. That's down to the lowest level in three years. But of course we are still seeing more than 100,000 deaths from drug overdose in the U.S. every year. And that is just unacceptably high. This has come down from where it was in the pandemic, but it is not quite down to where it was before the pandemic when we start drug overdose deaths soar. One thing that experts are looking at though is there are there other indicators that indicate that this trend is real and continuing, and they see that there are indicators suggesting that. One is that none not just fatal overdoses are down. That's about 10 percent decline, but also nonfatal overdoses. They say look like they're down about 15 to 20 percent across the board. And if you look at the state level, researchers at the University of North Carolina say they're seeing even bigger magnitude decreases. So there is a lot of optimism here, but still trying to sort through and figure out what's driving it. One thing that really is a noticeable trend is that deaths from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids dropped 20 percent according to CDC data. So they are looking into interventions, things like the increased availability of naloxone, for example, that became available over-the- counter recently, you can buy Narcan in the pharmacy without a prescription they want to make sure that medication for opioid use disorder is more widely available. Things like fentanyl strips, but they're really looking across the board to things like fentanyl shipments, seizures, and things like that. Could that be driving this? They want to make sure whatever it is, we keep doing it.",
