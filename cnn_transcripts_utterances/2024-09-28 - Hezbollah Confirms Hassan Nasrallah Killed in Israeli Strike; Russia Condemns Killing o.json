Hezbollah has confirmed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday. Nasrallah, one of the founders of the Iran-backed militant group, which has been a major antagonist of Israel for decades, behind many deadly terror attacks as well. A short time ago, I asked a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces if he believes that Nasrallah's death has somehow weakened Iran's power in the region. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESPERSON: You know, I think we'd be very cautious before saying that Iran has been weakened. Again, rockets went off just a few minutes ago, just over my home on our way here. There was a rocket that was intercepted and I had to deal with my children who were very, very scared. We're not going to, you know, wage that Iran, which is the largest supporter of terrorism in the entire world is weakened. What they do know is that they've been hiding for years behind their proxies, being able to destroy and attack Israel, terrorize Israeli civilians without paying a price. What they see now is their proxy Hezbollah, which has forced their people out of their home and tortured their own people and hid all their weaponry behind Lebanese civilians is now paying a very serious price.

It launched rockets in the northern Israel right before announcing Nasrallah's death.Israel certainly not letting up its military activities. It launched further strikes into southern Beirut today, targeting what the IDF says were weapons, storage facilities for Hezbollah. Those strikes along with the confirmation of Nasrallah's death, have sent shockwaves through the region, a fair amount of fear as well, regarding a possible retaliatory response. Iran's Supreme Leader said today that quote, \"all regional resistance forces are standing with Hezbollah\". And the country's state media is just reporting that a senior Iranian commander was among those killed in this Israeli strike targeting Nasrallah. Nasrallah's death marks a major escalation in a decades-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman has more or on Nasrallah's rise to power.

After the war, his focus turned inward on his homeland, Lebanon where Hezbollah increasingly became a key player in the country's complicated politics and expanded its network of social services. When war broke out in neighboring Syria in 2011, Nasrallah deployed Hezbollah fighters to shore up President Bashar al Assad's regime and also provided support to Iraq during its war against ISIS. Iran was quick to reward Nasrallah with money, weapons, and logistical support. But critics say his alliance with Tehran inflamed sectarian tensions. And weakened his credibility as a self-styled defender of the Palestinian people. When the Palestinian militant group Hamas, Hezbollah's ally, attacked Israel on the 7th of October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and abducting more than 250 others, Hezbollah began firing into Israel, opening what it called a day support front for Gaza. For more than 11 months, Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire across the border. Nasrallah said this would only stop once the war in Gaza came to an end. Instead, more fighting and death followed in the form of covert operations by Israel, which detonated Hezbollah's wireless communications devices in broad daylight for two days in a row. A weakened Nasrallah called it an unprecedented blow. Then Israels bombing campaign killed hundreds across Lebanon. Yet until the very end, Hassan Nasrallah remained defiant. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We were speaking to supporters of Hezbollah and they were -- they really believed that he was still alive.It was them telling us just wait and see. He will appear and he will come back with surprises, meaning that there will be more attacks. And, you know, a few minutes later we got that statement announcing and confirming that he was indeed killed by that massive Israeli strike yesterday. And what happened in immediately after that? You had an outburst of celebratory gunfire across different parts of the city. And this is in celebration of his martyrdom. And this is something that many within his support base, many Muslims believe that this martyrdom should be celebrated. So you've had that. We also have had scenes of people on the street. Women wailing, women fainting, supporters chanting their support for Hassan Nasrallah in the lobby of my hotel where we are staying. A woman was standing there crying and she broke down. She had to sit down and she's crying just repeating, oh God, oh Lord. People are in shock. For many of his supporters, for his loyal base this was an unfathomable scenario. Now, they are seeing this playing out and everyone is just wondering, Jim, what comes next, because Hezbollah put out that statement saying they will continue fighting. The question is, are they in in a position to continue fighting? We know that they are continuing their attacks on Israel, but how much of an escalation could we be potentially seeing and is it going to involve other Iranian-backed proxies in the region.",

When you throw around numbers like 150,000 rockets and missiles which Hezbollah is purported to have, that really means a lot of firepower. So you're worried about the firepower if you're on the other side of this. You're worried about the firepower. You're worried about their ability to exercise that power to use those instruments, those weapons against you. And in this particular case, what you're really looking at is the fact that in this case, I think with the command-and-control links destroyed it becomes much more of I was going to say paper tiger, it's not quite true because they are still extremely dangerous.

In April, we had what was then an unprecedented attack in its scale. Many dozens of missiles and drones fired at Israel, but few, if any reaching their target. Israels missile defenses, proving not just Israel's, we should note a regional network of defenses that included U.S. forces, but also allies in Jordan, for instance, proving capable of neutralizing that threat.

But the fact that Israel not only had those -- has those missile and air defenses but that they were connected to allied air defenses and missile defenses that made it really difficult for the uranium systems to penetrate that shield. And this same thing holds true today. The Iranians can throw a lot of stuff against Israel, but the likelihood of it succeeding is really quite low given the fact that the U.S. is in a position to help as are other allied nations and Israel, of course, is prime for just such an eventuality.",

That was a big deal for Iran. It wasn't there wasn't just their proxy force and their response has been trying to kill President Trump and John Bolton, his national security advisor, who has 24/7 secret service protection now. So there will be a response, but it's likely to be below the threshold of an absolute war. And the larger -- the other question you asked, Jim I think that, you know, we tend to think that if you killed this leader, that leader it's sort of the group's going to fold. Clearly a bunch of leaders have been killed in Hezbollah, and there've been many strikes against them. But you know, this is a 30,000-man army. They have 150,000 missiles. And they're not going to go out of business.

He met with him in Mar-a-Lago, amongst other things, he traveled here recently. And you know -- so you know, I'm sure he thinks that time is on his side to do these kinds of things because U.S. attention is elsewhere. As you were discussing with somebody who was there during the ceasefire, negotiations are basically dead and had been dead for a long time I think unfortunately. But you know, I think the big point here, you've heard people in Shin Bet say this a lot. I mean, you can win every battle and still lose the war.
