That's been the focus of both Republican and Democratic chairs of the FCC for the 20 years that I've been reporting on this industry. But Brendan Carr is signaling this will not be business as usual. He is not talking about broadband in his tweets about his appointment. Instead, as you said, Jim, he is talking about the censorship cartel. He is pointing at big tech companies that are right now not under the regulatory purview of his agency. And he is saying that companies like Meta and Google need to be reined in. That is his promise.And he wrote the FCC chapter in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint, where he said, we've got to reign in big tech. Right now, he doesn't really have the tools to do so at the FCC, but Congress could change that in the future. And in the meantime, Carr is using his bully pulpit to challenge companies like Meta. One company he's not challenging though is Elon Musk's X. Carr is a very big ally of Musk. And now, Carr could be in a position to steer billions of dollars in government subsidies to Starlink in the future, Jim.",

Look, when we hear the word censorship, the right says censorship, and it's become a real rallying cry for Trump and Carr and Musk, what these platforms said they were trying to do was moderate content to create a better user experience. Tamp down on the toxicity.For example, lies about the election, conspiracy theories about the pandemic. But the actions by Facebook and Twitter and other companies to try to clean up information pollution were also interpreted by some as censorship. And that is what Carr is referring to. That is what he's focusing on. It is so revealing that his first comment, after getting appointed, was to focus on censorship. His second comment, Jim, was about broadcast television. We know that Trump has threatened the licenses of major networks. Usually it's local stations, always actually, local stations, not networks that are licensed. Carr is indicating he might go after those local stations as well. But again, he has limited power to actually do that. So, this might be a case where he's talking the talk. We'll see if he can actually implement it. But clearly, he's trying to say that he's on board with Trump. He's trying to show he's a loyalist.",

So, for him to have his hands in selections of government officials is a huge conflict of interest. Now, Mr. Trump -- President-Elect Trump, let me be respectful. President-Elect Trump is saying that Musk is going to play a central role in deciding what government spending we have. He's not in Congress. Nobody voted for Elon Musk.
