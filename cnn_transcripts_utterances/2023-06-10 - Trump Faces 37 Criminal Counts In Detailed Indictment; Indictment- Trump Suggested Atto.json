      "sentences": "All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right. Right now, former President Donald Trump is hitting the road, preparing to speak publicly for the first time since the justice department unsealed its historic indictment against him. Trump traveling to Georgia and North Carolina today, speaking at GOP conventions in those states, as he continues his campaign for another term in the White House. And it comes just a day after the justice department presented stunning new details in its case against him. 37 charges in all, including 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information. Special Counsel Jack Smith, alleging the former president took classified materials to his Mar-a-Lago home, and then, resisted government attempts to get them back. We're also seeing new never-before-seen photos of the many boxes stored at Trump's residence. The DOJ says some of the documents inside held some of our nation's most sensitive secrets. CNN's Kara Scannell is in Miami ahead of Tuesday's court appearance. Trump is now the first former president ever charged with crimes in federal court. Kara, so, how serious are these charges against him?",

Now, under the federal guidelines, they don't usually sentence to that maximum, but it does underscore just how serious these charges are. And when you see multiple charges of multiple crimes, that is something that a judge would consider if Trump is ultimately convicted in that sentencing, Fred.",

So, I mean, this indictment goes into stunning details about these documents alleging that some were classified, containing information on the U.S. defense. Vulnerabilities, nuclear capabilities, and it says that Trump showed classified documents to others, on at least two other occasions.

These are literally, those Special Access Programs, the most sensitive government information that we have. There obtained through very sensitive collection, sensitive human sources, and the like. So, the idea that the president retained these documents continue to have them as possession, and then, at least on two occasions, as alleged in the indictment, may have shown them to other individuals who he knew didn't have security clearances. And that, at least, based on the transcripts they have, indicates that he knew they remained classified.

And that in company with the pictures that we've now seen. It really tells a story.So, Trump's aide, Walt Nauta, is also now facing charges. And apparently, right? Nauta provided some of the photographs in a two, prosecutors. I mean, so, you know, provided some of the evidence already. So, given that he's facing charges along with Trump, are you seeing a likelihood of not a flipping, trying to strike a deal with prosecutors just say, I've already provided you these photographs, maybe I can give you a little bit more information too, so that I don't, or am not facing jail time?",

And what the government alleges was a conspiracy to withhold these documents, a conspiracy to obstruct justice, by keeping these documents not just away from the FBI and the government, but away from Trump's own lawyer, who was going to do the search to actually move these boxes, if you -- if the -- if the indictment has proven true, to another place that the lawyer himself couldn't identify these documents. And so, Nauta has a lot of exposure, a lot of the charges brought against him, as Kara laid out. Some of them do carry those higher penalties up to 20 years in jail. So, he may very well plead, and if he does, then, his cooperations going to be required. That could go very poorly for the president, if he says, look, the president directed me to do this in an effort to prevent the government from getting his documents. That's obstruction straight up.

But the real challenge for the prosecution is, he's going to file motion after motion to get the case delayed and try to stall as long as possible. And frankly, there may be some merit to the idea that this case should wait until after the election takes place. Because, again, the attorney general, for whom a special prosecutor works, works for the president. President running for reelection, Donald Trump running for reelection. That's a real challenge. And a Court may be inclined to delay the case. Normally, a defendant wants a speedy trial, because they want to get the case resolved, because they're being held in custody. And so, in this case, actually, the defendant probably, in this case, President Trump, wants to delay as long as possible. He may have a lot of successful effort there.",

They're saying a similar amount has been gained this time. This is the most significant advance that they've had in that Eastern front. But it's not necessarily part of any counter offensive, really as part of what's described as the ebb and flow of the very bloody fighting that has been ongoing in the East there for more than a year now, Fredricka. But in the southeast of the town of Zaporizhzhia, along the line that runs many hundreds of kilometers all the way to the Russian-held city of Donetsk. They have also been significant increase in Ukrainian activity with company size, probing attacks by units of 100 or more men using artillery, using Bradley Fighting Vehicles supplied by the United States. MRAPs, those wheeled armored vehicles, some of them are taking casualties. We've had independent confirmation from fighters on the ground that the Ukrainians have indeed inevitably taken casualties. Because this is a very heavily fortified frontline where the Russians have been expecting the Ukrainians to push because they know and the Ukrainians want ultimate success will be when they managed to get south towards Crimea, and indeed, to recapture Crimea, which was taken by the first part of the Russian invasion back in 2014.

Law enforcement is taking nothing to chance, however, right? We already have heard that. We've heard about the coordination between multiple law enforcement entities, both at the federal, state, and local level, and how they're engaging with each other. Our -- while all these entities are working together in unison into a common goal of ensuring that the event goes off without incident, they all have individual roles and responsibilities that are very unique.
