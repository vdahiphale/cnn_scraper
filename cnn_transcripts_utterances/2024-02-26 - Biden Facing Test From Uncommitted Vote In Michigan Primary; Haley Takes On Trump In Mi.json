On the Democratic side voters angry over the war in Gaza are trying to send a message to President Biden. Does the uncommitted vote pose a threat to his campaign?And on the Republican side, Nikki Haley is vowing to soldier on after Saturday's blowout loss to Donald Trump in her home state of South Carolina. This as a major conservative donor network pulls (INAUDIBLE). Also tonight, CNN speaks one-on-one with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, marks two years of war with Russia, why he says millions will die if the U.S. cuts off military aid. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in The Situation Room. First up tonight, President Biden's big test in Michigan, where a primary challenge threatens to embarrass the president and expose deep divides among his Democratic base over the war in Gaza, this as President Biden just spoke out on the Israel-Hamas conflict saying he's hopeful a temporary, temporary ceasefire will be reached by next Monday. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more on the president's primary challenge and our M.J. Lee is over at the White House with details on President Biden's latest remarks about the war. Let's go to M.J. first. M.J., President Biden made the comments while visiting an ice cream shop in New York just moments ago. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. The president is up in New York spending the day there to do some fundraising and for a heaping of Seth Meyers, and he was just asked by a reporter when he was visiting an ice cream store when a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war might start, and his response used some pretty specific language on the timing. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is when they would like to have that next temporary pause in fighting to begin by. And that is so critical because this is when the Israeli government has said that the Israeli forces would go into Rafah in Southern Gaza if by that time a deal isn't struck. And that is something that U.S. officials are very much set on trying to avoid because the thinking there is that if that does happen, then all bets are sort of off and they wouldn't exactly know when the opportunity next might be for this kind of temporary pause in the fighting to happen. And it would be also, of course, incredibly significant, because it will be the first pause of the fight since that seven-day truce we saw back at the end of November, when, of course, a number of hostages ended up coming out. So, clearly, Wolf, we are seeing a president who appears to have reason for optimism that a cease-fire could begin in just a matter of days, Wolf.",

Four years later in 2020, President Biden carried it by 154,000 votes. However, the number of Muslim American voters, of course, is the larger influence of Arab-American voters in Michigan, is about 145,000 votes. That's based on the Emgage, a political action group, there. So, the margins there are so important. We, of course, do not know how all people will vote. We do not know what the situation will be in November. But that's why this is so precarious.

But what is the path for her to actually start getting a majority of the votes in these upcoming primaries? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Well, again, you take each state separately. You're looking at Super Tuesday. There's 16, 18 states there when you include Michigan in the mix. When you have the fact that, I think Nikki said it very well, there is not a mandate here. When you have former President Trump, the incumbent president, the standard bearer of the party, and 40, 45 percent in the early state say, we don't want them, we want to change things out, that's a weakness. And I think when Nikki talks about the electability, as she goes into these states, a lot of which the campaigns are really just picking up, the next ten days will be very intense. And it starts explaining to folks in a state like Michigan, boy, having Trump on the ballot kept losing races for Michigan Republicans. It kept losing House seats and the Senate seats. It put the governorship at risk. We couldn't win the governorship when we probably should have. So, again, electability matters a lot to a lot of these other states.

And they want to make sure that that process is protected. So, they're going to the judge now to put in place some of the provisions for the trial. And one of the things they're asking for is a gag order to be placed on the former president. Now, he has gag orders in two other cases already that he is largely abided by in recent weeks. And so they're asking in this case because of Trump's long history of talking about jurors, talking about the prosecutors who bring cases against him, talking about court staff and the threats that have resulted from the amount that he talks about, all of those people, they want a gag order.So, what they write in a filing to the judge, defendant, that's Donald Trump, has a long history of making public and inflammatory remarks about the participants in various judicial proceedings against him, including jurors, witnesses, lawyers and court staff. Those remarks, as well as the inevitable reactions they incite from defendant's followers and allies pose a significant and imminent threat to the orderly administration of this criminal proceeding. Now, they are not asking for Donald Trump to be barred from speaking about the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, himself but they do want to make sure that the harassment of court staff, as well as people in the prosecutor's office, family members, that that wouldn't take place. They cite hundreds of threats that have come in an exponential amount since 2022 when there was just one threat to the D.A.'s office. Now, there's been white powder received by the D.A.'s office in Manhattan in 2023 and many, many threats to them. Also, they obviously have concerns about juror safety as well.",

But I do wonder whether the court will implement a gag order this early in the process.In other words, I do wonder whether the court will give the former president maybe some verbal instructions of how he's supposed to comport himself, wait for him to be out of line with those particular prescriptions, and then move to the gag order. In other words, the gag order would be a step in the process, but maybe not the first one. So, I am curious to see how the timing of the court's decisions play out.",

And then, of course, the district of Columbia case, Jack Smith's case, related to 2020. That case depends a lot on whether or not the Supreme Court decides to take up the issue of immunity. So I think it's really nearly impossible at this point to predict when these cases are going to take place, in particular, until we get that immunity decision.",

He was arrested, landing for an international flight in Vegas when before it, magistrate the judge let him out. And that federal probe prosecutors really implored a judge to get this guy back in custody. They said he was definitely a flight risk, and the judge said he believed that perhaps Smirnovs lawyers were trying to facilitate him absconding from this country, getting away.
