      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We're tracking several stories developing at this hour. Houthi rebels now vowing to meet escalation with escalation after the U.S. and U.K. hit at least 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday. Those strikes happening just a day after the U.S. launched a series of air strikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq. And that was retaliation for last week's attack in Jordan that killed three American soldiers. We're also watching the U.S. southern border, where Republican governors from more than a dozen states, are meeting over a feud between Texas and the federal government. And breaking news out of California, parts of four counties now seeing emergency evacuation orders. Nearly 40 million people under flood watches. A deluge of heavy rain is just starting to fall, increasing the risk of potentially life-threatening flooding conditions. All right. Let's begin with a vow by the U.S. to continue operations in the Middle East after it carried out more strikes against Iran- backed Houthi rebels in Yemen Saturday. U.S. Central Command says the strikes were conducted in self-defense, and included Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles that were preparing to launch. The strikes hit 36 targets on 13 locations, using air and surface platforms, including fighter jets. They were aimed at deeply-buried weapons storage facilities, as well as other weapons used by the Houthis to attack shipping lanes in the Red Sea. We've got full coverage of this developing story. Priscilla Alvarez is with the president in Las Vegas, Ben Wedeman is in Aman, Jordan and Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. So Priscilla, let's go to you, traveling with President Biden. What more are we learning about the strikes, what kind of details are coming from the White House?",

That is an ongoing mission with the coalition to diminish the capabilities of the Houthis that have been targeting U.S. vessels and commercial vessels in the Red Sea, all of it though underscoring this delicate balance that Joe Biden is having to strike between deterring these Iranian proxies in the region but not being pulled into a wider regional war. National security adviser Jake Sullivan repeating that as well this morning, saying that the U.S. is going to respond forcefully and with clarity, but they do not want to escalate tensions in the region. Rather, they are trying to focus on deterrence, Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "Well, listen. The last time Secretary of State Tony Blinken was in the region was nearly a month ago, and back then, he was focused on trying to reach a hostage deal. He was focused on trying to avoid this conflict from spiraling into a broader, regional war and he was also working on longer term solutions to the Israel-Hamas conflict.A month later, he's focusing on those very same three tasks as he's set to arrive in the region later tonight. Of course, the backdrop for many of those issues has shifted in some ways, but the challenges and overall objectives very much remain the same. On the hostage front, of course, we know that there have been major developments as Israel, the United States, Egypt and Qatar last week were able to agree to a broad framework for the next hostage release deal. And so the secretary of state will be arriving at a time when all of those countries are waiting for Hamas' reply. And he will be visiting some of the key capitals where mediators in Qatar, as well as in Cairo, Egypt have been trying to work with Hamas to get them to a place where they can accept that broad framework or present a counterproposal of their own as it relates to a broader regional conflict. We know of course, that the secretary of state's trip comes with the backdrop of these latest strikes in Syria and Iraq, as well as the possibility of additional U.S. strikes in the region. And as the national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier today, while the United States is going to reply militarily to attacks on its forces in the region, it also wants to balance that military activity with diplomacy aimed at trying to deescalate or at least prevent further escalation in the region. But there's no question that ultimately the hostage talks will be a major focus for the secretary of state as people wait on edge here to see whether or not a deal is around the corner. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser indicating that as of now it is not. Other officials saying that it could be a matter of weeks. But nonetheless, this will certainly be a critical trip for the secretary of state at a critical moment in the region, Fred.",

It was a coalition attack, which I think, of course, is very, very important to build a coalition of support against them.

We're the only ones in the world that can do that. But we were able in that case, to use them in Syria and Iraq to make -- to use munitions that have enough payload to really strike deep and really hit down in the bunkers and to hit in the caves and places like that.

San Francisco has already had some problems with their airport there. We're already looking at 150,000 people in California without power, and again, we haven't seen the brunt of it get to the southern portions of California, where there's pretty high population. Here is a look at some of the excessive rainfall risks that we have been talking about. That high risk that is in effect from Santa Barbara to L.A. and Long Beach is very rare, not just for California but for the U.S. Fewer than 4 percent of the days that we get this excessive rain risk have that high risk in there. But it's responsible for 80 percent of the flood damage that we see, and 40 percent of the flood-related death. That high risk has also been issued for tomorrow too, for southern California, so that threat continues as we go into tomorrow. So we're looking at dangerous and life-threatening flash floods, river and urban flooding, mud and debris flow, downed trees and power lines. Because this is not just a water threat, this is a wind threat, as well. Look at the high wind warnings, all of that kind of dark red for gusts up to 80 miles per hour. And then that pink right off the central coast, that's where we're looking at some hurricane force winds that we've already seen. And it's the first time that that office has issued a hurricane force warning. So we can see that the ranges continue to pile on. You can see the gusts up to 35, 40 miles per hour. And then look at southern California tonight and into tomorrow and even into Monday and Tuesday, the fire hose of moisture that just continues. So the rain totals again will be very hefty, widespread three to six inches with that chances seeing up to eight-inch totals plus that snow pack, we're looking at it coming down in feet, Fred. WHITFIELD: My goodness. And so Elisa, you know, January, February, it's not rare that big rain inundates the areas there, especially in southern California. I remember being there one time and it was some kind of record, you know, rainfall. But this is particularly unusual, right?

The Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has not committed to put any Senate deal that emerges from that chamber onto the floor of the House. So that is a big question. How would they proceed?Other, of course, the other big question can they get 60 votes in the United States Senate? That will be the first test on Wednesday, getting the votes, there is 51-49 chamber. That means at least nine Republicans would vote, join Democrats, but we do expect some Democratic opposition. So, so many questions about whether they can even get the votes to begin the process, let alone passing a law in the middle of this campaign season, and its intractable issue of immigration -- Fred.

Welcome back.It's a sad fact, but despite improvements in health care over the last century, the Journal of Women's Health maintains grave disparities persist when it comes to Black women's experiences. Not only do Black women experience inequities in access and treatment in their health care journeys, but consequently, or conversely experience higher rates of chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease. Obesity, maternal mortality, and shorter life expectancies compared to most other American ethnic groups. The latest numbers from the CDC show life expectancy for Black women is nearly four years lower than white counterparts. But the reasons are far reaching. Someone who became a familiar face on this show and network talking about COVID, the pandemic and a host of other health-related issues is Dr. Uche Blackstock. And now she has penned a deeply personal book called \"Legacy: A Black Physician Reckons with Racism in Medicine,\" and it focuses on health care disparities. Welcome back, Dr. Blackstock.

And I talked about how systemic racism do practices and policies had limited the number of Black physicians and Black women physicians.I talk about a report in 1910 called the Flexner report that led to the closure of five out of seven of the historically black medical schools that would have trained tens of thousands of Black physicians. But I also just talk about how the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow really has impaired the health of Black people as to chronically deprive our communities. And that even our professional level of attainment socio-economic status, as we know what Serena Williams and Beyonce Knowles, you know, women who are affluent. Serena Williams is the greatest of all-time athletes. That is not even protective for us. So I talked about this appendicitis that I had that almost ruptured. And how my mother died at a very early age from a rare cancer that she should not have gotten, but likely she developed as a result of environmental racism.",

You know, when you're going to seek help for pain or some issue and you don't want -- either you don't want to seek care because you feel like people wont believe you or you do and you're turned away and dismiss what happened to me. I actually was sent away from ER, twice. And was on my third visit finally, over the course of a week, my appendix had actually ruptured.
