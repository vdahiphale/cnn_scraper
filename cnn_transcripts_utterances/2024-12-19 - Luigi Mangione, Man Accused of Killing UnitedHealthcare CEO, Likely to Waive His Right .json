      "sentences": "Yes, you bet, John. Well, first, I'll let you know that news. And you saw that tape. You just played it. Luigi Mangione has arrived here at the Blair County courthouse for these two hearings. First, that one on those Pennsylvania charges and then that all important extradition hearing to follow. And I'll just spend a little bit of time with that video. I know it's a short clip right there, John, but you see, Luigi Mangione again being escorted into the courthouse in an orange jumpsuit, once again, clean shaven, notably, in contrast to the last time we saw him outside of the courthouse. And like you also noted, John, no large outbursts, unlike the last time we saw him in the back of this courthouse just a week ago.Now, when it comes to what we're expecting to see first out here and then inside, I'll just tell you, John, a ton of media presence out here, a ton of law enforcement presence out here as well. A lot of the roads are closed off in this area of the courthouse. And there's also a lot of people just out here holding signs, a lot of \"Free Luigi\" type aspects. So this is clearly a lot more attention perhaps, than this little street in Hollidaysburg normally gets on an average Thursday morning. But let's talk about what we're going to see inside of the courtroom in, like you said, just a matter of minutes. There are two hearings this morning. The first one coming up at 8:30. Like I said, that's a preliminary hearing for the Pennsylvania charges. To remind the audience, those are two felonies, including a gun charge and then three misdemeanors. Those stem from when Mangione was picked up at that Altoona McDonald's, not too far from where we're standing right now. But then there's that bigger extradition hearing coming up around 9:00 a.m., likely just following immediately after the preliminary hearing is finished. That hearing is still on as of now. But Mangione's new defense attorney told CNN's Kara Scannell that Mangione is not expected to fight extradition. So, as you noted, John, that means he could be on his way back to New York as early as potentially this morning or potentially this afternoon as well. Meanwhile, John, I want to just update your viewers on a few of the things that we learned when it comes to the interaction the outside world has tried to have with Mangione since he's been behind bars here in Pennsylvania. We reported to you yesterday that he had received a few dozen emails, six letters. Well, I got a new update from the Department of Corrections yesterday afternoon. And we learned that as of yesterday afternoon, he's received 40 emails and 53 pieces of mail since he'd been behind bars. He also has 158 deposits into his prison commissary that has been available to him. But notably John, he has not had any visitors except for his attorneys. That's at least as of last evening. [08:05:00] But what's interesting, John, is that we did learn last night, again, from CNN's Kara Scannell, that the Mangione family, they're actually the ones who hired that high-powered defense attorney who is planning on representing him when it comes to those, again, more serious New York charges. So a lot of interesting dynamics at play here. Clearly, a lot of attention on this case outside of this courthouse today. But the main thing, John, is that in maybe an hour, maybe a little bit more, this particular chapter of the Mangione case here in Pennsylvania may be coming to a close. John?",

What extradition means, by the way, is if a person is wanted in one state here in New York but captured in another state, Pennsylvania, it's just the process of handing that person over back to the state that wants him. He's actually charged in both states, Pennsylvania and New York. But the murder charge is in New York.If in fact, he waives, meaning gives up his right to fight extradition, then he becomes the property, so to speak, of the New York authorities. And they can theoretically today take him out of that courthouse and drive him from Altoona to New York City. He could be here in Manhattan within -- it takes five hours to get here. He could certainly be here by the end of the business day today if things go as we expect.",

There's certain information they need to get from him in the in the arrest process, as if he were -- as if he had been arrested today on the streets in Manhattan. There's like biographical information, things like that.And then typically, if you're arrested in Manhattan, you're taken to a place referred to as the tombs. It's the jail intake that's in the courthouse building. So he would probably be held there for some period of time. If they expect to present him on Friday, which would be the moment of his arraignment, he might stay there overnight, or they'll take him to Rikers Island for a longer term hold until his trial, and as the proceedings go on. So he'll end up staying at Rikers Island with every other inmate in New York City that's awaiting some sort of trial or legal proceeding.",

And his New York attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, put out a statement on this, and I'll read this for everybody again. \"The federal government's reported decision to pile on top of an already overcharged first degree murder in state terror case is highly unusual and raises serious constitutional and statutory double jeopardy concerns. We are ready to fight these charges in whatever court they are brought.\" What would these charges likely be?",

I know it would seem to a normal person, well, you're charged in the state and federally for the same crime. The Supreme Court actually took this exact question on just a few years ago and said, it's OK. It's not recommended, but it's OK to have the feds and the state charge the same person with the same crime. They're separate sovereigns in the terminology.Now, what could the federal charge be? It's important to know not every murder is federal. In fact, most murders are not federal. You need some sort of what we would call federal jurisdictional hook. And here I think that hook could be the fact that he traveled in interstate commerce, or he came into New York across state lines in order to commit this murder. So that's what I would expect. If there are federal charges, as we're hearing, I'd expect him to be that.",

      "sentences": "So I think the state has a fair and articulable claim to this charge, even though it is a pretty extreme charge. It's the most serious murder you can be charged with in New York. And as we've said, in most cases, when it's charged, it's because there's been a murder of a first responder or police officer or something like that. But there is a provision in the charge to allow it to go forward to someone who has been accused of terrorism. Terrorism is, of course, defined as a crime or a murder, violent crime that's intended to coerce or intimidate a population.So in this case, what the state will argue, argue is that from his own writing, the writing they seized from him when he was arrested, he indicated a desire to do this crime as sending a message to this community of parasites, as he referred to them, who the state, I'm sure would say is likely a reference to other people in the health insurance industry. [08:10:05] He then commits the murder, and the murder has the effect, has the effect, rather, of intimidating or frightening a population, that being the corporate world that has responded to this murder and the publicity around it in a very distinct way. Corporations are desperately seeking security arrangements to protect their CEOs and other people. So there's a logical, factual pattern there to establish the terrorism charge. On the other hand, the defense will come in and say, this is an overcharge. This is not a terrorist. The resulting fear and intimidation across corporate America was just an unforeseeable result. That was not something that he ever intended to do. So it will certainly be a fight. But in either case, that very high charge provides a lot of room for the prosecutors to negotiate a plea bargain, because it's a charge that they could essentially walk away from in return for his, let's say, guilty plea to second-degree murder or something along those lines. So it actually gives them, I think, more freedom of movement in terms of plea negotiations.",

At this point, he's under basically what is like a civil complaint, John.
