      "sentences": "I mean, first of all, the fact that we can see this live at its happening in such good quality is just incredible. And it reminds us, you know, that SpaceX really does believe that this is not just a journey for one company or one country. I mean, yes, this is a critical part of NASA's Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon. But this is really a moment for all humanity because SpaceX wants to use this rocket to colonize mars. And so as I watch these -- these images, it's just an incredible moment for people that all enjoy watching spaceflight.I would have to say that SpaceX is going to be very pleased with this because this so far has been a picture-perfect launch. There was no hold at t minus 40 seconds. They didn't even have to wait to see if those wind speeds were too high. It was as clean a countdown as they come. And keep in mind, they only got their launch license from the FAA about 24 hours ago, less than 24 hours ago. So, SpaceX here is really saying, hey, our hardware is not the one that is holding up these flight tests. It is FAA, government regulators, that are keeping us from moving at the pace that we would like to be moving at, the fact that -- that SpaceX was able to launch today. And so what we're seeing right now on the screen, on the left-hand side of your screen, actually, I'm not sure there, but what we're going to be seeing is the booster, the bottom part of the rocket. The super heavy is going to be returning back, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. I believe that's what you're seeing on the left-hand side of your screen.",

You can see the black belly there, those are all the heat shield tiles that are going to protect it from the heat of re-entry. But right now these are the grid fins that you're seeing. There's things that are turning, they're trying to kind of help steady the super heavy booster as it makes its way back down to earth. I believe they lost an acquisition of signal. So, you've got two things happening at once, the booster coming down to the Gulf of Mexico and then Starship trying to make it all the way to the Indian Ocean. And, Sara, what we're going to be seeing now, within the next few minutes, is this fuel transfer. I mean think about that, they're going to be trying to move cryogenic super-chilled fuel from one tank inside that Starship rocket spacecraft right there into another tank inside the spacecraft. That is critical because Starship cannot make it to the moon until it is able to prove that it can do that. And it's going to have to do it ten times. You're going to have to have about ten or 11 of these things all launching around the same time, transferring fuel from one spacecraft to the next. That's how much fuel it's going to take to get it up to the moon. So, that's the first big demonstration that's going to be coming up here if all goes according to plan. They're also going to be opening up a very small payload hatch. That's critical because SpaceX wants to use it to deploy satellites, likely Starlink satellites, in the next few months. And then there's also going to be the first ever relight of a raptor engine in space. So those are going to be some of the key milestones that we're going to be seeing coming up. But so far, I mean, Sara, SpaceX and NASA going to be very pleased with this. It doesn't get much better than this right now.",

      "sentences": "It should be just about 40 minutes. I mean the goal here is not to make Starship fully orbital. They're not trying to do, you know, several laps of the earth. What they're trying to do is simply get Starship to orbital speeds, to prove that they can get it into orbit. And so, if all goes absolutely perfectly, the whole flight plan is not to make even one full orbit of the earth. Essentially what it's doing is its lifting off from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, its going up, going over the Atlantic Ocean, it's going to go over the very southernmost tip of Africa and then close to Madagascar splash down somewhere in the Indian Ocean.But even then, SpaceX saying here, you know, it will look like, if you could see it, and we probably won't be able to, end in some kind of explosive event because, with a spacecraft traveling at those speeds, you can imagine what sort of impact that might have when it splashes down into the Indian Ocean. But overall, about 50 minutes is what SpaceX is saying if all goes according to plan for the Starship spacecraft. But that booster, I believe it should have already splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, or already suffered a rapid unscheduled disassembly, which is SpaceX terminology for an explosion.",

Former Alabama -- excuse me today. Former Alabama Senator Democrat Doug Jones joins us now. Forgive me for getting slipped over my tongue there. Senator, I wanted to ask you about No Labels because I think you have strong feelings about this group and their efforts to launch a third party presidential candidate. DOUG JONES (D), FORMER ALABAMA SENATOR: Absolutely. You know, John, you've got to start from the premise that a third party cannot win an election in the United States of America. We are a two-party country and we have that - been that way for two centuries now. And a - they - there's no way on God's green earth that a third-party independent candidate can win. And I believe that a third-party bid by No Labels, which purports to be a centrist type organization, would only take away votes from Joe Biden. And I think that that's a vote for Donald Trump.
