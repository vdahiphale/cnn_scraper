Earlier this year, a jury took just three hours to convict the disgraced South Carolina attorney of killing his wife and son, in June of 2021. Now his attorneys allege, the clerk who courted his trial, tampered with jurors. Let's get to CNN's Dianne Gallagher, who's in Columbia, South Carolina for us. So Dianne, what did the defense team say?",

      "sentences": "You know, Boris, they say that the Colleton County Clerk of court, Rebecca Becky Hill, was motivated by quote, money and fame in pursuit of a book deal and television appearances. They filed that motion for a new trial here in Columbia today with a 65-page motion that includes bombshell allegations against the clerk of court there in Colleton County. Just to read you a bit of this here, they claim that quoteThe clerk of court tampered with the jury by advising them not to believe Murdaugh's testimony. And other evidence presented by the defense. Pressuring them to reach a quick guilty verdict and even misrepresenting critical and material information to the trial judge in her campaign to remove a juror that she believed to be favorable to the defense. Now again, these are just allegations at this though. We have reached out to Miss Hill. She has not given us comment yet in response to this motion. But look, the filing does contain two sworn affidavits from two people who served on the jury, in addition to witness statements and copies of a book that Rebecca Hill did eventually publish about the Murdaugh double murder trial earlier this year. Now some of those jurors in those affidavits said things like Hill instructed the jurors to not be misled by evidence presented by the defense and not to be fooled by Murdaugh's own infamous testimony. It was that book that authorities say caused the jurors to come forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM GRIFFIN, ATTORNEY FOR ALEX MURDAUGH: Immediately in the aftermath of the verdict, we had received information that that we needed to look into what happened in the jury room. We started down that road and we met a zone of silence. No jurors would speak to us. And so we were, you know what I like to call, we were given the Heisman. Right? And then when the clerk of court wrote her book, published her book, that zone of silence collapsed and jurors were upset about that. The ones we talked with and they were more than willing to come forward and tell us the things that that we had sort of heard through a whisper campaign. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
