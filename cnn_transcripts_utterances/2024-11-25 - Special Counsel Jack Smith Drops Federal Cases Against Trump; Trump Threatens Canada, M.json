I'm sure there will be some things that are, um, you know, very troubling. But Democrats also failed when these cases were going forward because there was not -- there should have been one narrative about what these things, cases mean together, for the American people because, remember, people accepted certain things about Trump but they thought, well, but the economy was good under him. And so, we didn't, you know, have a strong enough message to say, yeah, but if he's busy focused on retribution or if he's busy figuring out how he can make money, he's not focused on you, instead of just trying to tell people more facts, it's a mistake we made in the 2016 campaign, in fact.
