Well, abrand new and potentially troubling diplomatic row is emerging amid the Israel-Hamas negotiations, and this one involves a key player in the talks. Qatar is slamming Israel's Prime Minister, accusing him of undermining the country's mediation efforts. Now, it comes after a leaked audio recording airing on Israeli television allegedly captured Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing the Gulf nation, describing it as, quote, \"problematic\". CNN cannot verify if the voice is indeed that of Prime Minister Netanyahu, but take a listen to what was leaked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator):  For me, Qatar is no different in essence from the U.N. It is no different in essence from the Red Cross. And in a certain sense, it is even worse, more problematic. I was very angry recently, and I didn't hide it from the Americans, that they renewed the contract on the military base they have with Qatar. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, one former Israeli Prime Minister is putting Netanyahu's situation this way, \"For the love of God, go.\" Coming up, my conversation with Ehud Barak. But first, Boeing 737 MAX-9 jets could be back in the sky this weekend, as long as they pass a set of inspections. The Federal Aviation Administration has announced that. The planes have been grounded since a door plug on an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-flight earlier this month. Alaska says the grounding of the planes will cost the airline about $150 million. Meanwhile, the FAA says that it won't grant any production expansion of the Boeing 737 MAX line-up until it satisfied quality control issues are resolved. Boeing CEO recently took the opportunity to defend his airline. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Moscow says the flight recordersfrom that plane are being decoded at a military lab. Now, it's still not clear who or what was on board the plane when it crashed near the Ukrainian border, but Russia says there are no survivors. Now, Kyiv is raising fresh doubts about Russian claims that Ukrainian POWs were on board. And Moscow continues to insist that Ukraine shot down the plane. In the coming hours, the U.N. Security Council is set to meet over the incident. So, let's talk about all of this with CNN aerospace analyst Miles O'Brien. So, Miles, very tough to crack inside what is going on as far as how Moscow is investigating this crash. But from what we know, we do know that they have had access now and have found the black box recordings. What, if anything, can they tell us about this incident? And do you think a flight manifest would even be available? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST:  Well, these are all important questions. What the authorities on the ground there may be able to discern and what the rest of the world will know could be two very divergent things. In cases like this where there is the high probability of a shoot down, there's an awful lot you can learn, Bianna, just by looking at the metal. Which way did it fail? Was it bent inward or outward? Inward would suggest, you know, air -- surface to air missile. Outward would suggest some sort of explosive on board the aircraft. Those kinds of things don't require black boxes but what whatever thing -- what we do need is a public disclosure in a candid way and I'm not sure we're going to get that.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, miracles -- what a way to put it. Our remarkable, resilient, lots of sort of ways to define thiseconomy right now. But yes, it is more than twice what economists were expecting. So, what's behind it is really what we saw is consumers. I mean, consumer spending was a really large driver here, Bianna. Government spending continued to be a strong driver at the end of the year. Business inventories, as well. Consumer spending is an area of the economy that has really left a lot of economists sort of scratching their heads because, of course, as we know, the Fed has raised interest rates 10 times. They have done a remarkable amount in a very short time, and yet the consumer continued to spend in the last quarter. We saw continued spending on both the good side of the economy and the services side of the economy. The report pointing out that people continue to spend on food services, restaurants, on accommodations, traveling, hotels. I mean, that is not an economy that is in contraction. That is not an economy where folks are necessarily tightening their belts, at least according to this report. Now, if you look at sort of the last few quarters or so, we don't have this for you, but I can tell you that 3.3 percent on an annualized basis. Yes, it is cooler than the prior quarter, but if you go back a few more quarters, it's actually -- it's stronger. I mean, this is a healthy quarter. Now, when you put it all together, you have also some inflation data in this report that suggests that inflation continues to cool, and yet growth continues to be strong. So, it's sort of looking like, Bianna, that soft landing that everyone was looking for -- the soft landing that the Federal Reserve has been trying to engineer. I talked to Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist of Moody's a few hours ago -- a short time ago, and I asked him, is a report like this illustrative of -- maybe the Fed got it right. Maybe they did it.

EhudBarak says the only way for Israel to avoid sinking into what he's calling the Gaza quagmire is to hold early elections. In a blistering interview with \"The Telegraph\", the former Labor Party leader accused Netanyahu of being politically dependent on his far-right coalition, comparing him to a hostage. And he said Israel is currently experiencing a vacuum in leadership. And in a separate scathing op-ed in \"Haaretz\", Barak accused the Prime Minister of failing to consider or even discuss post-war plans in Gaza, thereby threatening Israel's security. And joining me now is Ehud Barak. Thank you so much for joining me, Mr. Prime Minister. In the \"Haaretz\" piece, you also go on to write, \"For about three months now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has prevented discussion of the day after in the inner cabinet. This is unconscionable. Israel needs different leadership. There must be an early election.\" Now, that may be easier said than done. As you know, this Prime Minister will likely not leave voluntarily, and despite his unpopularity, it's still quite an uphill battle to even call for new elections. From everything I've read, and you're the expert here, first you would need the 12 Knesset members who joined the emergency war government to leave. Then you would need an additional five members of the original 64-member government to leave and join the opposition to only then hold a three-month mandatory campaign calling for a new election. That seems to be a lot of ifs and an uphill battle to say the least. Do you see this happening?",

There is a significant risk that we will deteriorate into full-scale regional kind of war of treason or war,however you call it, with the Hezbollah in the north, probably with terrorists in the West Bank and with the Houthis, which the United States and the U.K. are dealing with, and even Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. So, we have the probability of we're being drifted into a much worse situation. But the basic issue is simple. Israel has to remove Hamas from power in Gaza and make sure it cannot threaten us. Number two, Israel does not want to stay in Gaza forever. Number three, the Gazans are not going to anywhere. So, as a result of those three elements, we have to find a body which is internationally recognized and legitimized to hand over the Gaza Strip to. This force could only be kind of under coordination with the Americans, made of inter-Arab force that will take it for a limited time and then pass it to the Palestinian Authority. This simple reality somehow is ignored by Netanyahu for reason that some of them are politics, some of them are ideology. It doesn't matter. That's the only practical way. And as long as he does not accept this reality and Israel cannot run even the regional war that you have just mentioned with Hezbollah and others without the close coordination with the United States. United States provide our munitions. United States provide the deterrence against Iran and Hezbollah. United States provide the protection for Israel, safety net in the U.N. Security Council and even certain support Criminal Court in The Hague. So, basically we cannot run it without America. Netanyahu is planning to lead it into a kind of climbing down from the trees and instead of admitting that he is unable to run the situation, he will blame President Biden, he will blame the leadership of the IDF, he will blame the opposition leader and probably even myself. So, basically we are in a tough situation.

Basically, when I try to convince people in Israel, stand up and let's fight for our future --our collective future. They tell me, what me, the ordinary citizen, knows that Eisenkot and Gantz, the leaders of the opposition who joined the cabinet war, do not know, or that President Herzog doesn't know, or Lapid, who is the head of opposition, doesn't know, Lieberman, who is another leader in the opposition, doesn't know. As long as they are quiet, I, the ordinary citizen, feel that the time has not yet come. I think it had come, and that's the reason why I called for election, not just calling for something abstract. I call upon Gantz and Eisenkot, the two generals, former heads of the IDF, who are now politicians, which have joined, probably rightly so, the war cabinet, to stand up and tell Netanyahu, we demand to set a -- election date at most, early June.

But Netanyahu is the one who set a strategy which collapsed on the 7th of October, saying that Hamas is an asset and the Palestinian Authority, the only internationally recognized legitimate player, which is also short of perfect, he said Hamas is an asset and the Palestinian Authority is liability. And he helped Qatar to pay protection money, I call it, to the Hamas over five years, some $1.5 billion, which financed this tunnel operation and these heavy, heavy kind of weaponizing of Hamas and even the Tuwali.

I've campaigned there. And Trump does have the significant lead in the polls. There's a couple of things that could change the dynamics. First of all, Trump overplays his hand. He's already gone on such severe personal attacks on Nikki Haley and that could cause a backlash of pride there in South Carolina. Whenever he is promising to ostracize anybody who supports Nikki Haley, clearly it demonstrates he wants to have a revenge presidency. And the other thing is that Nikki's going to have to campaign hard, not just in South Carolina, but she's got to identify those states like Michigan and other places that she can make the inroads, bring in the independents. The case that she can bring in independent voters makes sense because that's the weakness of Donald Trump when it comes to general election. Republicans want to win and that's what they're going to have to evaluate who can best lead them.",

You and Chris Christie are, I believe, the only former candidates vying for the Republican nomination that have not thrown your support behind Donald Trump. We've seen Tim Scott now do it, obviously Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, John Cornyn, Ron DeSantis. Nikki Haley says this is not a coronation, but there are those in the party with a lot of authority in the Senate today that are saying now it is time to coalesce around one candidate to unify the party.
