But look at those comments get to something that he has been really talking about a lot, that this is not the same Donald Trump that you first elected, he's lost his edge. He said there he's lost his fastball. When you talk to voters who listen to that message. Some people agree with him that he is different.So, there is a sense of the candidates are trying to go around the margins because they don't necessarily want to offend some of those Republican voters who like the former president. But look, all of the candidates are going to be in Iowa this weekend, all the major candidates. Tomorrow marks 100 days until the Iowa caucuses open this Republican nominating contest. And Iowa is the place because it most -- it devotes a first to slow Trump's rise. But as we get closer and closer, even if someone does slow it there, can they slow it other places? Can his rise be slowed? Or is Donald Trump going to essentially march to the nomination? That is a question voters still of course have to vote. They have open minds. But boy at this stage in October, DeSantis thought he would be in a far different spot.",

If you look at the at the numbers here on inflation, economy, immigration, look at the immigration moves the White House made yesterday, the president's going to be talking about job creation later today.Look, this is a divided country, this is going to be a close race. So that is one thing that the Democrats and the President's team are trying to wake folks up to the idea that, yes, this is going to be a close race. Something very interesting happened yesterday, that could shape the dynamic of this as well not talked about a lot. But the Green Party candidate, a Cornell West decided to drop his Green Party affiliation and run as an independent. The reason that matters is he will not be on the ballot in as many states. So, one thing the White House is worried about is third party candidates. So that is a significant development a help for President Biden, perhaps. But look, this is going to be a close race, the next year is going to be a closely divided. But one thing the former president weighing in on the speaker's race, which you guys have been talking about earlier this morning, that could have a perhaps a boomerang effect as well, not all Republicans are pleased by that. So, the divisions as we end this week on Friday, think of all that has happened just in the last week narrowly averting and government shutdown, one could be around the corner, in terms of governing versus not governing. That is something hanging over this race that voters of course will have to make their decisions on.",

Some of this is a continuation of what we have already seen. So, leisure and hospitality adding jobs there, healthcare adding jobs there. Guys, this is an interesting one, because all week we have been getting these conflicting reports about the state of the labor market. Is it cooling? Is it heating back up? This seems to suggest it's still pretty hot. Right? So just to give you some perspective over the last month, last year, rather, we've seen an average monthly gain of about 271,000. And this is on top of that. Revisions very important here for the prior two months, we added an additional 120,000 jobs more than expected, 120,000 jobs more than expected. So, it's still a strong labor market, which is great for the American worker in terms of what this means for the larger economy in terms of the Fed. Well, this seems to suggest that the next time they meet at the end of this month, October 31st to November 1st, the chances of another rate hike have increased.",

So, the reason why, I mean, this is good news for the American worker, this is good news about the labor market, except that it means the Federal Reserve that Jay Powell on that committee, it now sort of gives them a bit more push to increase rates further.

The difficulty with all of this is that even though these numbers are reported as being a monthly number, they're really focusing on a snapshot in time during that month.So that's why you don't see them in these data, but you might see them in the following month's data.
