And with that ramping up, he is ramping up his attacks on Haley. Listen to what he told his supporters just last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A vote for Nikki Haley this Tuesday is a vote for Joe Biden and a Democrat congress this November. The radical left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley because they know she's much easier to beat than Trump. But if she wins, Biden wins. And I'm telling you that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, clearly, if the other person in this race, as she says, says something about her, we should expect her likely to respond.But bottom line, she is the only person campaigning in this state today. And she's trying to capitalize on some of those opportunities. We're at the first of what is said to be a number of meet and greets and campaign events over the course of today before, of course, her CNN town hall tonight. Now, part of why she's the only person campaigning is Ron DeSantis has scaled back his campaign. And we were at a town hall of his yesterday -- scaled back his campaign in New Hampshire. But at that town hall event, he was still asking for votes here in this state, despite we're really not going to see him much except for back on Friday and then on Sunday as well. So, Haley has gotten -- has turned that aspiration that it's a two- person race into essentially a reality here in New Hampshire. Take a listen to what she said yesterday at one of her events. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know Trump threw a temper tantrum about me last night. I heard that. And I've seen the commercials you see. We have to win in November. But if you look at these head-to-head matchups, that's a hard truth. Head-to-head, Trump and Biden, it's going to be another nail-biter of an election.

She's - she's backed away from it.I also think that New Hampshire is where Nikki Haley becomes John McCain in 2000. You remember that? He pulled off the upset there. He won because of those moderates and those independents that can vote if you're undeclared or if you're a Republican moderate. But I think South Carolina is where her campaign dies, just like with John McCain. And if you recall, it got very nasty in South Carolina. The race card was pulled on John McCain because of his adopted daughter who's of color. And I think Nikki Haley's in for a rough ride. So, she's running for VP. So, she wants to be careful and she doesn't want to tick Trump off or his base, but she's trying to do this kabuki dance. And I don't think she's doing it very well.",

And so let's say that Donald Trump wins New Hampshire, then you move on to South Carolina. DeSantis is obviously more likely to place second in South Carolina than Nikki Haley, again, because of that idea of the voter profile and where those voters register if we're looking at like an ideological line. Most of them are further to the right than the voters in New Hampshire who are more centrist leaning.And so again, the DeSantis camp has to have the recognition that if Trump dominates in the first two states, his likely voters are going to look at that and beg the question, is it worth voting for someone who we know doesn't have a chance going forward, or should we move over to the Trump camp? I think most of those voters are going to move over to Trump. I spent a significant amount of time in South Carolina in 2016. Every single county in that state registered for Trump, 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent compared to someone like a Ted Cruz, who was also favored by evangelicals at the time.",
