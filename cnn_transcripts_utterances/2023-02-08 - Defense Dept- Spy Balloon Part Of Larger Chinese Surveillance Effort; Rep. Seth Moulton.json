And roughly half of those flights have actually been within U.S. airspace. So Pentagon press secretary, Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, he actually did just address this with reporters earlier, confirming that the U.S. has been tracking this surveillance program for quite some time now. And does believe that it's part of a larger mission, a larger operation being carried out by the Chinese government. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: This is what we assess as part of a larger Chinese surveillance balloon program. You've heard us talk in the past about the fact that this is a program that's been operated for several years. And this last week provided the United States with a unique opportunity to learn a lot more about the Chinese surveillance balloon program, all information that will help us to continue to strengthen our ability to track these kinds of objects.

Did they think they could get away with them being up there and never being detected, or had they planned that this might happen, and they were willing to take that risk? Are they filling some gap in China's knowledge about the U.S. that they don't have?

In fact, I recently learned of the story of somebody who was just about to get on the flight.

And Democrats are pushing back saying you're using this to distract from the problems of January 6th. But I think, moving forward, this step represents a big problem for tech companies. With the Republican majority that believes that they are censoring them, they are going to be putting -- they will be under a lot more pressure, expect to see them in Congress to address some of these situations a lot more, even for Twitter, which is now owned by Elon Musk.
