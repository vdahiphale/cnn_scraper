They always said the Democrats that were working on campaigns down ballot always would say to me, it's the messenger, not the message that is the problem, and they saw President Biden as the issue. Now, they have a new messenger at the top of the ticket with Kamala Harris, who they think is much more effective, but she is going to have to differentiate herself in little ways.

There's a lot of things on her record that we know what she needs to -- she would do if she wins.I think one challenge for Former President Trump, though, is that he always likes to compare leadership styles and leadership characteristics more than he likes ideology. Ideology has never really been his thing. He's not an ideologue, but this is now a campaign about ideology. If he's going to win, he has to paint her as the most extreme candidate for president ever.
