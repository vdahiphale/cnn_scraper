This method has to be one of the more crafty ones. U.S. Attorneys have charged this Texas man for sneaking on board a Delta flight bound for Austin, it happened in Salt Lake City on Sunday, which was St. Patrick's Day.Court documents say 26-year-old Wicliff Fleurizard was planning to fly standby on a Southwest flight, that flight was overbooked. So, investigators say, Fleurizard went to the gate of this Delta flight. Police reviewed the security footage which showed Fleurizard in the boarding area, taking multiple photos of multiple passengers, phones and or boarding passes while they were not looking. The criminal complaint says, Fleurizard scanned his fake ticket, boarded the plane and locked himself in the plane's bathroom and did not come out until after the plane had pushed back from the gate. Now, this plane might have worked if he did not get questioned by a flight attendant. And court documents say this, Fleurizard indicated to the flight attendant that his seat was 21F. The flight attendant verified that the passenger who was in seat 21F was the person who had purchased and had been ticketed for that seat. And it was not the criminal here, Fleurizard. So, clearly this created a lot of confusion on board. Flight attendants were pretty quickly able to figure out that this man was not on their manifest. So, then they taxied back to the gate where the police were waiting. Police say Fleurizard told them he got bumped from his original flight onto a later flight and was simply trying to get home and made a mistake. But now he's facing one count of stowing away on a vessel or aircraft, sort of, an old school charge there that can carry prison time up to five years. It is not clear yet if Fleurizard has an attorney, Jim.",
