And then the seat -- then the president got up and sort of was surrounded by the secret service. And you see this -- you could see him just with a little bit of blood on him and his -- you know, his sort of fist came out in defiance.And then, over my shoulder, behind me, it was clear that somebody had been hit. And so, people around this gentleman were trying to administer first aid. And he was clearly -- this person was clearly injured. It seems severely. There was a lot of blood. And eventually, some police officers came up and carried him to where I hope he got the urgent care and obviously praying for him now. So, that was what I saw. I saw the immediate attack on the president and I saw the fact that this person behind me was injured. But you can imagine with that kind of incident happening, very hard to know what's coming. In fact, I'm not sure whether it was one shooter or two shooters. I couldn't really tell. It seemed like the shots were coming from my front. So, to the pres -- from the president's left, but -- which would've made sense why the person behind me was hit, but I'm not sure if there was also shots coming from other directions. So, it was -- as you might imagine, it was chaotic and confusing in, in the moment.",

The Secret Service says suspected shooter dead. In fact, here is a video which appears to show the gunman after he was shot and killed on the roof of a building, just a couple of 100 yards away from the stage from which Trump was speaking. You could see it better there on the map. The shooter on top of that building at the top, the stage just there in the center, the distance between them, perhaps the length of a couple football fields.

I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.We are seeing the first video of Donald Trump since the shooting. Trump campaign's deputy communications director posted a video to X, formerly Twitter, of the former president walking down the steps there in New Jersey, captioning it, strong and resilient, he will never stop fighting for America. The White House says U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Trump earlier on Saturday, following the shooting, he has now returned to the White House early from Delaware. President Biden has been calling for unity in the shooting's aftermath. He says he's grateful to hear that Trump is safe and well. Here's the president earlier condemning political violence, calling it sick. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this. The Trump rally was a rally that he should have been able to be conducted peacefully without any problem. But the idea, the idea that there's political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody.

They appear to have seen him there before he was able to take these shots at the president. So, now, I want to take your attention to another video. It shows a different angle, also very revealing from this perspective, because here you can see what appears to be the Secret Service Counter Snipers, as they're called, on the roof of a building just behind President Trump there, looking in the direction of where the shooter was.And in fact, you could see the gun, the rifle of the counter sniper there jolt a little bit at the first sounds of gunfire before then they fire back. And later, at the lower part of your screen there, you can see after they fire those shots back, the -- there they are. Secret Service agents rushed to the stage to take president -- former president down to the ground and then to safety. We're joined again by retired FBI supervisory special agent and CNN law enforcement contributor Steve Moore. Steve, it's good to have you back. First, I want to start with what is really the most important point today and just how close this what appears to be a lone gunman got to potentially killing a former president, current candidate for president. I mean, these were half inches, perhaps, away, right, given that one of the bullets appears to have struck his ear from a far worse outcome.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and what's terrifying to me as a former sniper is the level of the of the shot. I mean, generally, a sniper is going to shoot at the at an area between the eyebrows and the top of the cheeks. And that's about where this bullet passed. It was certainly almost perfectly aimed.And I think we might find that the former president turned his head just as the trigger was dropping. It could be one of the most incredible miracles of this whole time that the president moved his head So, yes, it's -- that struck me. And that's horrible phrase, but that really got to me on this thing. The other thing that's interesting here and that I think we should really point out is that while what we see is very important to us and what we hear is not necessarily telling us the truth. [01:15:00] If this was a high-powered rifle, the bullets were traveling faster than the speed of sound, which means they're going to pass the target before the sound gets there. So, by the time people in the audience are hearing the bullets go by, they've already gone. And there is also a secondary sound that sometimes you hear, which will make you think that there's more gunfire than there is because the bullet going by has -- breaks the speed of sound. You get a little crack from the breaking of the speed of sound. Then you get the sound of the gun that fired it, bang, bang. And it'll sound like two rounds. So, they're going to have to recreate this entire thing using visual to inform the audio.",

So, nobody would be blocked.So, I'm not convinced necessarily that those were the only two counter snipers that were at the location. It could be. But if that was the case, then I want to ask questions about that. Then you get to the immediate protection around the president. If you listen to them discussing, what you're hearing is a finally tuned cadence of instructions, of questions to each other, of orders and of queries, you know, do we have this? What's going on? Let's move. This kind of things. It's obviously so well trained that it's ingrained in them. And keep in mind, the former president of the United States has just been shot.

That would concern me.And again, like we said last hour, they have to be right every time. And the bad guys only have to be lucky one time.

It sounded like it was coming from behind the bleachers and the man in the bleachers, kind of to the right of me, in the bleachers took a gunshot wound to the head who was killed and another woman -- like I don't know exactly where she was on the bleacher.

I saw Donald Trump get hit. It looked like he had -- you know, he was either -- I was running my camera at the time, but it looked like he was just turning to the -- he was turning his head to the side and it looked like he got grazed in the right ear with a bullet.

It was just complete pandemonium, like every -- you know, there was a bit of a delay, like there was a lot of confusion, but immediately, you know, it seemed like more gunfire erupted. I couldn't figure out where that was coming from. And then, you know, there was a state policeman there, I believe a SWAT team, you know, showed up relatively quickly. They jumped to the side. There was a fence, you know, it was next to the bleachers. They jumped the bleachers and started clearing the bleachers.

And you know, the people were close to the people that got injured and killed. You obviously know it wasn't a joke and it was -- it seemed like there was a push pull on the crowd.

It just seemed to me, like I said, I was sitting there, it seemed like the rounds came from behind, and they got this -- they hit the gentleman in the head. You know, he got a gunshot wound to the head, and the other lady was injured, and then I saw Trump -- President Trump, you know, get hit and it looked like I was right here.

Joining me now for a view of history, Tim Naftali, CNN's presidential historian, former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. Tim, it's a sad day. It's a sad day, in part because this kind of violence is so familiar in this country. I mean, going back to Lincoln, but more recently as well. And I don't have to tell you this because you've studied it for years.You know, we often think of this moment in this country as unique, and the divisions are so vitriolic. But a lot of folks making references to the year 1968. I mean, the sad fact there is there is historical precedent for this in this country. TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, NIXON PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND SENIOR RESEARCH SCHOLAR, COLUMBIA'S SIPA: Our politics have the potential of being violent. We have seen violence like this before in presidential elections. You mentioned RFK, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination was struck down. 1972, George Wallace, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, he wasn't killed, but he was paralyzed for life. 1912, the last time that a former president ran for office, Theodore Roosevelt was hit by a bullet. It did not penetrate his heart. It was actually stopped by his eyeglass case and his speech. And indeed, he continued his speech. He finished it. He said it takes more than that to kill a bull moose. That gave a name to his party, it became the Bull Moose Party. Violence is not new to our politics. What we need -- and the gentleman that you just -- that was just interviewed mentioned it, we need to have this stop. We need, as Americans, to remember that in the end we are part of one country. And when we create -- when we spread hatred, when we spread poison, when we demonize those who do not agree with us politically, we are laying the ground for the kind of violence that sadly reappears every so often in American politics. So, sadly, there's nothing new to this. But yet, again, we have a chance as Americans to prevent it from happening again.",

That's the critical incident response group will be driving up with their vehicles and equipment from Quantico.The FBI's evidence response team will be doing a grid search over that entire area where the rally was and outside the rally. That means elements of the SERG Group, including BAU-1, the behavioral profilers, will be involved. Significant parts of the Counterterrorism Division and the Joint Terrorism Task Force will join the Criminal Division. Why the FBI and not the Secret Service? Because that's actually normal. The Secret Service's job is to protect their protectee, in this case the former president, stop any assassination attempt, take out the potential assassin. But after that happens, they are part and parcel. But the FBI is going to be operating under the federal law that makes it a federal crime to attempt to assault or kill a federal officer or a former president of the United States or any official under the protection of the Secret Service. And that means figuring out who is he. Right now, Anderson, and I've been talking to sources all over the government, we're not certain that they are certain that they have the identity of the gunman. I know they're trying to confirm that. Secondly, they're going to need to know, where is he from? Is he local, or did he travel far and wide to get here for this event? And then, they're going to want to know, is he a left-wing, violent extremist? Is he an accelerationist? Or is he, and this is not out of the question, one of these people who are just hearing his own voices in his head? At what point, we may learn the motive is something that just makes no sense to us.
