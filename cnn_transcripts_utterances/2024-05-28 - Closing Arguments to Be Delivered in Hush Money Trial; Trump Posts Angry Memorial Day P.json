It's wonderful to have you with us. Twelve jurors soon to decide whether a former U.S. president is a criminal. Closing arguments are set to begin this morning in Donald Trump's hush money trial. The jury could get the case by tomorrow after hearing instructions from the judge. CNN has learned that Trump's lawyers intend to focus once again on the credibility of Michael Cohen, who is the only witness whose testimony directly links the former president to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, and of course, to the alleged cover- up. Trump, as we've come to expect, trying to insist the whole proceeding is unfair, posting this, quote, \"WHY IS THE CORPORATE [SIC] GOVERNMENT ALLOWED TO MAKE THE FINAL ARGUMENT IN THE CASE AGAINST ME? WHY CAN'T THE DEFENSE GO LAST. BIG ADVANTAGE, VERY UNFAIR, WITCH HUNT! DJT.\" One of Trump's lawyers from his civil case attacking the judge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
