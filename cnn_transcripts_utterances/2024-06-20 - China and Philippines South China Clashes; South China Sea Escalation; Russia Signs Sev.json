There are clashes in the South China Sea. The Philippines say the Chinese Coast Guard has launched a brutal assault using bladed weapons on their soldiers. Millions of people around the world are struggling under extreme heat waves and flooding as a new report shows we're burning more fossil fuels than ever before. New York has become the first U.S. state to restrict the use of addictive algorithms on children's social media. And a potential energy explosion. Companies in Iceland are trying to harness the power of volcanoes, providing clean energy for millions. That and a great deal more as we continue. We begin in the South China Sea where escalating tensions between the Philippines and China are threatening to drag the United States into another conflict. Beijing and Manila are blaming each other for a violent clash this week off the heavily contested Spratly Islands. Manila claims China's Coast Guard was responsible for a brutal assault with bladed weapons. What happens in the South China Sea has profound implications for the United States, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, which it's had since the 1950s. CNN's Ivan Watson reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A high seas confrontation that could ignite a war. In the middle is a boat belonging to U.S. ally, the Philippines, sandwiched by the China Coast Guard in the heavily contested South China Sea on Monday. Footage released by the Armed Forces of the Philippines shows its uniformed sailors attempting to fight back, some Chinese Coast Guard personnel armed with axes and knives. But Beijing says the Philippines started it. LIN JIAN, CHINA MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (through translator):  Law enforcement measures taken by the China Coast Guard at the site were professional and restrained. WATSON (voice-over):  China says it seized guns and ammunition from the Philippines ship, which was enroute to the Second Thomas Shoal. It is in Manila's exclusive economic zone, but Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea for itself. In March, I was on board a Philippine Coast Guard ship on one of these routine trips. Chinese Coast Guard ships swarmed the Philippine ship.",

And we talk about it being a dispute over the islands. But honestly speaking, it's a dispute over the maritime rights. The South China Sea, which is the size of half the continental United States is home to a vast amount of trade in which these countries rely on as well as fishery, in which a lot of Southeast Asian countries rely on. China wants to control these waterways. And if they did, they would basically be able to hold hostage most countries in the region economically and have a huge impact on the rest of the world.

They build this argument based on interpretations of what they think internal waters are, which are kind of like rivers in other countries, waters that countries are not allowed to sail in. The Chinese have said that waters between islands are internal waters. They claim that territorial seas have to be measured from the outskirts of those islands versus just individual islands themselves. Anyway, they use all these arguments to basically build this position that other countries have to ask them permission to sail in water -- international waters, as well as the exclusive economic zones of other countries in the region. And obviously, giving Beijing that level of control is something that countries don't feel comfortable with. It does hurt stability in the region and hurts the security of Asian countries.",

The United States has issued several statements saying that the defense treaty could possibly be called into play. But the Chinese military is not really ready to project power across those distances yet. And so, in my mind, they do believe that there is a ceiling in terms of how much this could escalate.

Geothermal power plants, feeding off the heat, providing emission- free energy in abundance and leading companies from around the world to move energy-intensive manufacturing, like aluminum production, to Iceland. Our team traveled all the way to the northeast of Iceland to the Krafla Geothermal Plant. When drilling a new bore hole here at Krafla, they accidentally hit a shallow magma chamber and now are working on harnessing the Earth's energy almost directly from the extremely hot magma. The project's director says this technology could provide clean energy for hundreds of millions of people.",

Four-time World Cup winners and defendingEuropean champions Italy taking on three-time European champs Spain. Between them, they've won three of the last four Euros. And it would be Spain who would strike first, albeit courtesy of a little luck. Italy's Riccardo Calafiori can't get his legs out of the way, sending the ball into the back of his own net. LaRoya had a chance to double their lead when Nico Williams almost found the back of the net with his beautiful solo effort, but it's denied by the woodwork. And that is how it would end. One- nil Spain on the night. So, with one game remaining Spain, the second team to book their spot in the round of 16 after host Germany, Italy in second, and they'll want to book their spot against Croatia on Monday. Spain's final group game against Albania. It's all still to play for in Group B. In group C, England were hoping to win their first two games in a European championship for the first time ever, and it looked like it might just happen. Facing Denmark, England Captain Harry Kane striking first. No European player has scored more goals in the last four major international tournaments than that man. But then, Danish delight. Watch this laser for about 30 yards out. Morten Hjulmand ripping it through the England defense. That leveled it up at one. And that's how it would end. England on top of the group, three lions' fans certain to be less than thrilled with the result, but Canaan Crew, they'll take it.",

There's no doubt about it. He's going to turn 37 next week. He has indicated, in a roundabout way, that this will be his last international tournament because he said in an interview in China last year that he will not be playing in another World Cup. He said Qatar was his last. So, this could be his last dance. And that is why there is going to be so much excitement and why the tickets for these games are going to be at such a premium because we could be looking at Messi's last five or six games for his country.
