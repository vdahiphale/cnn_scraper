He said that the U.S. was given a heads up by Israeli military officials prior to the strike. He noted that the strike struck purely military targets in Iran.And he ended by saying, and I'm quoting here, \"My hope is that this is the end,\" indicating the U.S. President. Hopes that this is the end of this cycle we've seen in recent days and weeks between Israel and Iran of attack and retaliation followed by retaliation. We should note that Iran is describing the strikes overnight the damage from them as limited. It says two of its soldiers were killed. It does say that it reserves the right to respond saying it is entitled to defend itself and called Israel strikes a violation of international law. Israel, unusually commenting on military action inside Iran, whereas in the past, it has refused to comment, says that it struck purely military targets, that this operation is now over and they call it a success. It also described the strikes as precise in nature. I'm joined now here in Jerusalem by Matthew Chance. Matthew, this is something that has been an enormous amount of anticipation inside this country and around the region. When Israel would strike, how far it would go when it struck in retaliation? How are these operations, these attacks being received here in Israel tonight?",

They didn't restore the deterrence that Israel needs with Iran.And there's been others that are like, well, this is great. You know, military logic has prevailed. It means that Israel has retaliated without dragging the country into an all-out war with Iran. Look, I mean, the fact that Israel focused narrowly on military targets, perhaps under U.S. pressure, because the Biden administration wanted to rein them back from the brink, and they didn't expand to hit nuclear facilities, energy infrastructure facilities, you know, it could be interpreted as a good sign that, you know, this may be an end to the current round of tit for tat, you know, strikes between these two countries.

And there was an enormous amount of trepidation I think we could safely say inside the administration about any potential effect on the upcoming election from a widening war -- widening even further than it's already of course widen in this region. And this attack seems to be smaller than some expected.Arlette Saenz at the White House, thanks so much. I want to bring in now Trita Parsi, Middle East expert with the Quincy group for his -- Quincy Institute for his thoughts. Trita, good to have you on again. I wonder given the anticipation of this strike sense that massive Iranian missile barrage some three weeks ago, and I was here along with my team to witness that. In terms of the scale from perhaps one end of the scale potential Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities or energy facilities this far short of that. Do you consider this a significant strike? Or in your view, is it less than many expected? TRITA PARSI, EXEC. VICE PRESIDENT, QUINCY INSTITUTE FOR RESPONSIBLE STATECRAFT: Well, I think in many ways it's both. On the one hand, it is quite significant for the Israelis to have more than 100 airplanes. Most of them probably entering Iranian airspace and targeting 20 different sites, which goes way beyond what the Iranians did. You also have at least four casualties, and according to the Israelis, there were zero casualties with the Iranian strikes. In that sense, it is significant. But it is also at the same time, much smaller than many had anticipated, particularly mindful of the rhetoric on the Israeli side in which one former prime minister said that after the Iranian attack, Israel had the best opportunity in 50 years to enlarge the war and take on what they believe is their core enemy in the region. And I think it begs the question as to why this ended up being smaller. And I think it has partly to do with a couple of things. One is the Iranians did show that despite the fact that they clearly are the weaker party here, they can still inflict significant damage on Israel and its air defenses are not sufficient to be able to handle the hypersonic missiles that rained down on Israel while you were there, Jim. On the other hand, I think the Israelis are also a little bit spooked by the leak from the Pentagon that reveals some of their earlier plans, and I think interpreted that the U.S. is not going to be fully behind Israel if Israel goes on for a full scale escalation.",

From Iran's perspective, it's been notable today to watch the coverage of this strike in Israel -- in Iranian state media downplaying it.In fact, the morning newscasts were talking more it seemed about commuter traffic than they were about a massive Israeli airstrike on the country overnight.

Back then as well, they were downplaying it immediately, in fact, almost mocking it. And we've seen that pattern be repeated here, which I think is a clear indication.They don't want this escalation. They know that they're not going to be in the best position to fight a direct war with Israel. But the question is, why does this then keep on escalating despite of the fact that the Iranians are toning down these attacks. They don't want to take any action at this point. And I think it comes down to the fact that as long as there is a continued warfare and slaughter in Gaza and now in Lebanon, this is just going to be the end of another phase of exchange of fire between Israel and Iran. If we truly want to deescalate the situation, we need to have a cease fire in Gaza and Lebanon. Otherwise, unfortunately, it will continue to spill over into other arenas.

He had said that he was his preferred candidate over the summer, which actually received a lot of sharp criticism from Donald Trump in response to that. But then it seems that Joe had made up.

You know, everything sort of went up in a sort of a big mess, starting in April. Because, remember, Israel attacked in -- in -- in Damascus and killed some IRGC Iranians, some Hezbollah types there. Then Iran did the first of its big and first ever missile attack on Israel, which was completely protected and defended by Israel itself and by its allies, the United States and others. Then you had the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas, and that was by Israel, although it hasn't admitted it. And then the killing of -- of -- of -- of Iran's major ally, Hezbollah's chief, Nasrallah. And after that, Iran did a retaliation. So this has been attack, retaliation, attack retaliation. And the objective is to draw a line under it. No side wants a major war. Iran certainly doesn't want a major war because it won't be able to win a major war against Israel or the United States. And also, they're really interested in regime survival most of all.",

So they've been working very hard.And as you know, because you're there, the State Department, Secretary of State was there this week. He went on to Qatar. He was speaking to the Jordanian and the UAE foreign ministers here in Europe. And so it's designed to manage the Iran piece of this, which has happened now overnight, we'll see if there's any response. But also to get a ceasefire in Lebanon, because the Americans seem to believe, and they've been signaling publicly that Israel has essentially achieve a lot of its goal by decapitating the leadership of -- of Hezbollah and also disrupting its weapons and ammunition supplies in southern Lebanon. So there, they have to get a ceasefire, empower the Lebanese government, empower the Lebanese army, so that it's not beholden to the Hezbollah militia, and maybe, maybe get some kind of international peace force in there, maybe not U.N. but international to -- to monitor that border there between Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon. So that's for that. And then, of course, the huge, huge unfinished business, as you said, is Gaza, where scores and scores of people are still being killed, even after Yahya Sinwar was assa -- was killed there. So that also is part of what Antony Blinken was doing in the region, trying to restart these ceasefires. And as you know, there's going to be a meeting, I believe, with Israel's participation, and Bill Burns, the CIA, and -- and the, you know, the responsible interlocutors for the parties, and that's apparently meant to start on Monday.",
