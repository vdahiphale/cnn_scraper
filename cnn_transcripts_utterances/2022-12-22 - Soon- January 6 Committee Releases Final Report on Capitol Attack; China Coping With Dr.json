Thank you.So new numbers just out this morning offer some good news but still raising more questions about what this all really means for the overall economy. GDP and weekly jobless claims data showing that the Fed's fight against inflation might have so far only have had a limited impact. Let's get some perspective on this. Matt Egan's looking through it all. He joins us here. Matt, let's start with the GDP. What do we see?",

But here we are at the end of the year and by all accounts, this economy is still standing.And let's look at the GDP report from this morning. It shows that the economy actually grew faster than we realized this summer, Q3 GDP, 3.2 percent. That's pretty solid. That is a significant upward revision from the original estimate of 2.6 percent, and it shows that this economy has bounced back after back-to-back quarters of negative growth to start the year. Now, let's talk about jobs because you know, you and I have spoken about layoffs, big-time layoffs in tech and in media. But jobless claims are still really low. These new numbers out this morning show that initial claims, they only rose slightly last week staying around a two-month low. They're almost exactly where they were a year ago. This shows that businesses are reluctant to let go of the workers they have which makes sense because there is a worker shortage right now.",

It is a sign that hiring has slowed down which is backed up by the Monthly Jobs reports.I think at the end of the day, you know, this economy clearly faces some significant risks for next year, right? Inflation is still way too high. The Fed is not done yet. And some economists, they do fear a recession might be on the web.

Neither Citigroup nor Goldman Sachs have any records of his employment.Santos listed on his 2022 financial disclosure, a salary of $750,000 and claimed he made the same amount last year. Income he says he earned from the Devolder organization, which he says is his family's firm, a search showed the firm was registered in Florida last year. The state temporarily deemed it inactive for failure to file required annual reports. CNN found Santos filed the required report Tuesday. Santos's attorney said Santos represents the kind of progress that the left is so threatened by, a gay Latino immigrant and Republican who won a Biden district in overwhelming fashion.

Hospitals here are coming under pressure. Fever and cold medicine is running out. The local versions of Tylenol and Advil are nearly impossible to get at drugstores. Some local governments are resorting to rationing the amount of medicine for sale down to the exact number of pills in some cases. One city in eastern China, it says customers can only buy six pills per day.But even as COVID is sweeping through the country, China has only reported less than 10 total COVID deaths for this entire month. And what we're seeing on the ground, it tells a very different story. I visited a crowded crematorium in Beijing this week, and from the video, you can see the long line of cars waiting to get into the cremation area. The parking lot was also completely full. Several people there told me their loved ones had died from COVID and an employee said they'd been swamped with work. I saw these metal containers full of yellow body bags and workers loading more coffins in. A new study by Hong Kong researchers estimates nearly 1 million people in China could die from COVID if the country doesn't take necessary public health measures like increased vaccinations. The vaccination rate is still lagging for people over 60 and only around 42 percent of those over 80 have received a booster shot. And experts say that getting that third dose is necessary for enough protection since China is using less effective vaccines compared to the mRNA ones used overseas. And as these crematoriums fill up, the Chinese government now saying it is narrowing the definition of COVID deaths to only include those who died of respiratory failure directly caused by the virus. That means those who died because of another underlying condition will not be counted as a COVID death, even if they were sick with COVID at the time. This goes against the World Health Organization's guidelines, and the WHO says it will severely underestimate the true death toll of COVID in China, Kate.",
