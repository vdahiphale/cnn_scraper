What -- what law enforcement and emergency managers aim for is what we would call safer or less bad, which is essentially you have enough resources, enough police officers, enough hospital capacity that if something were to happen, you can minimize the harm.In that standard, things looked pretty good yesterday. I mean, you had a lot of people wounded by gun, buy a gun -- shots. I think over 20 now, but only one fatality. There was a lot of other harms that could have occurred, including what we worry about in mega event planning, which is crowd crushing. So you have a lot of things that went right but what went wrong is a society in which we have guns as a means of expressing violence. Whether this was a fight that got out of hand, whether it was targeted at parade-goers, we don't know and therefore, the kind of impact that you saw yesterday, which is a global impact. Everyone is watching this, right? This isn't just about one city. It's about what people think of American cities. HUNT:  Right. And everyone's going to look at them go, oh wow, that moment of celebration, that great.

One, I thought it was interesting that word shame that President Biden use the sense that we -- you know, whatever your political beliefs are about guns. This -- this is just a shameful activity, right? Is that -- it's something that one cannot justify. And I think one of the things that we can look at is maybe we cant change national laws, maybe that can get through, but a state like, you know -- I mean, every state has the capacity to tighten its gun laws.And we know, right, Missouri has by far -- I mean, I think it's sort of maybe the worst between 45 and 50 states in terms of its permissiveness and not only allows open carry, almost, you know, you can get a gun without registering it. But it prohibits in many instances, localities say a city like Kansas City from trying to create stiffer drunk gun laws for its own residents. And so I think one of the things that we can look at is whether there are fuller state rules that the Supreme Courts still allows it. You could tighten the restrictions in terms of place, age of purchase, type of guns purchase. Those are still allowable one of the things I wanted just note is we talk about gun deaths, right? Which we should, that those are the most important thing. So we have 20 people with gun wounds, we have a million people, some percentage of them traumatized by this. The -- what we call the social impact of gun violence is immeasurable and its not just those who are harmed and traumatized, the city itself, you heard the mayor say this, right? Like this isn't us. Well, unfortunately, it's all of us, right? It's the economic impact, it's the reputational impact on a city that had every right to have a good time yesterday and then wasn't allowed to.",

It apparently suggests that the Russian military is working to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space.And when he put out this warning, it's sparked a frenzy yesterday among lawmakers. Some of them saying that the information so serious that they want President Biden to declassify it and make it available to the public. Although there are many senior members of Congress who insist there's no immediate threat to the U.S. or to its interests. Juliette, this was a very dramatic situation that unfolded yesterday.

And we've also been hearing from Lloyd Austin, the American defense secretary, not actually physically here because he's still recovering, Kasie, but he did speak to his counterparts by video conference reasserting Americans determination to continue supporting Ukraine.

He says he would prefer Biden or he claims publicly he would prefer Biden to Donald Trump. He called Biden a politician of the old school. Of course, conversation here in the U.S. lately has been about Biden's age, which I can't help but hear a reference in there to it.

So your commute, not impacted by snowy weather. You have to travel north of I-96 to really see. That little clipper is going to race through the Great Lakes, eventually impacts northern New England, maybe bring some light snow showers from New York to Boston, but we're not going to accumulate very much. We have winter weather advisories in place across area, Upstate New York, and into Vermont, New Hampshire, some winter storm warnings. Here's a storm system that will impact Kasie and the nation's capital. This is Friday night into Saturday morning, another weak disturbance. It'll bring another one to three inches of snowfall to that area. Higher elevations will see if more snowfall as one would expect. This is the forecast rain and snow accumulate accumulations right through Saturday morning. But the West Coast, this is where its really becoming active because we have yet another atmospheric river that will settle in through the weekend. And once again for the day on Sunday. Here it is impacting the central and north coast, eventually moving to the south coast as we head into Sunday, the chance of rain exists from San Francisco, all the way to Los Angeles and plenty of mountain snow as well, making skiers and snowboarders happy.
