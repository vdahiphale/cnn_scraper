Helloeveryone, I'm Zain Asher in New York, and this is ONE WORLD. The U.N. Aid Chief says the extent of the unfolding disaster in Libya is still unclear. Days after catastrophic flooding in the east smashed buildings and swept entire neighborhoods out to sea, witnesses say the Libyan city of Dona resembles a war zone. Thousands of people were killed when two dams burst during a torrential rainstorm. Just take a look at a fraction. This is just a fraction of the damage that's been left behind. Some 10,000 people are still reported missing. Beyond the staggering numbers, volunteers say they're overwhelmed by the scale of human disaster in Derna, where aid is slowly beginning to arrive. I want you to listen now to what the U.N. Aid Chief is saying about the crisis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N.

And it really feels like you're walking through a war zone. Like massive bombs had gone off here. And this is what people here would tell you. You know, you've got several cities along the Libyan coast that were impacted by storm Daniel, by the flooding over the weekend, but nothing like this, what people are describing here as this catastrophe. What happened in Derna, of course, as you know, is those two dams that burst and you have the flood waters that swept through the whole of the city, washing out entire buildings, neighborhoods, homes, infrastructure, families, and brought it all down here to the sea, to the Mediterranean. I mean, this is just -- it's very difficult for us to really move the camera around because of the communication issues -- the communications were disrupted in the city. But looking into the sea, what we see here is people's lives in there. You see homes, you see door frames, windows, furniture, clothes, cars, everything.

But the prosecution did get that Rubiales cannot contact Hermoso in any way during this investigation. The judge also denied a request from Hermoso's lawyer that the court protectively embargo the assets of Rubiales. That was scotched. Now, Rubiales and his lawyer came down this street going into the courthouse a little before mid-day hearing. They said nothing on the way in, and after the hour-long hearing, they said nothing on the way out. But the prosecutor, in a statement, said that, in the courtroom, Rubiales denied the charges of sexual assault and coercion and answered the questions from the judge, the prosecutor, and Hermoso's lawyer. Hermoso's lawyer did speak to the media outside the court, saying that the whole world basically saw that this was a non-consensual kiss. And that's what the legal team would try to show. This kiss came after Spain about four weeks ago on a Sunday, won its first ever Women's World Cup, beating England in Sydney, Australia. The game was televised. This was the awards ceremony right after. So, people -- a lot of people saw that kiss. This case has been seen as really a changing Spain, as old attitudes, as they're described about sexual relations, are matching up or butting up against a younger generation that want gender equality. Now, the judges -- the judge at the national court here will now have to investigate and see what really happened. He's looking at video. He'll be checking with Australian authorities to see what's in their legislation. This court is not unaccustomed to doing these kinds of difficult investigations, money laundering, organized crime.

But a large number of the women players on the winning team have said they do not think there have been enough changes at the federation with the ouster of Rubiales and the coach -- with Rubiales, I' sorry, his resignation five days ago after he said he would not resign and the ouster of the coach. They said there haven't been enough changes. So, the federation has postponed that announcement of who will be representing Spain in a game that's supposed to be next Friday against Sweden, which is still considered the top team in the world. So, it is an issue that's ongoing right this moment, and it's not worked out. The players are trying to take a stance.

All right, Kenya's President is in San Francisco to meet with top tech executives and enhance trade relations with the U.S. William Ruto's visit comes as Kenya's fuel prices hit a record high as he marks his first year in office. Fuel prices jumped as much as 20 percent overnight, sparking absolute outrage in Kenya. President Ruto was elected partly on his appeal to, you know, to appeal, rather, to poorer Kenyans, branding himself as a leader who understood their challenges. CNN's Larry Madowo joins us in Nairobi. Now, I mean, this is interesting. You know, this is the guy you and I have talked about this, Larry. He branded himself as the \"hustler-in-chief\". His whole messaging was like, look, I'm just like you, you know, I'm just like you. I'm for the common man. He appealed to ordinary Kenyans, especially those who are struggling financially. And then he comes into office. And one of the first things he does, albeit, you know, because the economy was struggling, is raising taxes. And that's meant that ordinary Kenyans have struggled to pay for basic goods. Just walk us through how the perception around President Ruto has changed over the past 12 months.",

But as soon as he came into office, he removed the fuel subsidy, which saw an immediate increase in fuel prices. And that obviously has an effect on the cost of other basic commodities. And after that, as the shilling has continued to weaken, the cost of living has increased in the country. On top of that, President Ruto's government has introduced new taxes and levies like the housing levy, which is very unpopular.

Then on Monday, an intense storm and flooding in Libya burst two dams that nearly wiped out the city of Derna. Doctors Without Borders says at least 5000 people there have lost their lives, with thousands more missing. Morocco and Libya are, of course, both in northern Africa, not too far apart. But their ability to respond to these crises have been very different. Libya has two rival governments. Derna is in the eastern part of the country, and that's run by Commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army. Infrastructure across the country is crumbling, and you've also got the political turmoil, too. International aid has been very slow to arrive, as well. But it is a very different story in Morocco. The main hindrance to helping earthquake victims there has actually been the ability to reach them, because the epicenter of the earthquake was in remote mountain villages.

Yes, there are similarities between the two events in terms of damage and needs, and there are key differences between the two events on how we respond to them as responders and humanitarians and medical teams and so on. And that is what we are balancing now. Libya, largely an urban destruction, tsunami-like with the water and the mud sweeping away 25 percent of a city of 200,000 people. And the water recedes and the mud is being cleared. And now we're dealing with the aftermath of the fear of cholera and so on. And of course, the trauma of the people affected, the psychological trauma that can last a lifetime for both disasters, for people that have lost everything, including loved ones. And the rebuilding. And the reconstruction is always top of mind for people. Immediately what they think, I want a home, I want a roof, I want my home, I want to go back to my home to retrieve my, some of my belongings, to see what survived. That's absolutely natural. And we see that on both fronts. That's a human thing to do. And we have to enable that as responders because that's also about people's dignity and preserving it even in such extreme conditions. With Libya's conflict, which you have alluded to, of course, is a factor. Aid is beginning to come in. In our Red Cross, Red Crescent family at the International Federation, many Red Crosses and Red Crescents from around the world are approaching us now with support. We have launched a $10 million assistance, emergency assistance package for Libya, an appeal, and we've released a million dollars for them to respond, and many others are doing. So, flights are beginning to come in. Access will get better every day. Contrast that to Morocco where you have constant aftershocks, three today. And that tends to stop everything, also reshape the land. Roads that may have been cleared yesterday are no longer clear today. And you're always in that race against time.

They're realizing, and that's why they're using the brutality, the violence, and they have a monopoly on violence, on force, on guns, on arms, and they've used it very brutally because they realized that they're dealing with a serious legitimacy crisis. A big part of the population, the youth, doesn't want them and how they're doing things. But I don't think it's gotten to the level of an existential crisis, meaning threatening their existence that they're imminently about to fall. So, I want to be careful when we call it -- when I call it a cultural revolution. I think it's massive, the way women have pushed them back, throwing their hijab in the bonfire. We've heard even from religious women, hijabi women saying, I choose to wear this, but don't force it on my sister, don't force it on my daughter, on my granddaughter. I think it's a big cultural and social transformation that we shouldn't undermine. But at the same time, I think there was some illusions that this is the beginning of an end and it's imminent, that I honestly didn't see from the beginning. But nevertheless, I think if the authorities, if the state is not hearing this voice, this cry, this women putting their lives, their bodies on the line, this will eventually be the beginning of an end, but maybe further down the road.
