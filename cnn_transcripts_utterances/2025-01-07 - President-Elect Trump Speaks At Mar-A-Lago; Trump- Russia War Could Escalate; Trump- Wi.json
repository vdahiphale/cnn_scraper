And that's always been and nobody knows more about NATO than I. You know, years ago, when I first started this, I didn't know too much about NATO, but I got it right anyway. I said, they're taking advantage. I'm the one that got and the secretary general was here, as you know, two weeks ago, saying that if it weren't for me, NATO wouldn't even exist right now because I raised from countries that weren't paying their bills. At that time, 28 countries, 20 of them were not paying their bills, 21 to be exact. They weren't paying and -- or they were paying a very small portion. And I raised over $680 billion. That was the number he gave by saying, if you don't pay, we're not going to protect you. And as soon as I said that, the money came pouring in. But Obama could have said it. Other people could have said it. Bush could have said it. Nobody said it but me. I took a lot of heat. They said, oh, that's a threatening statement. Well, they weren't paying their bills. I said, we're not going to protect if you're not paying the bills. So, in a true sense, I saved NATO, but NATO's taking advantage of us. And one of the problems that I have, and I've said it openly, I said it to President Zelenskyy, Europe is in for a tiny fraction of the money that we're in. Now, whether you like that situation or not, Europe is much more effective than the United States. We have a thing called the ocean in between us, right? Why are we in for billions and billions of dollars more money than Europe? And, you know, they're a similar size, a little smaller, but they're a similar size economy as the United States when you add them up. And yet, Europe is in for a small fraction of the number of the United States is it. Now, Biden could have called them up during the term. That's what I did. I said, you have to pay your bills. And they all -- one stood up. I won't say who. You'll probably have it. Because the papers should be -- media hated to report on it. But a prime minister up from a country, you know, a famous meeting of 28 nations with no press, no anybody in the room, he stood up, he says, does that mean if we don't pay our bill, and at that point it was two percent, it should be five percent, it should be five percent, not two percent. But at that point it was two, but many people didn't pay. Some people didn't pay anything. But many people were away, including Germany. Germany was at less than one percent.",

That's why I told Trudeau when he came down, I said, what would happen if we didn't do it? He said Canada would dissolve.

And that was exactly the nature of the last press conference that he held, when he began with the announcement of a $100billion investment from SoftBank, and then we touched on a lot of other subject matters. This is quite similar. Leah, it's interesting because as you see the bottom of our screen in just a few hours, we will be covering the continuation of the state funeral of President Jimmy Carter. And it's hard to find two more different presidents, both in demeanor, both in policy, both in style, both in principles. And he touched on President Carter, said that he really liked him as a person, that he didn't agree with a lot of his policies, didn't think that he was a strong president. And on this issue, in particular, of the Panama Canal, what's noteworthy of President-elect Trump wanting to reclaim the Panama Canal now was that it was actually President Carter who signed the treaty to hand it over to Panama in 1977. I'm just wondering, from your perspective, the president-elect also went as far as to say he thinks that's ultimately what led to his loss to Ronald Reagan, even more so in the president's -- president-elect's opinion than the hostage crisis in Iran.",

Leah Wright Rigueur and Molly Ball, thank you so much for joining me. Well, happening just moments ago, as we mentioned, Judge Aileen Cannon blocked to the public release of Special Counsel Jack Smith's final report on Trump's investigations. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now live from Washington with more on this. Katelyn, we saw the president-elect in real time respond to this news. Walk us through Judge Aileen Cannon's decision.",

That's where Judge Aileen Cannon sits. She had the case. That's the classified documents and obstruction of justice case. Those cases were going to be -- they are dismissed. And the special counsel's office was releasing its final report about how they investigated those cases and made charging decisions in them. Trump was charged and then in Florida, two co-defendants. What happened was the plan was for the final report from the special counsel's office was going to be released no earlier than Friday of this week by the Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was going to get to see it and have it in his possession for a few days. Trump's team ran to court, and Judge Cannon said, no one is sharing this outside of the Justice Department for at least three days. That was her order just now. And there are ongoing appeals where Trump's team is asking an appeals court to block the release of this report. And also his co -- two co-defendants, they don't want the report there -- out there either. Here's what Trump had to say just a little bit ago at that press conference when he was told that Judge Cannon had done this. Remember, she's a Trump appointee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Katelyn Polantz, thank you so much. OK. Let's go back to our panel. We liked them so much the first time. We're going to bring them back now. Molly Bally, Leah Wright Rigueur. Molly, your reaction to, again, I don't know how else to describe this other than how my colleague John Berman did earlier this morning. And the clock and the delay tactic really has been Donald Trump and his legal team's superpower throughout all of these cases. And now, there is a high likelihood that we will not see this final report from Special Counsel Jack Smith. Your reaction?",

Now, he is still supposed to be sentenced in the New York case, although we'll see if that goes forward as well. But, you know, as he prepares to resume the presidency, Trump really looks to have -- looks like he has gotten off scot-free on all of the many legal challenges he was facing. So for his opponents who had hoped that the legal system would offer some measure of accountability for Trump, it certainly looks like that will not be the case. And we heard in his press conference, Trump, of course, very pleased by the fact that he has defeated what he views as a witch-hunt in all of these cases.",
