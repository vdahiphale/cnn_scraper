They say that they do not know what the source or cause of the strike on the school was, but already Egypt and Qatar as well as other Arab countries are already beginning to blame Israel for this.But what is clear is the scenes of absolute devastation that we are seeing in videos from this incident. Bloodied bodies in several rooms on two floors of this school complex, including many women and children among the dead. In one room you can see a dozen bodies covered in dust -- desks smashed, a huge hole in the wall of one of those rooms. And the Israeli military has said that it is aware of the incident but it did not know who was responsible for the strike. And it said as of now that they have no comment. Meanwhile, we see that at the al-Shifa Hospital there are efforts underway to evacuate those 32 premature babies who were in that neonatal unit, were moved to a different wing of the hospital after a generator was struck and power went out to the incubators there. The Israel military, of course, has said that they delivered mobile incubators to that hospital and now it appears that a plan is underway with the World Health Organization to evacuate those babies to a hospital in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, yesterday United Nations workers also visited the al-Shifa Hospital and they described devastating conditions at that hospital calling it a death zone with a mass grave of about 80 bodies at the hospital's entrance. They also said that patients and staff who are still there feared for their safety and were pleading for a way to coordinate an evacuation route out of there. The Israeli military, meanwhile, is continuing its campaign in the northern Gaza Strip. They say that they are conducting clearing operations in northern Gaza to destroy tunnels and other Hamas infrastructure. Last night, I was in Tel Aviv where we had thousands of people rallying for the release of those hostages being held by Hamas. It's not clear whether the pressure that they brought to bear will get the Israeli government to reach a deal with Hamas to secure the release of dozens of hostages in exchange for a multiday pause in fighting. But what is clear is that it at least resulted in the Israeli prime minister agreeing to meet with the families of those hostages. That meeting is set to take place on Monday as we see that negotiations between Israel and Hamas mediated by Qatar are still ongoing.",

Instead, the administration has been pushing for humanitarian pauses so that hostages that are held by Hamas can be released but also so that more humanitarian aid can get into Gaza.But notably two other things the president mentioned in this op-ed included a warning. Two extremists were attacking civilians in the West Bank saying that the United States is prepared to issue visa bans. And the president also calling again for a two-state solution. This is an idea that the president has long endorsed and says is the way forward. Of course, that will remain a steep challenge for the region but the president says in this op-ed -- quote -- \"Our goal should not be simply to stop the war for today. It should be to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself.\" Now, the president also called on Israel to follow humanitarian law and protect innocent civilians. But zooming out here, this was an op- ed that not only touched on Israel but also Ukraine. The president reaffirming the administration's position that it supports both Israel and Ukraine at a critical moment. Now, recall the president has asked Congress for billions in additional funding to support both of these conflicts. And the president making the point again that these conflicts while they are unfolding abroad do affect U.S. national security and it is incumbent on the U.S. to support especially to not cede any ground to Russia and President Putin or to Hamas. So, the president taking those positions again in \"The Washington Post\" in this opinion piece that ran just yesterday and what the administration sees as an inflection point. Amara.",

He says, \"As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire is not peace. To Hamas's members every ceasefire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpiles of rockets, reposition fighters and restart the killing by attacking innocents again.\" This is not conditions based. This is not if they, you know, release hostages or if they shift something, then there can be a ceasefire.

But he is really -- it seems using this op-ed to reach perhaps the Democratic Party, this might be as domestically focused as it is internationally focused. He has seen the polls that young people, especially in his party, hate what they see going on right now in Gaza and don't understand Biden's policy. It seems this is his way to articulate what Hamas is doing, what it has done, and what he thinks is the appropriate reaction to that.But of course, he also recommends a two-state solution which at this point this Israeli government doesn't seem remotely interested in and has declared itself against in the past. But he also talks about wanting to sanction or somehow crack down on extremist Israeli settlers, which is a first. We haven't seen that mentioned before.

If Hamas is now under or amongst these people in the south, we should not only expect that there will be attacks and now these doubly dense places, but it makes sense to follow the history of both the IDF and Hamas in this war.

You hide until you can fight another day.And the Israeli Defense Forces have said that they are going to root out Hamas wherever they are. They are in all of Gaza. And so, expect to see more nightmare situations, including situations like we saw in the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital where it looked like that was an Israeli missile.

It's just in time for the holiday rush this year, gas prices are falling dramatically. The price of a gallon of regular is now down by more than $0.50 just since mid-September, falling to 10-month lows.And if prices stay in your current levels, this would be the cheapest Thanksgiving Day gas price since 2020, when of course COVID prevented many people from traveling. None of this is to say that gas prices are dirt cheap. They're not. If you look back to 2019, the national average then on Thanksgiving Day was $2. 59 a gallon. Still though, this is good news for consumers. And it is possible the prices go even lower in the coming days. GasBuddy expects the national average will drop to $3.25 a gallon or lower by Thanksgiving Day. And that is well below last year's level of $3.57. And this would translate to American spending $1.2 billion less on fuel this Thanksgiving week. And it's not because people are driving less. AAA projects just over 49 million Americans are going to hit the road this Thanksgiving. That is up almost two percent from last year. So, why is it getting cheaper to fill up? Mostly it's because oil prices have been in a deep slump driven by concerns about oversupply and about weak demand, especially in China. No matter the reason, there are now 10 states where drivers are being greeted by sub $3.00 gas including Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina. And GasBuddy says there is a growing chance that the national average will go below $3.00 a gallon by the end of the year. That, of course, would be something to celebrate. Victor and Amara?",

And unfortunately, we are likely going to have some travel delays both in the air and on the roads over the next several days as this system right here focused across the central U.S. begins to progress eastward. Today, we've already got some showers and even thunderstorms across the U.S. Snow is falling across portions of the Mountain West.But this whole system is going to progress eastward, so you've got rain that eventually make it towards Chicago, Saint Louis, down through Memphis, and even the potential for some severe thunderstorms on the South side once we get to Monday. That low pressure system deepens. It intensifies. So, now you're looking at the potential for damaging winds, tornadoes for areas like Shreveport, Dallas stretching down towards Orleans. Then once we get to later Monday, that low begins to continue eastward. Cincinnati, down to Atlanta, over towards Washington, D.C. and New York by the time we get to Tuesday. So, Tuesday likely to be a bit of a hot mess, especially if you've got any connections say in some of those cities like New York, D.C., or Atlanta. Once we get to Wednesday morning, the focus now becomes all up and down the East Coast, especially cities like Boston and New York likely going to have some travel delays there. So, push it forward to tomorrow, the big concern cities, they're going to be Denver, Chicago stretching down towards Saint Louis. By the time we get to Tuesday, still looking at especially the morning hours for Chicago and Saint Louis, but now you start to see some of those air concerns traveling East. So, New York, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, even stretching down into New Orleans for a lot of these areas because again, this system is going to continue to progress eastward. By Wednesday morning, as the system is finally starting to push farther out to the east, we still have some concerns along the East Coast. Tuesday, by the evening, you're still looking at New York and Washington, D.C. But by the time we get to Wednesday morning, it's starting to wrap up. Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., all the way down through Atlanta. So, again, as you pack those bags, Victor and Amara, maybe pack a little bit of patience to go with it. And remember, yes, maybe you paid a little bit less for the gas if you end up getting stuck behind the wheel.",

And Max adds another jewel to his crown, overcoming the penalty on the very first turn of the race. The Dutchman holding court for most of the night, taking the checkered flag by a comfortable margin, and getting his 18 champagne shower of the campaign. All right, a massive day in college football. Number three Michigan at Maryland again without coach Jim Harbaugh second straight game because of the team science stealing scandal. The Terps had him on the ropes. They're rallying from 20 down and they had a chance to take the lead. But Josaiah Stewart comes up huge, forcing the Wolverines' second safety of the day, sealing a 31-24 win.

Star quarterback Jordan Travis in his final game at Doak Walker Stadium suffering a devastating injury after being tackled in the first quarter. Emotional scenes, people gathering around him. His leg was placed in an air cast before he was carted off the field. No updates have been given on his injury. Travis is a team leader, one of the best quarterbacks in the country, helping lead the Noles to a perfect 11 and 0 this season. The number five Washington Huskies pull off another nail-biter, this time at number 11 Oregon State. Michael Penix bolstering his Heisman resume with three touchdowns in a 22 to 20 win, staying at perfect 11- 0. Each of their last seven wins have come by 10 points or fewer. Next up, the Apple Cup rivalry game with Washington State, then the PAC 12 championship game in two weeks. Finally, the cutest thing you'll see all day, BYU receiver Talmage Gunther creating life-long memories on senior day where players typically have their parent with them. But Gunther celebrates by running out with his 3-year-old son Drew before facing Oklahoma. Once- in-a-lifetime moment. He and his wife actually have two sons. And they used to have to work full-time early on in their college career to put themselves through school. And there he was celebrating a great moment on his last day on that field.",
