Israel's security cabinet met on Thursday but did not reach a decision on retaliation. The U.S. has been talking with Israel about its plans to respond. U.S. President Joe Biden says the response should be proportional. Iran is said to be bracing for that retaliation. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us now live from Tehran. And Fred, what are people that you're speaking to saying about these presumed imminent retaliatory strikes?",
