Magnitude 5.1 earthquake has shaken Southern California. The epicenter was in between Santa Barbara and Ventura, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Right now in the southwest the main concern, though, is Tropical Storm Hilary, which will cross into Southern California we're told by forecasters within the next couple of hours. Some areas will see a year's worth of rain, according to those forecasters, in just a day or two. Flash flood warnings are up across the region. Deteriorating conditions are affecting the roads. We've been showing you this image. This tells the story for a big chunk of this area and the skies we should note at this hour. Hilary has contributed to more than 1,000 canceled flights at this point. 4,000 delays. But the worst is likely to come. And this is what Hilary unleashed on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula. One person in this coastal town died when their vehicle was swept away. And weather forecasters are warning those on the path of this storm to be prepared for catastrophic and life-threatening floods. The warning that blankets much of Southern California today is this. Stay off the roads if you can. A small mudslide temporarily shut down a lane of the 14th Freeway just north of Los Angeles, and crews were able to quickly clear that away. CNN's Stephanie Elam is in Palm Springs, California, for us where officials took the precaution of closing some roads hours ago. Stephanie, what's the latest? How do things look where you are? It looks like a little flooding on that road behind you.",

We've been out here pretty much all day. And I can tell you we drove down this, it was fine, and then all of a sudden, after that first time I think I was on with you today, Jim, and it was really boring. This is what's happened.And this road is completely flooded out. We've seen a few cars go through here. But, look, I have on -- I had to change shoes because my socks and boots were just so wet. I put on these old-school sandals here just so I could show that this is how deep it is. And you can't tell especially when it's raining how inundated the road is. We know at least one car has been stranded in this water. This is why they're telling people not to do that. Nonetheless we've seen cars coming out here to go flying through this. But it can be very dangerous when you can't see how deep it is. This is part of the issue, washing out the road behind us where we've been standing. That's the road that will lead to Interstate 10. And it is flooded out down there as well. They knew that that was happening, and that's why they barricaded the road off so early. But all in all, they are seeing some issues here in Palm Springs, and the storm is not done. There's still more rain, more wind coming through. The wind has died down now a bit from when I talked to you last time. But it's still very persistent right now. So you're seeing this whole idea of mudslides, of fast-moving water, all of that inundated through parts of Southern California. And we're definitely seeing it right here in Palm Springs.",

This whole area now is under a mandatory evacuation because of the sign over my shoulder here really says it all. This area, prone to mud and debris flows from recent burns. That is so key here as we walk over. We're going to walk very slowly because the wind is coming in rapid bursts here. You can see behind me, some of these burn scars. This is what has fire department officials so concerned. In past years, this whole area was subjected to wildfire. What that means is that will significantly change the landscape here should water start rushing down the mountains, down to the lower areas. And so, you know, officials tell us they are certainly very concerned. I spoke not long ago with the battalion chief of the San Bernardino Fire Department who told us that, look, residents if they get the evacuation order, it's not something that officials are sending out lightly.

Friday is the deadline for them to turn themselves in. Now one co-defendant wants his case thrown out altogether. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is asking that he have all of his charges dismissed against him, arguing that his alleged action should be immune from state prosecution because he was acting in his capacity as a federal official at the time.CNN's Isabel Rosales is live outside the Fulton County Jail where it's going to get very busy in a few days from now.

It has been a week since the indictment came down.Now sources tell CNN that there is a lot of conversations happening here, communication between Trump's team and the DA's office specifically conversations that are going to continue into next week about the conditions to his appearance, and also the logistics of his surrender. We've been hearing from a lot of officials, including the Fulton County sheriff here that Trump and the co-defendants will be treated the same as everybody else. But frankly, that's not possible just due to all of these security precautions that have to be taken here with transporting a former president of the United States. We know that the Secret Service has been here on site over the last couple of weeks, working out with the city of Atlanta and the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.

This idea about well, we're going to treat him like everybody else. That's just not going to happen. You know that by looking at the pictures, the barricades surrounding the courthouse not that long ago. So basically, for Trump and for some of these other folks who are turning themselves in, I mean, it'd be a little different. But they'll come in and they'll have a pretty simple processing, that is get some biographical information, that type of thing, fingerprinting.

In federal court, you know, we saw the defendants move quickly to a judge and have them issue a bond set and all that kind of stuff and being advised of the charges against them. This is different.
