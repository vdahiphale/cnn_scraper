The president responded, we are told by our sources, by being defensive about the polling and told Pelosi he has seen polling that shows that he can, in fact, win. At one point, we're told that Pelosi asked Mike Donilon, the president's senior adviser, to join the call to talk over all of the data.Now, none of our sources would say whether Pelosi in this conversation explicitly told the president that she believes that he needs to leave the race. This would mark the second known conversation between Nancy Pelosi and President Biden since the debate at the end of June. The White House would not comment on the contents of this conversation, as CNN is reporting. They only said that President Biden is the nominee of the party he plans to win. And a Pelosi spokesperson told CNN that the former House speaker has been in California since Friday and that she has not spoken to President Biden since. It is impossible almost to overstate the importance of Nancy Pelosi in the entire conversation that is happening right now about President Biden and his future. She is somebody that has incredible sway within her party and probably has the best pulse of what her colleagues in the House are thinking right now than almost anybody else.

And Dr. Miskovich, I mean, a huge setback again for President Biden, but what does this mean in terms of his health?DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP USA: You know, Fred, in general, when we have a patient that's 81 years old, we, you know, you have to treat everybody differently and assess them as an individual. Dr. O'Connor released the president's general health report back February 28th of this year, which was in the news for other reasons. And I would tell you when I would be talking to a family of someone like him, that I would assess him as being in very good health. That's the first thing. He has suffers from what's called atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat. That's common in approximately 10 percent of men over 80. And he has something called sleep apnea, which causes him to wake up at night with lower oxygen. So he wears a CPAP device. And then he has some high cholesterol, some stomach acid reflux, and we all know about his arthritis and stiffness. And, you know, at 81, those aren't really major issues that put you at any type of significant risk for COVID. So that's my overall assessment right now is he's not at significant risk. And the other good news is they immediately put him on Paxlovid, which really works.",

And at the same time, though, COVID has changed, hasn't it?It's not the potent respiratory disease that it was maybe two years ago, but it can still be dangerous. What do you think his doctors are looking at in terms of how all this could develop? MISCOVICH: Well, you know, right now we still see, even though things have changed, as you've mentioned, we look for the respiratory change. You know, people who are still being hospitalized, the majority progress onto a pneumonia. They get a severe cough. They have difficulty breathing. They still get the liquefaction in the lungs when the virus attacks the lungs. They can get heart attack. They can get stroke. They can have blood clots in the legs. Some get amputations. Those things are changing. But Fred, what you alluded to, what has changed across the country is the fact that right now it's estimated with CDC data and sampling over 97 percent of the population or more has either been vaccinated or has contracted COVID or both. And when you see an individual like the President, who is now going through his third episode, he's carrying a lot of natural immunity. That's very, very important. Plus his last vaccination was September of 2023. And that also, although it wanes, that will still carry some protection for him. So that's why there should be some optimism that he's not going to have a severe disease, because he should, even though he's older and our immune system declines, should have fairly robust immunity right now.",
