This marks the first time a child of a sitting president appeared in court to fight criminal charges.Joining me now from Wilmington is CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, it was a very quick moment today inside the courtroom. Tell us what happened inside.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana, this was a quick procedural hearing. Hunter Biden sat quietly listening attentively as the judge laid out the charges that have been filed against him, the possible penalties and the conditions for his release, which include that he abstained from drugs and alcohol is also prohibited from owning a firearm.Now, he entered that not guilty plea through his attorney, Abbe Lowell. Even though this was a short hearing, this is still a historic moment. But shortly after the hearing, Abbe Lowell issued a statement accusing the Justice Department of bending to pressure from former President Trump and his, quote, MAGA allies to bring this case against the President's son. They have pointed to the fact that no one in the District of Delaware has ever been charged with something like this based on a similar fact pattern. And legal experts have questioned the strength of the government's case here. And, of course, this was supposed to originally be resolved with a plea deal. That plea deal fell apart would have also included tax charges. And Dana, at this point, it is unclear if prosecutors will also file those tax charges against Hunter Biden. But what we've seen, it's been interesting over the past nine months or so, we've seen a much more aggressive, forward-leaning strategy from Hunter Biden and his lawyers. This has been spearheaded by one of his lawyers, Kevin Morris. He brought on Abbe Lowell. They've been a lot more litigious with some of Hunter Biden's detractors, like Rudy Giuliani. They sued him several days ago. We were also seeing these more forward-leaning public statements, statements that some people around his father, around President Biden, would prefer that Hunter not make, that he not say anything. And it appears, even though, this has gone from a plea deal to a full blown criminal case, it does not appear that they're backing off of that more aggressive strategy going forward.",

And if somebody were named, you know, Jim Smith and not Hunter Biden on these gun charges, it wouldn't be brought necessarily. It's very unusual and that it's only being done because the plea deal fell apart and there's political pressure on the now special counsel running the investigation of Hunter Biden.",

We're going to talk to a Democratic congressman about whether there's any chance they will try to save him. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [12:43:14] BASH: The question of the hour is, will any House Democrats step in to save a Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy from a revolt within his own party? The House Democratic Caucus just met to discuss that and much, much more. And joining me now to share his insight is a member of that caucus, Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. Thank you so much. It's nice to see you in person. What's the mood right now in your caucus? REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D), NEW YORK: Look, within the Democratic Caucus, there's a presumption against Speaker McCarthy. The burden falls on him to reach out to House Democrats in pursuit of a negotiated outcome and there are members like me who will presumptively vote for a motion to vacate unless there's a compelling reason. And at the moment, I see no compelling reason. You know, the burden is on Speaker McCarthy. The ball is in the court of House Republicans. In government, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and no House Democrat should be expected to bail out Kevin McCarthy for free. You know, we're repeatedly told that Republicans are against bailouts, handouts, and free lunches, or no free lunch.",

They have more than doubled in 2023.You can see if that statistic is up on the screen right now, close to 750 of those carjackings this year compared to just around 360 at this point last year.
