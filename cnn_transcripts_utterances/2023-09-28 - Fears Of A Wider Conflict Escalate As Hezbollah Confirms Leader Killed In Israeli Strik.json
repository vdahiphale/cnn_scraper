They're also urging all U.S. citizens right now, all U.S. citizens who may be in Beirut or elsewhere in Lebanon, to immediately leave.The statement's saying, \"Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile, an unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.\" It adds this, \"At this time, commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. If the security situation worsens, commercial options to depart may become unavailable.\" And they urge all U.S. citizens to check flight options right now. This is a pretty serious development that's unfolding, Kevin, and it underscores the danger that exists in Lebanon right now.",

And I think you've been hearing the State Department and American officials sort of ramp up these warnings over the last several weeks, and it's certainly over the last several days as it appeared that an escalation was at hand as those cross-border tensions grew worse and worse.And I think, you know, what they want to do is to make sure that Americans are able to get out while they're still able to get out. Because already, you've seen today certain commercial air carriers canceling their flights to Beirut. And there is a certain fear and there is a precedent for these situations to deteriorate very quickly and for a commercial air travel to suddenly very quickly become unavailable for Americans who may want to get out and that leaves the State Department and Washington generally more responsible for trying to get Americans out. So they want to make sure that as they are able to, that they are able to leave and it does underscore how tense the situation is, how quickly they think that it could deteriorate. But at the same time, they don't think that it's necessarily inevitable. And that's why you see President Biden calling for de-escalation now, calling for renewed diplomacy. Of course, that large part will depend on what Iran does next and what Hezbollah does next, but it will also depend on Israel and it will depend on the Prime Minister Netanyahu. The United States, at this point, doesn't appear to have a ton of influence with the government of Israel at the moment. That's part of why you haven't seen President Biden speak with his counterpart, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in over a month, but certainly all sides now calling for diplomacy, and they're watching very closely to see how this will unfold.",

And most of your viewers probably don't know this, but the embassy in Beirut is very difficult to secure physically so it is vulnerable. So this is a smart thing to do.And then to have people take advantage of commercial options while those are still available, then there are also plans for a maritime evacuation to Cyprus that are probably being dusted off and refreshed.

It was not a situation that could be resolved then as Hezbollah started gaining strength. So my hope would be that, you know, after now. 40 plus years of this, that if Israel is seriously degrading Hezbollah to the extent that it can't function as a proper military, that it's degraded to a guerrilla group, that Lebanon, particularly the Sunni, as you said, but also the Christians, Wolf, might see this as their opportunity to say, to Shiite Lebanese, you know, this is over. That we've got to work together. We've got to reestablish our country. As I said, it's a beautiful country. It could be very prosperous and secure, but not under these circumstances.",

So those two empty seats inside the capsule right now, definitely a little bit different for SpaceX and NASA, but that is what was needed to do in order to bring Butch and Sunni home in February of 2025.

These strikes coming after the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah announced an Israeli strike on Friday killed its leader. They confirmed it, Hassan Nasrallah. I'm joined now by IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. Colonel, thanks so much for joining us. The IDF, as you know, says that strike in southern Beirut in that area also killed a senior Hezbollah intelligence leader. First of all, what more can you tell us about that? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESMAN: Operation New Order, as it's been called, is designed to change the reality on the ground that we've been facing under the control of Hassan Nasrallah for over three decades now. So what we realized this afternoon was we conducted a strike in line with what we've been fulfilling before the strike against Nasrallah and after, which means taking out, decapitating the major leadership. So this intelligence official, a senior intelligence official, which is part of Hezbollah's intelligence directorate, was taken out. But also, we've conducted, continued to conduct strikes against strategic assets of Hezbollah, such as precision-guided missiles or rocket launchers. And finally, the third component of our activities throughout the day is holding an interception of those who are actually planning, conducting, or conducting rocket launchers.

All of these capabilities, they accumulated for one purpose, to go to war with Israel.So in order to be prepared for that action, Israel, since 2006, has been conducting extensive intelligence surveillance in order to understand the ins and outs of Hezbollah. And indeed, we had revealed the nerve center, the Hezbollah headquarters, where they were convening yesterday together with -- effectively with his Jihad Council, planning to conduct more attacks, more war efforts to try and infiltrate into Israel, perhaps. And this is when we conducted the strike in the course of this operation. And in the aftermath of that, based on the understanding of what we knew, where he was on the real-time basis, the result of our strikes, we knew what we had conducted and how it would have been conducted. And indeed, of course, based on intelligence in the aftermath that was coming in, we had concluded in the early hours of this morning that indeed he had been killed in the strike.

There is a lot to lose here. I don't think anybody is interested in a further escalation, a broader war, but Israel needs to be prepared for that. We have to take the necessary steps. As I said, you know, you wouldn't be happy being evacuated from your house because a terrorist organization had fired rockets at your town and forced you to evacuate. You would demand to go back home. 60,000 Israelis are demanding that from the Israeli government. The IDF is instructed to restore that safety and security.
