And it is a very busy Thursday morning.With less than a week to go before the midterm elections, President Biden raising the alarm, highlighting the dangers of election deniers as he says democracy itself is on the ballot. Plus, on the trail, former President Trump stumping across several states in the final days of the race, hitting Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa. We're going to take you there. And a CNN exclusive. New 911 audio from a Uvalde student trapped inside the classroom as the gunman continued his rampage in the school. What her parents want us all to hear now. Let's begin this morning with President Biden's stark warning. CNN White House correspondent MJ Lee, she's on the North Lawn. MJ, walk us through President Biden's closing message. Five days until the midterms, he had some very harrowing words.",

He said that what we are confronting right now is so much bigger than politics. He said this isn't about me. It's not even about the last election or the upcoming midterm elections. He said this is all about the future of our country.He began his remarks notably by talking about, in some graphic detail, the violent attack against Paul Pelosi, which of course now we know authorities have said was politically motivated. And he said that the alleged words from the suspect who attacked Paul Pelosi saying where's Nancy, where's Nancy, that those were the same words that some of the members of the mob who went into the Capitol on January 6th used. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There are candidates running for every level of office in America, for governor, Congress, attorney general, secretary of state who won't commit, they will not commit to accepting the results of elections that they're running in. This is a path to chaos in America. It's unprecedented. It's unlawful. And it's un-American. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He will go to New Mexico to campaign for Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is in a tight race. And this midterm we have talked a lot about House races and Senate races and the question of whether Democrats will be able to keep control of Congress. But this trip is a reminder that Democrats also care a whole lot about whether governor's mansions can stay blue because, remember, these governors are the ones who can help enact and implement the president's agenda heading into the next two years.

And they have been laying the groundwork for those investigative priorities for months. That includes yesterday when Jim Jordan sent these letters to a number of Biden agencies requesting documents and other information. To the FBI, Jordan is seeking information about the search warrant on Trump's residence in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. He is also seeking information about the agency's pipe bomb investigation.And then, to the DOJ, they are seeking information about the probe into Project Veritas. That is a conservative group that is known for its undercover sting operations. And also seeking information about the agency's enforcement of an access to abortions clinics law. But I just want to read you a quick key line here. Jordan writes that committee Republicans intend to continue to examine these matters, including into the 118th Congress if necessary. So, clearly, they are putting these agencies on notice and making crystal clear that Republicans plan to use their subpoena power, if they have it, in order to obtain these documents. And, remember, Jim Jordan is poised to chair the powerful Judiciary Committee if they win power. That will have jurisdiction over everything from abortion, immigration, guns, potential impeachment proceedings. And Jim Jordan is a very powerful figure. He's close to Donald Trump. He's close to Kevin McCarthy, the likely speaker. He's close to the conservative wing of the conference. So definitely someone to watch, Jim, if Republicans take back the House.",

It was, of course, a political speech focused on democracy, but it wasn't a speech catered towards Republicans or Democrats, per se. In fact, I think it was catered towards those individuals in the middle of the country.I mean Ron Brownstein says this often, and I'll repeat it until I'm blue in the face next week, is that this is an election of double negatives where people don't have an appetite for either party or either candidate in their respective races. And what Donald Trump did was give those voters something to hang their hat on. If you're an election denier or you don't want to promote or ensure the stability of democracy, you can't be elected to the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives. And that was his message last night. It was giving voters, particularly those voters who are in the middle, not to the far left, the far right, a reason to vote. And I think it was very profound.",

So, we're hearing from even Democrats with concern over the president's speech last night, not just in terms of the message, but the messenger. His message on the democracy is on the brink is not what's top of mind with voters. Voters are concerned with money in the bank, not democracy on the brink. So, he would have been better served to focus on economic issues, as well as the inflation, but also the messenger.We've heard \"New York Times\" Peter Baker this morning said that many Democrats are trying to distance themselves from President Biden due to his low polling numbers in the 40s. Our colleague David Axelrod also said the same, that Democrats would prefer to run their own race. So, I think that's where the trouble lies five days out from the election, not speaking about the issues that are top of mind for voters. That's a big concern.",

He has them in the city. He has them in the suburbs. He has college educated women. And he's given himself a fighting chance. And Democrats haven't had a fighting chance in Ohio since Barack Obama.If you follow any races in this country, you have to follow Pennsylvania because I believe Fetterman is still up in every poll since the debate. And then the two races that are going to be of the utmost import that people are not talking about because they're not nationalized races are Ohio and North Carolina. And, No, we don't need the DNC in particular in those races because Cheri Beasley and Tim Ryan are doing what's best respectively for Ohio and North Carolina and they're running damn good campaigns. SCIUTTO: Alice, I do want to ask about Republican messages going into this race. Of course they're playing economic issues highly. Understandably so. But they're also talking about investigations. A lot of them. And you know that there can often be a limited amount of patience and enthusiasm for those.

It's a global problem because people fail to realize we just emerged from a pandemic. It's a serious issue. Pocketbook issues are serious. The borders is serious.
