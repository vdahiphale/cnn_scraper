And indeed, we have a wonderful and fruitful relations and cooperation, which is very important. And we have made this cooperation even more profound when Yohannes together with the other leaders came to Kyiv with other partners. And it was at a very important stage. And at that point, we were talking about the candidate status for the European Union. Now since that moment, our cooperation has become much better not between me personally and the president, but which is also important, but in between of the nations and in between of our estates, talking about security. Now, that's signal that I'm talking about the security guarantees. Now, this is a signal about our future membership in NATO. It's more than, you know, open door policy or something open. So President Yohannes supports the future of Ukraine in NATO. So that means that he will support us, and he would vote for that to happen, and he will work with other partners to make it happen. So that's what it is.",

But there is anaggressor in this war, and there is a victim, there is the person there is an entity or the party who starts the war. So whenever an aggressor came to your territory, then the peaceful plan cannot be prepared by the aggressor. So those who suffered do prepare that, so since we do have a war on our territory that could be only our peace plan. Now talking about the dialogue, we do need to have a dialogue with those countries willing to be engaged in this process. And I'm very interested in making sure that different countries would be complementing our platform with their own initiatives. I'm not saying that this is the ultimate version, because it's all about diplomacy. If you're not talking with missiles like Russia, you're talking with words, and it's absolutely normal. When people from different continents are not standing aside, but willing to join the process in order to put an end to this war, they have to give their initiative. I mean, they have the full right to do that. And we are grateful, if they will approach us not trying to impose something upon us but suggesting us. And this is a dialectic and there could be any country well, except for the aggressor state, any country that is offering us with something, not Russia, through some country, because we are all adequate people, we all understand, you know, the originator of this or that initiative. So if there is any ideas, it would be good that our peace formula summit would involve as many countries as possible from different parts of the world. This is very important, because I am confident that the peace formula and the peace summit, I don't know how many meetings, how many summits will there be. But what I know for sure is that things might serve as the foundation for the security infrastructure for the whole world for the future, when you engage the whole world. And you show that one country is isolated because of its aggression. Now, this is what's going to happen to you that the rest will get united as part of different reasons, everyone will get united. And even not against someone particular, but against the war, against aggression, against the authoritarian regime. And that is why I support this very format.",
