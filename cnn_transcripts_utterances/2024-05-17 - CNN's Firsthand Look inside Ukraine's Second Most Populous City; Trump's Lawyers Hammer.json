That's according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who went there on Thursday, just days after Russia launched a cross-border offensive into northern Ukraine, capturing at least nine villages so far.Local military officials say the Russian advance has been stopped in some areas, but Ukraine is still trying to hold the line in the town of Vyshchansk, where things are, troops are trying to clear Russian forces from the streets. The town is about 60 kilometers from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Despite Moscow's early gains, NATO believes the Russian offensive will eventually run out of steam. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Russia claimed that it prevented a large Ukrainian strike on Tuesday, while Ukraine says it's not ready to announce any details yet.Well as Moscow's troops advance in parts of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the war with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday. According to China's foreign ministry, Xi told Putin during the meeting that China supports an international peace conference to end the Ukraine crisis. The Ukrainian peace summit is expected to take place in Switzerland next month. Now during their talks, the two leaders pledged to deepen their strategic partnership even as friction grows with the U.S. and other Western nations.

And earlier there, Putin laid a wreath at the Monument to Soviet Soldiers, and he also already attended a Russian-Chinese expo in Harbin. We also learned that he has been meeting with the Chinese Vice President Han Jiang. And Putin, while in this city, will also soon be interacting with students at the Harbin Institute of Technology. Now, this is a university that was sanctioned by the U.S. a couple of years ago for its alleged role in procurement for the Chinese military. So, and let's point out, this is a very significant choice. It's highly symbolic. It symbolizes solidarity against U.S. sanctions, as well as access to Chinese military technology. Now, on Thursday, Putin and Xi, they issued that sweeping 7,000-word joint statement to declare this new era partnership. In this statement, it said that relations between the two are, quote, \"the best period in their history\". And this statement also laid out how Russia and China are on the same page on a host of issues, from trade to Taiwan, Ukraine as well. In this statement, they also had pointed words about the United States. Let's bring up an example for you. It said this, quote, \"both sides will strengthen coordination and cooperation to deal with the so-called dual containment policy of the United States that is nonconstructive and hostile toward China and Russia\", unquote. Now, top of mind for Putin is he wants reassurance from Xi, reassurance of China's support, especially China's economic support, as the war in Ukraine rages on. As we've been reporting, trade between these two countries has been very strong, so strong it reached that all-time high of $240 billion last year. But according to official data, trade volume has been softening in recent months in the wake of Western pressure. So this is a very delicate dance for Xi Jinping to shore up ties with his dear no-limits ally Russia without angering the West and hurting China's economy. Kim.",

HAUSFATHER:  So this year is actually shaping up to pass 2023 as the warmest year on record globally while it's unclear exactly how warm it will be in Canada yet. You know, a series of warm and dry years is really primed vegetation there here to be highly combustible. Now, its probably unlikely that 2024 be quite as catastrophic is 2023, which set a new bar, as I mentioned by a huge record. You know, it's still quite possible are going to see a pretty bad year for wildfire in Canada.",

You know, if you look at somewhere like Florida, most people think climate change is a serious issue there, even if the current political officials are not dealing with it, and the same is true in Canada. And so, you know, when you have a new smoky season, as we have in California, now that we had never had before, it's really hard to ignore that the changes happening in front of us day-to-day.",

And special counsel, Robert Hur, declined to bring criminal charges barges against the president, but he did create a whole lot of controversy by suggesting numerous times in this report that the problem suffered from memory problems, which, of course, the White House Democrats said was gratuitous and politically motivated. Now, back in March, the DOJ, the Justice Department did release the transcript of that interview. This was the written transcript, but since then, House Republicans have been pushing for the release of the audio recording of that interview. And now are threatening to hold Merrick Garland, the attorney general, in contempt of Congress, for not releasing that audio according. They are arguing that they need the audio to pursue their ongoing investigation, the impeachment investigation into President Biden. Now what we saw happen on Thursday was that the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance those contempt proceedings. And this is something that the House Oversight Committee is also similarly pursuing as well. And what the white house and Democrats have said all along is that all of this is just political theater. We saw the White House council saying in a letter to house Republicans I can quote the absence of a legitimate need for an audio recordings lays bare your likely goal to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes. I should also finally note that CNN is a media outlet that has sued to obtain those audio recordings. MJ Lee, CNN, at the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
