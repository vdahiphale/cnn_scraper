If you said pig organs, you are correct. They are roughly the same size as human organs, making them the most suitable for transplantation. What if animals could talk? And I mean, talk to you and you understand them. Well, some researchers using artificial intelligence have made a breakthrough with pigs that could revolutionize how we understand animals. While we might think oinks and squeals are just random barnyard noises, we`re learning that maybe these pretty poor sign creatures are trying to tell us something. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Does this -- (PIG SQUEALING) STEWART (voice-over): -- indicate happiness, discomfort, or stress? With the help of A.I., European scientists developed an algorithm that may just be capable of decoding pigs` noises, as well as keeping farmers updated on their pigs` well-being. To develop the A.I. algorithm, scientists collected thousands of recordings of pig sounds in various scenarios, including play, isolation, and competition for food. Once collected, they were placed in a database. ELODIE MANDEL-BRIEFER, BIOLOGIST, UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN: You had this huge database, of course, that are producing specific emotions, specific contexts by many different pigs and kinds of pigs. STEWART (voice-over): Scientists found short grunts typically signal positive emotions. Long grunts often indicate discomfort. Screams or squeals could show stress. MANDEL-BRIEFER: We developed A.I., so artificial intelligence that could tell us -- be trained to tell us if the calls that we recorded were emotionally positive or negative. STEWART (voice-over): The study of animal emotions is a relatively new field. It highlights the importance of livestock`s mental health to their overall well-being. Most welfare strategies today focus only on the animal`s physical health. MANDEL-BRIEF: And now with the explosions of A.I. methods, it actually becomes more and more easy to do these things. STEWART (voice-over): Scientists hope this tool will be developed into an app for farmers` phones, helping to translate what pigs are saying in terms of their emotions. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
