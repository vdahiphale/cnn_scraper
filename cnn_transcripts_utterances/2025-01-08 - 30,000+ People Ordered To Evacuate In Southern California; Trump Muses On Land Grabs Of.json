We have been tracking this overnight with major wind gusts expected through the early morning hours there. This is a live look at Los Angeles at this hour. It is 2:01 a.m. Pacific Time. We had heard as we were going to bed on the East Coast last night, that some of the most dangerous hours in California, we're going to be playing out right now as those fierce Santa Ana winds have made it all but impossible for firefighters out there to try to battle these blazes, instead simply focusing on getting people out and to safety. We saw really striking images of cars lining Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, people abandoning them as they tried to flee these fires. They engulfed many multimillion dollar mansions in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, many celebrities among those who have homes in that area. So this is going to be something we are going to be tracking throughout the morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is wonderful to have you with us. And again, these terrifying, devastating wildfires are burning across Los Angeles. There is a state of emergency. Thousands of people being threatened. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Biden says, I don't know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good, but who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old? I mean, striking honesty, but also, he was telling the American people that he could do it by saying, I'm going to run for reelection.",

But he obviously feels that way. And that's -- that must be very difficult for him. I think the -- excerpt that you just talked about is going to be what gets a lot of attention, a lot of attention in the next 24 hours. But what's really, really interesting is when he was asked two things basically like, what are you worried about with Donald Trump and beyond the democracy stuff? He said he's worried that Trumps going to undo some of the climate stuff, and that he's worried that he's going to do some of the drug -- price prescription drug protections that he put in place for Americans with chronic illness and for older Americans. So I think it's a really interesting interview. It gets -- actually gets in the policy, too, but I think everyone is going to focus initially on the age question.",
