It just -- it's hard when you actually see it happening in real-time. Mifepristone is such a vital medication for so many people across this country, and it helps terminate pregnancies from 10 weeks and under. A lot of women don't even know they're pregnant at that point.And the women that do know they're pregnant and know that they don't want to continue the pregnancy or they're pregnant against their will, or whatever the reason may be, this medication is so important and it needs to be accessible. And I am -- honestly, I'm scared to see what's going to happen. I feel like we know what the ruling is going to be, and I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for a bigger battle in 2024. But I just -- I -- there's this string of hope, there's this small string of hope that these Supreme Court justices will understand that the majority of Americans need and want access to this medication and just abortion care in general.",

There are several House Republicans who are in Biden districts who seem to be willing to vote for this inquiry, but are under a fair amount of pressure going forward about how they treat it. How do you think they will respond to the continued struggle that we heard from Chairman James Comer there and others for them to directly tie what Hunter Biden may have done wrong to impeachable actions by President Biden?",

      "sentences": "Well, the risk here, John, is that in these marginal districts, in districts where Republicans have managed to win, notwithstanding the fact that President Biden won last time around, the big question is, you know, what is going to be the focus of the campaign this coming year?Is it going to be on issues like the economy and immigration where we know from recent public opinion research that the public has some challenges with where President Biden is and President Biden's record on these issues, or is it going to be on the impeachment proceedings and on legal matters where, frankly, I think the terrain is much more difficult? So, I think for these House Republicans, yes, authorizing the impeachment inquiry is something probably that shores up their political base is probably important to some who are looking at the situation. But in the longer term, if you talk about winning independent voters or winning Democrats over, one does wonder whether this inquiry actually distracts from the issues where Republicans could potentially be stronger and where I think the President and Democrats, frankly, are much more vulnerable.",

It has seemed to benefit Democrats there.",

And it is a potent issue for Democrats. And I think it is the only issue, again, to go back to the survey research, it is the only issue where I think Democrats have, going into this election cycle, a significant political advantage, at least again, if you if you believe the numbers.And so, Democrats are going to want to push this campaign in this election toward that issue which they know they can use, particularly with the female voters, with independent voters. And Republicans are going to want to push it toward the economy and immigration where they believe they have an advantage. But there's no question that the timing of this Supreme Court case potential decision in the fall has significant ramifications for the 2024 elections, not just at the presidential level, but down ticket as well.",

Also, new this morning, the IDF says at least nine soldiers were killed overnight in Northern Gaza, operations around this area right here. That is the biggest loss of life in a single incident for Israeli forces since the ground offensive began.On top of that, we have learned from U.S. officials that the Israelis have begun flooding the tunnels -- here's some video of the tunnels, begun flooding the tunnels with seawater. To discuss what that means is retired Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. General, thanks so much. This is a map of what the tunnel complex looked like a few years ago. What does that mean? What are the implications of Israel starting to flood some of these tunnels? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.) CNN MILITARY ANALYST, HEAD OF GEOPOLITICAL STRATEGY, ACADEMY SECURITIES:  What's significant is, and let's just zero in on this area. Let's assume this is the area that they're going to start the tunneling, which means they've already cleared this area in Gaza. The IDF is in here. They're confident that the tunnels do not hold hostages, which is key. But the other thing you want to do is you want to deny the capability that these tunnels have provided Hamas for years. You want to deny that to them. And the way you do that, you load them up with water, which means this now becomes a no go, both for the Israelis and Hamas. And the Israelis now can direct forces in other locations to conduct other missions. It's an economy of force in this area. You can then maneuver forces to other areas. You still have to keep eyes on that, but you can maneuver other forces around it.",

I'd hate to be the guy on duty down here who's told, this is where here -- this is where you've got to conduct the fight. And then as water starts pouring in, how am I going to get out of there?
