He's a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University also. Dr. Reiner, first off, let's just talk about measles and how contagious measles are. DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Yes. So measles is probably the most contagious pathogen on the planet. If you take -- you put 10 people who have not had measles and have not had the vaccine and put them in a room with somebody who has active measles, nine out of those 10 people will contract. Incredibly transmissible. And it's remarkably preventable. The vaccine that we've had since 1963 is 98 percent effective at preventing vaccine -- preventing measles infection. The virus itself causes severe illness. And prior to the advent of vaccines, hundreds of thousands of Americans would get measles. Right now, if you look at the -- what happens if you get the virus, but one in five people will need to be hospitalized. About one in 10 people get pneumonia. One in 1,000 people getting syphilitic, which can result in deafness, intellectual disability, seizures. And kills -- it still kills quite number of people, mostly outside the United States. And the tragedy is that it's preventable. In 2000, it was declared that basically measles had been eradicated from the United States. But in recent years, we're seeing more and more of these outbreaks, largely caused by parents making a decision not to vaccinate their kids.",

So if an infected person has been in a room and has left, you can become infected from being in the same airspace after they had -- after they've left.People who are infected with measles are transmissible. They are contagious four days before they develop the characteristic rash. And four days after the rash finally leaves. If you've been infected, the incubation period, meaning the period from which you are infected until you actually develop symptoms of the disease, can range from seven to 21 days. And this is why the recommendation is for an unvaccinated person who has potentially been exposed to this virus to not go to school for up to 21 days. And this is what Dr. Ladapo has basically refused to urge parents to comply with. Because you can be infected and develop the disease up to 21 days after being exposed to it.",
