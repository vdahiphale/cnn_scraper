About a dozen of those family members, we are told we're here at the White House. Several others tuned in virtually.When these family members came out to speak to reporters afterwards, they said that they were grateful for the White House's continued close engagement with these families. And they said that the Biden White House understands that each of their loved ones isn't just a name or a face, but that they are somebody's son, somebody's mother, somebody's grandmother. Here's what one of those family members said. JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF HOSTAGE SAGUI DEKEL-CHEN: It was terrific, terrific meeting and conversation. I think we all came away feeling that as families of hostages, of American Israeli hostages, which are 8 out of a total of 138 hostages, we felt that and we felt before, and we were only reinforced in seeing and believing that we could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his administration.",

      "sentences": "And when I have spoken with some of these family members in recent days, they said, understandably, that they are starting to grow increasingly desperate for any news about their loved ones and any movement to get more hostages out.You'll recall, during the seven-day truce in the Israel Hamas war, each day of that truce, a small number of hostages was successfully getting out. But that truce, of course, ultimately fell apart. The war has resumed, and no hostages have gotten out since then. And so, these family members are all pressing both the Israeli Government as well as the Biden administration to basically get creative to do really anything, take any action to try to get additional hostages out. But the tough reality right now, according to CNN's reporting, is that there is no movement at the moment. There isn't even a formal negotiation to try to get Hamas back to the negotiating table as it relates to these hostages. Our reporting is that in recent days, Hamas has actually been entirely unresponsive to various overtures that have been made to once again discussed at some kind of deal, some kind of negotiation to get more of these hostages out. So that certainly is not good news for these families. But they did say after this meeting at the White House and seeing the president in person, that those meetings, that meeting, helped to refuel their hope that the White House is in fact trying to do everything that they can to get more of these hostages out of Gaza.

New video shows what overwhelmed hospitals are now facing and we want to warn you that viewers will find these images disturbing. The video was shot at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Wednesday. It shows those injured being treated on the floor amid chaotic scenes. Many casualties brought in on Wednesday after a reported strike. Several other hospitals in Gaza also reported receiving a high number of civilian casualties that same day.And it's not just the expanding war, but also the weather that's bringing more misery to Gaza's displaced population. Heavy rain has flooded makeshift tents and some had to dig trenches to try to keep the water out. Elliott has been following all of this for us. First of all, this cancelled trip to Doha.
