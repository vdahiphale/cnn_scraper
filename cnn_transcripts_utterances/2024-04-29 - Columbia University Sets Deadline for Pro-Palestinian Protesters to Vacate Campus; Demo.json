So that call went out this morning that if the protesters did not leave the encampment by 2 p.m. today they could face suspension or other disciplinary actions. We'll walk around here down the sidewalk. The police have moved in pretty quickly and set up barricades. We just want to walk along the protest here to give you a sense of how big it is. Several dozen. There's a lot of media in here as well. These individuals cannot get onto campus. All of the ways onto campus right now are being controlled by security for Columbia University and NYPD is now on the scene as well. NYPD moved in pretty quickly once they called for protests. So they put out a call for protests around noon, the protesters who are in the encampment in the main lawn in Columbia University.What you're looking at down the street here, that's the bookstore and you can see all those people in the-and those barricades that police have set up down there as well they're trying to create a situation where they can put protesters and media and students and keep them separated. Very long lines for students right now to get on to Columbia University. This is crunch time as well. This is the end of the semester and a lot of them have tests and exams that they have to get done and then commencement in a couple of weeks . So there's a lot happening here at Columbia University. If we just keep walking down the street here, I'm going to show you. So these gates are the closest to where the protesters are inside Columbia which is only about two or three hundred feet inside there. But you can see students still trying to get in there. Police now at- this is NYPD now at this gate. That was earlier it was just security but protesters still inside the main lawn at Columbia. Back to you guys.",

And while they didn't fully leave, they decided the next phase of letting their voice heard would be to circle and try and protect here. Now, they mentioned the police department being called. That happened in the very early days of the encampment and yesterday, the university president said that they did not.

Listen, I can tell you, having seen from the inside, that the dialogue that the administration is pursuing with the students, particularly since the last arrests that took place about 10 days ago, that they've been in very good faith. And I know we as faculty, we've been kept informed multiple times a day, sometimes at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. And I mean, they are working around the clock to pursue these dialogues. And they were really hopeful. I mean, all the messaging up until this point was that the dialogue with the student protesters was in progress, that they were facing progress, that they were improving because the students were changing certain things and agreeing to certain things like less inflammatory rhetoric, no anti- Semitism or hateful language, which I myself saw on campus, by the way.And so things, it looked like they were improving. And the campus, the administration really did not want to get to this point. And they made that very clear. They said over and over again, they don't want to invite the police to campus. But at the very end of the day, there are rules. This is exam week. Kids need to be studying. They need to be focused. And the fact is that you've got a minority of students who are creating an environment that is very difficult to work, to pursue studies, and many who feel on top of it unsafe. And that rules, if they're not going to be enforced, are useless. And so I don't know how it's going to happen. But I will tell you that if they're suspended, then given the rules right now, they will be trespassing on campus. And so hopefully that it will end peacefully with security and not the police itself. But it is a possibility always that the police are invited back.",

Israelis have proposed a ceasefire that is right now in Hamas's lap as we speak. Secretary Blinken came out and said it was, quote, extraordinarily generous and he hopes Hamas takes it. And if you have a ceasefire, I definitely think it would calm tensions down for sure so that the protests aren't as heated. But you're still going to have protesters want divestment. Maybe they're going to want aid to Israel to be conditioned, for example. Those desires, I think, are unleashed and will still be there. But my concern as a professor and also, I would say, as a different generation, there is a generational divide here in what seems acceptable in terms of language and views among these protesters who call for intifada, who call for resistance by any means necessary, things of this kind.And that's what I am concerned because that when you're going down that path of questioning the right of Israel to exist, it means that this type of issue is going to linger on for a while. And there's some real education there that needs to happen. Kids don't seem to even understand what is anti-Semitic language. And that's my concern, is that you are going to see some things linger.

You had a number of colleges across Texas in the UT system where students gathered and they protested. But the reaction by law enforcement was different at UT Austin. You had almost 60 people, a number of them students, arrested. Eventually they were barred from campus, and then the university kind of walked that back. Now they're totally allowed back on campus. It is interesting, as you see law enforcement kind of off there to the side assessing the situation.

You should also point out that the county attorney, those were misdemeanor charges. All of those charges were dropped against the protesters. But there was always a great concern that they did not want to allow any kind of encampment, any kind of tents. That would prolong and create a situation where the protesters would be on campus for an extended period of time, as we've seen play out at other campuses like Columbia and Yale across the country.I think the university administration here had seen that, and they were thinking they would much rather end it as early as possible and not allow that to happen. That is their thinking. These protesters obviously feel very differently that they have the right to free speech and to be able to voice their opinions about what has happened in Gaza and in Israel.

It obviously extends well beyond just about those college campuses and those college students. So what are you seeing in these numbers?MARK PRESTON; CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you know, Alex, we do have this new poll out right now that these images are certainly not helping Joe Biden when he's trying to deal with this Israel-Hamas situation. Look at these numbers right here. How is Joe Biden handling this situation right now? Only 28 percent of Americans right now approve of how he is handling this situation between Israel and Hamas. But what is even more difficult, and you can put a number to a face right now, is look at how he is doing with young kids right now. Look at these numbers right here. His approval rating with people under the age of 35 on this Hamas issue is 19 percent. Now, when you're going into an election year right now and you are looking at a key constituency of your voting bloc, young people for Democrats, that is incredibly troubling right now for the Biden administration.",
