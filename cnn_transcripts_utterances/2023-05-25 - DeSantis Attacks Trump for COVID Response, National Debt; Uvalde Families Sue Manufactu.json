He directly attacked Donald Trump. In a radio interview earlier today, DeSantis blasted how the former president handled the COVID pandemic. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think he did great for three years, but when he turned the country over to Fauci in March of 2020, that destroyed millions of people's lives. When people look back, you know that 2020 year was not a good year for the country as a whole. We will absolutely reduce federal spending. We will fight with the Congress on that. I mean, I think the debt has gone up on both Republican and Democrat. I mean, we act like it's just Biden. You know, it went up $8 trillion -- the debt -- under Trump, as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As DeSantis ramps up his attacks on Trump, he will also hit the campaign trail next week for the first time as a presidential candidate. He will make a four-state swing through the early contest states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.Joining me now Molly Ball. She's a national political correspondent for \"Time.\" Has also written a cover story on DeSantis. First, let me ask you, because this thing has already been spun so many times. If you are inside the DeSantis campaign right now, do you think it was a major flop last night, the campaign announcement? Do you think that has lasting implications from their point of view? MOLLY BALL, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"TIME\": I think they cannot possibly be happy about it. There's no way that went according to plan. And I think, you know, we see signs that there's a little turmoil behind the scenes. It was obviously a bit of a last-minute decision to launch in that way rather than to do something more traditional. You know, I have been hearing previously that maybe he was going to do something in Miami, right, a big sort of swing county that he won big. Where you can have a big diverse, multiethnic crowd and really showcase his popularity back home. Instead, we get this mess. So, it is quite possible that this will all be lost to the sands of time and nobody will remember it in a few weeks. But it certainly is not the foot that they were hoping to get off on.",

And what's interesting, his attack on the president on the pandemic response is a deliberate effort, right, to look at his success in Florida, right. At the time, he took a lot of grief, but he gets -- it's one of the reasons he was elected with a 19 percent margin there, for opening things up before others did.And I wonder, when I was watching that -- watching him attack Trump and seeing that record, which many Americans, even of other parties, non-Republicans will say that the shutdowns went too far. Why hasn't DeSantis focused more on that part of his record to run in the national campaign as opposed to these cultural issues, you know, or six-week abortion ban for instance, which God knows, do not have that level of support?",

A major, major part of his popularity in Florida, probably much more so than some of the controversial stuff, the war on woke and so on, you know. I think, you know, DeSantis and his team took that 19-point victory as a mandate on everything that he's done. Including really pushing the envelope far to the right in Florida with the help of the legislature there.But the source of his popularity, if you talk to Floridians, really has much more to do with opening the schools in particular, creating that free state of Florida where you didn't have to wear a mask and could go to the beach and so on. So, I think we're going to be hearing a lot about that. And the question will just be, you know, Trump wants this to be a personality contest. And he's going to make a lot of personal attacks. DeSantis wants to make this about substance and about policy and about things like the record on COVID. What do voters really care about? I don't think they know.",

Whether it's going back to November, right, when DeSantis won big, Trump looked like a loser and was blamed for having lost the Republican Party three national elections and you saw the polls really go the other way. You saw DeSantis start to come out on top.So that indicates that, you know, a lot of those voters clearly have wandered back to Trump now. They always liked Trump. They never disliked him. But they had doubts. And so, the question is, now that he's the won who has sort of been in the barrel and gotten bruised up, can DeSantis get those voters to give him another look. But there clearly has been an openness for candidates other than Trump, and we know that Trump also may have a lot more drama coming up for him in the next few months.",

But if someone was marketing their car in sort of a videogame that you could use to just plow through things -- and some video games do. I mean, you can run into everything. You could certainly injure someone with a car, presumably with some of the damage you could cause in a video game.It's hard to see how that would fly. You can see how someone might have a case in that regard. Is that exactly the same kind of thing or is it different because it's a gun? O'MARA: Well, you know, it's similar but another good example, Brianna, would be cigarettes. Don't forget, you know, cigarettes, without question, were and in some people's, minds still are -- particularly, you know, the vape pens and things like that -- are being marketed to children. And we know now that cigarettes are horrible for children and for the rest of us. So those companies got in trouble for marketing their cigarettes to children -- Joe Camel and some of these other ones. So, there is a basis, if you think about it, to hold manufacturers responsible if they improperly market to an audience that they should not.

It also says Donald Trump and his aides allegedly did a dress rehearsal for moving sensitive papers even before his office received a subpoena in May of last year. We're joined now by Josh Dawsey, who's with \"The Washington Post,\" and is part of the team that broke this news. He joins us over the phone. Josh, this is significant reporting. Walk us through it.JOSH DAWSEY, POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via phone): Right, Boris. What we're reporting here is that the night before federal authorities came to Mar-a-Lago to collect material from a grand jury subpoena, that two employees to former President Trump moved boxes back into a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. If you remember, former President Trump and his lawyers say to the FBI agents, say to the government officials, we'll take you, you can see the storage room, you can see the boxes. We are going to give you a tour of the storage room and then barred them from actually looking inside the boxes. But what we now know based on an account of a lawyer for one of the workers, who says -- that's on the record -- that security cam footage shows him and Walt Nauta, a valet for former president Trump, moving boxes back into the storage room the day before federal authorities show up to collect subpoena material.",

The way that they threw documents away. And behaved during that period was analogous to a dress rehearsal for what happened when the subpoena came from the Department of Justice. Essentially, further tactics were the exact same or very similar for the National Archives and later for the Department of Justice.",

And all the boxes were in the storage room and that's where the material was. But what this shows is that it was not always there, right? It was moved from the storage room and it was moved back the day before.And then what's important to remember here is when federal authorities come in August and they do the search, the raid on his property, as you remember, they find more than 100 classified documents in other parts of the residence. In his bedroom, in his office and various places at Mar-a-Lago. So those documents were not in the boxes that were taken back to the storage room. One other thing that I want to point out that we reported in our story, Boris. Is that federal authorities know of multiple witnesses who say that former President Trump kept classified materials in his office, and out, you know, for people to see and sometimes showed them to visitors who came to Mar-a-Lago. And that's also of interest to them, because it kind of contradicts a claim, oh, we accidentally took these materials. It's in the storage room. What they have learned now from multiple people who came into the grand jury, who came in to meet with federal authorities, is that he actually took the material out and was showing it.",
