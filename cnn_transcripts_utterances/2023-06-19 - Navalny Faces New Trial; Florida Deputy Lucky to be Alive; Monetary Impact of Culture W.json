Here's what we know.One person was killed, nearly two dozen people injured after bullets flew at a Juneteenth celebration. This was in Willowbrook, Illinois. And now police are hunting for the suspect. In St. Louis, one teenager is dead, nine others injured when bullets rang out at a party in an office building. A 17-year-old suspect is in custody in that shooting. And in central Pennsylvania, one state trooper is dead, another is fighting for his life, after police say a suspect took aim at police barracks with a hunting rifle. The suspect was eventually killed by police after an hours long manhunt and shoot-out. In central Washington two people were killed, three others were injured, including the suspect at a campground. An investigation has begun in Atlanta also after five people were injured in a shooting outside a nightclub there in DeKalb County. And four people are dead, one suspect is in custody, after a shooting in Kellogg, Idaho. It's not clear what set this incident off.",

She passed from breast cancer when Wyndham was in college, but he's never forgotten her message to him, play big. And that's exactly what he needed to do with Rory McElroy breathing down his neck all day. McElroy needing to sink a 41 foot putt for birdie on 18 to catch him, but it comes up just wide. That put all the pressure on the 29-year-old from Denver. People rushing to the 18th hole to see if Wyndham Clark could maintain his one stroke lead. He'd need a two putt to win his first major. He got his first PGA tour win just last month and now Clark, she's a beaut (ph). That's a major champion he is. He'd never finished better than 75th in the six majors he played in, but he finishes at 10 under to win the U.S. Open. And our Patrick Snell caught up with the camp moments after his win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WYNDHAM CLARK, 2023 U.S. OPEN CHAMPION: It was like, wow, you know, I really feel my mom's presence this week more than any other week. You know, and then as I played the rounds and stuff started going my way, it - it really reminded me of her. And there was multiple times when I was out there on the golf course that, you know, I thought of my mom. And so it's - it's just been a really special week and a lot of this is in memory of my mom. I've always thought of myself as a star and I - I always dreamt of being one. And so to finally get to the point where I feel like I'm at their level is, you know, is a dream come true.

A majority of everybody under 18 in this country are kids of color. One-fifth of gen-z identifies as somewhere in LGBTQ. Two-fifths of them do not belong to any organized religion.
