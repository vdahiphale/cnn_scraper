We've seen it condemned by Hezbollah, by the Iranians, by the Houthis as well.Israel's official line, of course, remains that it's not really commenting on who done it. But we have heard from U.S. officials saying so, Axios reporting senior Israeli officials saying that it was Israel, but that the Biden administration was only informed as it was actually happening. And then we have this post on X, formerly Twitter, by Danny Danon. He's from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's own Likud party. He's a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations congratulating the Israeli security services and saying that this just shows that whoever was involved in the Hamas massacres of October the 7th, Israel will close accounts with them. So it almost seems like this official line of strategic ambiguity, if you want to call it that, is not particularly credible when, to all intents and purposes, everyone is saying that it was Israel. But I think the line from Mark Regev is important. What he is saying is that Israel wasn't targeting Hezbollah. This is the Iranian proxy, the militia in southern Lebanon, which has been firing on Israeli positions and communities in the north of Israel and towards which Israel has been firing back in this kind of simmering war that hasn't quite developed into an all-out war. So Israel trying to make it clear that it wasn't targeting Hezbollah. This isn't Hezbollah's war. Hezbollah doesn't need to retaliate to this. It remains an open question as to whether Hezbollah will and whether this will be seen as a reason for escalating the conflict on the northern border. But as I say, for now, Israel's position is officially that it's not commenting on this. It's not taking responsibility. But at the same time, of course, let's not forget, in the wake of those October the 7th attacks led by Hamas, Israel has said that all Hamas leaders are fair game and Israel will reach them wherever they are -- Max.",

And now they are dramatically ramping up defense spending. You see many, many images of government officials, Shoigu, the defense minister, Dmitry Medvedev, constantly visiting factories, calling for increased production.And it's happening. We do see that they are pushing up the numbers. They just released a video, the defense ministry just yesterday, showing a big increase in the number of drones being provided to frontline troops. And we know by U.S. intelligence and other means that Iran has become a key provider of the Shahed drones, ammunition from North Korea. So they are finding avenues to replenish.

So I think there is a sense in Ukraine that it's not the right time to hold elections.But certainly, President Zelenskyy now almost two years into the war is seeing more questioning around his strategy and how he's handling this war, certainly more opposition than he had been at the beginning when we saw this huge sort of surge of unity.
