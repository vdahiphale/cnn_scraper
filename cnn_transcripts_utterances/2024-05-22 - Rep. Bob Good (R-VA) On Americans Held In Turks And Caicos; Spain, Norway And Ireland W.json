And because Democrats were providing such a large number of votes to get the spending bills across the finish line, ultimately, what you saw is almost every single Democrat get precisely $616,279 for at least one of their projects in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development spending bill. And this is an important thing for Democrats because this is something that they can go back home and tout. And while this was not the full amount of money that Democrats had wanted; this detail really does give a clear picture of how he operates. I asked Rosa DeLauro why didn't you guys put out a press release at the time? It took months for me to find this. And her argument was we did what we needed to do. He negotiated what needed to be negotiated. Not everything has to be a press conference -- Kate.",

New this morning, an American tourist pleaded guilty to bringing ammunition into the Turks and Caicos and is now facing a possible 12-year prison sentence as a result. He's one of five Americans held there now, all on similar charges. A bipartisan team of lawmakers just got back from a trip there to plead for their release. One of them joins us now -- Rep. Bob Good, a Republican from Virginia. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. What were you told when you went to Turks and Caicos and pleaded for the release? REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA):  Well, we went there to meet with our constituents -- the four detainees who are still being held. Some of them as long as 90 days, some as short as just a couple of weeks. But they're being faced with a 12-year mandatory sentence for accidentally having a stray bullet or two in their luggage as they were leaving the island of Turks and Caicos -- something that they didn't intentionally bring into the country that wasn't found when they were leaving TS -- through TSA in our own country. There was no criminal intent, no harm. Turks and Caicos put in place about a year ago a new law -- or a few months ago -- that carries a mandatory 12-month -- 12-year sentence, rather, if you have possession of a firearm or any kind of ammunition. But these individuals -- the ammo was in the seam of a piece of luggage or down into the lining -- something they would never have found if it wasn't picked up by the scanners where they had to search the bags multiple times. So we wanted to hear the stories directly from our constituents. I had spoken with them on the phone but wanted to speak with them directly. And then to plead with the government officials there in Turks and Caicos to consider the unintended consequence for tourists of their law, especially Americans who provide about half of the gross domestic product, the GDP, through our tourist dollars visits to their country -- about a million Americans a year.",

And again, our plea was that discretion would be utlitized. That there would be some discernment for the unintended consequences.We're -- you know, our individuals who are being held should be released with time served. They've spent anywhere from two weeks or a few weeks in jail or in prison. They've had to pay tens of thousands of dollars for bail money and to stay there on the island. These are middle-income Americans who where there to celebrate a wedding or to celebrate an anniversary or something to that effect, and they've been held again for weeks on end and months, in some cases. So, hopefully, we'll find out next week with my constituent Tyler Wenrich. That's when he's supposed to be sentenced, I should say. And hopefully, he'll get time served, maybe a fine, and promise not to return or a public apology -- something reasonable -- and allow him to come back to America and to his 1-year-old son and his new bride.",

The last one, Leo Varadkar, was at the White House for St. Patrick's Day recently. And I think through the Irish media you can sense this tension that from an Irish perspective, they felt that the United States wasn't doing enough to put pressure on Israel. And this is Norway, Ireland, and Spain collectively saying the same thing to other Europe -- fellow European countries, North American countries -- the United States, in particular -- and saying more could be done. We'd like to move the dial here. Norway's prime minister said look, to have peace in the Middle East -- and this is something that the United States is saying as well -- to have peace in the Middle East you need a two-state solution. And to have a two-state solution you need a Palestinian state and an Israeli state. So he said without it -- without a Palestinian state you can't have peace. You know, the United States would say OK, let's do this when we've -- when we've got a -- you know, when we've got a ceasefire in Gaza and when the hostages are back. There's a time and a place for this to happen and it should happen. And that's sort of the view of the European Union as well. They say well, it's a vision.

We're talking about the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. It was formed in 2014 after superstorm Sandy two years before caused all kinds of chaos. It holds gas in New Jersey and in Maine. Only about a million barrels of gas. It's never been used before. [07:50:05] It's actually very expensive to maintain and that's why Congress, earlier this year, required the Energy Department to sell gasoline from there. So this is really not an emergency move as much as something they had to do. They are just timing it for the peak of summer driving season. Now, I talked to GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan. He told me this is really not going to move the needle much for gas prices because although a million gallons sounds -- a million barrels sounds like a lot, it's really not.

The \"FRIENDS\" star was found face-down in his hot tub last October. Perry had reportedly been receiving ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But according to the autopsy, his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, meaning the drug would no longer have been in his system.

That's when you can say Reich. So this was just a piece of -- a campaign staffer that failed. I thought the campaign did a really good job of cleaning it up. They were immediate. They closed the book on this. But absolutely, you're right. If I was running Joe Biden's campaign I would have used it.

But there are other people who are responsible or should be responsible for those tweets going out. In fact, I think the former president himself bears all that responsibility. Trump's campaign -- and this is going to sound strange coming from me, but Trump's campaign actually has been extremely well done. The candidate is the problem. I mean, he lacks discipline. But Jason Miller and team have done an amazing job just trying to right the ship and not letting things like this happen. And so it's surprising that as carefully as they curated this new Trump campaign that something like this happens, which goes to show you that Trump was probably involved. Joe Biden has to use it, but will it move the needle much? It will be good at fundraisers but the average voter cares more about our last segment talking about gas prices than they care about the antisemitism that is Donald Trump.

I'm going to make the direct assumption that Donald Trump misheard or didn't think through the answer to the question when he said contraception and confused it with an abortion pill and other parts of the conversation of Roe V. Wade. I'm going to go there because we've seen -- we've seen in other campaigns where -- even Republican primary campaigns with Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska where Murkowski used this very effectively. Now in that case, Kelly Tshibaka meant to say contraception. In this case, I think it was very clear that the president did not. His campaign cleaned it up. But I also -- listening to the clip -- and I think it's important to listen to the clip -- I also wish and I think the American people also hope for this is that when it is that obvious of a -- of a faux paus, whether it be on the right or the left, that the anchor clean it up.
