      "sentences": "Now, let`s take a step back to get a better sense of where we are in this process of finding the next U.S. President. Iowa has been the firststate to vote for a presidential nominee since the 1970s. And despite the focus on the Republican side this week, Democrats are also participating in nominating their party`s next presidential candidate. Their votes are being mailed in though, and we won`t have the results until March to comply with changes to the party`s process. The Democratic Party chooses to give several other states a chance to announce their outcomes before Iowa`s. The next step in this nominating process is the New Hampshire primary where candidates will try to gain more momentum. These primaries and caucuses all lead up to this summer`s Republican and Democratic conventions where parties finalize their nominee for the general election, which takes place November 5th. That is when voters will finally choose the next American president. Let`s take another look at the candidates. After the Iowa caucuses, only three contenders remain for the Republican nomination, former president Donald Trump, the clear front runner, U.S. military veteran and current Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, a former U.N. Ambassador and Governor of South Carolina. As for the Democrats, it`s current president, Joe Biden, self-help author Marianne Williamson and businessmen, and current Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips. There are three notable independent bids as well. Environmental Lawyer and Author Robert F. Kennedy, nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, Environmental Activist, Jill Stein, and Progressive Activist and Harvard Professor Cornel West. Long way to go in this election process. And we will be keeping you up to date on all the action right here on CNN 10. Ten second trivia. Which country has the most volcanoes in the world? Japan, United States, Indonesia, or Iceland? According to the Smithsonian Institute, the U.S. leads the world with more than 160 volcanoes, though, less than 30 have erupted in the last 20 years. Authorities in Iceland ordered residents in a fishing town, in the Southwestern part of the country to leave their homes because of an erupting volcano. This is the second time in a month that molten lava has destroyed parts of nearby towns. Some are worried that the Iceland they know and love will never be the same. Here`s our Barbie Latza Nadeau with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So far, several homes have been consumed by scorching lava flowing out of two new fissures from the latest eruption forcing national police to order evacuations.",

Katy Milkman, author of \"How to Change\" gives us a few science based tips to help us out, so we can all be successful and conjubilant. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Whether you`re hoping to get in shape or learn a new skill or save more forretirement, or just get to bed on time. Science has proven that there are tools that can really help you immensely as you pursue those goals. There are some moments that are much more motivating than others for starting something new. And of course the most famous of those is New Year`s. Some other dates include the start of a new week. So every Monday is a little miniature fresh start. The beginning of spring, the celebration of a birthday is a fresh start. All of those fresh start moments give us this optimism about what we are capable of. So most of us will choose a goal that`s very abstract and long-term, like I want to get in shape, or I want to meditate more regularly. The next thing you need to do is actually break that down and figure out what`s the bite size piece you can do this week. And when and where are you going to be able to execute on that? So say, I decide that my goal is going to be to learn Spanish, and I`m going to try to learn it on \"Duolingo.\" Well, now I need to think about, when am I going to practice? And how many hours do I want to practice a week? Research shows that when we think about how much time we`re going to commit each week to a goal, instead of thinking about how much time we`re going to commit over the course of a year, we`re roughly 10% more likely to actually make progress each week. Research shows that if we don`t find it fun to pursue our goals, we won`t persist. We should look for a way to make it enjoyable. Maybe by pairing it with something else that we love, or even just pursuing it differently, going to a Zumba class instead of getting on a punishing workout machine. And it`s important if the people around you also believe in you and boost your confidence rather than putting you down, that makes goal pursuit more fun. When you want to quit something, though, it`s really different. In this case, you actually want to make it more costly to engage in whatever behavior it is, that`s bad for you. And so there`s a tool that is very counterintuitive called a \"commitment device\" that you can use, which means basically putting money on the line or forfeiting something else you value if you fail to achieve your goal. There are websites like stickk.com and beeminder.com. They allow you to put money on the line and if you fail, you`re going to owe money to a charitable organization of your choice. Now, you`ve increased the price of your vice enough that you may actually make the decision that`s in your long-term best interest at a higher rate. In fact, science shows, this is very effective.
