The former president's right ear was covered with a bandage as he greeted supporters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He's not expected to speak at the gathering until Thursday. Earlier in the day, he announced his vice presidential running mate would be Senator JD Vance of Ohio. The 39-year-old is a Marine veteran and Yale Law School graduate. A number of the convention speakers on Monday night talked about the shooting at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): On Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle, but an American lion got back up on his feet, and he roared! REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Two days ago, evil came for the man we admire and love so much. I thank God that his hand was on President Trump. KRISTI NOEM, (R) SOUTH DAKOTA GOVERNOR: Prior to this week, we already knew that President Donald Trump was a fighter. He is the toughest man that I have ever met. Nobody has endured more than what he has gone through. They've attacked his reputation, they impeached him, they tried to bankrupt him, and they unjustly prosecuted him. But even in the most perilous moment this week, his instinct was to stand and to fight. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Speaking to Fox News later that night, Vance shared Trump's explanation for why he picked him and spoke of his transformation from Trump critic to fierce supporter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He just said, look, I think you've got to go save this country. I think you're the guy who can help me in the best way. You can help me govern. You can help me win. You can help me in some of these Midwestern states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth. I don't hide from that. I was certainly skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016, but President Trump was a great president and he changed my mind. I bought into the media's lies and distortions. I bought into this idea that somehow he was going to be so different, a terrible threat to democracy. It was a joke. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So it seems to me that that gives a pass to Democrats who've been comparing the authoritarian Trump to the Third Reich.I'm not saying that that's accurate. It probably is extreme. But the fact that Trump's own running mate actually said that. As far as what he adds to the ticket, it's a generational contrast. He's 39. He would be the third youngest vice president in American history. And oddly enough, the very same age that Richard Nixon was when President Eisenhower, then General Eisenhower, chose him for the ticket in 1952. He doesn't have much experience, but that isn't important to Trump. He ran without ever having been in public office and got elected president. So a year and a half in the Senate, a bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy, Yale Law School, a stint in the Marines, and there you have your nominee. I don't know that it brings much beyond that because JD Vance is from Ohio, and Ohio is guaranteed Republican. It's now solidly Republican.

      "sentences": "On Monday, we learned a tremendous amount of new information, not only when it comes to what exactly happened and how was this shooting able to happen behind me at the fairgrounds here in Butler, Pennsylvania, but also we learned more information about the shooter's movements leading up to this assassination attempt.But first I'll start with that question of what happened here. Well, we did hear from a Secret Service spokesperson earlier on Monday saying that they did not sweep the building that Thomas Crooks, the shooter, was perched on top of when he fired those shots. A spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service said that it was actually local law enforcement who was responsible for searching and covering that area because it was outside of the perimeter of that Trump campaign event. But the Secret Service did not say specifically who in local law enforcement was responsible for this. Well, what has resulted is a bit of a blame game and finger pointing. We spoke with the Pennsylvania State Police who told us that they were not responsible for that particular area. And furthermore, they reiterated that they gave Secret Service all of the resources that Secret Service asked for when they were asking State Police to help provide security for this particular event. And Pennsylvania State Police emphasized that in these sorts of events, which they've done multiple of, Secret Service is the one who is the lead organization for these types of rallies. Now, I want to move on to the new information that we learned about the shooters' movements prior to the event. We're learning from CNN's John Miller through law enforcement sources that back on Friday, a day before the shooting, Thomas Crooks actually went to a gun range. And that's important because Thomas Crooks belonged to a particular gun range, a sportsman's club, where there was a range that was about 200 yards. That's notably just a little bit farther of a range than the distance between where the gunman was perched on that rooftop and former President Donald Trump on stage at that rally. Then, according to CNN's John Miller, the shooter on Saturday morning purchased a ladder, then later in the day purchased 50 rounds of ammunition from a local ammunition store in the area not too far, I should say, from his house. But here's the thing. Even though there has been all of this evidence and all of this investigation, and that has included the cell phone of the shooter that the FBI is now telling CNN they have now finished processing, we have learned that through law enforcement sources, the FBI still has not been able to come up with a solid motive for this case. And that's after searching his phone. That's after interviews with family, interviews with friends, and going through the shooter's search history leading up to this particular incident. The FBI at this point and law enforcement sources telling CNN that they just do not have an ideology and a motivation for this shooting. So that mystery at this point still open. Still a number of questions remaining about how this all came to pass. Danny Freeman, CNN, Butler, Pennsylvania. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHURCH: Meantime, House Oversight Committee Republicans are asking Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to preserve all documents in connection with Donald Trump's Pennsylvania rally. That includes text messages, e-mail communications, a list of law enforcement personnel at the rally, and any surveys identifying security concerns at the rally location. And amid growing questions over the agency's preparations, the Secret Service director is taking responsibility for the security lapse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
