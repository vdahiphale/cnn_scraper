      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, to reveal or conceal? That's the critical question facing the House Ethics Committee today. They're going to meet about an hour from now to discuss what to do with a report into Matt Gaetz's alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. As president-elect Trump says, he's not giving up on Gaetz's nomination.Plus, a top Senate Republican will be here to discuss Donald Trump's cabinet picks because he thinks of Trump's threat to use a constitutional loophole to put his team in place without Senate consent. And we're standing by for the sentencing of the undocumented immigrant, just convicted of killing Laken Riley, a young Georgia woman out for a jog earlier this year. We'll take you live to that courtroom. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start today on Capitol Hill where the fate of Donald Trump's cabinet hangs in the balance. Today, vice president-elect J. D. Vance is holding meetings with key senators, and Trump's picks for secretary of state and attorney general. On the secretary of state front, Marco Rubio is expected to sail through the confirmation process. But Matt Gaetz is a very different story, especially since less than an hour from now, the House Ethics Committee will discuss whether senators should see their investigation into Gaetz before they vote. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill, of course, talking to lawmakers. Where do things stand so far with these meetings that Gaetz is having, Manu?",

The Democrats are not part of this meeting because Republican support is soft right now.In fact, getting to the 51 votes he would need to be confirmed by the United States Senate next year, seems at the moment a steep climb, because a number of Republican senators are concerned with this pick. Are concerned about these allegations are detailed in this House ethics report. A key question today is what that House Ethics Committee decides to do with this report. They plan to meet in about an hour to discuss its fate. Now this all comes as there are questions about what would happen to Matt Gaetz if he does not get the votes to become the attorney general. Donald Trump has voted the idea of installing Gaetz via a recess appointment, such as short circuiting the Senate process altogether. There is growing Senate Republican opposition to this idea. One key Senator, Thom Tillis, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he's OK if Donald Trump were to go this route for lower-level nominees, as Barack Obama did for about 33 nominees during his term in office. But he said, not for cabinet nominees like Matt Gaetz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): Not for a cabinet level position that should be absolutely off the table. And quite honestly, any serious candidate for cabinet level position, I would have to really wonder if they would want it or be willing to accept it under a recess appointment. These positions are too important and carry too much weight internationally to take a shortcut. However, I really do hope we get at least 33 recess appointments.

I think they're a first step for Vance to kind of be playing his role in the chamber. Tell me who's in those meetings, and I'll tell you how important they actually are. And the people that have been in those meetings are up to this point, thinking specifically.Marsha Blackburn and Josh Hawley, these are not individuals inside that Republican conference. And I think the Trump team is very concerned about at this point, that doesn't say anything that he's going to meet with lots of people. It's the folks like Thom Tillis who, I think, is saying out loud a thing that I'm hearing from lots of Senators behind the scenes, related to the former president-elect, talking about recess appointments. That is a very real concern with a majority, I think, of the members in the Senate Republican Conference. But also, you know, when you have a Susan Collins sitting down in meetings with Matt Gaetz. When you have members that you wouldn't describe them necessarily as moderate politically, but moderate within that conference, then we're going to start to see whether or not the meetings have an effect. I think you're going to hear a lot in terms of the actual people that have been named about senators want to go through the process. They want to go through the process. And that's always the case. You know that from running around, usually edging me out of on Capitol Hill. But it's also important for Trump -- Trump's kind of perspective on things. If it's going to go down, it has to go down through a full process. Now, there's also the behind the scenes of picks that are still forthcoming.

Kevin Warsh, former Fed governor, also Marc Rowan, who's the CEO, co-founder of Apollo, major fund management group. They need that decision quickly. They wanted that decision last week.

But there's also the outside game, where public pressure and campaign pressure is going to start being applied.I mean, Charlie Kirk, has made it clear. The turning point U.S.A., big component of the Trump victory and what he and his organization were helped put together in terms of turnout, young voter engagement, all of that on the conservative side. Threatening primaries to any Republican senator who voted to confirm in Biden's cabinet, Merrick Garland as Attorney General. But now, potentially, is one of these on the list to watch who may vote against Matt Gaetz. And he's saying, if you do that, you will be primary. There's going to be this conservative pressure on the outside to try and help Trump, even as Gaetz may be faltering in the inside game, which of course, is the one that will determine whether or not finishes the line.",

I just think that's a set up for weakness. I don't think it's what they aspire to President Trump. I've spent six hours with him yesterday. He never brought up the point or the issue of recess appointments. So, there's both, the ethical and constitutional question of separation. But also, the history of it, while there have been a lot of them, as you know, and there's been a lot of talk of it lately that go back to the Bush and Obama eras. I don't know that there's been more than maybe one, if even that was actual cabinet secretary. So, I think it's fine.

I mean, he has an incredible record as a combatant commander. He's soft spoken, but he does carry a big stick, to quote my favorite president from North Dakota. So, you just have -- I just think Pete's wrong on this -- on that particular point. No, I don't -- that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be some generals that are fired. But what I don't think is that we ought to go out and talk about a commission to go after all the woke generals. Generals even with four stars salute to a political leader. That's a really important part of our constitution as well. That our military, even George Washington had to surrender his commission, right? So, that's a rich part of our leadership. I would encourage Pete and the president to visit with CQ Brown and judge for yourself. Ask him tough questions if you want. But I want our troops to look at our generals and our political leadership and go, I would like to be one of those guys. I want to aspire to that. We have a recruiting problem because of the DEI nonsense that the political class put out there. Remember when Gina Ortiz was the under secretary of the Air Force, she drove generals out of the air force because they wouldn't read out loud to their troops that her DEI statement. So, we don't want to -- we don't want to be the reverse of that. We want to be respectful of -- I think of the men and women that wear the uniform.
