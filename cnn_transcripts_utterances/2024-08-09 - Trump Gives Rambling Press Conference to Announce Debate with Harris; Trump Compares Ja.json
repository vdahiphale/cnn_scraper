They want Donald Trump out there -- Democrats do -- talking off the cuff, exploring the inside of his mind in a public fashion. The Republicans also want to hear Kamala Harris speaking off the teleprompter, because they think a lot of the viral clips of her, you know, sort of doing word salads and doing things that Republicans have clipped and disseminated are times where she's not on the teleprompter. She has done quite well, and I was at her rally in Michigan. She's done quite well when she's giving a set speech to an adoring crowd of thousands of people. And I think that's shocked a number of Republicans, including Donald Trump, that she's done so well. And so, they're trying to find another way to get her in front of the public in a way that she's not as comfortable: maybe in an interview, in a press conference.

We do still have some flash-flood warnings North in the Charleston area for considerable flood damage. Again, where we have found ten to 20 inches of rain, parts of South Carolina and North Carolina. The flood watches now stretch all the way up to the Canadian border. We're talking through Pennsylvania, upstate New York, parts of New England where we could still continue to see three to six inches of rain. You can see what's left of Debby will continue to swirl through New England, but we are finally getting rid of this thing probably by tonight -- Kasie.",
