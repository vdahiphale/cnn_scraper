We're definitely seeing a peaking in producer prices. That is good news. The Fed has been raising interest rates. This is why they've been raising interest rates. Another measure of retail sales. Remember, this was super strong in January. Well, that pulled back a little bit. Retail sales pulled back in the month of February, down 0.4 percent from January. Still running about five percent, five and a half percent year over year. It's not adjusted for inflation. So, you know, we could go. These were the most important things we were looking at to decide what the Fed was going to do on interest rates. But I don't think that's the case anymore.
