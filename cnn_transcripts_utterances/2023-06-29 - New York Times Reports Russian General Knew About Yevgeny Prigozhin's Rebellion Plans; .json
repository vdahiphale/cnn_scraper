      "sentences": "Thanks for being with us for this hour on CNN. We begin once more with the fallout from the open military rebellion in Russia, which many believe left the Russian president looking weak and vulnerable.And that may explain Vladimir Putin stripped to the Dagestan region on Wednesday. There he was greeted by cheering and enthusiastic crowds, but may have been a carefully orchestrated photo-op by the Kremlin to show Russian unity and support for President Putin. And now, new details on how Yevgeny Prigozhin plan to overthrow the leadership of the Russian military. The Wall Street Journal cites Western officials who say the head of the Wagner Mercenary Group plan to capture both the defense minister as well as the military chief of staff, but Prigozhin change his plans at the last minute when Russia security services learned about the plot. There are also reports that another top Russian general may have been involved in planning the insurrection. We get details now from CNN's Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russia's president trying to show he's in full control, cheered on by crowds in Dagestan. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I had no doubts about the reactions in Dagestan and throughout the country. PLEITGEN (voice over): But the uprising led by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin still reverberates. The New York Times reporting one of Russia's top generals Sergey Surovikin may have had advanced knowledge of the insurrection, the Kremlin trying to brush off the report. There will now be a lot of speculation and rumors surrounding these events, the Kremlin spokesman says. I believe this is just another example of it. While Surovikin was quick to call on Prigozhin to stop the insurrection. GEN. SERGEY SUROVIKIN, RUSSIAN AIR FORCE (through translator): You must do this before it is too late. Obey the will and command of the elected president of the Russian Federation. PLEITGEN (voice over): There is no doubt Surovikin and Prigozhin are close. But Prigozhin continuously ripped into Russia's defense minister for alleged ammo shortages during the battle for Bakhmut. For Surovikin, nothing but praise. SUROVIKIN (through translator): This is the only man with the star of an army general who knows how to fight. PLEITGEN (voice over): Surovikin lead Russia's war in Ukraine for three months last year, just as Wagner's battle for Bakhmut was escalating. He was also Putin's top general in Syria in 2017, leading a brutal campaign to crush the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And they are two working side by side with Prigozhin's Wagner Mercenaries. So far, there's no indication that Russians implicated Surovikin in the uprising. But Putin has made clear he views those who took part as traitors. PUTIN (through translator): The organizers of the rebellion betraying their country, that people also betrayed those who were drawn into their crime. PLEITGEN (voice over): A Russian general claiming Russian intelligence had advanced knowledge of Prigozhin's plans, and yet they couldn't stop them. Another possible problem for Vladimir Putin as he tries to show things are back to normal and he remains firmly at the helm. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

On Wednesday, he tells us that this was a legal battle over the past three months and he was finally granted permission to do this. Who is behind this and what the motivation is is really irrelevant for Muslims around the world who are angered by this move coming on one of the holiest days in the Islamic calendar, the first day of Eid al- Adha. We've heard from Swedish officials this time and in the past, they say that they don't agree with the sorts of acts, they find them disrespectful and insulting. But at the same time they say that this is about freedom of expression. In Sweden, a country where the -- where freedom of expression is protected by the Constitution, where they say it is at the heart of the country's democracy. We have heard the angry response coming from Turkish officials this of course at a time where a Sweden and Turkey are still in the midst of these negotiations over the accession of Sweden into NATO. The Turkish foreign minister in a statement saying that this is a disgraceful act against our holy book, unacceptable that Sweden would allow these anti-Islamic actions under the pretext of freedom of expression, and to turn a blind eye to such heinous acts is to be complicit in this. We've also heard from another senior Turkish official Fahrettin Altun saying that this is a provocative terrorist act targeting our religion on this sacred day.
