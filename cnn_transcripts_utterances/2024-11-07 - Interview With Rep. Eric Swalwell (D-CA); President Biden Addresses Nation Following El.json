Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated. We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. That's the story of America for over 240 years and counting. It's a story for all of us, not just some of us. The American experiment endures. We're going to be OK, but we need to stay engaged. We need to keep going. And, above all, we need to keep the faith. I'm so proud to have worked with all of you. I really mean it. I sincerely mean it. God bless you all. God bless America. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (CHEERING)",

      "sentences": "Look, he knows this the first words, in effect, of his own chance to put the brushstrokes on how history will remember him.And, right now, it is a deeply damaged legacy. He knows that. In some ways, he will be credited as the person who drove Donald Trump from the White House the first time, but also paved the way for Donald Trump's return. I thought one of the most -- and one of the things you heard in there was him voicing what has been his central mantra of his life and his career, of course, which is, when you get knocked down you get back up. That's his way of trying to inspire people to say get back into it, don't give up on politics, on governance, on the idea of pulling this country together. It's a barbed idea now, because in some ways it was that image, that notion, that mantra to himself that inspired him to run in this campaign and to stay in it, despite all of the headwinds and the criticism that he got, people who wanted him to leave early. So some will inevitably wonder whether that message of never relent, never lose faith in yourself ultimately will be part of the reason why Americans will perhaps eventually come to see the positive sides of his legacy as much as the negatives. But it's going to take a while for them to get there.",

He said that on -- when he gave big speeches on the anniversary of January 6. He would constantly sort of like taunt Trump as a reminder, you can't do that. Here, he used it as a proof point, because he's on the other side of the win here. His team lost and lost badly this week to Donald Trump. And his standing in the Rose Garden was to assert again as a proof point that he wasn't just saying that when he was on the victorious side, but here he is on the losing side and reasserting, you can't just love your country only when you win. And that, I thought was a really important thing to hear from him in this new perspective, but with the same goal of reminding that that's what he means about the struggle for the soul of the nation being ongoing work.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, that echoes the conversation that they had privately yesterday, a brief phone call that was cordial and congratulatory for the campaign that she ran during a very truncated period of time, the shortest campaign being stood up in history.Of course, it was unsuccessful. And Biden keeping it very brief, choosing instead to focus these remarks on the work of his administration, with many of his senior-most staff and nearly his entire Cabinet here in the audience, giving him a standing ovation. The emotions here very raw, Pam. The mood is extremely emotional. Everyone here believes that his approval rating really belies the achievements of this administration. And that's part of the soul- searching that's going on behind the scenes. And there are so many cruel ironies of this moment for President Joe Biden. He talked about the strength of the economy. But yet, as we know now, from nearly every exit poll, that is not how American voters see it. And, as David mentioned, he said the same line about you can't love your country only when you win here from the Rose Garden, where he, when he was the Democratic candidate, did many of his own campaign events, instead using that line that he had previously delivered in Statuary Hall on the anniversary of January 6, in Independence Hall, and in front of Union Station to criticize Donald Trump, who he's now preparing to welcome back into office, the exact outcome that he and everyone sitting before him had worked so tirelessly to prevent. Now, of course, they're preparing for what many of them saw as a binary outcome, the outcome that they did not want to see. And while he's trying to rally the troops to continue the work for 74 days, there are real questions about what the Biden legacy tour will look like and what the legacy writ large will be -- Pam.",

It's not Barack Obama's fault.It's the fault of the Democratic Party and not knowing how to communicate effectively to voters. We are not the party of common sense, which is what the message that voters sent to us. For a number of reasons, for a number of reasons we don't know how to speak to voters. When we address Latina -- and language -- listen, language has meaning. When we address Latino voters is Latin X, for instance, because that's the politically correct thing to do, it makes them think that we don't even live on the same planet as they do. When we are too afraid to say that, hey, college kids, if you're trashing a campus at Columbia University because you're unhappy about some sort of policy, and you're taking over a university, and you're trashing it and preventing other students from learning, that that is unacceptable. But we're so worried about alienating one or another cohort in our coalition that we don't know what to say when normal people look at that and say, wait a second, I send my kids to college so they can learn, not so that they can burn buildings and trash lawns, right, and so on and so forth. When we put pronouns after names, and say she/her, as opposed to saying, you know what, if I call you by the wrong pronoun, call me out, I'm sorry, I won't do it again, but stop with a virtue signaling, and just speak to people like they're normal. There's nothing I'm going to say to Shermichael that I'm not going to say to you, that I'm not going to say to somebody else. I speak the same language to everybody. But that's not what Democrats do. We constantly try to parse out different ways of speaking to different cohorts, because our focus groups or our polling shows that so and so appeals to such and such. That's not how normal people think.It's not common sense. And we need to start being the party of common sense again. Joe Biden is not responsible for that. Neither is Kamala Harris. It is a problem that Democrats have had for years. I have been banging the drum on this for, I don't know, probably 10 years, if not longer on this. We need to get back to being the party of common sense that people look at us and say, we understand you, we appreciate what you say because you speak our language. And until we do that, we should stop blaming other people for our own mistakes.",

      "sentences": "Look, I mean, no one likes to lose elections. I have worked on enough campaigns to understand what that feels like as a strategist, but also for millions of people out there who voted for the vice president because they believed in her, they believed in her policies. I get it, so I certainly don't want to gloat.It's just not a great feeling to lose, but the American people, at least of vast majority of them who voted, did give a mandate not only to the former president, now president-elect, but also to the Republican Party. President Biden stated his presidency has been historic. He said they accomplished great things, changing lives in rural communities. Well, Donald Trump was able to improve his standing and performance overall in rural communities across the country. He talked about the economy being the strongest, although he did acknowledge that some people are still struggling. Well, economic dislocation is still a very real thing. It's why I would argue a vast majority of people voted for Trump over the vice president. I think it's why Donald Trump was able to increase his margins with Latinos, specifically Latino men. And so I think the Democratic Party is going to have to do what the Republican Party did after Mitt Romney lost to former President Obama. They need to do an introspection, an autopsy report to understand, to many of Julie's points that I actually do agree with, how do you actually communicate to regular people, not well-educated individuals, everyday hardworking people, and understand their values, their plight, their concerns? I don't think the Democratic Party, at least in my opinion, and I'm a conservative, so maybe our viewers may say, well, Shermichael, you're a bit jaded or biased in your perspective here, and I certainly understand that. That's a fair point. But I think a lot of people believe that the Democratic Party of the past is no longer the Democratic Party of today. And as you think about that dislocation as it pertains to the economy, we could go all the way back to NAFTA with President Bill Clinton at the time and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs and how over the past two-and-a-half decades that's led to the economic environment that we're seeing today. And so people are wondering, particularly men, who oftentimes work with their hands, who don't get college degrees, well, how am I supposed to survive in this continuously changing economy, one that relies more on information technology and less on skilled workers? I mean, you have to provide solutions to those workers. And I think Donald Trump in a very unique way, and I know Democrats will criticize the depth or the nuance and specificity of some of his arguments, but to be able to provide a critique and recognition of that plight of many people is important.",

After this resounding presidential election loss -- I don't know if you just heard the conversation I had with the Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky, but she said the party doesn't know how to communicate effectively to voters and how to just get through to the regular person out there in America who's not inside the Beltway.",

And I think we would be better served if we led with our personality, rather than policy. And our personalities can reflect our values, our principles, what we care about. But, too often, we're just not plainspoken enough. And, frankly, we're too nice and too modest. And we stand on virtue. And I think you look at a candidate like Ruben Gallego, who won in Arizona, look, that guy went to rodeos. He went to soccer matches. He went to boxing matches. He went out to the tribes. He was himself. He was just Ruben. And it worked. And he beat Kari Lake in a state that Donald Trump won. And I think that's a good model of how we can win.",
