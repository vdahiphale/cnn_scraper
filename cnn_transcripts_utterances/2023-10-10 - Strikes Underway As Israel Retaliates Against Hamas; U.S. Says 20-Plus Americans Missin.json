He arrived there on Sunday evening, joining his elite paratrooper unit.He explained to CNN why he decided to leave New York. And this is a quote from him. He said, it's just feeling that it is my duty, it's my calling. Of course, he is one of many of the reservists who have joined up to fight and go with their country, following this devastating attack from Hamas on Saturday.

But I think you know, we can't underestimate the tragedy of this, the danger of this, the horror of this, and let's look at who we're dealing with. We have Putin in Ukraine. We have Hamas. We have Hezbollah. We have Iran. We have a new world order, I'll come back to that, that is more dangerous than we could have ever imagined at the end of the 20th century. And here we are in the 21st century with these forces, including genocide of the Jewish people, again, loose in the Middle East.",

And my next guest just returned to the United States from Israel, where she survived by hiding during the attacks.Elizabeth Hirsch Naftali flew to Israel last Friday to celebrate Sabbath and a holiday, and she joins me here in New York tonight. Elizabeth, I'm grateful that you're here, that you made it out. Tell us, what has the last 72 hours been like for you, for your family? ELIZABETH HIRSCH NAFTALI, NIECE'S FAMILY MURDERED BY HAMAS IN KIBBUTZ KFAR AZZA: It's been hell. It's been heartbreaking. So, Saturday morning, we woke up to sirens and I was in a hotel and I knew that meant you run to the stairwell and everybody ran to the stairwell. And my daughter who lived nearby, she was in her apartment and ran to her bomb shelter. So, everybody was in hiding. But then we started to hear that something was happening in the south. And I knew my sister-in-law and her family lived on a kibbutz along the border of Gaza. So, I called her. She didn't answer. Then I called another sister-in-law. And by 8 o'clock on Saturday morning, she told me that my niece had been murdered. Her husband had been murdered. And at that point, they thought that the baby who was with the husband outside, because it was a beautiful morning on a kibbutz, and a kibbutz is a beautiful, idyllic place where people are running around and young families are out and kids are free, and the husband had been outside with the baby, and they also saw the missiles. But before he could do anything, he was literally slaughtered by Hamas terrorists. The mother inside quickly put the two -- six and 10-year- old in a closet and locked them in. And before she could do anything, her life was taken. She was killed by these terrorists. So, when you ask how the last 72 hours have been, I then spent the day and the family all spent the day in different parts of Israel and the grandmother was out of the country, couldn't get back to the country to be with her family. And truly the kibbutz itself was on lockdown for two days because it was right along the border and it's a beautiful piece of property and they lived well next to each other. There wasn't animosity from the kibbutz towards the Palestinians. It was a beautiful, idyllic life. But it was the closest place in the border for these terrorists to come in because of the location of where these young families were living.",

And my daughter has been in Israel for 10 years. She is an Israeli. She has a partner. And she made a choice to stay. I said, I will take you, come with me. But she loves her country. She loves her people. And for her, it was an important thing to stay and be part of what Israelis do, which is they come together at these terrible times. And it was so hard because I never saw her the whole time I was there and I couldn't see her on Saturday. And literally as I was going to the airport on Sunday morning, I went to her apartment and just held her for an hour. And then I had to leave her. And it's just -- I know she -- I really believe she'll be fine. But just to leave your child, even as an adult, is just -- and know what's going on in that country. It's really hard.",
