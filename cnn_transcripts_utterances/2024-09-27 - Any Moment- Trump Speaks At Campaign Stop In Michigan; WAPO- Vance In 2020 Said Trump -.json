You can see RFK Jr. currently at the podium. It all comes after his closed door meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York. Here they are, ahead of the meeting, talking about ending Russia's war in Ukraine. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're going to work very much with both parties to try and get this settled and get it worked out. It has to end. At some point it has to end. He's gone through hell, and his country has gone through hell like few countries have never like it's happened anywhere. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.

The Grand Rapids area, is a purple part of this purple state, the county that Trump is speaking in today, Kent County, is one that he won eight years ago by four points. However, he hasn't when you look at, excuse me, in 2020 he actually lost it to Biden by six points, and this is a challenge for the Trump campaign going forward.They are concerned about the fact that this is an area where Nikki Haley got about one-third of the votes when you look at the Republican primary earlier this year. So that is one of the challenges they have, is that it is a much more moderate Republican Party than the rest of the state. And I was actually had the opportunity yesterday to walk some neighborhoods with a Republican candidate for Congress up here, Paul Hudson. And there were -- there were houses where you had a Trump flag outside the door. There were houses right next door that had Harris-Walz signs on their doorstep and clearly showing that this is a purple region. And he actually had a conversation with one voter who said, you know, he approached him and said, you know, what -- what is your party? And he said, I'm a Republican. He said, no, thank you. This was a swing voter that they had identified, that they hoped they could sway. And this person said, essentially, look, Republicans are -- I'm not in -- I'm not interested in that whole Trump thing. So clearly demonstrating some of the -- the headwinds they are facing in this important region. Trump will address them just moments from now on the stage and try to make his pitch to win this region back just as he did in 2016.",

According to these messages obtained by the Washington Post, Vance gave a candid critique of Trump's first term. He wrote in February of 2020 that quote, Trump has just so thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism except a disjointed China policy, end quote.In another message from June of that year, Vance said he believed Joe Biden would win the election. Writing quote, I think Trump will probably lose. CNN has reached out to Vance's folks to verify the authenticity of the messages and to seek comment on their contents. Joining me now to discuss is Dana Milbank, syndicated columnist for the Washington Post. He's also the author of a new book called \"Fools on the Hill: The Hooligans, Saboteurs, Conspiracy Theorists, and Dunces Who Burned Down the House.\" Metaphorically speaking, I think, in many other cases --",

It's been, you know, iteration after iteration, election after election, and it's because the Republican primaries are structured.Look, only a couple of dozen seats in the House are ever in place. So people are chosen in -- in primaries exclusively. And within the Republican Party, they have twice as many conservatives as there are progressives in the Democratic Party. So whereas moderates still hold sway in the Democratic Party, they've -- the moderates have lost control of the Republican Party. So, you know, that Tom Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, member of the House, said in trying to figure out who are these voters voting for, and he finally realized they're voting for the craziest SOB in the race.

You offer a pretty stark warning for the future. You say voters ought to know that this is what they would get if they return MAGA Republicans to power, the chaos, the conspiracy theories, the lies, the constant cultural and political warfare. What do you think the next four years could look like depending on different outcomes? MILBANKBut look, I mean, it -- it appears the Senate may well wind up being Republican if Donald Trump wins the presidency, which is certainly not out of the realm of possibility and entirely possible Republicans keep the House. It's an entirely different ballgame. Then it's, I mean, we can all sit back and say, well, isn't this amusing that, you know, so many votes for keeping Confederate names on military bases.
