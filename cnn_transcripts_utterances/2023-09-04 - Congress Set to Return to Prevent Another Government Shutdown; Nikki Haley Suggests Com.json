Ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom,\" a budget battle brewing on Capitol Hill. Congress set to return Tuesday when it'll face the potential of a government shutdown if Congress can't reach a deal on spending by the end of the month.A major shakeup in Kyiv. After more than 18 months of war, President Zelenskyy announced his plans to replace his defense minister. Plus, Burning Man chaos continues. Thousands still trapped in the Nevada desert after heavy rain turned the festival site into a mud pit. It is back to business this week for the U.S. Senate as its August recess comes to an end. Now, Washington is set to become a pressure cooker in the coming weeks as lawmakers attempt to avoid a government shutdown yet again. And they only have until October 1st to come to an agreement. Little shall we say that it will not be easy. Members of the U.S. House aren't back until next week, in fact, but conservative Republican hardliners are already pressuring House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to stick to strict guidelines on a deal. Now, they don't want to make any concessions, but McCarthy and the White House are seeking a short-term bill that would put at least a band-aid on the problem for now, moving the issue months down the road. The U.S. Commerce Secretary meantime says American business owners are preparing already for the worst. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GINA RAIMONDO, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY:  They are worried. They are very worried. They are, I think, in some cases frustrated that this is how government operates. You know, what businesses need to be successful is predictability. You know, predictability, some semblance of, you know, regular order. And so, these sorts of disruptions that are mainly driven by politics, it's a challenge for the economy and have the potential to set us back. So, I do hope that there'll be a speedy resolution.

They're also asking for a boost in funding for some key programs that provide assistance to millions of Americans.Now, separately, the White House is also asking Congress for a supplemental request, that is to provide more funds to FEMA, which has been responding to very expensive disasters across the country and whose funds are set to run dry by the end of this month, as well as more funding for Ukraine. Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said the FEMA funds will be replenished, but there is pushback about those funds being linked to Ukraine. Now, also there is disagreement within the Republican conference about the spending bill. Republican hardliners have asked for an impeachment inquiry into Biden, action on border security, as well as cutting spending to pre-COVID levels as part of passing any type of spending bill. So that is likely to play out in Congress in the weeks to come, but all of this really a sprint to the finish in September when the fiscal year ends.

      "sentences": "A warm welcome back to viewers in North America. I'm Paula Newton. Scientists are racing to understand a highly mutated Coronavirus variant. BA.2.86 has made an evolutionary leap similar to the one the original Omicron variant made almost two years ago. If you remember, the Omicron wave caused infections and hospitalizations to spike to their highest points in the pandemic in the United States.But early lab tests are easing fears, one scientist saying that the BA.2.86 variant is not, quote, \"The second coming of Omicron.\" Thank goodness. Preliminary results in China find that the variant appears less infectious than previous viruses. A Swedish study is finding that our antibodies do appear to be powerless against it. Meantime COVID cases are once again on the rise in the United States. This late summer spike has led to an increase in hospitalizations nationwide. And while federal data suggest that current cases have stayed below earlier peaks, some question that data because it isn't being recorded in quite the same way. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It's hard to say whether or not we're in a new COVID wave right now. Certainly there's been a lot of anecdotal reports. People more likely to know somebody who might have COVID or may have had COVID themselves. But admittedly, this is hard to validate because there's just not as much testing. There's not as much testing being done overall, and a lot of the testing that is happening is happening at home and not being reported, so it's hard to get those numbers. One of the things that we have paid attention to throughout the pandemic is hospitalizations and hospitalizations have gone up a bit. Take a look. About 15 thousand more hospitalizations this past week as compared to the week before that. So the numbers are trending in that direction, but at the same time, it's about half overall of what it was at this time last year. So you get the idea, it's difficult to sort of read into this too much. Another metric we pay attention to is how much virus is in wastewater. Again, this is sort of a general look, a sort of broad look at how much virus is out there. And we see that the numbers have gone up again over the last several months. Higher than it's been in some time now. Does that translate to more cases? Does that translate to more severe illness or hospitalizations? We don't know yet. But think of these as early warning systems. When it comes to this weekend, I want you to take a look at this map. And this is a good-looking map. It's mostly green, which means these are areas where the CDC says there's not as much hospital surge or hospital increases. But there are a few places of yellow and even a couple of places of orange. Pay attention to this like you would pay attention to a weather map. Right now there's not a recommendation for masking in general. I will tell you, on a personal note, I visited my parents a few weeks ago, they're in their 80s. I masked on the way down there. I tested ahead of time to make sure that I wasn't going to potentially get them sick. While they are protected, if they do get COVID, as someone said to me, it could be one of the worst viral illnesses of their life. So we're doing everything to try and avoid that, obviously. Also, keep in mind, isolation. If you do test positive, if you do get COVID, starting with the first day after you develop symptoms, you should be in isolation for five days after that. You don't need to test to get out of isolation, but there is a recommendation to wear a mask for a few days after that as well. Finally, I just want to say about the new booster, because this is one of the most common questions we get as well. There's going to be a CDC advisory meeting on September 12th. That is the point where this booster may be recommended broadly for the population. We'll see what happens. But I put together this grid for the upcoming shots so people could have some idea of what's happening here. Get the flu shot before Halloween. That's a general rule. The COVID shot, again, in September. If you've had COVID recently or you've had a shot recently, you can probably wait several months before you get this updated shot. And then some information there about RSV as well, especially for people over 60. Have a great weekend, be safe, and be kind to each other. Take care. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
