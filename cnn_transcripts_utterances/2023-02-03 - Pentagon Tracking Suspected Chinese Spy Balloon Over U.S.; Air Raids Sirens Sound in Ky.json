The Pentagon has decided against that for now, but we're told while the flight path does not bring it near sensitive sites, it is not considered a major risk. But its presence did cause authorities to ground flight in Billings in the state capital Helena for about two hours on Wednesday. The timing is perplexing. Antony Blinken is on the verge of visiting China for the first time since becoming Secretary of State. And the two super powers have a stack of tricky issues to tackle already. CNN's Oren Liebermann has the latest on the balloon from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "For several days now the U.S. has been tracking this surveillance balloon over northern U.S., specifically over Montana. The U.S. says that they believe, they are confident in fact, that it is from China. A balloon that drifted in or came in over Canada and has been over sensitive sites the Pentagon admits over Montana. Now they haven't specified what those sites are, but Montana is home to several ballistic missile fields, ballistic missile silos and perhaps that's what this surveillance balloon was going after.The Pentagon says when this first came over and they started watching it, they did launch F-22 fighter jets. In the end the decision was made not to shoot it this down. President Joe Biden asked for military options for the possibility of what it would take to shoot this down. In the end senior military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, top U.S. officer, recommended against shooting it down for a number of reasons. First, there is a risk to what's on the ground. Facilities and people there on the ground, even if it is Montana and isn't densely populated. More importantly though, the Pentagon says they don't believe this has intelligence gathering capabilities, with satellite communications above what Chinese spy satellites already have. In the end the decision was made not to shoot it down, but the Pentagon emphasized that should they determine this is a high risk, they do retain that option of carrying out a military option against this of essentially shooting this surveillance balloon down. The Pentagon will keep watching this. It's important to note that the Pentagon did bring this up through diplomatic channels both in Washington and in Beijing and it comes at a time of incredibly high tensions with China.

The ground launched small diameter bomb, a guided missile with a range of 90 miles will be part of a new $2.2 billion security package. The bombs will effectively double the range of Ukrainian weaponry but the package won't include even longer range missiles that Ukraine has expressed a desire for. Now sources say that the details could be announced as soon as today. And with more on the air raid sirens in Kyiv and this military aid package that's coming down the pipeline, CNN's Scott McLean is here joining us. Scott, have we seen this before, that Russia might be launching air attacks when prominent world leaders or EU summits are happening in the country?",

One of his first visits if I remember correctly to the country, that there were a series of missile strikes I think just before or just after his visit. And so this is not uncommon for Russia to try to send a clear message.A bit of context though around these air raids sirens is that they may or may not be significant. It doesn't always necessarily mean that there is incoming, obviously the air raid sirens cover huge swathes of the country. And so, even if it was incoming, it wouldn't necessarily hit Kyiv and sometimes they could also be triggered by say fighter jets taking off and Belarus near the border. And so, this could easily be a false alarm. But perhaps also meant to send a message. We don't know.",
