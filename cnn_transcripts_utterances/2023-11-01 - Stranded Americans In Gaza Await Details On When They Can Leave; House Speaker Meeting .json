He's an attorney for a Massachusetts family of three that's trying to leave Gaza right now. Sammy, we've been following the story of Abood Okel and his wife, Wafa Abuzayda, and their 1-year-old son. We know they were contacted by the State Department today. What else can you tell us?",

But unfortunately, both the family and I remain incredibly but somewhat hopeful.They did receive a communication from the State Department that the State Department had reliable information that the crossing would be open in the next 24 to 72 hours, which we did see that today. The part of this that's frustrating is the list of foreign nationals that were permitted to cross today through the Rafah crossing included foreign nationals of eight countries, none of them being the United States of America. So at this point, neither the family nor I have heard of a specific departure date or time or option at the moment. In fact, Abood reached out to the U.S. embassy in Cairo maybe two to three hours ago and he was told that there is no timeline for his family to be able to depart Gaza and enter into Egypt. So I'm encouraged by the development but, as of this moment, there's still no departure option and there's still no timeline being communicated directly with the family.",

So I don't know why foreign nationals of other countries were permitted to cross but not the foreign nationals of the United States. But I'm trying to have some bit of hope that this family in the coming day or two will be able to depart. Obviously, the difficulty continues to be, every day that passes and the airstrikes continue, we don't know whether the family makes it to the next day. Abood was telling me as early as this morning, every night before they go to sleep, they both worry but at the same time try to have some hope that they'll wake up and live another day.",

Every passing day, the telecommunication issue becomes worse and we get more worried about this.Right now, the way I'm able to communicate with them has been primarily through WhatsApp text messages. Anytime I've tried to call them, the call usually drops after a few seconds. My understanding is they have U.S. cell phones with them. And if they step out into this open field that is next to where they're currently sheltering with 40 other people, they're able to pick up a bar or two by connecting with some Israeli telecommunication infrastructure. And so that's the way in which they're able to get e-mails and communicate with the outside world. But it's really difficult when they're inside the house. And it gets extremely difficult when we get into the late hours and into the evening over in Gaza. Because on top of the connectivity issue, electricity gets shut down to Gaza, so they're unable to keep a charge once they get into nighttime.",

A lot of them have never interacted with him.One of them, Susan Collins, said she had to actually Google who Mike Johnson was. And for Johnson it was an opportunity to lay out his vision for how he plans to approach the job. And we are getting a readout from some of our colleagues who've been chasing this this afternoon about what was said in that meeting. According to our colleague, Manu Raju, Speaker Johnson says that his focus is going to be on passing things that can get through the House with the support of House Republicans and worrying about reconciling with the Senate later on. And he also signaled that he would be open to additional Ukraine aid but only if his Republican conference was on board. He would not be doing that with the support of Democrats. So obviously, that is a very different approach than what Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell has taken. He has been a staunch advocate for Ukraine aid despite the fact that there are divisions within the Senate GOP over that issue. So Mitch McConnell is advocating for a broader national security package that includes Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, border security, much more similar to what Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats and the White House are pursuing. So at this moment, Jess, it is just really uncertain how the House and Senate are going to come together.",

And at this point, it doesn't look like any of those resolutions are going to pass.Just a reminder, expulsion is a really high bar. You need two-thirds of the entire chamber in order for that to succeed. But I will say that these votes are going to be very divisive. On the expulsion resolution, you have New York Republicans who are now leading the charge here. They have been impatient, waiting for the House Ethics Committee investigation to wrap up, even though the committee now says it's going to wrap up potentially by November 17th. These Republicans are worried that Santos is going to be a drag on their re-election bid. They're pressing ahead with this regardless of the fact that it likely doesn't have the votes. And then on the censure effort of Rashida Tlaib, I'm told there was a recent GOP conference call. And on that call, Young Kim, she's a congresswoman who represents a swing district in California, she spoke up on this GOP call and expressed concerns over this idea of a censure resolution. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has her own history of anti-Semitic tropes and is backing that resolution, shot back at her. Just an example of the tensions that are spilling out in public view at a time when Mike Johnson would much rather be focused on policy than personal feuds -- Jess?",

And shortly before that this morning, Kay Granger, who's the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, from Texas, she also said she was not going to run again for re-election. So now there are 21 members in all, seven Republicans who are not running. That's about on average of what it was in the last time at this cycle.

My guess is most Republicans would not join that because they need that vote still. So we'll see how this afternoon progresses.

But when they look at the data by state, they found that only one state in the entire country has seen a decline in infant deaths. That's the state of Nevada.

So those include, like preterm deliveries or preeclampsia, which is having high blood pressure during pregnancy, those deaths rose by 9 percent last year.
