Yesterday it was a magistrate judge who denied the bail application. Today it will go before the judge who will oversee this trial.Now, prosecutors say that \"Diddy\" should remain behind bars, saying that witnesses they've spoken to say that there is - that they are scared. They say that the threat of danger is acute, pointing to the weapons that were seized when they searched \"Diddy's\" homes in Los Angeles and Miami earlier this year. They also say that they have spoken to more than 50 witnesses and victims to this sexual abuse. They also said that they have dozens of recordings, video recordings, that they have from \"Diddy's\" own devices of the sex - these sex parties that were drug-fueled, where the women were allegedly forced to engage in sex with \"Diddy\" and with male prostitutes, often over several days. And that is what they're saying is the strength of the prosecution evidence, the reasons why \"Diddy\" could try to flee the country and not appear at future court appearances. Now, his attorneys are saying that this is not a sex trafficking case, but this is a relationship, a ten-year relationship, where there was a fight, where there were consensual sex acts that took place, arguing that it is not what the government is making it out to be. That Combs has previously had run-ins with the law, and he has always attended those court appearances, saying to the judge that they should trust him that he will take this seriously. He came to New York in order to surrender, although he was arrested by authorities on Monday night at his hotel room. Ultimately, it wasn't enough to satisfy the magistrate judge who said that she could not get comfortable with any conditions of release because of the types of crimes he's accused of happening occur behind closed doors. So even if there is monitoring by pretrial services, it - she said she wasn't comfortable with it. Now they'll make this case again today before the judge overseeing the case. It will be up to him to decide whether to grant Combs bail or to keep him behind bars through the duration till this gets to trial. John.",

In 2016, he said the very same thing, that he's going to bring all the auto factories back to Michigan, back to the United States. We lost manufacturing jobs. He was president for four years and he lost those manufacturing jobs. Joe Biden, as president, has been the one to bring them back. But let's - let's fact check him again. In 2020, when he was running against President Biden, he said that if Biden won there would be no more manufacturing. We've added manufacturing jobs, even in my hometown of Flint. When Trump was president, we lost 5,700 jobs in Flint, manufacturing jobs. With Joe Biden, we gained 11,000. So, look, this is a familiar promise.

Analysts at this moment think they'll do a quarter of a percentage point. Investors, far more optimistic. They see a way bigger chance of a half a percentage point cut.

It matters for our money. It matters for America's borrowers. And that's going to filter into all the things that we spend our money on in our lives. Credit cards is a great example.
