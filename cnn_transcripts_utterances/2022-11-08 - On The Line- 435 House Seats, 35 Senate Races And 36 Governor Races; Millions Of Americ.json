HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER (on camera): Finally, Election Day is here, my prayers have been answered. Of course, this could be a long Election Day, it could last into Wednesday, Thursday, who knows? But let's take a look at some of the key states that we'll be voting in that will ultimately help determine the shape of Congress. So, let's start out in Arizona, a state that took days to project the 2020 presidential winner. Interestingly in Arizona, the later counted ballots were good for the GOP in 2020, which was a reversal of what happened in 2018. And this is one of the things that we're going to be talking about and that in some states, the later count of ballots were good for the GOP and other states, they were good for the Democrats. So, let's go to one of those states where it was better for the Democrats in 2020 and 2021. You may recall that there was in fact a 2021 Senate runoff in Georgia, and it was not determined who won those runoff until the Wednesday after the election. So, it took a long time to count, took even longer in that general election back of November of 2020. Here, the later counted ballots were good for the Democrats in 2021 and in 2020. Remember, Biden kept gaining, gaining, gaining and gaining until he ultimately overtook Donald Trump. Very different from Arizona where Biden had an early advantage. And then Trump kind of kept creeping up, creeping up, creeping up until Biden barely held on. Let's go to Nevada, another state in the southwest. Again, another state that took days to project the 2020 presidential winner, the later counted ballots, like in Arizona, were good for the GOP in 2020. But we're unclear if that will hold this year. We're just going to have to wait and see, we can use the past as a guide. But it isn't always the prologue. Let's go to Pennsylvania, a state that's right near here, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, near and dear to my heart, I like the state of Pennsylvania or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I don't want to get any hate e-mails. It took days to project the 2020 presidential winner. The later counted ballots were good for Democrats in 2020. As those late mail-in ballots came in, we think that's probably going to be what happens this time around. But we're not exactly sure, but we'll keep an eye on Pennsylvania because it's such an important state in terms of control in the United States Senate. And I just want to point out some important House races with poll closings before 8:00 p.m. These districts will probably get the vote counted fairly quickly, so it could give us a good idea of where the House is going. These are all really tight races. North Carolina's 13th district, Ohio's 13th district, Virginia's seventh, and Virginia's second congressional district. These are races I'm really going to be watching. Give us a good understanding early on how the evening is going, back to you guys.",

And I agree with your correspondent who spoke before that a lot of these races in Pennsylvania is a perfect example. We're not going to know by midnight, we're not going to know by 7:00 a.m. the next morning in Georgia, which requires a run off if no one gets over 50 percent.

But people win and lose elections, you win and lose sporting events. In life itself, you get the job, if you don't get the job, you move on. And I think it's absolutely correct for news organizations to hold the candidates accountable when you've got more than half a percentage of the vote, when you've abided by all the rules and regulations of an election. When someone loses by half a percent, they still lost. And you live to fight again. And we forget to remind people that a gracious loser is as important as a victorious winner. And that with grace, and respect and dignity, you leave a proper legacy for the next generation. And unfortunately, we had an embarrassment in 2020.

There's the House in the Senate and they behave very differently in midterm elections.Senate elections don't necessarily move the way that waves do. And part of the reason for that is they're much bigger campaigns with bigger figures who often are more well-known in their state. So, one of the reasons to answer part of your question is why is it as close as Maria suggesting, because in some places, part of it is candidate quality and that Mitch McConnell did not get a lot of the Republican candidates he wanted in some of these key states. So, it's been closer. In Charlie's home state of Pennsylvania, there are scenarios you could have imagined where Republican would be running five to 10 points at five to seven points ahead now, let's say in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz isn't. In Georgia, you have the incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock who is a very strong, seen as a strong candidate. Obviously, it's a super close race because it's the most purple purple states. So, he's seen as a strong candidate. So, that's the kind of thing you see there. And in the house, overall, trends tend to matter more. The economic trends can sink an incumbent president's party and normally would push Joe Biden's party, the Democratic Party down. Now, what's keeping it maybe up could be the Dobbs ruling, maybe you know, that won't have Democrats keep the house, but it will keep them from the Obama as shellacking of what 63 seats. I can't read my writing in 2010. So, they can keep it down into the 20s or the teens there. The other thing that's happened is redistricting, which is the more and more people split the country up into these partisan camps, the fewer and fewer districts can swing back and forth. So, you may not see these well.",

She refused to say if she lost that she would accept those results. And she continuously talks about how the 2020 election was rigged. And you know, that there's got to be something there with fraud and that people need to be aware of that. Frank Luntz was talking about this. And he's absolutely right. That is something that everyone needs to be very concerned about as Americans, where I didn't agree with him as he didn't call out the Republican Party, because you have no one in the Democratic party that has ever said that they will not accept the results of an -- of an election. So, Kari Lake is like the person that represents that in the Republican Party. And I think it's dangerous, and I think it's scary. She does have a very good chance of winning, though I am told, I talked to the Hobb's campaign earlier today, that the narrative has swung more in Kari Lake's direction that what the data actually shows.

DENT: You contrast her, look at Kari Lake, she's a much more polished, media savvy version of Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania, both election deniers, but she has real skills, and frankly, her opponents seem to be a rather underwhelming candidate from what I can tell. But you contrast that to say Mastriano won Pennsylvania, you know, who's just way out there and, you know, just has run the most unconventional unorthodox campaign I've ever seen, doesn't talk to media, doesn't do anything.

He sounded confident but at the same time expressed some concern that there could be a runoff here in Georgia. Here in the state, if neither candidate gets 50 percent, a runoff is automatically triggered. That runoff would be December 6. Meanwhile, though, the Republican challenger in this, Herschel Walker, he seemed to scoff at the idea of a runoff earlier today at a rally, boldly predicting that, when it's all said and done tomorrow, he will be the rightful winner. He blasted Warnock as a \"woke\" candidate, saying that, you know, Georgians here are really tired of him choosing Joe Biden over Georgians. Look, tomorrow is going to be, or I should say, later today is going to be a real test on this theory of whether or not Georgia is a true battleground state. I know Democrats would certainly like to think so, especially after what happened here in 2020, with Joe Biden winning here, being the first Democratic presidential since Bill Clinton back in '92 to win the state.

Hit Fetterman on issues like the economy and the border and called on his supporters once again to reach out to conservative Democrats and independents, to go beyond the Republican Party and their Republican friends, to get them to come out to support Oz. Fetterman had his final pitch at a union hall in Pittsburgh, talking about sending Oz back to New Jersey. That's hitting him on this idea of him being a carpetbagger. And telling them to just get out, get out to the polls. We spoke here with the county executive, Lamont McClure, here in Northampton County, about what they expect here. They believe that turnout is going to be higher than usual, because they're seeing a lot of voter enthusiasm. They say they're ready. Here's more of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAMONT MCCLURE JR., NORTHAMPTON COUNTY EXECUTIVE: Our county council has invested heavily, in the millions of dollars, in helping us prepare to meet the new burdens in Pennsylvania of mail-in voting balloting. And so we've bought a high-speed letter opener. We have several high-speed scanners. So we've really made investments in our election infrastructure to make sure that we can not only be accurate but fast. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You could see it appear that there's a red mirage, they call it. But there could be Democratic votes that were mail-in votes that end up being counted later. And of course, Pennsylvania is a state where they're not allowed to open those mail-in ballots until 7 a.m. when the polls open -- Laura, Alisyn.",

At least right now, at this moment, the data does not show that we should be dooming and glooming. That we should actually be optimistic. We're ahead by almost 4.5 million votes. There's a poll that shows us ahead in the generic ballot. There's a poll that also shows that threats to democracy is one of the key things that people are going to the polls to think about. And like I said before, I think there is this underlying current of young people, especially women and voters of color, that are going to be coming out and talking about how important the Dobbs, Roe v. Wade decision is. Even though they are really concerned about inflation, and that things are costing more, they will go into the ballot box and say, You know what?
