But the counter to that does this move potentially put pressure on the West to provide Ukraine with some of those longer range missiles that they've been asking for and that we're anticipating the White House will soon make a decision on?",

Because really, if you look at this from the benefit of hindsight, obviously, if we could have delivered all the stuff that we've given them over the summer six months earlier, maybe Russia wouldn't have had those strong defenses prepared. And if we wait another six to nine months, what we know is the Russian forces likely to be stronger.The economic weapons against Russia, they're significant, but they're not decisive. And Russia's finding ways to work through those restrictions and through those cut offs of technology and so forth. It's getting its technology in six months, 12 months from now, they'll be stronger. The Russian military, we read a lot about their mistakes. But they're learning and you can't believe that they're going to continue to be just as ineffective as we saw them in the early days of the campaign. So this is a race. It's a race of the West and Ukraine to develop the decisive capacities to finish this war versus Putin on the other side, building up the capacity to intervene and overrun Ukraine, where it is right now.",

And he was speaking at an Economic Forum in Russia.

In fact, Russia did -- has done everything it can do to try to destroy this system, including its intervention in the 2016 election. And there's no doubt that Putin is pulling for Trump to win. But he's not so much for Trump. He is for the disintegration of the American political system and its weakness. And frankly, the strength of the American political system is a very important part of deterrence and stability globally.So when you look at what's happening in the United States today with the charges against Mr. Trump and what's going on with funding the important government bills in the Congress, you have to understand this has international implications. U.S. political stability is essential for U.S. global stability. Mr. Trump has threatened that. Putin likes that. He supports that threat.",

Because the first part of this 14th Amendment is the due process clause, bring it down to the states. We're talking about state officials making these decisions. If there is some way the Supreme Court gets to this and they say he is not qualified. I don't see that happening necessarily.What we need to do is focus on the voters. We have a Constitutional Republic of laws that essentially empowers voters to make decisions. They make good ones. They make bad ones. They generally come out OK. We have to trust the voters in this. And anybody using an electoral scheme or a constitutional interpretation to remove anybody from the ballots is going to be a dangerous precedent. Because I can guarantee you what happens, it start up from the Bork hearings in '86. One side does one thing, the other side does something else. The other side blames the last side for doing it. There will be a Republican saying, you have violated your oath of office under the Constitution. I'm barring you from the ballot. That's all we're going to see happening. We need to have grown-ups in the room look at the long term implications of these things. Whether we disagree with the individual candidate or loved a individual candidate.",

I know that. They got a birth certificate. If she's been elected twice. I know that. You know that. We all agree on that. Who is the decider of whether or not an individual has, quote/unquote, committed insurrection or given aid and comfort to those who have. You can't put the power into one individual or even a small handful. Like I said, the only other way to remove somebody from the ballot are a 2/3 vote of the United States Senate. The American people would accept that outcome. But the American people as a whole and a large section of them would freak out if all of a sudden there's individuals or small groups can remove a person from the ballot.",

So essentially, a tsunami ran through this city of more than 100,000 just washing away neighborhoods and an undetermined number of people. Of course, the latest figures coming from the Libyan Interior Ministry, the Interior Ministry loyal to the government in the east in Benghazi, saying 5,300.But the real numbers are simply unclear because access to Derna is so difficult. Because most of the roads have washed out. Many of the cell phone towers have been knocked down. Aid is beginning to arrive. Turkey sent three airplanes full of search and rescue personnel, as well as humanitarian supplies. The rival government, based in Tripoli in the West, sent a plane full of medical workers, as well as body bags. But it may be days before we get a clearer idea about the death toll, the number of missing and the true extent of damage. But the numbers the images we're seeing would indicate the situation is extremely grave. And probably going to get only worse -- Jim.",

So then it brought the eyeballs to her.But you are correct. She is not the only show -- talk show that is coming back. The Talk is coming back. The View never went away. They are back in production as well. And they've all said we're coming back, but we're going to come back and we're not going to do any writing. We're going to, you know, speak off the cuff. We're not going to break any violations for the writers strike. That is what is what is up for debate. And the debate is a strong one on both sides. I mean, there are people who are saying, listen, we want to make sure that our crews get paid. We want to make sure that we come back and we can still keep people in production.

We want them here but we do have to think about the bigger picture. And we have hundreds of people that we want to continue to be employed. So while we stand with the writers and we stand with what they are fighting for, we do want to make sure that our shows continue so people can still get paid.
