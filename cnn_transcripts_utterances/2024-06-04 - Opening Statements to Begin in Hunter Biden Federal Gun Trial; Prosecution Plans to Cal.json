Opening statements begin in one hour. The doors of the courthouse should be opening any moments, and once the proceedings get underway at 9They have photos, they have videos of what they say shows Hunter Biden using drugs and around drugs at roughly the same time that he bought that gun in October 2018. That's, of course, the heart of this case. It's against federal law for a drug user or a drug addict to buy or possess a firearm. But of course, John, as is this true in any trial, there are two sides to this story, and the defense will also get a bite at the apple. They'll get their opportunity to make opening arguments to the jury. The judge, I will be honest, in the last few weeks in the run-up to the trial, she has made their job a little bit tougher, taking away some key arguments that they wanted to make, taking away some key evidence that they wanted to introduce. But they have focused in some ways on the text of the statute. Their definition of \"addict\" in their view is not so clear, and they think they may have one or two pathways to an acquittal. John, it all kicks off 9:00 a.m. here at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. Of course, it's Joe Biden's home state, and it's his son who is on trial.",

There are texts that show that they were terrified that something horrific might happen him.And that's one of the reasons why his ex-girlfriend, Hallie Biden, who is the widow of his brother, Beau Biden, took that gun away and threw it into a dumpster 10 days after he bought it. But before we get to that part of this case, there are a bunch of federal agents who are expected to testify, someone from the DEA, and also today we are expecting an FBI agent who will probably be the vehicle that prosecutors used to introduce texts and other messages from the infamous Hunter Biden laptop.

And he is stringing together all of the things that he thinks House Republicans are doing unfairly, that he believes that they are trying to defend particular department investigations, such as special counsels offices, that they are spreading conspiracy theories about the department's work, trying to tie the Justice Department to the state prosecution of Donald Trump in New York that resulted in a conviction of the former president just a couple days ago, and that they are also trying to intimidate the work of agents and people within the Justice Department by spreading additional misleading and false information about them. So Merrick Garland is saying now certain members of this committee, the House Judiciary and the Oversight Committee, are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining for no legitimate purpose sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations. So he's saying I'm not backing down. I'm not giving you that audio tape at this time. And I am having an issue with what you guys are doing in the bigger picture of things right now politically.

      "sentences": "Well, the reaction is mixed, John.It is like most announcements involving the border. There are some individuals who support what the president is about to do, and others who don't. Now, there is a group of mayors that have confirmed that they will be at the White House for this event. They are very supportive of the president and that includes the Brownsville mayor. Brownsville is in South Texas. Now, that mayor issued a statement saying in part: \"President Joe Biden is expected to unveil an executive order that may notably impact migrants' ability to seek asylum along the US southern border.\" Now this may or like many other officials are not commenting on camera yet. They are waiting for the president to make this announcement. They want to make sure that they know the details of this executive order. And then, there is another group of officials, like some mayors who are upset about what is happening at the White House today, what is expected to happen. They believed that it is a little too little too late. They don't think that this is going to have the impact that it should have. And some of them are upset because they weren't invited to the White House. That's the case of the El Cajon mayor. That is in Southern California. That mayor issuing a statement saying, in part: \"This is nothing but a sham in an insult to those of us dealing with the real consequences of his failed border policies.\" Now the White House would argue that no executive action will fix all the ills on the US southern border. That what is required is Congress to act, that only Congress can achieve comprehensive immigration reform.  Now the other thing that is very curious about the timing of this announcement is the number of migrant apprehensions at the US southern border. We are not in December when there was a migrant surge at a time when Customs and Border Protection announced that migrant apprehensions were about 250,000 just in that month alone. The latest numbers according to US Customs and Border Protection in April, that number was about 128,000. I talked to a source yesterday who says that the number has dropped even more last month, and so it is curious and some of the people that I've talked to here in the Rio Grande Valley point to just that to say that this move is political by the Biden administration. Now, we know very little about this executive order, but what we do know is that it is expected do we reminiscent of a Trump era rule that using an authority known as 212-F, that clamped on illegal immigration. Now, that particular measure from back in 2018 was shut down in the courts. The challenge was led by the ACLU. I talked to the lead attorney who led that challenge, and here is what he said about the Biden administration now, trying to do something similar. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think the key thing here, Kate, to look at is the timeline and look at the trend line here, because back in June of 2020, Biden was actually trusted more on the question of border security and immigration by a single point. Look at where we are in May of 2024. My goodness gracious. Look at this huge jump that Donald Trump has gotten. He is now a head on this issue by 27 percentage points. So it is not just that immigration is more at the top of voters' minds than it was four years ago, it is that who they trust on the issue has changed tremendously. I look at a lot of questions, I dig into the cross tabs a lot. The fact that you see a 30-point shift, I am used to seeing ten, fifteen, maybe 2-point shifts, but basically are 30-point shift, 28 points if you want to be exact, that is very, very different from a lot of other polling question.",

Well, this is quite something. I tis a number that always seems to surprise me no matter how often I look at it. In fact, they slightly -- more of them support Donald Trump at 47 percent than Joe Biden at 44 percent.
