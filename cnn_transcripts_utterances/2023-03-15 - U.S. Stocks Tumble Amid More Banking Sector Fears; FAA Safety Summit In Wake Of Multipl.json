But it has been a rocky day to say the least. Obviously, this coming after a big sell-off in European markets over banking concerns as well over there.",

But it comes at a time when there are a lot of people nervous and questioning the state and health of the global financial system.And like some of these regional banks, there is concern that some of the European banks though they may be well capitalized and stronger, also hold a lot of long term treasury that has been devalued as we have seen interest rate hikes go up around the world. How much should Americans be focused on the health of larger financial institutions in Europe and the United States right now?",

In the world after the financial crisis over a decade ago lots of reforms were put into place and these large institutions have been required to build a lot of capital.That's the cash cushion that they hold to digest any losses they might suffer on their lending or securities. So, they're in really good shape. I don't see any problem there. You know, obviously institutions overseas, it depends. It depends on the -- where we're talking about in the institution but generally even globally, I think because of what happened in the financial crisis over a decade ago most places in the world have instituted reforms that make their banking system stronger. And you know, obviously, you know, what matters most to most Americans are our banks, particularly our large, financial institutions. And again, you know, they're on very solid ground.",

But to be clear, today's summit is really just the start of this sweeping safety review of the entire U.S. aviation industry in the wake of those close calls you mentioned.And this morning we heard from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg who stressed that the U.S. has the safest, most complex aviation system in the world and, yet they are seeing this uptick in alarming incidents and more mistakes than usual happening across the system and happening on runways. Here's what he told our colleague Pete Muntean just a little earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

First the head of the Air Traffic Controllers Union pointed to an alarming staffing issue that they're down roughly 1,200 certified controllers from a decade ago. The acting FAA administrator responding to that is saying they're working to fix it. Now on pace to hire 1,500 controllers this year and another 1,800 next year.And we also heard the chair of the NTSB speak quite critically of inaction by other federal regulators, saying that her agency has made seven recommendations in recent years just on runway collisions that at this point have not been enacted. She told the crowd, quote, how many times are we going to have the -- have to issue the same recommendations over and over and over again? So, Victor, Bianna, you can hear the frustration that some of these agencies are feeling as all of these incidents are unfolding.",

      "sentences": "Well, the secretary and the administrator, the acting administrator, were largely talking in generalities and platitudes this morning. The only person that went forward with specific steps to be taken today to make the skies safer was Jennifer Homendy from the NTSB.As Mr. Cohen pointed out there are seven open recommendations on runway incursions that go back years. The FAA needs to either act on these recommendations or identify why they're not acting. Secondly, she pointed out that the most important step was extending the recording time of the cockpit voice recorders from two hours to 25 hours. They don't have the information to decipher and determine what happened at these events because the recorders only record two hours and they don't catch the event because they record over them. Those two steps alone can advance safety today if they were implemented. BLACKWELL: Those are action items, right. The things that people can do, be held accountable if they do not. But they're recommendations. Why can't they become regulations especially that regardless of party people don't want their airplanes clipping one another, God forbid there is something more serious that happens on the runway.",

      "sentences": "That's right. The system that we have in place is the NTSB as an independent agency makes recommendations to the FAA. The FAA has a period of time to either respond affirmatively or to explain why they're not responding. And they frankly have not responded on runway incursions effectively.So, there are seven recommendations that the NTSB has sitting out there that have not been acted on. And I think if the secretary wanted to take a step immediately, he would ask acting administrator Nolan to report back to his office on the status of all open NTSB recommendations that are older than six months and say, why aren't they being implemented? Why can't we do these today?",
