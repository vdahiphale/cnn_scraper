Trump had that post last week, saying he was going to be arrested on Tuesday. That didn't ultimately happen.And we're told that people in Trump's -- in his camp were caught off- guard because his legal team and others have kind of been speculating over the last several days about what the Manhattan district attorney was doing: wondering, was this case falling apart, why had they not heard anything. Sources said that Trump's legal team had been kind of arguing amongst themselves, that if the D.A. is trying to prove Trump committed this crime of falsifying business records, that he was potentially missing a key element when it came to the intent to defraud. They were talking about that. They also questioned the timing. A lot of the political aspect of this political allies of Trump's were asking what's taking so long. Trump had that rally in Waco, Texas, over the weekend when he told reporters on his plane on the way, quote, this of the Manhattan district attorney's office: \"I think they've already dropped the case. It's a fake case. Some fake cases, they have absolutely nothing.\" Obviously, that did not happen. Trump has now been indicted. When news of the indictment came down yesterday, the former president was at Mar-a-Lago. They had been prepping these political attacks on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. They were caught off-guard when it actually came out. They saw it in news reports before it actually had been confirmed to them by the D.A.'s office. But even as Trump and his legal team had been speculating that the case may not go forward, may not have a ton of merits, they still have been bracing for an indictment. We should know they have not actually seen the indictment yet, either. It is still under seal. They're kind of basically as in the dark as the rest of us at this point. Of course, we are in these uncharted waters, with a former president of the United States now being indicted. This has never happened before. So to help us put all of this in context, I want to turn now to Elie Honig, who is the CNN senior legal analyst and the former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. You know a thing or two about how all of this is going down behind closed doors. but the historic nature of this can't be understated.",

      "sentences": "We are living history. This is the kind of thing they will be teaching in law schools decades from now.So let's start with the facts here, because any a good legal analysis, you have to start with the facts. This all circulates around two hush-money payments that were made by Donald Trump, or people around him to two women who alleged that they had had affairs with Donald Trump. Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 Karen McDougal was paid $150,000. Now it's important to note these actual alleged affairs happened years before: 2006 for Stormy Daniels, 2006 to 2007 for Karen McDougal. And nearly a decade later, we all remember that moment in June of 2015 when Donald Trump came down that elevator and announced his presidential bid. Now really important meeting happens two months after that, August 2015. Donald Trump meets with Michael Cohen, who will be important witness in this case, and David Pecker, who also has testified in the grand jury. Now, David Pecker is in charge of AMI, the company that publishes \"The National Enquirer,\" and they talk about how they need to catch and kill these damaging stories; pay for these stories and then not run them. And then a couple months after that, Karen McDougal's story is paid for by AMI, by \"The Enquirer,\" by Pecker. It is caught and killed. They pay for it. They do not run it. Then we all remember that moment about a month before the election when the \"Access Hollywood\" tape came out, Donald Trump caught on tape making inflammatory comments. And then just days after that, they work out a catch and kill arrangement with Stormy Daniels. The way this one works is Michael Cohen pays Stormy Daniels $130,000. And then he gets reimbursed by a series of checks that get paid by Donald Trump and the Trump Organization over about a year after the election. So that's the way these payments were all set up, and that's what leads us to the case here now.",

We're talking now this indictment of Donald Trump is by the state prosecutors across the street. But back in 2018, Michael Cohen was prosecuted federally. He ended up pleading guilty to campaign finance crimes relating to these very same payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Michael Cohen also pled guilty to unrelated perjury, tax fraud and financial fraud. And really important moment, the Justice Department, the Southern District of New York, when it came time for Michael Cohen's sentencing, here's what they said in their letter to the judge: \"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted with respect to both payments to Daniels and McDougall, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual One.\" Of course, we know Individual One is Donald Trump.

We could have some different laws with important differences.Let me walk you through what some of those state laws could be here. Donald Trump, first of all, we don't know. We've not seen this indictment. But if they are based on these hush-money payments, important to understand? Hush-money payments are not criminal themselves. The potential state misdemeanor here is for falsification of business records. Were these payments falsely logged as legal fees? Now that's a misdemeanor. That's a low-level offense. However, if prosecutors can tie the falsification of business records to some other crime, then it becomes a felony, a much more serious offense maximum of four years, although the sentence could still be nothing. So what could that other crime be? One of the theories is that it could be related to campaign finance violations. A little bit of a legal question about whether state prosecutors can charge something relating to a federal election, the election for president. We have not seen that indictment. What we do know, thanks to our outstanding reporting team, is that there are over 30 charges in that indictment. We haven't seen them yet.

Because you know this.You know, this all happened on -- what was it -- October 28. It was in the closing hours, practically, of the campaign. And it's not clear whether or not that little additional piece of information, after the \"Access Hollywood\" scandal, would have made much of a difference. But certainly, people within the Trump campaign, close to the ex- president, thought it was important enough to hurry up and get the hush-money paid and get the thing signed and make sure that nobody would talk about it. So, you know, in a very close election, perhaps it made a difference. Perhaps it didn't. We'll never -- we'll never know. What we know for sure, though, is that, you know, people are going to have to make a decision. Does this matter? Does it not matter? Does criminal business fraud make a difference or not? Are we going to take one more step and say we're going to re-elect someone who's been found guilty, has been impeached twice; found -- run an organization that was found guilty of criminal tax fraud; has been criminally indicted personally? Are we going to take that new step into the unknown? It's -- that's a very different question from, you know, sort of trying to smear Alvin Bragg, trying to smear the rule of law, trying to downplay the idea that, you know, criminal business fraud is no big deal.
