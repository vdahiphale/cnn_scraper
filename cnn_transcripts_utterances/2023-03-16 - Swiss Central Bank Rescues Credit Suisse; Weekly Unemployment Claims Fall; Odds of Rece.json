She is the first Biden administration official to appear before the Senate. Global markets have been rattled by problems at another bank. Credit Suisse has been propped up by over $54 million from the Swiss central bank. This a look at where it is standing right now, as Christine Romans is watching all of this for us.

And you can see the propeller is spinning there and it is working fine. It is the second clip that shows what happened here and the Russian denial does not hold water. The jet approaches again. Once again it dumps fuel. As it hits the drone, video is disrupted a little bit. But when it comes back online, you can see that the damaged propeller with the bent end. And this is the telling signal where you can see the collision of the Russian fighter jet or the effects between the Russian fighter jet and the drone itself. For context, we have learned from two U.S. officials familiar with intelligence behind the matter, the orders to harass the drone, the orders for the Russian fighter pilots, came from highest levels of the Russian ministry of defense; to harass, disrupt the drone. They say it is not clear that it went higher than that. Not clear that president Vladimir Putin knew it would happen. But it is telling that the officials are telling us that the highest levels of the Russian ministry of defense gave the orders to harass the U.S. drone over the Black Sea. And then the drone went down according, to U.S. Air Force Europe some 70-80 miles southwest of Crimea. And the video itself is giving support to the U.S. side and the U.S. position, narrative of what happened here and seriously undercuts the Russian claims that there had been no collision, which is what the Russian ambassador to the U.S. said when he was summoned to the State Department on the day the story came out.

But what makes this important is not the loss of a drone but this is what it means to defend the so-called international rules-based order, international airspace, freedom of navigation and claims to territorial waters.

This affects all of us, not just in and around Ukraine. It's also important to see the example of the United States with transparency immediately releasing the video, saying this is what happened. And you and your team there have done a great job of making it clear what happened. You can be sure that the two Russian aircraft have video capability. And if they were in fact not guilty of what is clear that they have done, no doubt the Kremlin would have rolled out that video immediately to make their case. And we have not seen any of that.

I have not been impressed over the last 14 months with the level of training and discipline of Russian pilots.It is one thing to take off and land and fly close to something. But when you are talking about getting up next to another aircraft, getting as close as they did there with turbulence and things that can happen, the chances of a mistake are very high. I don't know that they intended to actually hit it. I am sure that what they wanted to do was to cause it to fail or disrupt the operations by dumping fuel on it, which, in itself, obviously, that was a deliberate act. To actually hit it, of course, we don't know. But when you are that close, those are the kind of things that can happen. And again, this is the same military that is committing war crimes every day in Ukraine and it is reflecting also a very brutal ruthless sort of society there.
