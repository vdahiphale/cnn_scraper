Those are the markets and these are the main events. The Princess of Wales announces her first public appearance since Christmas. The head of the Cleveland Fed speaks to Richard Quest, Loretta Mester says the Central Bank is trying to balance both sides of its dual mandate maintaining price stability and maximum employment. And Europe's biggest football tourney begins. Germany is currently leading Scotland, three-nil. We will keep you up-to-date on that live from New York, it is Friday, June 14th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. So tonight, the Princess of Wales says she will make her first public appearance Saturday since her cancer diagnosis. Catherine announced she is making good progress in her recovery. Kensington palace released this new photo. You see it there of her taken earlier this week in Windsor. She is expected to appear on the balcony at the King's official birthday parade Saturday. The Princess said, in her message that she is \"not out of the woods\" yet. Our Royal correspondent, Max Foster, is outside Buckingham Palace where she will be making that appearance hopefully tomorrow. And Max, good to see you. She has committed to the event tomorrow. No doubt, a boost for the entire Royal family and I dare say maybe even the country, but what is the timing tell you here about this very last minute announcement? And also carefully choreographed, including that very evocative picture we just saw.",

      "sentences": "The photo was taken in Windsor as you say, earlier this week. I think the timing, there has been this ongoingdebate about whether or not she would appear at Trooping the Colour because lots of people saw that as a good time for her to appear. The palace would never confirm or deny that. So I think, it has probably been considered for some time, but it is entirely based on how she feels and as she said, she has good days and bad days when you feel weak and tired, you have to give in to your body resting, but on your good days when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well. I think, she just got to the point where she does want to start getting back to normal. We've seen her doing that behind-the-scenes, visits to school for example, trying to support the family. She started doing some work from home behind-the-scenes, and now she feels ready to come out in public and this was a good opportunity to support the King. He says he is delighted that she can make it and its manageable. We will see her come out from the palace tomorrow morning in a carriage with the children. I think the optics of that are deliberate because she is putting the children first, not this whole process. She will go up and watch the parade, come back in the carriage, and then she will appear on the balcony with the rest of the family to show that she is still present and it is a big moment because we haven't seen her since last year at a public engagement. But she may decide tomorrow is a bad day. Her doctors might decide it is a bad day and say, she shouldn't appear. So they are taking each day as it comes. So whilst they are considering more engagements going into the summer, I think we will have to just wait and see as to whether she can turn up.",

Max Foster, for us, outside Buckingham Palace, really appreciate it. We go now to our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is with me now and we really appreciate you being here because people do have a lot of questions, right? A lot of curiosity and concern about her condition. Now, Princess Kate has not disclosed what kind of cancer she has, but she has revealed that she started, as Max was just saying there, preventative chemotherapy. She said that in February. What does that mean? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, some of this might be semantics. I mean, when someone has cancer, if they have had an operation, for example, to try and address that cancer, remove it. Depending on the type, there is sometimes the idea that there are cancer cells left behind. So preventative chemotherapy, or what is also called adjuvant chemotherapy, is to try and address those remaining cancer cells, Paula, that's basically what that means. And we know going back, if you look at the timeline, going back to January is when she had that initial operation. At first they thought, you may remember that it was not cancer, but then I think after a closer examination, probably they decided and realized that it was cancer and that is when she had that hospitalization, started the chemotherapy at the end of February. And now we are hearing from her saying that this is likely to go on for a few more months. That is, depending on the type of cancer, this is what we know, this timeline. What we don't know still is the type of cancer, the stage of cancer, the medications that she is getting for this cancer, just sort of what you heard in the statement that Max just read that over the next few months, likely she is going to continue receiving chemotherapy depending on what it is, chemo can sometimes go several months. So that is kind of what we know and what we don't know.",

I mean, I think as you pointed out with Max, you know, just dealing with this as a family and with small children and thenin the public eye like this, I have a lot of patients who are very reluctant to talk about their cancers and they are not in the public eye. I think out of the woods, not being out of the woods probably refers to a couple of things. One is how well is the chemotherapy working? Treatment still necessary. They may be doing assessments, imaging, or something from periodically to sort of determine is this chemotherapy actually doing what its intended to do? But I think the second thing is sort of the factors that you see on the screen there, Paula, when you're getting chemo, I mean, you can change in terms of things how fatigued you are, mood, physical sort of impact of the chemotherapy, that can change not just day-to-day, but even hour-to-hour. And so the idea that someone could be doing well on Tuesday and then have a tough day on Wednesday is not unusual. And I think that's -- so I think those two things are really what she probably means by not out of the woods, still seeing how the chemo works and acknowledging the side effects.",

It has gotten better. And again, it depends what the chemo is, but people can tolerate chemotherapy much better than they could a decade ago, for example, with other medications and different dosing and things like that of the chemotherapy.

The compromise seems to really come from the fact that, you know, you have a communique here, 39 pages long. This was on the 33rd page, not everyone gets everything that they want and we don't know where the compromise was. Did Meloni compromise on exercise -- did she want to exercise more language from the Hiroshima Communique where it was the 43rd paragraph of that communique back then? Did she want to exercise all of that language? And did she compromise on some of the language that she allowed in? The idea that sexual and reproductive health rights for all should be there -- should it be this comprehensive? Did she compromise on that? Or was the compromise on something else? Some other area of the G7 communique? We just don't know, but this is what White House officials were indicating earlier that this would be arrived at by a compromise, and I despite the fact that President Biden did want the language of abortion in there, the White House appears to believe that this is okay, that this has worked out for what they want as well. We know that the French President Emmanuel Macron, actually when asked by an Italian journalist what he thought about the fact that abortion wasn't going to be in there, he said that he was disappointed, but that he also respected the wishes of the Italian people. So yes, contentious, but the idea of these G7s is that the leaders walk away generally satisfied across the platform. But this is one where President Biden on this very key electoral issue for him back home, could potentially face some pushback. We don't know what his answer will be tonight here.",

We saw labor market conditions very healthy, still; payroll growth very healthy, but we are seeing that come into better balance and we are seeing inflation that was basically stalling out a little bit in the first couple of months of the year, but in the last couple of readings, starting to resume coming down.

They've won this tournament three times in the past, but none since 1996. But I think they fancy their chances this time around, they're certainly among the favorites and they will just be delighted with the way that this game went. Scotland, to be honest, really couldn't get much of a look in. The Germans were ahead after just 10 minutes, two-nil up after 19 minutes, three-nil at halftime. Their fourth goal scored by Niclas Fullkrug might end up being the goal of the tournament. It certainly will be a contender. It was just such an absolutely brilliant finish.

There are so many great teams. The standard of play in this tournament is usually pretty high. So, I just think we have so much to look forward to. Can Italy defend their title? Remember, they won in the final three years ago. They beat England on penalties. They're not among the top group of favorites. A lot of people actually have England down as the favorites to win the tournament which is an England supporter. Makes me a little bit nervous because that kind of thing just sounds like it's too good to be true. Portugal, could they do it again? They won it in 2016. Cristiano Ronaldo at the age of 39 is still scoring brilliant goals. So, they'll be fun to watch. Look out for the French as well. They didn't do so well in the last euros, but they've played in the last two World Cup finals. And remember, they won it in 2018 and they came within a whisker of being back-to-back world champions in Qatar a couple of years ago. So, the French with Killian Mbappe will be very, very good too.
