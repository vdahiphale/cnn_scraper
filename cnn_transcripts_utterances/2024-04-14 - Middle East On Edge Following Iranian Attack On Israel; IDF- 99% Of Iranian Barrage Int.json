And welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world for our special live coverage of Iran's attack on Israel.And we begin with the breaking news right now the world on edge. Following an unprecedented attack against Israel by Iran. For the first time, Iran launched a direct assault on Israeli territory threatened to escalate an already volatile situation in the Middle East. The variety sent waves of explosive drones and ballistic missiles. A response Iran says for a deadly attack at an Iranian consulate in Damascus earlier this month. A coalition of the Israel Defense Forces the IDF, including the U.S. and the UK, shot down nearly all of the more than 300 munitions, whose missiles and rockets and missiles launched by Iran. Now the world is waiting to see how Israel will respond. The Israeli war cabinet met today with one member calling to quote, exact a price over Iran assault, and the United Nations Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting in the next few hours. We're also getting new details right now about that phone conversation between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Biden affirming that the United States is iron clyde's (ph) -- iron close -- iron clad support for Israel exists. But telling Netanyahu the United States will not repeat -- not participate in any offensive action against Iran. I want to bring in our team of excellent reporters who are covering the story from around the world monitoring all the late breaking developments for the Middle East, as well as here in Washington. And let's go to our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, first she's in Tel Aviv for us. Clarissa first of all, is there any indication at least at this point of what Israel's response will look like?",

It's now over, there hasn't been any kind of formal announcement, people waiting to hear some kind of a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We did hear from Central War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz earlier who said that essentially, Israel was hoping to put together a regional coalition and that it would exact a price on Iran at the time and in the manner of its own choosing. So, the question now becomes, what does that response look like?Certainly, we are seeing a lot of pressure from certain quarters politically, particularly. Netanyahu's right-wing coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, calling Benny Gantz's comments, hollow Western catchphrases, saying that it was important to have a robust, strong response to essentially reinstate a real deterrent. At the same time, though, Ben-Gvir (INAUDIBLE) and others are not part of that war cabinet. And it does seem the longer we wait, the more time Israel takes to make this decision, that potentially it is pursuing a course of precision calibration, listening to the strong words of guidance that have been given from President Biden at the White House, urging restraint and not to escalate, making it clear that the U.S. would not be part of any retaliatory strike against Iran. At this stage, things here are getting back to some sense of normalcy, but schools will remain close, Wolf, the airport open here, but in Iran airports and civilian aircraft, not operational through Monday, as everyone in the region keenly awaits and Israeli response, Wolf.",

Hezbollah which has threatened to retaliate against Israel for the bombing of Iran consulate Damascus issued a statement saying the attacks were in support of Palestinians in Gaza. All this comes after the IDF says it carried out airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including a large military complex. The stepped-up attacks are raising concerns that the war in Gaza could quickly spread throughout the region.We have team coverage and how the region is responding right now. Our Scott McLean is in Istanbul, Turkey. But let's begin with Ben Wedeman, he's in Beirut, Lebanon for us. Ben, Hezbollah, just released a statement praising Iran's attack on Israel.

And so, I just want to read you what this diplomatic source told me. They said, quote, the Iranian side informed us about the options in advance. Possible developments were also discussed during the call with Blinken, which was on Wednesday, by the way. The American side convened --conveyed to Iran through us that the reaction should remain within certain limits. In response, Iran said that the response would be a retaliation to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus, and would not go beyond that. And Wolf, we also know, again, through diplomatic sources in Turkey, that the Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan spoke with his Iranian counterpart today, again, with a message of de-escalation, they do not want to see an inflammation of tensions in this region.

And you have the Saudis who said this, in part, the Foreign Ministry said this, in part, the UN Security Council must act to prevent the crisis from escalating which would have grave consequences if it expands. And the Egyptian foreign ministry seemed to indicate that all of this was rather predictable, saying, quote, The escalation is nothing but a direct result of what Egypt has repeatedly warned about, regarding the dangers of expanding the conflict in the region, as a result of the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip and the provocative military actions being exercised in the region.Of course, it's not clear which side that's referring to that last line.

The Israeli war cabinet, I'm told, is still determined to respond to Iran, but it is -- has yet to decide on the timing and the scope of such a military response.One of the key dilemmas I'm told that is facing the war cabinet is exactly when to respond to Iran, in part because there is still a war going on in Gaza that the Israeli cabinet, including the Israeli prime minister has been, has said that they are determined to continue to carry out and to expand, including with a potential major ground defensive into Rafah. I'm told that this war cabinet meeting Wolf ended with the Israeli military being tasked with coming up with additional options for how to respond to the threat from Iran to this attack that was carried out by Iran. So, a lot still to be determined.

But it is quite a significant development, especially in light of the fact that over the course of the last several weeks, we have seen the Israeli military draw down its military presence on the ground in Gaza, most notably, last week, the Israeli military withdrawing all of its forces from Southern Gaza after completing its military operations in that southern city of Khan Younis. Until now, there has only been really one Israeli military brigade remaining inside the Gaza Strip. And that is the brigade that is -- is basically managing the Netzarim Corridor, which separates northern Gaza from the rest of the Gaza Strip, and in its call up order tonight, the Israeli military saying that it is calling up two additional reserve brigade specifically for central Gaza.And so that may mean additional security measures that are being taken along that corridor. We also know Wolf that this comes as we saw today that many Palestinians had started to try and make their way back into northern Gaza. The Israeli military appeared based on reports on the ground to have allowed some of those Gazans women and children to return to northern Gaza, but a chaotic situation did indeed ensue. And so perhaps this is a measure designed to provide additional security for those types of operations. There is also of course, Wolf, the fact that the Israeli government has continued to vow that they will press on with a major offensive in Rafah, I don't think that two reserve brigades will be anywhere close to enough to carry out the kind of major ground defensive that they have been talking about. But it could potentially Wolf, be a prelude to one of the things that needs to happen before that ground defensive is evacuating civilians from Rafah to the central part of the Gaza Strip.

It's just incredible between the drones and the SAMs, right and the cruise and ballistic missiles.

There's nothing really in it that should give anyone any pause, except the issue of his intent and whether the falsification of the business records was intending to interfere with the election. That's really the important thing here because it makes what would otherwise be misdemeanors into felonies. So that's the only even halfway challenging case.The real challenge here though, is of course, again, can you see the fair jury? What will jurors think of Michael Cohen, who is corroborated by other evidence, but it's so polarizing has such obvious distaste for his former boss? And that's really -- and then the other question, of course, is will trump testify? And if he testifies, man, that will be the blockbuster and that will really impact the jury, whether you know, however it goes, especially cross examination.",
