The court just issued four opinions, but they gave the country reason to keep paying attention by holding back blockbuster opinions on Donald Trump, executive power, insurrectionists and abortion. And new fear unlocked. U.S. officials warned all-out war between ally Israel and terror group has blogged could render the Iron Dome a scrap heap. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, brand new information on next week's CNN debate. And now everything will look when you turn on CNN one week from today. President Biden won a coin flip this morning to determine who stands where on the stage. He chose screen right. Donald Trump will appear on the left. The Trump campaign then got to choose the order of closing statements and decided that Biden will go first, and Trump will get the final word. And critically, it will be just the two men on stage. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not qualify for next week showdown. Later today, President Biden will head to Camp David to begin an intensive week of debate prep. And we have new details on how that prep is going for both candidates. So, I want to get straight to CNN's Kayla Tausche, who is live at the White House. So, Kayla, what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Manu, President Biden is going to be arriving at Camp David late this evening. He plans to huddle there through the weekend with aides in preparation sessions that sources say could lead right into the debate on Thursday, with the White House preserving the possibility that the president travels directly to Atlanta from Camp David, depending on how much prep they see as still required.Now, that structure is going to evolve over the course of these next few days, starting with sort of informal conversations about topics, material, policies, potential questions, potential responses, and potential rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. That is going to culminate in the next few days into formal 90-minute mock debates where the president is going to be on his feet, expected to be responding to the draft set of questions that his team has put together. And while the team is still compiling the list of which Trump responses they're going to be practicing with. There is one that has stood out in some of my conversations with sources and that is Trump's comments in December 2023, that he'll be a dictator on day one, expect President Biden to respond directly to that. Now the debate is going to be testing the Biden teams' theory of the case that voters have been largely disengaged until now. And so, they think that it's going to be a workable strategy to retread some old Trump material to put it on the radar of voters. And it's going to be the first debate for either candidate since the last election. And President Biden is leaning on some familiar territory, roughly the same aides will be in the room led by Ron Klain. And sources say Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney, who stood in for former President Trump four years ago in those practice debates could easily replay that role, though casting, Manu, is still open.",

And, and for both of these individuals, it'll be interesting to see how they can -- how they can sort of meet that challenge. Is Trump ready for this? I mean, I know that the Biden campaign and Biden states, they are focused on honing in on not only his record, but also recent statements that he's made as well. They want to put a spotlight, not just on Biden's time in office, but almost make this sort of a assessment, if you will, of the -- state of the country when Trump was president. You know, I do think one area in particular that I know Biden's aides are preparing him to on is with these recent executive actions on immigration. One on enforcement at the border, one providing relief to undocumented immigrants in the country. They think that that in turn, just as an example of this can put a spotlight on Trump's approach to that policy, which was family separation.

And Watergate involves the sitting president under an active criminal investigation.I understand the stakes here. But let's put this in perspective. The Trump immunity case, first of all, was the last case argued. All the other cases that Joan referenced, were all argued many months before. Second of all, it's completely normal to get this sort of case dumped in late June, sometimes into early July. This is when we get the big decisions. Third of all, everyone relax. We are going to have this opinion within -- maybe tomorrow, maybe within a week, but sometime really soon. And finally, if you look at the actual timeframe here, the Trump immunity decision was rendered at the district court, Judge Chutkan in December. To go from a district court ruling to a Supreme Court ruling in seven months is lightning speed. I understand everyone wants this as soon as possible. I understand the widely felt, not universal, but widely felt desire to get this case back to the District Court. So, if there's going to be a trial, it can be held before the election. But I think people are sort of maybe venting some anxiety inappropriately at the Supreme Court. By the way, if you want to vent it somebody, look at DOJ who took two and a half years to charge this case, not the Supreme Court that's taking a grand total of a few months to decide it.",

Just to go back to what you were saying Elie, as well, in terms of the politics of this, some of the anxiety that I think people are venting when it comes to some of these decisions that have to do with Trump are directly connected to just how seismic timing is politically for these decisions.
