We're just hours away from Vice President Kamala Harris addressing the nation after President elect Donald Trump reached the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White house.This is CNN's special coverage of Election Day in America. Continue. Donald Trump makes history winning a second term. We have learned that Kamala Harris has actually now reached out to President Elect Trump and she will speak publicly at 4:00 p.m. Eastern. More on that coming up in just a few moments. Republicans have also seized control of the U.S. Senate for the first time in four years. The House of Representatives is still too close to call. Let's take a look at the numbers that we're seeing right now. You can see in the U.S. Senate right now, 52 Republicans, 42 Democrats, six seats remaining outstanding, three Republican pickups in the Senate as you can see right there. In the House of Representatives, you need 218 to control the House right now. The Republicans have 204. The Democrats 182. Democrats have two pickups. The Republicans so far, five pickups, 49 seats remaining, undeclared so far in the U.S. House of Representatives. There are also several battleground states still uncalled. Stand by for our key race alert right now. All right, let's take a look at some of these states where we still haven't made a projection. In Michigan right now, 15 electoral votes, 99 percent of the estimated vote is in. Donald Trump maintains the lead, 49.8 percent to 48.3 percent. His lead is a little bit more than 83,000 votes in Michigan right now. In Arizona, another key state, 11 electoral votes, 63 percent of the estimated voted vote is in. Trump has 51.9 percent, Kamala Harris 47.2 percent. He has a lead of more than a little bit more than 100,000 votes over Kamala Harris in Arizona. In Nevada, where the 89 percent of the estimated vote is in, Trump maintains a lead, 51.7 percent to 46.6 percent. His lead is almost 65,000 votes in Nevada, with its six electoral votes. I want to start our coverage right now, this hour with CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's over at Trump campaign headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida, not far from Mar-a-Lago. Kristen, you have some new reporting about Trump allies pitching themselves for key roles. What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, we do know that Kamala Harris will be at some point reaching out to Donald Trump to formally concede that. We expect to happen before the vice president actually publicly addresses the American people. We've yet to hear from her. She didn't appear at her own election night party last night.You know, this goes without saying, this has been a very tough night, a very tough morning for Democrats in the Harris campaign. I think there is the shock element to this. Even though a lot of folks thought that this could be a very close race, I think a lot of folks did not expect sort of the scope of her defeat. And then there's just the sense of dread that this is only just the beginning. They are now anticipating everything that could come from another four years of Donald Trump at the White House. And I am told that there was a campaign call featuring the senior most people on the Harris campaign, usually this is led by the campaign chair general, Molly Dillon, I'm told by one participant that it was filled with tears. They were trying to be supportive to everyone on the campaign. And there was an acknowledgment, I am told, of everything that the campaign had gone through and sort of the unusual nature, of course, of this campaign, it having been so truncated. This is something that I think we will be talking about a lot. One senior adviser I was talking to earlier in the day said the Harris campaign ended up being, in their view, the Biden campaign, with Harris at the top of the ticket. It was essentially the Biden campaign just with new posters. As we are looking at the results of last night and processing everything, it is very clear that this was such a repudiation of the last four years of Joe Biden. And I think a lot of Democrats are wondering, did the Harris campaign do enough to really separate herself from the Biden administration and will that have even made a difference in the end if she had gone that path?",

There is no true leader for the Democratic Party. And if you look at across the board, who is the leader for the party, you would have to say it would be Chuck Schumer. I think that our friend Manu can talk even more to that about how he what his power will be. But if you assume now, if we're assuming that Republicans take control of the House, they will control the House, the Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court in four years to another conservative on the Supreme Court. So the Democratic Party right now, they can do all the backstabbing and the knifing, as we always see in a campaign. But the reality is they better get their act together and they better get it together quick because right now they are going to get steamrolled by Republicans.",

We have a CNN projection that's going on in Michigan. Take a look at this right now. CNN projects that President elect Donald Trump will win the state of Michigan and its 15 electoral votes. It's another important sign of just how sweeping his win has been. This is the third of the so called blue wall states to be won by Trump after Pennsylvania and Wisconsin both went his way. Trump won them eight years ago, but lost those states to Joe Biden back in 2020. Let's take a closer look at the numbers right now. We'll show you what we have.

It is another sign of how dominant his victory has been. Why we use the word landslide, it wasn't eking it out in the battlegrounds. It was overwhelming. Michigan's votes were not needed for Trump to win. And yet that just is icing to the cake. Adding to that electoral vote dominance, which now stands at 291 votes. It is the third of the so called blue wall states he has won along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.And my panel is back with me. So, Kate, let's just start with Michigan. I mean, and you even saw it in Minnesota where despite having the vice president from Minnesota, Harris dramatically underperformed what Biden had done four years ago in Minnesota. She wins it. But just to show this was overwhelming, my favorite map is looking at the country and seeing the little arrows of which way things went. And it's like you don't even see any blue on there, even in the middle. I mean, there's a couple of them, but it's just a red sea of arrows going Right. And Michigan is really ground zero for that.",

I mean, this is not the only place in the world where since 2020 somebody has stood for reelection and has suffered a defeat like this. I mean, this has been a pretty consistent dynamic around the world since the pandemic. So, you know, certainly no question VP Harris was facing those headwinds.You know, I think you look at the places where she underperformed Biden's vote and you look at the breakdown with different ethnic groups, racial groups across the country, it's hard to point to one place where she really, you know, it would almost be sort of easier to look at the result and say, OK, well, it was clearly, you know, her underperformance in Dearborn.
