And I think the first glimpse we will get of the princess is in the carriage essentially, as the royals will be leaving Buckingham Palace in about 2.5 hours' time as part of the royal session -- procession.And this is all part of the king's birthday parade, often known as Trooping the Colour, because that's a big ceremonial part really of what happens here. One of the five foot guard regiments of the household division take their turn on Trooping the Colour, which is essentially showing their flag. Now this year is a particularly important one for the Princess of Wales, given that she is also the colonel of the Irish Guards, which is why, last year, you may remember at the king's birthday parade, that she wore all green, resplendent in green. On St. Patrick's Day, she wore green as well. So perhaps we will see another nod toward the Irish there. She will likely be with her children, Princes Georgia and Louis and Princess Charlotte in that carriage. Royal fans absolutely love seeing them all. And then of course, the balcony scene which will happen right at the end of the event, they'll all go to Horse Guards. They'll come back, they'll get onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace, which you could probably see behind me. It's all getting rigged up. You can see a drape has been laid out. That, of course, is where you get the royal waves. And that's where often we get some nice, silly faces from the children as well. Anna.",

And so I think there's a sense of relief, also, a real personal touch and the statement that we had from the Princess of Wales, explaining that she has good days and bad days but she's not out of the woods yet. But that she will be starting to both work from home and appear at certain events. Of course, it will be left up to her medical team to advise on which ones she's able to make. But I think everyone be thrilled that she's making this one in particular, because this is a big family occasion. It marks the king's official second birthday. Monarchs always get a second one in the U.K., the second Saturday of June, because supposedly the weather is good -- as it is for now. But this is about the family.

The Supreme Court decision has put bump stocks -- which, by the way, enabled the deadliest mass shooting in modern history -- back on the streets.

Now a campaign official says the president won't have as much time to devote to debate prep as he did in that 2020 race. They expect that the most intense sessions of debate preparation will come in the days leading into June 27. In fact, the president is expected to spend a few days at Camp David in the coming weeks. But there have been some debate preparation sessions so far. And a source does that in those sessions, the president has really been focused on trying to find ways to hold Trump accountable in this debate. Some of the areas where he really wants to draw a contrast and criticize Trump are related to reproductive rights and also Trump's calls for political violence or trying to undermine democratic institutions. The ultimate goal, advisers say, is trying to paint Trump as chaotic and divisive while presenting Biden as a steady and wiser alternative. One campaign official said that President Biden has been much punchier in his remarks, in his speeches about Trump on the campaign trail. And they expect that will continue into this debate. Of course, Biden and Trump have faced off twice before back in 2020. So Biden at least understands a little bit of the style that Trump uses on the debate stage.
