The Harry interview, my conversation with Prince Harry that I did it for CBS \"60 Minutes.\"Tonight, the interview and we'll discuss with our correspondents and guests the potential fallout from it and what Harry reveals in his new book which comes out on Tuesday. Prince Harry may have stepped back from his Royal duties in 2020, but he and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex certainly haven't stepped away from the spotlight. Just last month, they appeared in a six-part Netflix documentary about their relationship and their decision to leave their Royal lives behind. But now, the 38-year-old Prince Harry is telling his own story in his new memoir, \"Spare,\" a nod to his backup role in the line of succession. The book is a stunning break with Royal protocol. It is deeply personal, and it's an account of Prince Harry's decades long struggle with grief after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, and a revealing look at his fractured relationships with his father, King Charles; his stepmother, the Queen Consort, Camila; and his brother, Prince William, the heir to his spare.

You know, this is a two-part interview that we did for \"60 Minutes,\" and one of the reasons that we wanted to start with this -- with a focus on Princess Diana and the experience of her death for Harry is in reading the book and it is 460 pages, I mean, it is, yes, people are going to be paying most attention to all the revelations and you know, the inside information that he's giving out, the break of protocol with Royal family, information he is telling about the Royal family, which we will show shortly. But for me, I mean, this is such a memoir about loss and about grief and about the devastating impact of childhood trauma, the death of his mom which played out obviously on a global scale and it's extraordinary how the life that he lived is so different than or his perception of himself and his perception of his life is so different than the world's perception of what his life and his inner life must have been like growing up.

The grief was cataclysmic. And yet Harry, the one with really almost the greatest -- he and William had the greatest right to grieve of all, he just couldn't cry. He felt so guilty. I was so moved about him talking about his feelings, and how he is speaking out, Harry's book, there really has been three things for me: A portrait of a very dysfunctional family, their relationships with the press in this dysfunctional family. But most of all, a portrait of a young boy losing his mother at this young age, with very little support from within the family and also expected to play this role on the world stage. And when he said \"My war began in 1997,\" that was, I think, a stunning revelation and really went to the heart of why he is still suffering now, the loss of his mother and how much the press had a role in that.",

The head of the family is the constitutional head of state, his oldest is also in the Constitution, and the oldest after that are also in the Constitution. So they become much more than a prominent family. They're actually the fabric of the country.And you know, I can remember I mean, I remember when Charles and Diana brought Harry out of the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's, the day he was born, and watching this jolly little redhead boy who just always had a smile on his face, until that day, when he was made to walk behind that coffin, which was barbaric, but also keeping in the tradition of this family, which is more than a family, they are the state. So that is the issue I think that the British people are going to have to come to grips with and I think is what Harry in which you show in that really brilliant interview, Harry is challenging this and this is really the conflict and the clash is going to come in the British body politic.",

And then Harry, of course, says he does believe in monarchy, I think that is the reality.I mean, I think what William's side would say is that they did everything they could to make Harry not feel like a spare. They elevated him, they had something called the Royal Foundation, where they worked together initially, Harry and William, and that was an umbrella group for all of their charities. And I think William felt that he was elevating what would be a traditional role for a spare, a spare, would, in the past, just be invisible and brought in if they're needed. So I think Harry really struggled with that and then it was the treatment, of course, from William that he felt he received as well always being made to feel like a spare. And ultimately, when he found Meghan, and she wasn't happy with the situation, either. They came together and realized they couldn't do this any longer.",

And the way she did this particularly was by pushing forward negative stories about Harry.As the spare, he is expendable, and I thought you brought this out so acutely in the interview, the grief he suffered, that the isolation he suffered, but also as this \"Spare,\" the title of the book, that very structure I think, even though he says he supports the monarchy, he does blame it for so much of what went wrong. We have a situation in which one child gets everything and all the attention and the next child not only gets nothing, but also is sold out to the press and that is why he was so unhappy and that is why he felt he had to leave and I think it really raises questions about the structure of monarchy, spare and heir, the European Royals don't do it like that.

He talks about one particular incident when Harry was actually in high school and there were all these stories about alleged drug use. Harry was, I believe, smoking pot, he says, but many of the details were, he says, were not true that were being reported. And he believes a decision was made by the spin doctors that were employed by his father and by Camilla, essentially, to, if not greenlight those stories, not try to squash them or count or in some way try to minimize them because they were convinced or told by their spin doctor that those stories would make Prince Charles look better. He would suddenly go from being the villain in the story who had been terrible to his former wife, to being the beleaguered dad with a drug adult son.",

You know, this has gone into folklore, you know, who made who cry? Meghan or Kate over the bridesmaid dress just before the wedding. I mean it's quite defining. I mean, none of us know who made who cry. The story got in the papers was that Meghan made Kate cry and Meghan and Harry are really precious about this, saying it wasn't that way around, it was the other way around. But the palace wouldn't address that because it would be a more negative story for Kate to make Meghan cry. And that's the sort of thing that really frustrates Harry and Meghan.But, you know, my experience was that whenever I worked with William's side of the palace, they would often, you know, and hey were working with the Sussexes as well. They were constantly talking about, you know, the racism and the sexism in the British tabloid media, and they were trying to stick up for them. But, you know, I didn't, I was a party to the conversations between behind palace walls, and clearly Harry had the inside track, and he felt that it was always working against him and Meghan.",

So, they aren't going to say anything officially, but we've already had sources briefing the newspaper that they're devastated, that William is angry that there won't be a role for Harry in the coronation.So, there are sources who Harry, of course, would say comes from Buckingham Palace itself. These sources are anonymous sources are briefing. At the moment, it looks very much as if there can't be a reconciliation. There is a big distance between them. Harry said we haven't spoken for a while. He said there are dragons in the family. The press he said that actually also that the press wanted them to stay apart. They'd be terrified by a peace between them. So there seems to be this huge investment in keeping them apart and Harry sees that, you know, about to continue. So, I don't see a happy family reconciliation anytime soon, but I certainly think that Harry feels that he's been damaged so much already, that this is not burning bridges, it's honesty, and he's telling his truth.",

So, in that sense, spare at your interview with him is very, very important because we're getting a look at the vicious, nasty tabloids which Americans we don't have an equivalent of that anywhere in the United States. There is no equivalent. So, he's right about how Meghan was labeled, which was appalling.So, this guy is stopping the machine. I hope he does.
