Hunter was not the son that Joe Biden had tapped to be his successor, the golden child in the relationship, that was Beau. And I think Hunter was aware of that fact. And I think that Biden is aware of Hunter being aware of that fact. Biden consistently has really intervened in his son's life in order to try to prevent him from falling even deeper into that rabbit hole of addiction, which of course, is an incredibly difficult thing to prevent.Biden has played an active role as a grandfather and surrogate father to Biden's children. And so, that relationship, as you say, in the opening is deep, it is special, it is -- it's covered in scar tissue. And it's a -- it's one of the few areas where President Biden struggles to think strategically, because it's impossible to think strategically about your own son.",

I think Hunter is fighting for his reputation here where his father is fighting to save the republic from the threat of authoritarianism. But when I listen to what he's saying, I also have to agree that there is some truth in it. I mean, I think that Hunter Biden's crimes are so petty and should hardly be placed on a continuum with all the accusations being levelled against Donald Trump, and even Donald Trump's own family. And the Republicans have struggled for so long to really define Joe Biden and Hunter Biden is basically the best hook that they have to create some sort of extremely negative image of him.And it's actually been incredibly effective. I think, despite the fact that most people did not anticipate it to be effective because Biden had done such an effective job of swatting away all those accusations in 2020. But you look at the polling numbers, and it's pretty clear that beyond the Fox News base, there is a sense that there is the Biden is corrupt, that Biden's son has done something corrupt. And in an election that should be turning on questions of democracy and corruption that I would think would be crystal clear in terms of the comparison. This is one of the few things that muddies that up.",

The United States technically not at war with any nation, but that doesn't mean our defense is dormant. In the weeks following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, there have been nearly daily attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by Iranian backed groups. In just the past month, an American destroyer shot down multiple drones in its vicinity in the Red Sea and responded to distress calls from a civilian commercial vessel that was fired upon by a ballistic missile. U.S. forces killed at least five Iran backed militia members in a drone strike after the U.S. identified an imminent attack likely to be launched by militia forces in Iraq. A defense official told CNN that since October 17, there have been 82 attacks by Iran back proxy groups on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria.Since World War II, America has taken on the role of trying to keep peace worldwide as U.S. military bases have propagated around the world to the point where there are now about 800 of them. And today out of 195 nations on the planet, U.S. military counterterrorism has a footprint in 78 of those countries. As USA Today, which first published this data put it, \"Nearly a quarter century after the U.S. launched its response to 9/11, the Pentagon continues to pursue military actions in the Middle East and in many more parts of the world than Americans may realize.\" Joining me now is the person who compiled the data, Stephanie Savell, co-director and senior researcher at the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute, for which she wrote the recent paper, \"United States Counterterrorism Operations Under the Biden Administration, 2021 through '23.\" Dr. Savell, does the expansion of our footprint make us more or less safe? STEPHANIE SAVELL, SR. RESEARCHER &amp; CO. DIR. COSTS OF WAR PROJECT, WATSON INSTITUTE, BROWN UNIV.: Thank you so much for asking that question, it's just the one that should be asked with this data. And you know, my answer is no. There are more Islamist militant groups than there were when we started these -- the so called War on Terror in, you know, in 2001, there are more recruits to those groups, there's a ton of blowback to all of this military action around the world. And we're seeing in Iraq and Syria right now, just as you pointed out, that the U.S. presence in these places in the name of counterterrorism actually makes U.S. troops, you know, makes it more likely that they engage in aggressive actions abroad.",

Primarily, we've gotten extremely far in the direction of using the military as the primary tool of U.S. foreign policy. And arguably, that's not keeping, you know, Americans or anyone else in the world any safer. My other research has shown that in the so called War on Terror, that kind of ripple effects, the ways that these wars have caused what's called indirect death, you know, economic crises and hunger and the collapse of healthcare infrastructure, that's caused 4.5 million deaths.

Following testimony at this week's congressional hearing about a lack of pushback against anti- Semitism on their campuses, Harvard's Claudine Gay, MIT's Sally Kornbluth and Elizabeth Magill from the University of Pennsylvania have all been under fire for the way that they answered questions posed by Republican Elise Stefanik. Their responses sparked widespread condemnation and calls for resignations from donors, trustees, lawmakers and others. More than 70 members of Congress from both parties have signed a letter to the three schools demanding they remove their presidents in light of their testimony. The White House condemned the University president's responses saying, quote, \"Any statements that advocate for the systemic murder of Jews are dangerous and revolting.\"In Boston, a group claiming to be Jewish students pay for a plane to fly overhead with a Palestinian flag and a banner that read, Harvard hates Jews. Harvard's president told the student newspaper, The Crimson, \"I am sorry. Words matter.\" As the week wore on, it was Magill who became the poster child. A prominent Penn alum withdrew a $100 million donation. A truck circled the campus with billboards calling for her to be fired. The University Board of Trustees will meet via phone 05:00 p.m. tomorrow to discuss Magill and a statement she's said to be working on. Here's an excerpt from Magill's exchange with GOP representatives Stefanik. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
