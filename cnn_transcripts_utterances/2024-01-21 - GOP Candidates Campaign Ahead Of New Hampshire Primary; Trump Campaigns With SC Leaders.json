Just two days to go until the New Hampshire primaries, and we are seeing a Nikki Haley and Donald Trump crisscross the state all weekend to deliver their closing arguments to New Hampshire voters. Ron DeSantis, however, spent yesterday in South Carolina.He's expected to return to the Granite State today, but I think that just underscores how his strategy is very different here. He spent much of the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses really aggressively campaigning there. And in New Hampshire, we've really seen little of him in this state. And so that's kind of led to a lot of people to look at this as a two person race between Trump and Haley here in New Hampshire. Now, Haley, for her part, has been polling very well with moderate voters and independents in New Hampshire, and that's led to a lot of confidence for her campaign that she will do well on Tuesday. Trump, on the other hand, has really been urging his supporters not to get complacent. It's an argument we heard him made several times in the lead up to the Iowa caucuses as well. And here in New Hampshire, he's been telling his supporters margins matter. So please ignore the polls, ignore my commanding lead here in the state and turn out for me. And I can tell you from my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign and his advisers that they really do believe if Trump can win with big enough margins on Tuesday, they think that'll effectively end the primary early and force his rivals out of the race.",

(END VIDEO CLIP) TREENE: Now, Victor and Amara, him parading those South Carolina leaders on stage comes after Friday, where he picked up a major endorsement from South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. I know from my conversations with the Trump campaign that I had been pursuing that endorsement ever since Scott dropped out of the presidential race last year. And I think the timing here is what's really worth noting. Of course, that endorsement has led Trump's team to feel confident about their chances in South Carolina, but they are choosing to make the South Carolina lawmakers and their support of Donald Trump a big moment this weekend, just days before New Hampshire, because they're really eager to try and undercut Haley as much as possible. And, of course, as you just heard Trump say there, he's also been attacking her, trying to paint her as being someone on the left, trying to tie her to Biden and using the South Carolina leaders to really argue that.

So, yes, there's going to be politics inside Syria, politics inside Lebanon, where Israeli forces struck inside of Beirut just a couple of weeks ago.Politics inside of Iraq. Well, the Iraqi government has no desire to see American forces and Iranian-backed forces having a proxy war on their territory either. So yes, every strike escalates and every strike makes this even more complicated and even more dangerous. And that's why one would think that diplomacy would have to get involved here. But right now the conditions there for that just don't exist.",

The MAGA people and -- are trying to scuttle the immigration Ukraine negotiation that's going on in the Senate, and that's even before he's president again.

He was convicted of 1988 murder for hire. His name is Kenneth Smith. His initial lethal injection was halted in November because of IV-line issues. After the failed attempt, he requested death by nitrogen gas. This new method has U.N. experts concerned about the upcoming execution, citing a painful and humiliating death. Here with us now is Margaret Satterthwaite, clinical law professor at NYU School of Law and one of the members of that U.N. panel. Thank you so much for being with us this morning. Let me start here and back away just for a second from the method used here and simply that there is an execution.

You're even below freezing even as far south as Jacksonville.

Because the storm that's going to come in and start to bring in the warm air brings a lot of rain, but it could start as some ice for parts of, again, Missouri and Arkansas there. So, you can see where that ice starts as we go into tomorrow morning. We'll have some of that heavy rain continuing to fill in as well. Could mix us some snow up in the upper Great Lakes, and then you'll find some rain heavy at times, too, along the Gulf Coast, getting into areas like Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta. Here's a look at some of those ice totals that could be as much as a half an inch in some locations that could cause problems of power outages and some tree limbs being down. What it will do, though, as it brings us the rain is going to surge in that warmer air.
