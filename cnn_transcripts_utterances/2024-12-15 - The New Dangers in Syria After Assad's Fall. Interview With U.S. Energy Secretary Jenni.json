I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, the scenes coming out of post-Assad Syria are extraordinary. Prisoners freed, families reunited, a missing American found. Now comes the tough part -- putting a country of dueling factions and religious sects back together under the leadership of a group that's deemed a terror organization by the U.S. and many other countries. I'll talk to Richard Haass and Kim Ghattas about Syria's uncertain future. And beyond Syria, what are the other global crises that the world cannot afford to ignore right now? David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee will brief us. Plus, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on the Biden administration's work to fight climate change before the Trump team comes to power. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's a possibility for Syria ultimately, though we also have to be wary that there are, shall we say, malign singular entities. We could have a Taliban like future for Syria.But I think the more likely one for the foreseeable future is what you've suggested, more of a patchwork quilt of fiefdoms of sort. The Kurds here, Turkish backed groups in parts of the country. The Israelis have moved in in a limited preventive way along their border. This principal group that led the overthrow, the HTS, will have their areas. And then, you're right, there could be pockets still of Alawites and so forth. So we should expect that. [10:10:02] And I think the real question is how long does that last? How violent might it be? And ultimately, what does it lead to? I think all of this says, as hard as it is to oust a regime, it's even harder to build a functioning country.",

And I think that that should give us some hope that they will know how to lead this process forward, having gone through the infighting, and I don't think it's about being naive, but about making sure that we're not fatalistic about the potential chaos that could unfold in Syria.I think Syrians deserve support. They deserve encouragement, and they deserve for us to have faith in them after what they achieved pretty much on their own. This was the Syrians who started it in 2011, and it was the Syrians who ended up bringing down Bashar al-Assad in such a rapid way over the last two weeks or so. And they deserve credit for that because this means that this is not Iraq, where there was a U.S. invasion that deposed Saddam Hussein. And this is not Libya, where there was a U.N. led intervention. This is a Syrian led process. And I think that's why we should be a little bit more optimistic and supportive of Syrian efforts to make sure they can take that path forward now towards stability, even though, yes, there will be chaos in the short term as they figure this out, and it is possible that the country ends up being divided.

And Iran would ship arms across Syria to get to Hezbollah in Lebanon. I think all of that is unlikely to continue as it was. Hezbollah has its hands full reconstituting itself in Lebanon if it can. Iran has its hands full. Israel has demonstrated a real capacity to essentially act almost with, what, impunity over Iran.So I think they're both distracted. Russia has got its hands full with Ukraine. So I think the most important outside force right now is Turkey. It's got the advantage of proximity, has lots of incentives to have millions of refugees come home, real economic opportunity. Unfortunately, they also have an incentive to go after the Kurds. And we have to worry about that. The other outside power that matters is the United States. And we're going to have to decide not so much whether we help, but to what extent do we condition our help on certain types of behaviors against terrorism, potentially human rights type considerations, and so forth?",

Turkey, the UAE, Saudi Arabia don't necessarily see eye to eye on what comes next in Syria.And that's an opportunity for the U.S. because part of why we ended up here is because the U.S. did not have a strategy over the last decade, you could say, and allowed a void to be filled by Syria, by Iran, Hezbollah and Russia when it decided to step back in 2013 and 2015.",

And Israel has refused to introduce a political dimension into its policy in Gaza. So they've defeated Hamas militarily, but they haven't marginalized Hamas politically. And battlefield with victories are one thing. Enduring victories, though, require a political dimension.Plus, and people aren't really talking about it, the situation on the West Bank where, what, 60 or so percent of Palestinians live, three million, that's gotten a lot worse. We're seeing militias. We're seeing gangs. We're seeing expanded violence and settlement activity and settler violence. So there I think, again, it's the Achilles heel of Israel because it could become a real drag on its security. It could challenge its domestic fabric, and it could have real repercussions, as we've seen over the last year here, with its relations to the United States. So Israel is poised. You're right. I don't take away your -- I don't disagree with your basic premise, but the real question is with turning points, do you turn? Do you take advantage of them? So Israel has an opportunity here.

You're down now to this was the last main Middle Eastern state that was virulently anti-American other than Iran, the last Arab state.And it's no longer in that position. So if you think about it, in the long run, you know, Iraq has essentially become mildly pro-American or maybe at least neutral. Syria might become neutral.

I don't think regime change is in the offing. This is not as personalistic as brittle a regime as Syria.

Those factories, where are they located? Eighty to 90 percent are in red counties, red districts, red states. So, those representatives in Congress are not likely to be supportive of uprooting what is a huge economic opportunity When you think about the number of jobs that are embedded in these 900 factories. And right now, because its only two years old, right, so the announcements of all these factories have happened. But -- and it's -- honestly being that sound you hear is another one saying that they're coming because it's so far since the law is still in effect, but those factories have maybe -- done the announcement, maybe they've done groundbreaking, but they haven't done ribbon cutting, meaning that they haven't -- the steel is not necessarily in the ground yet. So, over the next few years, you're going to see all of this employment, all of these factories in these red places. I'm sure the Trump administration would want to take credit for that.

Including after the earthquake last year, we've not had our money interfered with, we've not had our distribution of aid interfered with, we've not had our work on education or healthcare interfered with. And so, the only hope for Syria, the thing that is making Syrians dare to hope at the moment, is that its diversity will be recognized, and the governing structures, and the things that have been said so far about recognizing five percent Christians in the Syrian population are giving some encouragement. Obviously, it's actions that count. But we can say that we've been able to work properly over the last 12 years.
