Here's some of the top stories we're following today.Investigators are not yet discussing a possible motive for a school shooting in Georgia that killed four people. A 14-year-old suspect is in custody. Law enforcement questioned the boy about shooting threats last year, but did not take any action. At least 21 people, including an infant, are missing after a migrant boat capsized off the coast of Italy. The Italian Coast Guard rescued seven people and took them to the island of Lampedusa. They told rescuers the boat departed from Libya. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. And an asteroid about a meter wide struck the Earth's atmosphere over the Philippines on Wednesday, and it created this fireball as it burned up during entry. The European Space Agency says asteroids this size are harmless and pretty common, but they are rarely seen before they strike. And more now on the deadly school shooting in Winder, Georgia. Authorities say two of the victims were 14-year-old students at the high school and two others were both math teachers. The suspect who opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle surrendered as soon as he was confronted by school resource officers. CNN spoke with a student who sat next to the boy in an algebra class. She explained what happened on Wednesday when he abruptly left the classroom, came back a few minutes later and tried to open the door. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Multiple law enforcement officials tell CNN's Mark Morales and John Miller, this same high school had received a phone threat this morning before the shooting occurred. The caller warning there would be shootings at five schools and that Apalachee High School would be the first. It's not known who placed the call. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: What they are investigating now is, is it possible that that threat came from the student who is in custody as the alleged shooter? Is it possible that that threat came from someone that he asked to make that phone call at or about the time that he opened fire? The timing here is obviously going to be important. TODD (voice-over): This video filmed by a student shows students being led down a hallway by law enforcement with their hands up as the school was being evacuated.

We could get a few out. They'll give us that. But they'll leave a lot with them.We won't have the pressure point. And something else will happen. We will not be able to come back. So we won't release all the hostages. And we won't achieve the defenses that we must have to prevent more October 7th again and again and again. I don't stand in judgment of these tormented souls because they're undergoing an agony that is hard to fathom. And I understand that. But the responsibility of leaders is not merely to share the sentiment, the emotion, but also to exercise judgment, the correct judgment, to make sure that these horrors do not happen again.

I mean, the past two press conferences we've heard from the Israeli prime minister, just in the past few days, he has doubled down and said that it is imperative for the Israeli military to stay on that, that border between Gaza and Egypt. And that's despite his defense minister, we understand, from multiple reports saying that it is not necessary, that if you stick to that rule, then you are not going to have a deal. Hamas will not agree and the hostages will not come home.Now, a senior Biden administration official has spoken to CNN and has said about this, this insistence from Netanyahu that it is not constructive, adding, quote: Staking out concrete positions in the middle of a negotiation isn't always particularly helpful. They also say that they believe that this deal is 90 percent done. We had more information on the deal than we have had for some time, which really speaks to the frustration that the Biden administration is feeling about the prime minister's stance, saying it's an 18 paragraph proposal at this point and all but four of those paragraphs have been agreed to between Israel and Hamas. But it is this Philadelphi corridor that really does appear to be the sticking point. Hamas saying it will not agree to it. But Netanyahu is doubling down. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have said, obviously, trying to take advantage of this, this divide they see between the Biden administration and the Israeli prime minister, saying that these new proposals, as they put it from Netanyahu, are unnecessary and an attempt to thwart reaching an agreement. The Biden administration, though, according to this official, is continuing to try and push for this deal. The first phase of which, it's a three-phase deal, would mean that all of the Israeli military would move out of the densely populated areas in Gaza. Now, Netanyahu is pointing out that this is not a densely populated area along the border, and it is something that he is determined not to veer away from. But it does make it more difficult for this deal to be done, given the fact that we also heard that in this initial agreement, this bridging proposal that the U.S. had put to both Israel and Hamas, Israel had agreed to it, according to this senior official, and at no point in this agreement did it mention the Philadelphi corridor. But there are ongoing talks to try and see if something can be done. We've heard from the Biden administration that this will be a final proposal to try and get this done -- Christina.",

He said it's an ongoing environmental crisis that's become an obstacle to harmonious coexistence of peoples. Indonesia, of course, is a country that is certainly feeling the effects of climate change. It's moving the capital because it's sinking and it also deals with chronic flooding. As you mentioned, tomorrow the Pope will head to Papua New Guinea, then to East Timor and on to Singapore. But he will be addressing that mass this evening before 80,000 people. We understand that people have been queuing up for hours to get into this stadium in Jakarta.
