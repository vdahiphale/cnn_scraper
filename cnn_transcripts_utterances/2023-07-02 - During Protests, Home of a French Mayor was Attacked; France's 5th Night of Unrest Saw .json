      "sentences": "Live from CNN center, this is \"CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber.\" BRUNHUBERFor a fifth straight night, France has been gripped by heated and sometimes violent protests sparked by the failed police shooting of a 17-year-old boy. In a Paris suburb of l'Hay-les-Roses, the mayor has reported an assassination attempt on his family. He says, a group of people rammed a car into his home, injuring husband wife and one of his children. It happened overnight as protests raged across the country. Police detained more than 700 people, some of whom set fires, overturned cars, and damaged buildings in response to last week's shooting of Nahel (INAUDIBLE). Now, let's get more from Catherine Norris Trent, a senior correspondent for France 24. So, first of all, what's the latest on this alleged attack on the mayor? CATHERINE NORRIS TRENT, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, FRANCE 24:  Hi, Kim. Yes, this is a major story that is unfolding here in France. We've heard, overnight, from this mayor of a suburb south of Paris, l'Hay- les-Roses, who says that his wife has been taken to hospital, and one of his two young children injured in this attack, which he branded an assassination attempt. He said that around 1:30 a.m., a group of people rammed a car into his home and set it on fire, while he, himself, was away working at the town hall. So, he has condemned this attack in strongest violence and the strongest terms. And we've seen a number of city halls and towns in France being the target of attacks out of anger from the rioters. Some of them have been set on fire. Some of the property has been damaged. This is something that people here in France are watching very closely as symbols of the French state, as authority have been coming under attack with this outpouring of public anger and rioting.",

So, it just shows the kind of pressure he is under to try and dampen down this violence.Now, the French government hasn't yet invoked a state of emergency, emergency powers, which it could use. They've drafted in 45,000 police officers to towns and cities across France to try and contain the rioting, but they are under pressure to do more, especially from the far right of French politics. We've had Marine Le Pen, who's the leader of the national rally party, the far-right party, calling for local curfews to be put in place and people from across the political spectrum calling for calm. But we've seen although perhaps overnight from Saturday into Sunday was a little calmer than previous nights, there were still more than 700 people arrested and disturbances across the country in various towns and cities. So, the government is, no doubt, going to be holding more crisis talks on what they can do to try to contain the anger. We know Emmanuel Macron has called on social networks to stop publishing some sensitive content, as he said, calls for people to gather together and protest or riot. But it remains to be seen what action will be taken on that front.",

Now sources tell CNN that President Trump pressured the governor to try to find enough fraud in the state to overturn the election in Arizona.Sources also tell CNN new details that President Trump tried to enlist his vice president, Mike Pence, in this effort. Vice President Pence, he called Governor Ducey several times after the 2020 election to discuss the election. But a source tells CNN that Vice President Pence did not follow through with the request to pressure the governor. And this all comes as Special Counsel Jack Smith is ramping up his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including some of those efforts by the president and his allies to reach out to state officials. Now, the governor's spokesperson, he downplayed the significance of this call to us. Saying in a statement to CNN, frankly, nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election. He certified the election, and made it clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by evidence to be brought forward. None were ever brought forward. Now, the spokesman also told CNN that the special counsel's office has not reached out to Governor Ducey to set up an interview and talk about this call. The special counsel did interview this week another state official, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about the call that he had with President Trump in 2021 about finding enough votes for the president to win the election in that state.

There was also one person that had a leg injury, but no one was killed, amazingly. And this is also the first time, according to the air force, that those Iranian-made drones have been used to attack the capitol in 12 straight days. What is especially unusual here, Kim, is the 100 percent success rate in actually shooting them down, which is why the Ukrainians have been, for so long, calling for more western support when it comes to air defense. They already have the Patriot air defense system, the most advanced in the world, but they don't have enough batteries.

Chief Justice John Roberts said that the schools, in order to take race into consideration, had to reach a high bar, and he said the schools here failed to do so. And he suggested that thwarts the ideal of a color-blind society. Justice Clarence Thomas, he went even further and said he thought that those programs tainted the applicants. Whereas the liberals on the court, led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed mystified. She said we don't live in a color-blind society right now. And that, in fact, these programs were necessary. They were still needed because there's still discrimination. In that LGBTQ case, there was a business owner who wanted to expand her business to create websites to celebrate weddings, but she didn't want to work with same-sex marriages because she doesn't believe in same-sex marriage. There, the conservatives led by Justice Neil Gorsuch really saw that case through a lens of free speech. And he said that the government couldn't force her to create a custom product with a message that she disagreed with. And again, the liberals came back and said, this isn't about the first amendment. They said, this is really about discrimination. Again and again, this court really on the issues that grab the public's attention are on opposite sides.

      "sentences": "Yes. And in one -- unfortunately, might expect the problem to get worse, because we're hearing of so many people, doctors, nurses, leaving the field of maternal health in part because of the crackdowns on abortion in many states. And I know reports have shown that states with more abortion restrictions have higher maternal and infant mortality. So, how does that factor into all of this?DR. IGBINOSA:  Yes. I -- so, first, I think it's important to like reframe what is the definition. Like, how are these statistics being informed? And pregnancy-related mortalities, whether that be from a termination or from a pregnancy is death from a pregnancy related event up into a year of the end of pregnancy. And so, then when you look at the timing that these maternal deaths occur, about 25 percent may occur during pregnancy, another 25 percent may occur on the day of delivery or within a week after. And then, over 50 percent occur seven days to a year after the pregnancy. So, you know, I think that, even there, that understanding that the risk is not just when a woman is carrying the pregnancy, it's beyond. You know, it's the factors that led up to them carrying that pregnancy, and then what we're providing for them afterwards. And I think to answer your question, that's where the factors that come into play, it could be policy, in terms of health policy, in terms of access, or does the patient live in a maternity care desert. Where, you know, where is their nearest birthing center or hospital to receive obstetric care? And then you add on the layers of racism that are always at play, it just makes it a very difficult issue.",

But from an institutional point of view, what more can be done?DR. IGBINOSA:  There are things that are being done at the institutional level, which I think need to be done, and that is providing standard, evidence-based care and implementing that quality care. And so, I think that's something that institutions should be actively trying to address and understand what is the risk factors and data unique to their area.",

Understanding what are those risk factors. There's a Hear Me campaign that's on the CDC's website, it kind of lists the, you know, most urgent maternal warning signs. And that could be, do you have a new headache? Dizziness that doesn't go away. Fever, chills, pain, a new onset of high blood pressure? And I think it's really important, not just, really -- you know, after a patient has delivered or has one child or some cases multiple, they're in a very vulnerable state.
