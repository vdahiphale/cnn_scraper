I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.In just a few hours, Joe Biden will give what could be one of the most important speeches of his presidency as a rematch against Donald Trump gets underway. The State of the Union address is a make or break moment for the President. New this morning, Sweden has been formally invited to become the 32nd member of NATO. The Swedish Prime Minister is in Washington where he is going to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and we will take you live to the State Department. Plus, hopes for a Ramadan ceasefire in Gaza have stalled as the Hamas delegation leaves negotiations, but little progress made. We're going to have a live report from Tel Aviv straight ahead. Well, the moment couldn't be bigger for U.S. President Joe Biden and the stakes couldn't be higher. Just hours from now, the President will deliver his State of the Union address which will double as a sort of unofficial start to the general election. Now, the speech is expected to focus on his populist message for the economy, which the White House says will include a crackdown on price gouging and higher taxes for corporations and the wealthy. Biden is facing low approval ratings and sagging poll numbers as the race against former President Donald Trump really begins. Now, the address is a crucial opportunity for Mr. Biden to flip the narrative and answer fears from some voters, even Democratic allies, about his age and his vitality. Here was the White House aide speaking earlier to CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She is also a Democratic Strategist. Great to see you both.Maria, let me start with you. Let me read for you the top graph of POLITICO's story on what to expect tonight. \"The State of the Union may be one of the most vastly overrated speeches in all of politics. But not this year.\" So, Maria, with stakes so high, what does a successful night look like for the President? MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I think a successful night is when the President comes out and he is going to state under no uncertain terms the massive accomplishments that he has delivered to the American people in the last three years, not just with detail, but with personalization. And what that means, Rahel, is that we see that the economic numbers on a macro level are really good. We have a booming economy, but not everyone is feeling it. So, tonight, I think, is an opportunity for the President to make those connections. Why is it that the $35 insulin is so important to the American people? How is it that canceling millions of dollars of student loans has helped families make sure that they have a bright future for their kids? I think those are the details that are going to be important in tonight's speech. But also, Rahel, as you can imagine, everyone is going to be not just listening to the substance, but perhaps even more so watching to see his demeanor, how does he deliver it, his energy, his stances, everything that he does with his hands, with his face, his expressions. Everything is going to be on stage tonight. And the President knows that. And as you know, one of the biggest, I think, gifts that this President has is low expectations. He has been repeatedly underestimated, and every single time he comes out on top, and I think tonight will be no different.",

And he raised a lot of money, raised his profile. And what we've seen, Rahel, is that incentive structure is a different one. I'm very glad that the Speaker's office is telling members to be respectful for decorum, but also to not allow Joe Biden to have a moment to where he can counterpunch. And if he counterpunches very well, because a Marjorie Taylor Greene or Lauren Boebert or somebody else directly challenges the President during his speech, you give that advantage possibly to the President that you don't want to give.But again, the reality is, these members, they don't work for House leadership. They work for themselves ultimately, or their political base, how they view it. And that's why we've seen members act up in the past and why we're nervous that that may happen again.",

He is going to come home tonight. He is very, very comfortable in that chamber. And I think you're going to see that comfort level as he delivers his speech.And then one more thing I would say, Rahel, you talked about how -- on his -- in the back of his shoulder is going to be Speaker Johnson. Let's not diminish the kind of debacle that House Republicans have suffered in the past year ever since McCarthy was ousted. People remember that this is a Republican House that has not been able to deliver anything for the American people. And what's more, they have demonstrated that the only thing they're interested in is being puppeteered by Donald Trump. And I think Joe Biden as the President can really use that to his advantage to say, look, I am here. Democrats are here to serve you.

The reality is, for the State of the Union response, is it's been a string of women and people of color, which is a welcome change for the GOP. And Katie Britt is going to talk about her background as a mom, talk about being a working mother, and certainly IVF, being that she is from Alabama, and this is an Alabama issue is going to come up. She is going to talk about moms and families first, and not leaning heavy into the things that have caused Republicans to be back on their heels on this.I'm looking forward to what she says. I've been a fan of hers for a long time, even back when she was a staffer. The GOP could not make a better pick.

And that is what has been such a horrendous electoral kryptonite for the Republican Party. And they know it. When the Supreme Court made that decision about IVF, and saying that embryos were persons, they panicked, and for good reason.This issue of reproductive freedom and reproductive rights was kind of a sleeper issue in the 2022 midterms. People thought that there was a summer of rebellion amongst women. But, you know what? Women will calm down. Well, guess what? We're not calming down, because when your rights and your freedoms are on the line, when you have somebody like Donald Trump who has said that he wants to support a national abortion ban, this is existential for our rights. I don't want my daughter to grow up in a country where she has less rights than I did. And women across the board, including Republican women, feel that way.

And while there was a lot of optimism last week, this week, it is a far different situation with one U.S. official saying that hope is fading that an agreement can be reached in time for the start of Ramadan. Negotiators had hoped that they would have a draft agreement by this point in order to put a deal in place by the start of Ramadan. But, that seems to no longer be the expectation. And we know that a Hamas delegation left Cairo today without any breakthroughs actually taking place.Israel is continuing to demand a list of the hostages who would be released under this agreement. Hamas has indicated that they won't be able to provide that list without a ceasefire that would allow them to gather the information on the whereabouts and the fate of those hostages. An Israeli official telling us today that they simply don't believe that assertion from Hamas. And Hamas, for its part, is continuing to push for a permanent end to this conflict, as part of these negotiations, something that Israel has rejected out of hand. So, despite some of the progress that was made last week, it appears that both sides are now once again at an impasse. And so that, of course, raises the question of what will happen next. Israeli officials had indicated that a major military offensive into Rafah would be launched if there were not a deal reached by Ramadan. But, as you noted, Israeli officials are also very mindful of the fact that a major military offensive during that holiday of Ramadan could potentially inflame tensions at a very, very critical time. The holiday of Ramadan has often been a time when tensions have soared. Hamas has often sought to use the religious fervor around Ramadan in order to provoke or to call for attacks against Israelis or Israeli forces. And so, this is certainly a very volatile time. And we will have to see next week how things unfold particularly if there is not a deal in place.",

And those two communities have histories that are really connected to the American story, migrating to the north, looking for opportunity.So, I think it's a story of hope.

We see many Republicans sending Latino migrants into black neighborhoods. And so, there is this question of a scarcity of resources. People feeling like, well, what is it going to take for my community to get ahead? Is it a zero-sum game when we talk about immigration?

Oscars host, you might remember, Jimmy Kimmel, infamously joked about the diabetes drug Ozempic being used by Hollywood elites to stay slim at last year's ceremony. And now, the maker of a pair of similar drugs will run an ad discouraging people from using them for \"vanity\". Eli Lilly makes Zepbound for obesity and Mounjaro for diabetes. And while it doesn't name the drugs, it does implore people not to use them just to fit into a smaller dress or tux.Let's bring a Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell, who follows this space very closely, and joins us now from New York. Meg, interesting take here from Eli Lilly.",

First of all, as you said, it doesn't say the names of these medicines, and therefore it doesn't have the litany of side effects. You usually hear in pharmaceutical drug ads. But also, the main message here is, we don't want you to take this drug, at least for this specific reason. Take a look at a clip here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There is already a lot of talk around Ozempic, and the Oscars leading into this weekend. We'll see if this ad actually airs during the ceremony itself.But, I spoke with Lilly CEO about why they put this ad together, and he really pointed to three things. One is that they haven't tested this drug for cosmetic weight loss. They've only tested it for diabetes, and for weight loss for people with obesity or weight- related health conditions. He also noted, of course, there is a shortage going on. So, people already can't access these medicines. And also, health insurance coverage is really poor. So, here is what he said about sort of using this moment to try to draw attention to these issues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID A. RICKS, ELI LILLY CEO: This is a serious condition with a serious medication. And yes, the media attention drawn on that from last year and might be drawn this year, we're taking a point of view on that, that these medicines were invented for people with a serious health condition. They're not invented just to have someone who is famous, look a little bit better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They cost more than $1,000 a month without insurance. And Lilly CEO told us half of people who could qualify for these medicines don't have insurance coverage. So, they're really trying to draw attention to that, which of course benefits them.",
