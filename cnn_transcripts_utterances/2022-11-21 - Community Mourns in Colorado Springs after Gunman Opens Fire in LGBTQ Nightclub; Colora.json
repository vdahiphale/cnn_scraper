We're going to speak live with the State's Attorney General about the suspect and the investigation including this video of his arrest last year.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:25:39]  COLLINS:  Major questions remain this morning about the suspect accused of gunning down five people and injuring at least 25 others at a Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub on Saturday, especially because of this, 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich was arrested in June last year in connection with a bomb threat that led to a standoff at his mother's home. You could see the video there of him coming out to police. They had already evacuated the nearby homes during that standoff. Sheriff's Deputies say that they responded after his own mother said he was \"threatening to cause harm to her with a homemade bomb, multiple weapons, and ammunition.\" A lot of questions still about how that case was resolved. Joining us now to talk about this investigation is the Colorado Attorney General, Phil Weiser. And thank you so much, Attorney General for joining us. The major question this morning has been about motive here. Is the suspect speaking to investigators yet and what have you learned about a potential motive, if anything?",

      "sentences": "So, the investigation is ongoing and I think, it is fair to say based on the facts, it's very hard to conceive a situation where the motive wasn't generated by hate.This was a well-known nightclub that individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, the LGBTQ community knew was a safe place. It was a place where people could be their authentic selves, and someone came and essentially took all of that away. Because we know there's so much of this hate out there particularly towards individuals who are LGBTQ and this is obviously something that is painful. It was on Transgender Remembrance Day when it happened. So, this is a call to all of us to look at that hate and ask what do we do about it?",

We know that people who are a risk, who are filled with hate, have firearms, it is a deadly mix.",

You actually campaigned on this heavily.And after the incident that Kaitlan described that happened just over a year ago with a bomb threat to his mother, the woman whose home, his mother, was living in at the time said after this, \"Why is he not in jail?\" After that day, police never reached out to her and she writes, \"I'm a Second Amendment supporter, don't get me wrong, but for him to be out there and have access to weapons, I just don't understand it.\" How can we understand it? Did the Red Flag Law fail here? Did no one use it?",

Obviously, when individuals -- when law enforcement don't use this tool, it's not going to perform its function.The way this tool works is very simple. When we know someone is a significant risk to themselves or other people, law enforcement or even individuals can go into Court and remove those firearms. This law was passed after we had a really horrendous law enforcement involved killing that was in Douglas County named after Zackari Parrish who perished when against someone with a history of violence who had weapons, kept those weapons. We've got to do better and we're going to work on educating law enforcement to make sure that again for everyone who is a responsible gun owner, this Red Flag Law is not about you. This is about people who are dangerous, who we know should not have firearms.",
