      "sentences": "Yeah, it's very sad news, and the Israeli military is admitting that soldiers effectively mistakenly identified these three Israeli hostages as a threat and shot and killed them during combat operations being conducted in Shejaiya, which has been the scene of very heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas over the course of the last week.Two of the three hostages have been identified. One of the families of one of the deceased hostages asked that their name not be broadcast, but the two who we can tell you are Yotam Haim, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz, Kfar Aza on October 7th, and the second is Samer Talalka, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Niz Am, also on October 7th. The Israeli military effectively recovered these bodies in Gaza, moved them to Israel, where they were taken to a forensic center, and then subsequently positively identified as the bodies of three hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. Now, we should note amid all of this that, this comes as the Israeli military had loosened its rules of engagement as it began this war in Gaza following those October 7th attacks, allowing Israeli soldiers to fire upon suspected terrorists while conducting fewer checks than they normally would have. The Israeli military, we're told, is taking lessons from this incident and transmitting them to soldiers in the field. They also say that they, quote, expressed their deep remorse over the tragic incident and send the families their heartfelt, condolences. This also comes as we know that some of those former hostages who were freed as part of that week-long truce between Israel and Hamas, they angrily confronted the Israeli prime minister last week with one of those former hostages, accusing the Israeli government of having no information and no intelligence about the whereabouts of these hostages, noting that the location where she was being kept by Hamas was actually shelled by the Israeli military. And today, we are learning of a far more tragic and direct incident where Israeli forces appear to have fired upon Israeli hostages in Gaza, believing that they were a threat, and then ultimately realizing later after the fact that they were indeed hostages.

But as you noted, one of the other focuses is indeed the civilian casualty count. I mean, we have watched as now nearly 19,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza. Some of those combatants, many of those non-combatants, including over 7,000 children who are believed to be among those who were killed in Gaza, including those who have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.And Jake Sullivan said earlier today that he believes Israel intends to distinguish between Hamas targets and civilians, but that that intention does not always line up with the reality on the ground. And that reality, that mismatch, has really, up until now, mostly applied to Palestinian civilians. But in this case, it appears to also be matching up to a reality that has now affected and resulted in the loss of life of three Israeli civilians. who were held hostage by Hamas and, unfortunately, today killed by Israeli forces.",

And what we have told our troops is, to exercise a little caution when being confronted with people in civilian clothes. Again, part of the complexity here is that we're fighting in a civilian environment where almost all of the RPG crews and the AD crews that are attacking our tanks and our troops have been dressed in civilian clothes. So, it creates a very dynamic and challenging combat environment.And what we have told our troops is to be extra vigilant and do one more safety check before dealing with kinetics with any threat that they face on the battlefield.

Our rules of engagement are those of a military at war against a terrorist organization that uses civilian infrastructure, uses schools and hospitals and mosques and ambulances and all the things that we have seen and you have reported on during the last two months. So, I'm not aware that we have changed any of our rules of engagement.They are according to the laws about conflict and according to our standard practice in war. We will have to look into and analyze exactly what happened. And what I can say so far is that these, the three Israelis, former hostages, they were above ground in Syria, in close proximity to one of our units in the area and then were misidentified as posing a threat. And therefore, Israeli troops fired and unfortunately killed them.",

It's the White House. So, I'm wondering what your response would be then to Jake Sullivan as he's in the region right now asking Israeli officials to do more.",

What I know is that we continue to respect the laws of conflict. And to listen, to listen to professional and well- intentioned criticism of our operations, including the ones that you mentioned, and to adapt where applicable, where feasible, and where it is possible to do so while still fighting and beating the enemy.It would, of course, be very, very much easier to fight in an area where the enemy is not embedded within the civilian population. But again, if we understand and I think that enough people around the world understand what the challenges that we are facing are. In order to defeat Hamas, we have to take them out where they are. We would like to fight out in the open in the deserts of Sinai if we could, metaphorically speaking, not now going into Egypt. But to fight in open areas would be great, not to have civilians at risk. But that is not where the enemy is. And we saw that on October the 7th, they came from these very same tunnels. These very same strongholds where they are now hiding underneath the civilians. This is where they operate from. And if we don't take them out there, then we will invite additional October 7th attack on our civilians. And that cannot happen. And I agree. And, you know, we've been listening to critique. We do take extra precaution. We do use ammunition that is tailored to certain areas. And we take a lot of preventive steps in order to minimize collateral damage. Had we not been doing that in this very difficult, almost impossible situation, I can assure you that the number of non-combatants that would have been affected would have been much, much higher. But we are moving civilians out of the battlefield. We are warning ahead of time. We're providing humanitarian assistance. We opened the Kerem Shalom crossing just a few hours ago, again, at the request and based on the guidance of our allies and our friends around the world. We are listening. But at the end of the day, when everything is said and done to defeat Hamas in order to provide security for our civilians, that needs to be front and center. And for us, that is front and center of everything that we're doing.",

What we're talking about here is the underlying intelligence that formed the basis for the US government's assessment that Vladimir Putin sought to help Trump win the 2016 election.The disappearance of this binder was so alarming to intelligence officials that they briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee about the situation last year.

She said it had been kept in a safe in Meadows' office when it was not being worked on. And Hutchinson also wrote about this classified intelligence in her new book, claiming that on January 19th, the final night of the Trump presidency that she saw Meadows leave the White House with an unredacted binder tucked under his arm.Now, Mark Meadows' attorney strongly denies this. He said in a statement to us that Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material. Any such material that he handled or was in possession of has been treated accordingly. And any suggestion that he is responsible for any missing binder or other classified information is flat wrong.

The political appointees were gone. Civil servants were preparing for the turnover the very next day with Biden becoming president, and it never happened.

So that's part of the reason they've been, no doubt, going after this information, try to push this argument at trial if it gets there.But part of the more interesting thing is, and Evan mentioned this as well, we have that testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson saying that Mark Meadows walked off with it. Mark Meadows' lawyer gave this like non- denial denial statement, not really saying they don't have it, just saying we didn't mishandle anything. So, it's entirely possible it's there.
