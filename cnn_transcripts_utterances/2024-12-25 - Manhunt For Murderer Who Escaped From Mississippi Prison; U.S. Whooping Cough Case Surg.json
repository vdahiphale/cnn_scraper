Authorities now say at least 38 people are dead after an Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed and burst into flames in Kazakhstan. But there were 29 survivors as well, including two children. Eleven are in critical condition.Now you can see dramatic video shows dazed survivors being pulled from the wreckage. We have to warn you this next video may be disturbing to watch. Just terrifying images right there. And in this video posted to social media, you can actually see the plane descending to the ground in what appears to be the moment of impact. A Russian aviation watchdog says preliminary information suggests the pilot tried to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Trans Partition Mary Schiavo joins me now. Mary, I mean, just incredible to watch some of this video. You see the plane really erratically circling the airfield before that crash. A Russian aviation watchdog, like I just said, is suggesting that this may have been an attempt to land after a bird strike. What's your take on what you're seeing here?",

      "sentences": "Well, what I'm seeing is it has to be more than a bird strike because the plane did not have what's called pitch control. In other words, how many degrees up or down the nose is. How much is the nose pointed up or how much is it pointed down? So it obviously had some damage to the pitch control, which could be from the trim system, which helps the pilot keep the nose in the right place up or down, or the elevator, which is in the back of the plane. So there had to be something additional going on.Also, there's unconfirmed reports that the pilot had done what's called squawking. In other words, you put your radio, you put your equipment on, and it sends a certain Signal, which is 7700, which says you've got a serious onboard problem. And then also, when looking at a publicly available flight radar system online, you can see that the pilot fought with this plane for some time before choosing to land it at another airport. And so this wasn't something that happened. And then the plane was brought down. For example, on landing, you hit a flock of birds, and the altitude makes me wonder, you know, would the birds been at that altitude? But the pilot really fought. Pilots really fought with this plane for some time and then did a figure eight before landing. They did two circles and then tried to land. So it appeared that they were trying to gain control of this aircraft and really put quite a fight up on this Embraer 190.",

That's Leakesville, Mississippi, in between Hattiesburg and Jackson, Mississippi. And we want you to take a quick look at this photo. Take a good look at this photo because police in the region are asking for your help in trying to find him. He may look slightly different than he looks in this photo, though. There is another photo that we've yet to verify that's floating around the Internet that shows Johnson with a beard, also hair, new tattoos around his eyelids, potentially.

It was back in 2016 that he was convicted of the murder of a friend who posted on social media and just four days later was found buried in a field with more than two dozen stab wounds. After he was detained and taken into custody, he had another run in with an inmate and tried to kill that inmate. According to authorities, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder after trying to kill that inmate with a brick, repeatedly striking him in the head. Not only that, he set fire to the Shelby County Jail in Tennessee notonce but twice. So this is a man with a violent streak and authorities are very concerned. They call him desperate and violent and they're very worried that he's on the run during Christmas. They say this is a time when people tend to be more generous. They tend to let their guards down. They want you to remain vigilant and stay vigilant and be careful. Again, Drew Johnson, 33 years old, has been on the run since yesterday afternoon. Danny.",

It's theoretically a defense, but I find it very unlikely.I mean, they have video of this individual sitting pretty calmly. He goes over to fan the flames with a T-shirt. It seems to me that he's going to be unlikely to show that he was so drunk that he actually couldn't form the intent to commit these crimes. So unlikely to succeed, I would say.",

Similarly, if he were to be acquitted, he will be given to the immigration authorities and be deported. So he won't end up here on the loose in the United States after this case is resolved either way. But it won't really come into the courtroom because it's not something that would be relevant to the charges.So it's not as if the jury is going to hear that he's an undocumented immigrant and that had something to do with the case unless there is some way that it did.

So while prosecutors technically don't have to prove it as part of their checklist of what they need to prove, they do try to find the motive and they do try to give the jury the reason for the crime, because jurors want to know, just like we all want to know why someone would do such a thing. I just think in this case it's really going to be impossible to find a motive that makes sense, right, for this horrible crime.So it'll be interesting to see what prosecutors put forward as kind of their theory of the case, why this man did this.

You know, otherwise, I can tell you inside the White House, there's abit of divide here where some people are a little bit in senioritis mode. They're looking, you know, for their next job. They are sort of checked out. And there are some people that are sort of running through the tape and they're trying to get as much stuff done as possible. But as a result, sometimes some of those attempts have been sloppy. You saw that the recent clemency announcements. Just this last week, there were people on that list that were politically problematic, including the judge that oversaw the Kids for Cash scandal.

And I think it's been clear over the last few months that his abilities as a communicator have also been a bit diminished.

And for crimes that have not usually fallen under the death penalty, Trump has made very clear that the thing about Joe Biden's clemency with the death penalty that has been really striking is that in some ways he framed it in moral terms that the death penalty is wrong. But then if it's wrong, then why were a few people exempted?And that part is not made clear. Now, the people he exempted, Dylann Roof, for example, in South Carolina, that was a mass murder in a black church that Biden was very much involved in and the grieving process.

And, you know, prior to the 1940s, when vaccinations were not that common in the United States, about 9,000 kids would die per year in the United States. And what this bacteria does is it attaches to the cells that line the airways. They're called cilia, the sort of hair-like cells, and damages those cells and creates a tremendous cough that can last for weeks.It's highly contagious. People can be contagious for weeks. It can be treated with antibiotics. But young children or people with immune systems that are impaired or people with asthma are particular risk of severe illness from pertussis. And the vaccination rate in the United States is dropping. Last year, only 91 percent of kids going to kindergarten had been vaccinated with the DTP vaccine, which contains the component for pertussis. And as this rate drops, the level of infection in the community rises. And so far this year, we've seen about six times more whooping cough than we did last year. And again, this is a vaccine- preventable illness. I mentioned that 9,000 kids died in the 40s per year. Last year, only three children died of this. And that's where we really want to be. Why go back to the times when we would just wring our hands and say, wow, what can we do? There's a lot to do. We can vaccinate children.
