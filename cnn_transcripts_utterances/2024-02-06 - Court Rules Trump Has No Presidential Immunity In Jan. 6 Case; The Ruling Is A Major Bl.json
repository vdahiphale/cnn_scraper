      "sentences": "All right. We start with breaking news here on State of the Race. This is what we've been waiting for. Afederal appeals court has ruled that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to try to reverse the 2020 election results. The ruling is a major blow to Trump's defense in the federal election subversion case that was brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. He has argued he was simply acting in his official duties as President. Here is what the three-judge panel from the D.C. Circuit Appeals Court said in their decision, \"For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\" Trump's team has been quick to fire back, his campaign releasing the statement, \"If immunity is not granted to a President, every future President who leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party. Without complete immunity, a President of the United States would not be able to properly function. Prosecuting a President for official acts violates the Constitution and threatens the bedrock of our Republic.\" All right. We're going to get more on this right now from CNN's Kristen Holmes, who joins us. Kristen, the judges pushed back in the ruling. They offered a defense that basically argues against the statement that the Trump team just put out that we just read, which basically says and cites other previous presidents who have acknowledged that if in fact a President is immune from prosecution, then effectively they're -- that is completely unacceptable because it would make our system of government null and void in some ways. What is your latest reporting in talking to the Trump team, and what do you think we should highlight in this ruling? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, here is the thing to point out about Donald Trump and the immunity ruling overall. This is a core argument for the former President. It's not just his legal arguments really become part of his political argument as well, saying that he should be immune, that every President should be immune, essentially arguing that presidents can't not have immunity or else they'll be indicted as soon as they leave office. Now, the appeals court actually pushes back directly on this claim, saying that past presidents have seemed to acknowledge that they knew that they could be prosecuted while they were in office. And that's the way that the system has continued to work. Now, when I'm talking to Trump's team, you have to remember, this is a huge loss. Part of this is not just the loss of the fact that he lost the appeal but it's also the fact that this could change the date. And they actually put a timing on this to give him timing to appeal to the Supreme Court that he has to appeal by February 12. Now, the reason why this is so interesting is because it's essentially speeding up the process. As we know, this was a trial that was supposed to take place in Washington, D.C. in March. Last week, they strapped that off the table, putting it on almost an infinite delay. That was a win for Donald Trump's team. That has been their tactic this entire time, to delay, delay, delay, hopefully pushing back all of these legal issues beyond the 2024 election. Now, with this small timeline or quick timeline that he can appeal to SCOTUS, to the Supreme Court of the United States, that could put a calendar date before 2024 for this trial, something that Trump's team absolutely does not want. So, that's why this is a loss in two general ways. The other part of this is that we know that if he does apply -- he does -- excuse me, appeal this to the Supreme Court that there will be a stay, meaning another delay. So, that's something that they're likely going to take them up on, because again, this is all part of a larger tactic here to try and push his legal issues to be on the election.",

And Alayna, let me just pick up with you, because you and Kristen are often our team covering Donald Trump. And in one of the like interesting lines of reporting that's come out in recent days is how Trump's team has underscored to him that he needs to win his reelection bid in order to solve many of his legal problems. What are you learning in your conversations? I know you've been on the phone with Trump people. How are they -- what's their posture? Is this something that has put them back on their heels? Made them -- are you picking up stress from them? And what do you think the next move is?",

And the other thing is, as Kristen mentioned that, we saw last week Judge Tanya Chutkan take this off the calendar and they were very happy about that. And they thought that maybe - - that means that another case the Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, his case looking at payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, that one would go first. That's the case just for comparison that they find far weaker, that they wanted to set the tone for all of his potential trials, because they figured that's when they can call political, can keep building his support when it comes to his legal battles. This is not that. And so, what they're probably going to do here is try to go the appeals route to the Supreme Court to delay this further and see how much time they can continue to get, and hopefully, ultimately try to push this back until after the election.",

Susan Page, you have covered this town. Your expertise is deep. You have seen all kinds of misconduct by politicians that you have covered. I kind of want to go big picture here, because in this ruling, there are some significant statements about the nature of presidential power. Right? I mean, this is a very existential question for our democracy. So, we said -- we talked at the top about how they said President Trump has become citizen Trump. They go on to write, \"It would be a striking paradox if the President, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to 'take Care of the law -- that the Laws be faithfully executed' were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity.\" And when you put it in those terms, it does kind of -- it underscores the fact that in the United States, we have a President. We don't have a king. When you see this ruling and as you've been going through it, what is your kind of broad sense of what this means for not just Donald Trump, but for us as a country?",

I think this is a ruling we expected, although thefact that it's unanimous and so emphatic is interesting, but it is such an important ruling. And one reason is because it affects the definition of the powers of a President when he is in office and otherwise. And one reason that the Trump people have been so focused on this trial, it is the one with the most political punch as well. This is an issue that if he got convicted of this, we know from polling that there are any number of people who are inclined to vote for Trump, who would have second thoughts. That may not be true for the other cases against him, for cases involving misuse of sensitive documents, for instance. That may not strike people as being as serious hush money payments. They've already come to terms with some aspects of Donald Trump's behavior. But, this goes to the heart of what a President can do. And if he loses on this and then is convicted at trial, I think that is -- the case, it has the most potential to really change the outcome of the presidential election.",

Youunderstand how people are thinking about this. And one of the things we've been learning as we've started to finally hear from voters in the Republican primary in Iowa and New Hampshire is that there does seem to be a contingent of people who feel differently about voting for former President Trump, if he is convicted versus if he is not. What do you think the implications are politically of what we're learning today? MATT MOWERS, PRESIDENT, VALCOUR GLOBAL PUBLIC STRATEGY, &amp; FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ADVISOR: Well, it doesn't -- politically, I don't think today's case actually changes much, right, because at the end of the day, Susan is right. Most legal scholars didn't anticipate that this was going to be ruled any differently. And I don't think even President Trump's team truly believed that today was going to have a different outcome or a different ruling. The political implication comes from, how does this impact the timing of the other cases? How does this determine whether the D.C. case is actually heard before November? What impact could it potentially even have on the case coming out of Florida, and then also the timing of it? Alayna is absolutely right. The political implications of the Alvin Bragg case going first are going to help Donald Trump immensely. Most observers, including mainstream Republicans, some who are disinclined to support Donald Trump, believe that the Bragg case is politically motivated, the weakest of the bunch, and is one that if you are Donald Trump, you want to go first because you have no better adversary, no better opponent than Alvin Bragg, who is a liberal prosecutor from New York City.",

Let's bring in now CNN's Senior Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic, because, Joan, as we know and Alayna walked us through kind of the choices facing the Trump team in terms of how far to appeal this, but it is clear that we are on track based on the seriousness of the discussion in this ruling about presidential powers and our democracy itself. This is headed for the Supreme Court.

      "sentences": "Thanks, Kasie. This opinion is very forcefully written. It's unanimous. It hits all the rightnotes about what the law has said that would stop President Trump -- former President Trump from having absolute immunity from criminal prosecution after leaving office. So, it relied on past Supreme Court cases. It thoroughly dissected his arguments. As we've said from the beginning, the law really isn't on the side of Donald Trump. But, it's important that the Supreme Court itself has never definitively ruled on whether a former President is absolutely immune. And Donald Trump is probably going to make the case as he has till February 12 to try to seek Supreme Court intervention here that this is something that the Supreme Court itself should resolve. Now, this is going to be a tough choice for the Supreme Court. I think there is going to be a lot of incentive inside not to want to take it up. The D.C. circuit panel here did a very solid job of explaining why Donald Trump should not be shielded from prosecution that that trial should go forward. So -- and also, as we know and you probably already laid out, the Supreme Court will be hearing the important Colorado case on Thursday, testing whether Donald Trump can remain on the ballot in Colorado and on other state ballots nationwide. The Colorado Supreme Court had said he is disqualified from future office because of his role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. So, the justices already have a difficult case that involves Donald Trump who is always problematic for him one way or another, and as a case that's going to play into the election. Do they want to take yet another case that will be so politically charged? But, I do have to say it only takes four votes to grant a petition for certiorari, as it's called, an appeal from a lower court. It takes five votes to kind of stop any kind of motion, but just four votes to grant a case. So, it's hard for me to say that absolutely they will not take this case up. But, we do know that the clock is going to still run for another week or two because Donald Trump has appealed (ph) the 12th. I presume that the justices will then ask for some sort of response from Jack Smith to say, do you think this -- we should take it up? And Jack Smith, once upon a time, wanted the justices to take it up, said this was very important. But, that was before there was any kind of answer from at least this important appellate court resolving the issue.",

And if they don't intervene, then it all goes back down to the trial court judge who had originally scheduled that March 4 trial start, and maybe it will only be postponed till like, say, April 4. But, the justices could take a little bit more time to even decide whether to take it or not take it. Maybe there'll be a justice or two that wants to dissent from that order and take some time to write a dissent. And we've got some wildcards on this court.

And Joey, it's always wonderful to have you. Thank you for being here. I just want to start for people who are just joining us and catching up to speed, the line, the key line from this ruling says, \"For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\" How do you view this ruling?

It means that the court really is in terrain that they haven't been in. But, when looking at it, what struck me in the case was that they said, look, presidents have contemplated that they could be prosecuted. And the significance of that is that law is about precedent and history. And specifically to that point, Kasie, they point to the issue of -- if you remember President Ford and the pardon of Nixon. There would be no basis to pardon President Nixon at the time if the Constitution did not or if the laws did not contemplate, right, the prosecution of the President. They went into Bill Clinton in the ruling and spoke to the issue of, prior to him leaving office, he agreed to a five-year forfeiture of his license and a fine in lieu of being prosecuted later. And so, all that significant, because it gives really some context with respect to why they are ruling, that is the court, Kasie, why they're making these and drawing these conclusions. So, I think on the law, it's very sound to the basic point of essentially a President being a citizen. At the end of the day, you cannot use your office in a way that would be devoid of any type of legality. They talk about the clause to faithfully execute the laws, which is significant. And so, I think just on par with a legal precedent, on par with legal analysis, on par with legal rulings, I just think that, I'm not going to say unassailable, perhaps that's an overstatement, but I just think that the analysis employed by this court is extraordinarily sound. And I just -- of course, the President can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But, I do not see at this point an identifiable basis to overturn this decision, as it's been written and constituted.",

In fact, it's not really based on any law that a U.S. President cannot be indicted while he is a sitting President. That is not the law. It is not something that we worked under on Watergate. In terms of the politics, what is different now is the polarization that Donald Trump has basically gone out, unlike any other President that we've had, and gone out and just blatantly lied about what he has done. In fact, all of his criminal activities based on this January 6 election interference is based on the big lie that the election was rigged in 2020. I mean, that just was false. And built upon that falsehood, he did a whole bunch of other things in terms of trying to get his attorney general move down somebody else in to send a letter to the state legislatures to change the electoral votes, calling the Secretary of State in Georgia and trying to get him to fix the vote, etcetera, etcetera.

Now, when it comes to Trump's team themselves, they are saying that they are going to appeal this. And the one thing we should watch for is them trying to delay this as long as possible. That means filing motions to stay this trial. What they want is they don't want this trial to happen before the 2024 election in November. Last week, they had a huge win when Judge Chutkan, the judge in this case, essentially took this trial off of the calendar. They believe that that was a very good thing for them. They've been trying to delay it. This is a case they are very concerned about. Now, with this ruling, with the timeline put on this, it could move up that trial date, again, probably not March as it was supposed to be, but it could be May, April event.

It's that. And he sort of -- he talked about both the ways in which kind of illegal process, the precedents that kind of rules, that the Justice Department follows are a little bit different than what they were following in the Nixon era, but also kind of just the sheer, the partisanship, the division.

The one time he really did lose support for a bit was after the 2022 election where people really felt his obsession with 2020. His support of election deniers really cost Republicans a better election, the election that they were expecting, including taking back the House and -- or the Senate. And his support dropped and DeSantis actually went ahead of him. So, I think there are -- there might be a limit to this.

I mean, it's not the Rose Garden, but we essentially have a courthouse strategy right now where he is currently doing most of his press conferences in front of some sort of statue of justice. Sometimes, that's in front of a courthouse. And so, he is so intertwined. And what does is it does two things. One, it serves to fire up his base, because if you talk to the conservative Republican base, they believe this is all political. This is all partisan. They think this is no different than the stuff that the State Department condemns in places like Venezuela and around the world. They think it's the beginning of a banana republic. And it also does one other thing by having him in these courtrooms day after day after day, even when he is not required to be there, as it starts to desensitize the American public to the image of him being in the courtroom at a time when he is going to have to be further down when there are these criminal cases coming down the pike.",
