Later this week, Zelenskyy will travel to Washington where he'll meet with President Biden, also unveil his long awaited victory plan. Biden, who addressed the U.N.

So they have pushed forward in the east of late. You will probably point to the incursion into Russia itself, into the Kursk region as evidenced that the aid is working. He will probably echo what we heard from President Biden earlier on, which is to not grow weary, that even though this war is dragging on, that this, this, that it is one that is worth supporting continuing to support. He will reiterate, I imagine what he has said in the past that we are essentially fighting on behalf of the West. We not asking you to contribute soldiers as long as you can send -- continue to send us aid. But he really has a big task ahead of him, Erica, because he is going to be presenting this plan for victory as he's been calling it, to the Biden administration later this week. We don't have too many details. Certainly, the administration is going to be wanting a lot of those details and it will be a question of convincing them that this is a valid plan and what we understand so far is that it will be designed to essentially tell the U.S. and therefore the allies that if you continue to strengthen Ukraine, that we can get Russia to a point where there can be a diplomatic solution. But we are quite a ways from there. So there's a lot for Zelenskyy to do at the U.N., and then later on this week at the White House, Erica.",

You're picking up on what both Fred and Alex were talking about there. As we wait for this victory plan later this week and we wait to hear from President Zelenskyy just a few moments from now, the way that this is being laid out by the Ukrainians, if you give us the okay right to strike deeper into Russia, we believe then that this will put Russia in such a place that we can negotiate. Is he right? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  He's probably right there, but no one really knows and you have to test it. And then we'll have to put a lot of pressure on the Russians. Putin will have to understand, will have to come to understand that he cannot win. He undoubtedly recognizes and the people around him undoubtedly recognize that it was a mistake to invade Ukraine in the first place, and he's probably looking for, probably thinks he can wait us out and wait the Europeans out and wait for the Ukrainians out. But the victory plan that President Zelenskyy presents to President Biden is adopted and President Biden and Europeans say and commit to being there for -- not for as long as it takes, but until they prevail, until the Ukrainians win. You heard -- you quoted President Biden, there are a couple of times where he says, when this is an important change. And if Putin realized that, when Putin realizes that we're in it until the Ukrainian win, then he'll look for a way out. That's what President Zelenskyy is going to try to make the case.",

This was truly a speech that was designed for the international community. I mean, this was very much in the context of the United Nations. First of all, he's speaking in English so clearly, he is trying to speak to the world and not just a domestic audience, but then consistently bringing it back to the U.N. Charter. This kind of echoes what we heard from President Joe Biden earlier today when he said that the support that the U.S. has given for Ukraine reflects the U.N. Charter, the values of the United Nations, as you mentioned, Erica, President Zelenskyy saying there that there are not multiple U.N. Charters and there really is just one that has universal values and Russia has breached the U.N. charter in a variety of ways. But then he also sought to give his audience a sense that there is an end in sight, that he does have a plan for an end to this war, that this isn't just a war that's going to go on forever. He talked about a peace summit a second peace summit to end this war. Or they're already was a peace summit. A couple of months ago in Geneva, at where he brought a number of countries together to talk about the future of the war in Ukraine. Here he was talking about the number of countries from around the world, Brazil, India, Russia, countries from the Middle East that will come together to end this war. But, of course, the most important country I would argue on that needs to be there aside from Ukraine, of course, is Russia. And right now, there is no sense from anybody who talked to you that Russia wants to come to the table to negotiate a diplomatic end to this war. And so, what we're going to hear from President Zelenskyy later on in the week tomorrow, I imagine at the general assembly, but then when he goes to Washington to meet with president Biden, is please continue this, support ratchet up the military support so that Ukraine can make military gains to put that pressure on Russia in order to force them to the table. It is going to be a diplomatic solution the U.S. believes and Ukraine believes that is going to end this war. But for now, President Zelenskyy's goal is to generate continued and increased support from the U.S. from countries around the world for their fight against Russia, in order to get to a place where there can be some kind of diplomatic solution to finally end this war, Erica.",

A new poll out this week shows Harris with a narrow lead there, 51 to 45 percent. As you can see, that's just outside the margin of error.

I thought it was interesting that over the weekend, Tammy Baldwin, who's in -- who's in a race, of course, herself, there, brought in Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who tends to do fairly well with independents, with Republicans, brought him in as she was waiting with voters in more rural counties rather. How helpful are surrogates like that and how much of an impact do you think that they could have specifically on rural voters?",

And ever before you see that what the selection of Governor Tim Walz as vice presidential nominee on the Democratic ticket, and you see that with Tammy Baldwin's campaign, I think one of the big things that challenger Eric Hovde is facing is just that the Democrats have been spending millions of dollars nationally to come into this state of Wisconsin and define him early.Now, whether or not the Democrats are able to pull off a change in terms of the trends in rural Wisconsin is yet to be seen. The reality is that things have trended toward the GOP because they've been able to connect with them on some those economic issues, whether or not that continues is what we're going to see on Election Day. And this chew of the disappearing farms in our country is something that evolves voters by both parties over the decades. And so, this is something where there is an opportunity for people who will vote for Republicans might also vote for a blue collar Democrat. It depends.",

They're going to advocate for a farm bill that's going to work for our farmers. And they are going to protect the Affordable Care Act. They are going to lower prescription drug prices says and those are all things that are going to be at risk with another Donald Trump presidency.

I think it's important to ask it regardless of how these elections go, the important thing is to figure out what's going on in these states.The reality is that in states like Wisconsin, there's a need to revitalize communities all over the state, rural areas, small town areas, a lot of areas that feel like they've been left behind in a very, very deep way. And that gets to policies that increase innovation and our rural economy. It gets to policies that help with a fair playing field for small businesses. It gets to policies that talk about new entrepreneurial opportunity and some of these places that have been left behind. I think that's something that our political conversation still doesn't catch up on. And as I suggested, I think that both parties work to do around that type of thing.",

And we'll have the opportunity to really have a legislature that represents the will of the people and can make some progress there. So I think that will lead to a much better policy. Democrats actually have the opportunity to take back the majority and the state assembly this cycle and make some gains and the state Senate, and either way, there are going to be much more competitive seats throughout the state legislature, which I think just makes for -- for better policy all around when voters get to choose their elected officials instead of the other way around, most of all that.",
