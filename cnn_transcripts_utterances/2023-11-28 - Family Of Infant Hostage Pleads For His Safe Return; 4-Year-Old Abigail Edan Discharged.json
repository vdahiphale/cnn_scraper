It's about grief and loss, which is something we all have, or will experience, but rarely talk about. I certainly haven't. I didn't plan on doing a second season of \"All There Is.\" But in the last few months, I've come to realize how little I understand my own grief, and how much more there is to learn. If you haven't listened to the first season, it's available now. And the new season starts tomorrow. We've got some really interesting guests coming up, including President Biden. You can find Season Two of \"All There Is\" tomorrow morning, on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. I hope you like it, and find it helpful.

      "sentences": "Good evening. This is THE SOURCE. I'm Kaitlan Collins, live from Tel Aviv, tonight.Israel has just gotten the list of the sixth group of hostages, expected to be released, tomorrow. And we are told by sources that the families, right now, are being notified. But the major question that still stands, tonight, is what happens, on night seven, when this truce is set to expire? CIA Director, Bill Burns, was in Qatar, for meetings, today, where I'm told he pushed, for an expanded hostage deal that would include men, and potentially IDF soldiers. We don't know where that is going to lead. But what we do know, right now, is that 10 more Israelis, who were being held hostage, for more than 52 days, are back home, tonight, as well as two Thai citizens, who were also being held hostage, have been released. We saw them being handed over, in Rafah, earlier tonight. In the video, large crowds are lining the street, and jeering, as the hostages are paraded through members of Hamas. Some could be heard chanting \"Allahu Akbar,\" while an elderly woman was being transferred, in a wheelchair. Today's freed hostages are all adult women, except one. 17-year-old Mia Leimberg. She was released, along with her mother, and it turns out their family dog was also with them. No Americans were a part of this group, today, as the White House says they're still hopeful some could be released, tomorrow, on day six, when this truce is set to expire. Also, not released, the youngest hostage, 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, a hostage, for 53 days now, along with his 4-year-old brother Ariel, 53 days. We have an emotional interview, with Kfir and Ariel's relative, who is worried that the baby could starve. We'll see that in just a moment. But I want to start now, with the latest, with CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Matthew Chance. Matthew, we're seeing this video. Can you just kind of walk us through what -- break down what we're actually seeing in this video that's released, tonight.",

You can see how they're sort of tracking the wheelchair, which is being pushed, with one Israeli elderly woman, being taken to the Red Cross ambulances. You can also see the crowds. They obviously all have been told to come there. And they are baying, they are heckling the hostages, as they're sort of handed over, to the Red Cross. And so, it's interesting in that sense. But we've seen videos like this sort of every night. And I think Hamas obviously releases its own version of this. And it plays well, I think, to the supporters of Hamas, in the region, and around the world, that shows them as magnanimous that they are releasing people. I mean, that is something an aspect of their image they're obviously very keen to play up.",

Because one of the things that Bill Burns, the Director of CIA, and the Prime Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the Egyptian Intelligence Chief, Abbas Kamel, what they heard today, from the Director of Mossad, David Barnea, is that Israel is not ready to discuss any future deal, on hostages, on men, on soldiers, on anything, before all the women and children are released, as part of this current deal.

And this is why, by the way, you hear from U.S. officials that they're more and more concerned, about such a move, because they feel that it might be coming, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not the day after, maybe the pause will be extended, by a few days.

I mean, when does it become a point, where it's the sustained delivery of commercial goods, in addition to just the basic aid that's going in now? POWER: Well, again, we are very clear that there has been progress, but that what is going in is still not enough. And that is both because the humanitarian supplies should increase. I convened my international counterparts, from all around the world, and implored them to increase the amount of funding they provide, to U.N. agencies, and non-governmental organizations, so that cash and actual resources don't become a limiting factor here. It had been that the inspections and getting supplies in were the limiting factors. You'd hate to see it be just a shortage of money, on the part of the World Food Programme, or UNICEF, or other partners. So, that is key getting, again, those -- that flow going. But it will be ultimately inadequate, without commercial traffic as well, accompanying humanitarian traffic. This is something that President Biden has raised, at the highest level. It is something the White House has seized with our Special Envoy in the region, as well is pushing for commercial access. So again, each week we see more progress, in terms of supplies, going in. The pause has given us a chance to expand dramatically, again, the throughput as they say. But we need to supplement humanitarian supplies with commercial supplies.
