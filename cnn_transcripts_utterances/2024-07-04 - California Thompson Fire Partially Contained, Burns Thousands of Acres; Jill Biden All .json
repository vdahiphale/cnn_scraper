And this is all leading to very dangerous conditions for those firefighters as you said, but also for the people living here, especially thousands of them who have been evacuated because of this Thompson Blaze up here in Northern California.But just overall, I want to paint the picture of how much more dire things look this year as far as number of acres burned. According to CalFire, if you look at how much has burned so far this year, there is a 1600 percent increase compared to this same period of last year, when you look at the number of acres burned, so, so far this year and this not even including the expulsion of the Thompson Fire, there have been a burning of over 130,000 acres so far this year. That is very concerning. And then you add in the fact that here in the Sacramento area, we're going to see the temperatures above 105 degrees for a week. That is also very dangerous. This is why, even though it's the Fourth of July, they are reminding people to not use fireworks. I know people want to do that and they're banned throughout a lot of California, but it is dangerous because of the fact that things are so dry. In fact, take a listen to CalFire official here explaining just why we are in the situation we are with the brush. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She's also the author of \"The Residence\" and \"First Women.\" Kate, great to see you. So we've heard so much in the past week about Jill Biden's influence on her husband, how are protective she is of him.

I mean, they -- even Pat Nixon didn't want her husband to resign during Watergate.So these women are fiercely loyal to their husbands and are their husbands' greatest defenders.

I mean, she can be helpful to his reelection efforts. And first ladiesalways are. But she can't win this for him. He's got to go out there in media interviews and on the stump, and convince people that what they saw on Thursday was an anomaly. It's not what we're going to see in the future and that he's still very deeply engaged. But this family is really circling the wagons around President Biden. And they're just a really tight-knit group of people with Hunter and his sister, Valerie, Ashley. I mean, they're all very much supportive of their father staying in the race because they do believe that he is the only real option to beat Donald Trump.",

They have come out, like you said, the White House has said that Jill Biden is not a political adviser. It's the president's job to run the country.But I think what we're seeing is if they're talking about switching up members of the campaign team, that's what political advisers do, right? So there's a fine line that she's walking. So if we see changes among the campaign team and there are reporting that's out there that she is involved in those decisions, that shows to me that she really is more a Nancy Reagan, Hillary Clinton than some people might have thought before.",
