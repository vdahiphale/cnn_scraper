So that means they're going to be going into the computer logs at the FAA. And they're going to be going one by one zero by zero back through those logs to look for anomalous behavior. Where did the system start to crack or glitch? What was the domino effect where it started to get worse? And then go back further, which is, did something come in from the outside? What other places does the system touch? What thumb drive could have introduced something through either a vendor or something else?

The holiday period is behind us.There are lots of seats out there for people to be rebooked and rescheduled on other connecting flights. And so typically what the airlines like to do is they'll do a reset of their operation tonight and then try to get the pieces in place to have tomorrow morning start out fresh, clean slate.

I worked with law enforcement agents from the FBI, DEA local and all the way across the board. But I also served on judiciary and oversight for my first two years in Congress.I've read the two IG reports that have come out. I have seen what the - what we're doing dealing with it and one of my biggest frustrations is that the leadership of the FBI by politicizing and DOJ politicizing so many different things, that the rank and file members who are just trying to do the best work they can in places like North Dakota are losing steam through no fault of their own. We have to get into this. I was actually one of the first people in judiciary on the Republican side to go after Director Wray in a hearing after President Trump appointed him. So I'm - these are really serious issues and we need to we need to investigate and deal with it. We've had - FBI whistleblower has already come forward and there's a real serious problem in leadership and just changing regulation isn't going to solve it.",

And this isn't the first time that has happened either, whether it's censoring the New York Post a hundred different people, we obviously know DOJ was coordinating heavily, big government was coordinating with big tech in order to suppress certain things in dealing with that.   So my major concern right now is the difference in timing, but I'mhopeful what we do as Republicans is something that I don't feel like Democrats did for my first two years. We're going to investigate the conduct and take it where it goes and we're going to do it a serious way and then prejudge any conclusions till we figure out what's going on.",

Now scientists are thinking the big one, that trillion dollar event could be an event like this, where it's just a month of relentless rain that floods the entire Inland Valley, where a quarter of our food is grown and will just have devastating effects.
