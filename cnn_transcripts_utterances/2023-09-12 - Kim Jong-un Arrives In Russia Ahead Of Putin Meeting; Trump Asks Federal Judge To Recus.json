So what we're seeing here is basically a reformation of an Asian bloc that is an alternative in many ways to the American led order.And that is China and Russia, which of course announced a partnership without limits. There clearly are limits to it back during the Olympics, just prior to the invasion of Ukraine. North Korea, Iran, and of course they're trying to bring in other nations as well. It's also a very big move for Kim Jong-un, who thought he had something going with President Trump a few years ago in their three meetings. President Trump promised that that would result in North Korea disarming. In fact, he never got back a single missile or a single nuclear weapon, and the North Korean arsenal has increased. But now suddenly Kim's in the position where someone needs him, and that's Vladimir Putin, who's desperate for arms. The Chinese will not provide them. And this is his moment to get them. And what it means is the pressure is off from Russia and to some degree from China on the North.",

One was the last time you can remember, Phil, that anybody needed anything from North Korea other than, you know, a cessation of threats. So, it's a pretty remarkable moment.Now, a couple of big questions. First of all, can the North Koreans provide what the Russians want in the quantities that they need? Second, is there anything that the United States can do or other allies to stop them? I mean, we could, I guess, try more sanctions, but at this point, since we've been sanctioning North Korea since the 1950s, we're pretty well out of options. We could try to intercept some of this at sea to the degree that it runs. I see, as you can see from that train ride, there are our land ways to deliver weapons to Russia. But that would probably be highly risky. And, of course, South Korea is providing artillery to Ukraine, indirectly, but 650, 000 rounds, we believe, of artillery that has been useful to Ukraine, and so I'm sure the Russians think this is just fair play.",

And she was essentially making the point at the sentencings that, yes, you're being prosecuted rightly so for storming the Capitol, but more responsible people are not. The problem, however, with Donald Trump's argument legally is that, a, it's really hard to get a judge to recuse himself or herself and, b, you can't base a recusal motion for the most part on something that a judge said during a court proceeding, basically, because that's a judge's job. They have to take all the evidence in front of them, make decisions, make determinations, sometimes about the relative culpability of other people. And so, the Supreme Court has basically said, if you're trying to recuse a judge, you have to do it based on something outside of whatever she said in the scope of an actual case in court.

Now, the date to watch, that would be September 30th, less than three weeks from now. McCarthy has to cut a deal with Democrats who control the Senate and the White House to avoid that shutdown. But he's also facing new threats to his speakership by some hardliners in his caucus. Joining us now is Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina. She's a member of the House Oversight Committee, and it's that committee that I want to start with. There have been -- there's been reporting this morning, both from Punchbowl News and our colleagues here at CNN, Speaker McCarthy is planning to tell the conference later this week that he wants to move forward with an impeachment inquiry or plans to. Do you believe that there are the votes to move forward on impeachment inquiry if he decides to go that route? REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): More than likely, the inquiry, my understanding, gets us or help -- will assist us in getting Joe Biden's bank records. And there's no doubt, based on the evidence that I've seen, whether it's the SARS reports or evidence from the FBI, whistleblowers, et cetera, there is no way that any of this happens without Joe Biden. And so, if that is a tool in the toolbox that we can use to get more evidence for the American people, then I'm going to support it. The problem is, if you do the inquiry, how do you avoid doing an actual impeachment? And, you know, that puts a lot of seats up at risk, particularly for Republicans who won Biden districts. And, you know, that is the web that we will weave if we move forward on it.

How have our attention spans changed over the last several years? And it's pretty extraordinary. If you go back, I think, 2012 timeframe or so, it was a about two and a half minutes, sorry, 2003 timeframe, two and a half minutes was our average attention span, 2012, 75 seconds, and now 47 seconds.
