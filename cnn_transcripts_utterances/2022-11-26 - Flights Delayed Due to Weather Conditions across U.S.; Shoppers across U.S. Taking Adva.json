It just depends on where you are going to or coming from that could cause some travel problems. The main system right here across the center portion of the country, that's where we have the heavy rain and even the chance for severe thunderstorms. But that's going to be sliding its way into the northeast in the next 24 hours. Our secondary system in the western half of the country, that's goingto be sliding back into the center portion of the country. So for some areas you are going to get hit both days with some travel problems as we continue to go through the next 24 to 48 hours. Here's a look at the areas where we anticipate delays for today in terms of the air. Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta, Kansas City, even out into the west, places like Seattle as well as Salt Lake may also be looking at the potential for some delays today. The main focus if you are on the roadways is going to be down towards the Gulf Coast region. Houston finally starting to see a lot of the heaviest rain showers begin to wrap up. It's still raining in Dallas, same thing for Oklahoma City. We're starting to see that heavy line push in through Shreveport towards New Orleans and then again making its way up towards Little Rock. This is not a very fast-moving system. It also has a tremendous amount of moisture, which means the potential for flooding does exist from Houston all the way over through Pensacola and up into Little Rock. Similar geographical area also looking at the potential for some severe thunderstorms today as well. Here's a look at the system, through, as we go through the rest of the day. Notice by tonight and early Sunday now it's starting to spread into the Ohio valley portions of the Midwest, also the eastern portion of that southeast region. So cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, but also Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland also looking at some very heavy rain at times. By tomorrow, especially tomorrow morning in the afternoon, now you are starting to focus more that concern into the northeast. So, yes, unfortunately, that means New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., guys, all of those cities have the potential for some delays as well.",

That's an increase from the previous year when there was 158 million.

Today there is an estimate that at least 60 million people will go out there and shop. We spoke to one of those shoppers just few minutes ago who told me that this is a tradition for him.

This was supposed to be a cruisewith family for this young man and his sister to go on a cruise starting from New Orleans, and their first stop was Cozumel, Mexico. Sounds like a great way to spend Thanksgiving. The sister says the last time she saw her brother was about 11:00 or so on Wednesday night outside of a bar on the cruise ship, and she didn't think much of it until she didn't see him again, and then alerted that to the cruise ship authorities on Thanksgiving Day at around noon. So first things first, you've got to search that big old cruise ship. No sign of him. Then they contacted the Coast Guard. And the Coast Guard spent hours trying to find him. Helicopters, airplanes, by boat, all looking for this man. And then they spot him in the water, pulled him out by helicopter. He was still alive and able to tell them, yes, I'm the guy that was on that cruise ship you have been looking for. So happy you're here. Listen to the U.S. Coast Guard talk about that moment.

We saw that in Pennsylvania these accusations of not having true local ties to the state that you are running in in the case of Dr. Oz hurt his candidacy for Senate in Pennsylvania.

What are the stakes with these two Democrat and Republican running for this Senate seat right now?BARRON-LOPEZ: It's true that this won't determine Senate control. Democrats have already maintained control over the Senate. But what this does do is it influences how big that majority is. So if it is a 51-50 Senate, in favor of Democrats, then they have the majority on committee assignments. Then they are able to actually have subpoena power, which is something that Democrats haven't had in a 50-50 Senate. Now, of course, if Republicans are able to win this seat and maintain that 50-50 Senate, then it makes it harder for President Biden to potentially pass some must-pass bills. It also makes it so they don't have subpoena power or the ability to really have the majority on these very influential committee assignments.",

Of course, these students and this community is worried. They are scared. They are frustrated.

They say it takes time to review the blood, the footprints, the tire marks. All of that stuff is going to take some time. And police saying, look, when you look at the totality of all of this, you understand why this case is so complex and why it's taking so long. But what they are also saying they'd rather take their time and be right in order to do justice to these victims and the families. In terms of the timeline, things have stayed pretty much the same. We know that Kaylee and Maddy, they were out on Saturday night, went to a sports bar. Then they went to a food truck. They got home at around 1:45 or 2:00 in the morning, more or less. They got a ride home from someone that brought them home. And then the other two, Xana and Ethan, they were out at a party, also coming home around 1:45 in the morning. They are believed to have been killed early morning hours on Sunday, November 13th. And then we also know that they were likely killed during those early morning hours. Then what happens is that the 911 call, that comes in at around noon on Sunday. Police say there were multiple friends in the house when they called 911. They are ruling a lot of these people out, but they still say there is so much to be done here.",

This is the second time that Musk used a Twitter poll to make a major decision related to the platform. Remember earlier this month he restored former President Donald Trump's account, but he has faced sharp criticism for his actions.Online activists, safety and national security experts, and others argue that restoring the accounts could lead to online harassment and real-life danger. Joining us to discuss is Alejandra Caraballo. She's a clinical instructor at Harvard Law's Cyberlaw Clinic and an LGBTQ activist and researcher. Alejandra, thank you so much for taking time for us this weekend. Shortly after taking over Twitter, Elon Musk said that he would create a content moderation council and that no major content decisions like re-adding accounts that had been suspended would be made until it was in place. But as far as we know, there is no evidence that this council is in place, right? ALEJANDRA CARABALLO, CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR, HARVARD LAW'S CYBERLAW CLINIC: No, absolutely not. In fact, on Twitter he actually said that there was some kind of deal between him and civic society groups that he would use a moderation council to bring back accounts, but then he blamed civic society groups for allegedly going after his advertisers and advertising revenue. So, therefore, he blamed them and went ahead and brought back trump's account along with a plethora of other accounts. But there is no indication that there was actually any sort of deal. This is just him tweeting this out. The indications are that this is what he wanted to do all along, especially given the account that he brought back first, \"Babylon Bee.\" There was a report in \"The Washington Post\" that showed that was his first concern on the day he took over. Within hours of taking over Twitter he was asking about reinstating the \"Babylon Bee,\" which has been cited as one of the main reasons for buying Taylor.",

And there is no indication that any of these polls in any way scientific. They are entirely driven by bots and others of his followers that dropped without warning. And so essentially, this is just being driven by random posts that he is putting up with polls.And so the more dangerous aspect is that he said that he is going to bring back accounts that haven't engaged in any unlawful behavior or spam. Well, in the United States unlawful behavior basically means just about anything except for directly inciting violence or other kinds of potential speech that may break the law, which is usually a very, very small subset. So, for instance, any account that has posted an activist's address underneath them, others that have engaged in directed hate speech, calling for the death of a certain minority group, that is all legal speech. [10:45:05] And any account that had been previously suspended for stating those things could be immediately brought back. He is saying there is a manual review, but given how many accounts have likely been suspended over the years, it could take a team years to probably manually review every single account. And there is no disclosure on the mechanism and what review process other than what he stated on Twitter, and there is no nuance to it.",

So the team that was in place before, only about half of it is there.I wanted to ask about a recent Twitter exchange you had with Elon Musk concerning the danger posed by this general amnesty. He says that these suspended accounts are going to be slowly reinstated, that any incitement of violence will result in suspension. How confident are you in that process? And what do you make of the argument that not that many Americans, not that many people are on Twitter, so whatever happens there doesn't have that much effect in real life?

He stated, quote-unquote, that they were engaged in a grooming event. So, therefore, he is essentially justifying the murders of LGBTQ people at Club Q. That tweet is still up. And the next day Elon Musk joked around with him and responded to one of his tweets.So I have no confidence that the kinds of incitement of to violence is going to be taken serious, particularly against LGBTQ people. And if you have even what has been going on at LGBTQ events, at drag events throughout the summer and into fall, so much of this violence has been organized on Twitter. Libs of TikTok in particular created a mega drag thread back in June, and several of the events were disrupted by Proud Boys, actual neo-Nazis and other far-right Christian nationalists that were coming often, sometimes even armed to these events, particularly in Texas. And there have been a plethora of violent events. There was the donut shop in Oklahoma that was attacked for even hosting a drag event. So we're already seeing violence, and so much of it is being driven on Twitter. So there is no choice for LGBTQ folks to just log off and ignore it because what happens on Twitter inevitably has an impact on what happens in the real world.",
