That didn't materialize and it expended lots of arms, lots of weapons, lots of men, which Ukraine is now looking to try to replenish and, all at the same time, that allowed the Kremlin to continue its resupply. It allowed it to bolster its supply lines. And we've seen that on the ground recently with that taking control of Avdiivka. And it all comes at a time now as we look forward, one foot for the next year that Ukraine has replaced its popular IN (ph) general, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, with his second-in-command, Oleksandr Syrskyi.

For the first time ever, NVIDIA now considers Huawei as one of its top competitors according to its annual report. The controversial Chinese chip maker is now a major rival in four out of five of NVIDIA's main businesses, including the crucial production of AI processes. Now it's significant because Huawei spent the last four years facing tough U.S. restrictions, banning its access to technology. Despite that, last year, Huawei shocked the tech world by launching a new phone powered by advanced chips. It's all part of a wider battle between Washington and Beijing over semiconductor technology. Several countries, including the U.S. and Japan have imposed a series of measures to try and limit China's access to advanced computer chips and Beijing has been investing heavily to try and develop its own domestic chip industry. These rising tensions and restrictions have already hit NVIDIA sales in China and the company warned that things are unlikely to change anytime soon -- Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
