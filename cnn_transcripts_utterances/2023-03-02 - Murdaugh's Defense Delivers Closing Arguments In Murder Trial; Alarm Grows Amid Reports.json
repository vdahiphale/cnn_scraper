The defense is trying to raise a reasonable doubt about whether or not Murdaugh killed his wife and son. This morning's precede, however, started with drama involving a juror being removed. Dianne Gallagher live outside the courthouse in South Carolina. Talk about some last- minute drama, Dianne. Take us inside and tell us what happened.",

He had told everybody up until he got on the stand that he wasn't including investigators, family, and friends. But a video found on his son's Paul -- his son, Paul's phone outed him, essentially because his voice was identified by more than half a dozen of those witnesses. The defense though again, saying that just because you are a liar, just because you're a thief, that doesn't make you a murderer.Amara, you mentioned that juror being dismissed this morning. We only have one alternate -- (AUDIO GAP). The judge said that they had determined the juror had been speaking with other people about the case, not necessarily in-depth, but had potentially offered their opinion on evidence in the trial. She was dismissed this morning.",

He is a criminal defense attorney. I just want to get your take on that, first of all, Joey, regarding this juror who was removed this morning. I mean, now you have -- replacing this juror, an alternate sitting in. Does that -- how does that impact you know the case or does it help the prosecution versus the defense in any way this late in the game?",

      "sentences": "So, it doesn't, Amara. Good morning to you. What happens is is that you have a jury and panels of 12, of course, who will deliberate and have to be unanimous, but you always, in a jury trial, select alternate jurors. Why? For this very reason. You may have a juror excused as there was the case for misconduct or you may have people who are sick, have other obligations, the trial goes on so long.So, the reason you pick alternate jurors is to have that pool in place in the event, right? For example, you're missing other jurors. And so, to this point, it wouldn't affect that at all. You have 12 and additional one. The trial is closing up. Could something happen to another jury at some -- a juror excuse me, at some point in the future? Absolutely. How long will they deliberate? We don't know. But at this point, it would not affect them the whole basis and per purpose, Amara. To have alternates is to leave the integrity of the process in place, anticipating that something can happen to a jury. So, we're good as of now.",

      "sentences": "So, it could be significant, but we have to be clear on a couple of things, right? The first of which is that you do not reward, the prosecution certainly will argue, a person who may be cunning enough to get away with murder, not suggesting he's guilty, that'll be their job. But you don't reward a defendant because there's no one there to say he did it. And there are 10 eyewitnesses.And so oftentimes, in cases, you have circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is evidence. It's not direct. It's not someone saying I saw the person right in the white shirt. And I saw them in the khaki shorts at the time committed murder, but it's other evidence that points to a certain event. You heard the prosecutor speak to the issue of rain, right? And his closing argument saying and the event really, you come inside, and it wasn't wet, but you go out and there's rain all over the place. It's not raining but there's water, you could conclude it rain. And so, circumstantial evidence are circumstances that point to different pieces of a person who actually did it. And so, although the case is predicated, Amara, on circumstantial and not direct evidence, it could still be very powerful and compelling, depending upon what the jury ultimately concludes.",

And that's -- those are the numbers that the Iranian regime itself is giving. So, God knows how many are really out there.

KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're going to be up there for about six months. And they're really going to be conducting a lot of scientific experiments in microgravity. They also have to deal with keeping up the space station which is now about 20 years old, it has some wear and tear. So, they got to do some spacewalks to keep up with that maintenance. But what a gorgeous launch last night lifting off shortly after midnight, after the first launch attempt failed due to just some issues with essentially the lighter fluid, the ignition fluid to launch that Falcon 9 rocket into space. SpaceX fix that problem, and that's what brought us this picture-perfect launch last night. And those astronauts, two NASA astronauts, one Russian cosmonaut, and one astronaut from the United Arab Emirates should be arriving at the International Space Station around 1:00 a.m. this morning.
