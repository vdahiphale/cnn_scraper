It's partly because of a pandemic era policy that allows officials to turn the migrants away and that is set to end in just four days. CNN's Ed Lavandera has been getting a first-hand look at what some migrants are dealing with after crossing into the U.S. Ed, I can see it's still going on behind you, obviously.

So many people following his every move.But scientists saying that about a month ago, they started seeing changes in his behavior. He was going deeper and deeper into urban areas. They say he was getting closer to dogs and even dogs on leashes, and closer to people. So they thought that maybe he was in distress and it was better to capture him. And that's what they did. And he went through a medical evaluation. That medical evaluation, unfortunately, revealing that he had liver or kidney disease, that he had infections in his skin, that he was going through severe weight loss. They also say that they believe that he was hit by a car and found trauma in his eye, in his head, in his internal organs. And so taking all of that into consideration. That's when the experts decide that it was best to essentially put him down. These experts spoke earlier this week saying that his data will live on. Here is one of those experts that has been tracking him for years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SETH RILEY, CHIEF WILDLIFE ECOLOGIST, SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS NATIONAL REC. AREA: He's been an incredibly interesting animal. We've really gotten a lot of really great information from him. He's persisted in the smallest term range that has ever been recorded for an adult male mountain lion. And just an -- like I said, a really interesting animal.

The Canadians and U.K. were involved. But NASA and the French became obsessed with , how do we mention ocean rise, how do we measure river flow. And now this will be able to do everything. And that is helping if you're planning bridges for a new age of climate uncertainty. It helps with planning drinking water, crops. Let me show you this graphic. I don't know if you can put it up. This is from the U.S. Geological Survey. They took all the water on earth and put it into a sphere to compare it to the size of earth. And all that big ball is all the water on earth. The one that is over like, Ohio there, is all of the unfrozen fresh water on earth. And then the little, tiny one, that you can barely see, are all the lakes and rivers on earth. And we, eight billion people and our animals and crops are drinking from those. So it is super important to understand the state of things. Especially now.",

This is the bottom of the food chain plankton and all of the fish and everything we eat when it comes to marine life and the seafood industry. Now they're realizing these whales are also huge carbon sinks. They can absorb more carbon than any other living thing. When they die, they go down to the deep ocean where pressure locks that carbon away. So whales could be our biggest ally in terms pulling carbon out of the sky. If you put a price tag on it, one whale is worth about $2 billion to the planet for these services they provide. It would be interesting to see how much this affects places like Japan. Iceland finally banned whaling going forward. But there are calls now for a total moratorium to let these animals come back and help heal the planet.",

They have a big lifestyle, big bills to play. They also signed this Spotify deal, this Netflix deal. Harry has a memoir in a couple of weeks. People feel it's too much all at the same time.

I think it was $70 million. But, yes, he does have a really big price tag to meet. He had said, look, I need to make a couple billion dollars at the box office in order for me to break even because it costs hundreds of millions to make. It looks like that could happen. Because there are presale tickets. A lot of people are choosing to preorder their tickets, see this in IMax, Dolby, which a lot of people are seeing. There are only 150-something of those theaters in the United States. So this is going to be a slow trickle for \"Avatar.\" In fact, many people are saying, and experts in the industry, this is getting an \"A\" cinema score. That it's a really big deal. And this movie is going to meet the box office demands. And that it will hit the mark that is going to help James Cameron break even.
