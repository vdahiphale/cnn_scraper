      "sentences": "Then as for the state of mind defense that Trump legitimately thought that he won the election, I think there are two big problems with that. One is the factual problem that the indictment really lays out, which is everyone who's anyone told Donald Trump he lost. That includes the attorney general at the time, his top lawyer at the White House, the White House counsel, the national intelligence officials, the election security officials, all sorts of people. And indeed, Donald Trump himself, according to indictment, believes he lost that there's lots of indications with that, including telling Vice President Pence, the problem with you is you're too honest.The other is a practical problem. You know, as an attorney, if I wanted one of my -- to put on one of my clients to say I had a reasonable, good faith belief in something, I'd put them on the stand. But you can't if you're an attorney for Donald Trump. Risk putting Donald Trump on the stand, you'd have to worry he's going to perjure himself. And so there isn't a viable way, really, to put this defense, I think, forward. And that's why we see, Anderson, a pivot toward new arguments that Donald Trump is making today about venue, that this trial shouldn't take place in Washington, D.C. It should take place in West Virginia because people politically like him more in West Virginia. That is not a legal argument, that will go nowhere. Kind of version of that argument was tried in the George Floyd case in which I was special prosecutor, that you couldn't try it there because the community was biased against the officers, and the courts routinely rejected that, and they will reject it here every day of every week.",

And you can have more charges that is, more crimes. You can also have more people added to it. So, Jack Smith did both last week in Florida, signaling he's willing to do that.And I suspect here at least we're going to see, Anderson, some more defendants in the days to come. That is, this indictment was lean and mean, it just went after one person, Donald Trump. It was a pared down indictment. And I think that was done because Jack Smith wants the timing of this, as you were asking me earlier, to be soon for this trial. And when you have multiple defendants, as we saw in the George Floyd case, there's a risk it can slow things down. So Smith wants to move quickly in this one particular case. But those six people are named or identified in the indictment as committing very serious crimes. And I suspect that if they don't flip, which means to go and help Jack Smith build the case against the currently indicted person, Donald Trump, we will see indictments for those people as well. And then, if any of them do flip, that will provide new information, possibly for new charges against Donald Trump. And of course, Jack Smith may uncover more evidence of other crimes that Donald Trump has committed as he continues his investigation and prosecution.",

That is the highest standard in our law. It means it's more than 50 percent, it's very sky high, and he's got to do it for every one of the 12 jurors. If one of those jurors says, no, I don't believe Trump did it, Trump goes free. And yet, having read this indictment and having listened to Trump's lawyers for last several days, I've seen no real legal defense.

I was struck by something as we were sitting here and kind of watching the motorcade go, which is there were a lot of Metro Police out and there were, I even think, even some Capitol Police out kind of guarding that area, those are the people that fought to defend the Capitol on January 6. I mean, the Capitol Police were fighting hard, Metro PD came in at literally exactly the right time to be able to stop, you know, the further violence and to then watch them because they're so good and professional and do their jobs, but standing out there kind of making way and guarding the former president who launched that attack, it goes to show their professionalism but it's also the whole irony and the sadness of what's happened.",

Too honest. I saw on social media today that the vice president's campaign for presidents is using that in some campaign swag, too honest on a shirt, too honest on a mug.

The extent to which, again, he had been informed of his defeat or the failure of the legal efforts, I think there's campaign testimony to that effect, and they'd probably have better evidence of what the president's state of mind was of that.

JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD), RANKING MEMBER, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Well, it feels like a great vindication of the rule of law in American democracy for me. You know, for more than two years, people have been asking me, wherever I go, will there really be legal consequences? Is he going to be able to escape this like everything else? And it's good to know that, you know, the wheels of justice turn slowly, but they turn. And the Department of Justice, with the grand jury rendered an indictment. And, of course, Donald Trump is entitled to every presumption of innocence and all the due process of law that he has wanted to deny to other people who he considers his adversaries.

Now the Republican frontrunner in the 2024 race for the White House joining us now to react to all the news, former Congressman from Texas and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Will Hurd of Texas, a former CIA officer. Congressman Hurd, let's bring up the photo, the courtroom sketch of Donald Trump.I believe that is the moment that he pleaded not guilty to the four federal charges for which he has been indicted. As a Republican, as somebody who at both with the CIA and Congress, swore oaths to preserve the Constitution. As an American, what's your reaction when you look at that image? WILL HURD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact that a former president is in our nation's capitol in front of a judge, having to plead in a contest about trying to overturn an election is just outrageous. I'm like most Americans, I'm upset, I'm annoyed, I'm pissed. Earlier today I was talking with my friends at the BBC and they're saying, what's going on? The rest of the world is worried about what's happening in America. I also know our adversaries like China and Russia are laughing. But here's the great thing, Jake. We can do something about this. Here's the reality. I don't want the folks that are watching your show to be concerned or scared or upset about the fact that Donald Trump has a lead right now. These are polls that only sample about 800, 900 people. We have a chance to say enough is enough, and defeat him in an election. Only 23 percent of Americans vote in primaries. If I'm hoping some of that other 77 percent are watching your show. And if you're sick and tired of what's happening, if you're tired of Donald Trump, then guess what? We can do something about it. Vote in primaries. We only need 95,000 votes in New Hampshire to beat Donald Trump. You need a little bit more than that in South Carolina. Then you get to California and Texas and you can start putting things together. Let's not get afraid about this lead that he has right now. It's only a snapshot in time. And for those of us that are sick and tired and are frustrated and angry that Donald Trump is running for president in order to stay out of jail, let's do something about it. It's within our hands.
