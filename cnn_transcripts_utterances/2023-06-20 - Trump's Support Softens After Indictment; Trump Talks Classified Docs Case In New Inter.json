      "sentences": "Yes, Dana, we are seeing a bit of softening in Donald Trump's support among Republican and Republican leaning Independents in this 2024 nomination race, even though he is still clearly the big front runner for the nomination. Take a look at that horse race, if you will.Right now, you see that Donald Trump's at 47 percent support among Republican and Republican leaders. DeSantis at 26 percent. Everyone else single digits. But note here the change. So, back in May, Donald Trump was at 53 percent support. He's down six points. That's one note of caution. How about favorability about Donald Trump? Take a look here. Now he's down at 67 percent favorable among Republicans and Republican leaders. That's 10 points below the 77 percent he was at just in May. And those that say they will never consider Donald Trump for the Republican Party nomination are on the rise. You see now it's at 23 percent of Republicans, and Republican leaders won't even consider as an option. That was down at 16 percent in May. So those are all warning signs in the primary context for Donald Trump. Still, clearly a 21-point lead is a place you'd rather be than not. In terms of the general electorate and the overall broader American audience, there's big, broad sense of approval of the federal indictment. 61 percent of Americans overall in this poll approve of the federal indictment. In the documents case, you see overwhelmingly among Democrats. 67 percent of Independents approve of the indictment, about a quarter of Republicans. Now, Americans do broadly see politics playing a role in this. 71 percent say so in this federal indictment. Even a slim majority of Democrats say politics is playing a role at this. Clearly, Independents and Republicans believe that as well. A majority of Americans, Dana, 59 percent, nearly six in 10, say Donald Trump should end his campaign now, due to these federal charges in the documents case. 90 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of Independents think he should end the campaign now, only a quarter of Republicans. That all gets at the question inside the Republican Party whether or not Donald Trump is their best foot forward to beat Joe Biden in November of 2024. And what you see here is a split decision among Republicans. 51 percent of Republican and Republican leaders say their chances are best for victory, with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. 49 percent say their chances would be better with someone else, Dana.",

There's a lot of numbers there, and I think it would be good for our viewers and for all of us to kind of keep digesting.Let's just go to the first one, the horse race. There you go. You do see, I mean, 47 percent is a big percentage of support, particularly when you have all of those other contenders in the race. But you do see slippage there for Donald Trump. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: He definitely still has a grip on the party. But now I think about how DeSantis, in particular, has really tried in this campaign to differentiate between Trumpism, between the values or the policies of the previous administration, saying that he supports those, even galvanizing off those. But then differentiating that between the actual former president, saying, I can actually do Trumpism better than Trump in a way. And you wonder, when you look at these numbers, if they provide a glimpse that that narrative and that focus that he's had is starting to soften support among Trump supporters, who may say, look, yes, we did support the policies of the previous administration, and we support how Trump galvanized us. But now we have various multiple options of people that can do that. It's no longer solely Trump as an option for pushing forward that narrative, those culture wars, those policies that galvanized us in the first place.",
