Good evening.Today, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis held dueling campaign events in Iowa with the caucuses just six weeks away. The Florida governor is all in on the Hawkeye State wrapping up a campaign tour of all 99 counties in Iowa, but even high-powered endorsements from Iowa's governor has not had much impact on the poll numbers. DeSantis showing in the polls that he is back behind Donald Trump, whose lead appears to be only growing at this point. Meantime, the former president is pushing lies about the 2020 election saying he hopes judges will let him prosecute the results of that race. He is now accusing his chief political rival of \"waging an all- out war on American democracy\" handing out these signs. Look at this on screen right there -- these signs to his supporters saying \"Biden attacks democracy.\" He is also encouraging his supporters to enter ballot counting facilities in 2024 to \"guard\" the votes. We are live in Iowa with both campaigns. CNN's Steve Contorno is in Newton with the DeSantis campaign and CNN national correspondent, Kristen Holmes is in Cedar Rapids with Team Trump. Kristen, pretty astonishing to hear Trump's allegation that President Biden is waging a war on democracy as he is facing federal election interference charges. He was the one that tried to overturn the 2020 election, but we saw those campaign signs being handed out to supporters earlier today.",

So of course, the big question being what exactly is it that Joe Biden is doing that is against democracy, he talked about the First Amendment.He also talked about Joe Biden and his administration forcing people to buy cars, electric cars in particular, but the main crux of his argument, was about himself essentially saying that Joe Biden was turning his administration against Donald Trump using the Justice Department for election interference, saying that that's why it is that Donald Trump is facing so many charges, it is because Joe Biden and his administration have essentially done this on purpose so that Donald Trump would not be president. So not really surprising when we get back to the connecting of the dots there politically, since we know that really, his political campaign message, Donald Trump's and his legal message are the same, that this is a political interference, that this is all fake. This is all Democrats orchestrating this.

I expect it is going to be the centerpiece of his argument all year. Joe Biden and the Democrats are going to argue just the opposite, that it's Trump and his people that tried to overthrow a fair election in 2020. So you're going to have two campaigns effectively making the same argument and really they're not talking to each other as voters, they're talking to their own base and we will see.

That is irrelevant of the facts, they are irrelevant of what any of the three of us happen to believe about the 2020 election, or how Joe Biden has acted in office.The purpose of a political campaign is to try to feed and nurture a base of voters on a narrative that, you know, whether it's true or not. You know, whether it's based in reality or not. So I think as the campaign rolls on, you're going to continue to see both campaigns try to do that. Now, I may disagree with what Joe Biden does, and I happen to disagree a lot with what Donald Trump does as well, but that's what a campaign does. You build a narrative, you build sort of a framework for argument for office, and then you do everything you can do to drive that framework and drive your people inside of it and keep them there and that is what Donald Trump is doing right now.",

He attempted to overturn American democracy, he attempted to overturn an American election and his supporters are going to hold these signs up, they're going to eat this up, and yet they're not being told the reality of the situation.JONG-FAST: Well, I mean, Trump has this whole thing, right that he has sort of Earth 2. He has what he tells his people whether or not it's true. And I think that he has seen that Biden has done very well running on democracy, and so he has decided that this will work for him, too. A lot of this stuff is upside down stuff. I mean, according to what I know about the norms of democracy, but you know, he's going to try it. And look, Trump is trying a lot of stuff.

One other piece of that, though, is I think he senses in his base, and maybe even Republicans at large, even some that aren't for him right now, the idea that vindication might be at hand.They are looking at all of these national polls showing Donald Trump currently beating Joe Biden, and they are -- I think they sense that, look, Trump is our best bet to win the election. That's what they think Republicans are sensing now. And so feeding on this idea of getting vindication for what they think happened in 2020, for what they think happened in the impeachments, for the indictments, whatever you're mad about as it relates to Donald Trump vis-a-vis his problems, getting vindication for that, I think is sort of the core vibe they're going for. And so when you see a sign like that, you know, it's like, I'm going -- that is feeling that emotion, and so I suspect that's part of what's going on here.

I will just talk about simply, it's gotten more and more expensive. They told us it was going to get cheaper. You know, they told us it was going to be a panacea of solutions and there are no solutions here because it's gotten too expensive and it doesn't even feel like insurance at all for a lot of Americans. That's probably the correct policy framework.

And so this is very much still a very dynamic war that is unfolding. Now, earlier, we were in that part of Tel Aviv because thousands of people had gathered there in order to show support for the hostages, the 130 or so Israelis and others that are still inside the Gaza Strip, voicing their support for those hostages and calling on the government as well, to do more to prioritize their release. Everybody in Israel wants to see these hostages set free as soon as possible, but there is some division about the best way of achieving that. There are those that believe the hostage families, their supporters, they believe that, you know, the negotiations should continue and should be resumed because Israel has withdrawn its negotiators from the talks in Qatar. They should be resumed. And everything should be done to bring those hostages home as soon as possible.

And we actually had a camera that shows you what it looks like, this invisible gas. This is the Permian Basin in Texas a couple years ago. We went down there with these special cameras.The Environmental Defense Fund is a specialty of this sort of thing, spotting this and calling out super polluters. Enough of this stuff leaks every year to heat 2 million homes in Texas. And they've been promising to do this for a long time. President Biden, one of the very first acts is he - after he took the office was to tighten up methane rules, something that Obama tried to do but Trump rolled back. Now they're formalizing it with the help of 50 big oil majors, including ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco and many others saying they will agree. And for the first time ever, China is now saying they will address this in their country. It mostly comes from coal mines. And so there's fewer of them than the thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of orphaned wells, fracking wells around the United States right now.

You were talking about that Iowa polling that says, obviously, DeSantis has tied for second place with Nikki Haley, but let's take a look nationally, because I think this really tells the story.At the beginning of the year, if you look back to March, our CNN poll, it was a dead heat between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Ron DeSantis was a little bit ahead, but well within the margin of error. Take a look at where we are now. Donald Trump is over 40 points ahead of the governor of Florida. You know, Jim, I like to go through history. There's simply put no historical analogy that Ron DeSantis could look to at this point based upon the polling and say he's going to be the nominee. Every single person in Trump's position in the national polls has gone on to win, and at this particular point, I'm not really sure why I would disagree with history.",

South Carolina, the third state in the calendar, 2 percent; Nevada, 2 percent, the fourth state in the calendar. And nationally, he's at 2 percent. This is why he's in danger of not making the debate. It's because even though he's polling well in New Hampshire, everywhere else, he's a non-entity.

He said, one kid in this 26 is going to have a problem. But what happened was that no parent wanted to admit that his kid was the one in 26. By the time I got out here, a hundred percent of those kids were having problems. DR. SPENCER ETH, CHIEF OF MEDICAL HEALTH, MIAMI VA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM: Well, there was no diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder in 1976. It not only didn't exist for children. It didn't exist for adults either. There was no protocol. There was no way that we knew how to respond after this event at that time.
