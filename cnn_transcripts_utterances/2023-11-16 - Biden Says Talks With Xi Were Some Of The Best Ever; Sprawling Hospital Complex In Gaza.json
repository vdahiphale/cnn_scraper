Israel underpressure to prove the Al-Shifa hospital doubles as a Hamas hideout. A senior Israeli defense official says that proof is on the way. Also ahead, friend or foe. Biden says talks with Xi were some of the best ever, only to call him a dictator just hours later. And later, \"The Rock\" on the Hill. Mega star Dwayne Johnson meets with lawmakers days after talking about a possible presidential run. Will he or won't he? All right, coming to you live from New York, I am Zain Asher. Bianna is on assignment today. I want to get straight now to our top story. A sprawling hospital complex in Gaza has become a battleground for a second straight day as Israel continues its massive raid on the enclave's largest hospital. The IDF says that special forces are inside and are surrounding Al-Shifa Hospital conducting specific operations there. The director general of hospitals in Gaza alleges that the IDF has been interrogating medical teams, asking questions of patients, as well. On Wednesday, the IDF published a video of its operation presenting what it called evidence hidden behind an MRI machine, including AK-47s, body armor, grenades, as well. But so far -- so far, Israel has not presented evidence of any sort of network of tunnels or underground chambers that would indicate a possible Hamas command and control center. As Israel comes under a lot of pressure to provide proof of what it's long promised, the Israeli prime minister advisor says that that is just a matter of time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK REGEV, SR. ADVISER TO THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER:  I think you'll see more information in the coming hours and days. This was the first day of our operation inside the hospital building. More will come. I have no doubt about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just in terms of how Hamas has been sort of capitalizing on the last week or so, the IDF has saidrepeatedly, gearing up to this moment, that yes, they believe that this hospital underneath it is some kind of Hamas hideout. They first surrounded the hospital, and then they closed in. Obviously, if there is this sort of Command and Control Center underneath the hospital, obviously Hamas would be preparing for the Israelis to come in. How does that complicate things? The fact that the Israelis had to announce their plans ahead of time, obviously giving Hamas an opportunity to prepare for their entrance. Yeah, and that's the real point. In fact, you mentioned it up front. There have been leaflets that have been dropped and the Israelis are declaring what their intentions are next. I mean, they are not -- they are hiding in plain sight. They are saying, this is where we're going to go next. Because the balance that they are trying to achieve is, according to Palestinians, enough humanitarian support to create a corridor. You need to get out of here because we, the IDF, are coming in and we're going to capture or kill everybody who's associated with Hamas. In other words, it's a very brutal, ghastly fight that is ongoing right now, and they are declaring what they want to do. That hospital before the Israelis got there probably was engaged in a significant gunfight or Hamas understood that they were going to lose that fight. And they surrendered the hospital to the Israelis. And then they showed the type of damage that took place, which was a necessary condition in order for the Israelis to achieve that, to achieve the objective, which is to get into that hospital and now begin the hard work of demonstrating, rooting Hamas out and then demonstrating to the rest of the world. This is what Hamas does. It wraps itself in Palestinians. It holds Palestinians hostage so that they can accomplish their bad deeds.",

I mean, there are some real architectural challenges as well, right? You start eliminating some of these tunnels and you've eliminated the coherence and the consistency of the terrain above and buildings start to collapse. The Israelis have a pretty good sense of where these tunnels are and what portions of those tunnels are being used by Hamas in terms of command and control and storage facilities for weapon systems and ammunition and communications capabilities and additional weapon systems. And currently, where the hostages, there must be an assumption that the hostages are being held in those tunnels. That's what complicates this mission so much more -- is -- we're talking about the humanitarian challenge. We're talking about the hospitals. The discussion on hostages seems to have been pushed to the side a little bit, right? That's the key leverage that Hamas has right now and they want to hold on to those hostages and we have to assume that they're being moved about in that tunnel system. So, your question, spot on, can it be done 100 percent? I would say no. Can it be accomplished where it's rendered safe and they can invalidate some portions of it? Yes.",

Many of the Hamas militants who crossed the border had body cam cameras on them. [12: 15:00] And when they went back across into Gaza, Hamas used that as their own propaganda. But not everybody. We were provided video from one of the body cams that shows continuous 100 minutes from about 10 minutes before the attack all the way through until the GoPro starts rolling. And we have to warn you that some of this video is very graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  An explosion before dawn on October 7th. The time is here and the attack is underway. Allahu Akbar, God is great, they chant as they cross the breached fence. Go right, go right, go right, they say. Less than two minutes later, they cross the second security fence. They are in Israel heading towards Akibbutz. The sun is up and a day that will reshape the region has begun. This video comes from the body cam of one of the terrorists who took part in the attack. It was obtained exclusively by CNN from the Israel Defense Forces. For the first time, we also see video inside Hamas tunnels before the attack. It is a look into a network of tunnels with what appear to be supplies stored in the darkness. Writing on the walls in Arabic says what's hidden is far worse. Above ground, the gunman fires his first shots. Go on man, go on man, he screams. They stop on the way. More than a dozen militants gather here to prepare for the next assault. One has several rocket-propelled grenades on his back. Minutes later, a group advances across an open field, moving towards the village of Kisufim. The gunman charges the last bit and spots an Israeli soldier on the ground. Others join in celebration. Moments later, he is more composed as he turns the camera on himself. He says his name and that he's 24 years old. He's a father. He says he killed two Israeli soldiers. He asks God for victory and well-deserved martyrdom. On motorbikes now, they keep advancing, moving together along empty Israeli roads, or nearly empty. The man cheers as he sees bodies on the road. His is not the first wave. He rounds a corner. Here we have seen this place before among the first videos to come out after the attack. This is dash cam video from a car on the same road moments earlier. The car approaches a group of militants who opened fire. The car coasts, its driver almost certainly dead by now. It is just after 7:40 in the morning. After a quick reload, the group approaches a military base near the kibbutz of Reim. For 65 minutes since crossing the Gaza fence, they have had nearly free reign in Israel. The gunman closes the distance with a weapon he took from an Israeli soldier, opening fire and fire comes back. This man's part of the attack comes to an end. The terror is just beginning. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on-camera):  One thing that becomes clear in this video is how freely and how easily this group was able to move. At one point in the video, which we had to watch many times as we put this together, they even ask, where are the soldiers? Apparently surprised that they didn't encounter more resistance as they crossed the second border fence. And that will be part of the investigation. Everyone we've spoken to here, from Israeli officials to the IDF, to even civilians here just hanging out, know that there is an in-depth investigation coming to figure out what went wrong and how it went wrong so catastrophically. And Zain, it is very evident in that video.",

And it's extremely, you know, this is not how you -- this is not how we can create an environment for peace. I believe that it's extremely important that the world comes together to stop this madness. And I don't think that, you know, that we can ensure Israel security by, you know, by killing Palestinians, by committing massacres. I believe, I wholeheartedly believe, that's why I joined the diplomatic corps actually, because I felt that only through diplomatic mechanisms, through dialogue and engagement, that we can resolve conflicts.

A lot of people question whether that's even possible, because Hamas isn't just a terrorist organization, it's also an ideology, as well. They said its goal is to root out Hamas. Of course, though, at the end of this war, there will likely be remnants of Hamas within Gaza. Just talk us through what happens next. Some people have floated the idea of the Palestinian Authority taking over. Netanyahu has questioned whether the P.A. is up for the job. The U.S. seems to believe that it certainly is.

But as Fred Pleitgen reports, a former Russian detective who helped orchestrate the killing has received a pardon after fighting in Ukraine. And he's not the only one. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDEN (voice-over):  As Russia loses large amounts of soldiers on the front lines in Ukraine, the Kremlin continues filling the ranks with convicts, pardoning and releasing even the most dangerous ones if they survive their tour of combat. Sergey Khadji Kurbanov was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2014 for organizing the high-profile killing of prominent journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya who was gunned down in her apartment block in 2006. Now, Khadji Kurbanov has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, his lawyer says. Politskovkaya's family and the paper she worked for \"Novaya Gazeta\", irate. It is a monstrous fact of injustice and arbitrariness, an insult to the memory of a person killed for their beliefs and for carrying out their professional duty,\" they wrote in a statement. There are others. Vladislav Kanyus was sentenced to 17 years in jail for brutally murdering his girlfriend and ordered to pay compensation to the victim's family, Russian media reports. He was also pardoned after fighting in Ukraine and doesn't even have to pay the compensation, the Kremlin defending the decision. There is a certain practice that is being implemented, Putin spokesman says. To my knowledge, there are no exceptions to this practice. More precisely, there are exceptions, but they do not relate to the topic of the resonance of this or that case. The Wagner private military company first started using convicts on the battlefields in Ukraine last year. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin traveling to Russian jails to recruit inmates. I spend more ammunition than was ever spent in Stalingrad, he said at the time. First sin is deserting. No one leave the front. No one surrenders. Even after Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash in August, Russia continues large-scale recruitment of prison inmates. Russian leader Vladimir Putin even included some in a moment of silence for fallen soldiers. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We are all people. Everyone can make some mistakes. They once made them. But they gave their lives for their motherland and atoned for their guilt in full.
