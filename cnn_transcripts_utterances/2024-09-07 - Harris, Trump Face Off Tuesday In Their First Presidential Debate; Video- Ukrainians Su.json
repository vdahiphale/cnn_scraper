Since Thursday, Harris has been preparing with a small team of advisers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or she has been taking part in mock debates and combing through possible attacks from Trump. She has also been taking breaks. Today, she made a surprise appearance at a spice shop in Pittsburgh, which turned into an emotional moment with voters.

Now, in 2020, when he debated Biden, the first time around, not good. The second time around, he actually was very well-prepared and he was able to sort of be very specific in back-and-forth with Bidens, so I know he can do it, but that's it.

They believe what her initial instincts were when she got into politics. I mean, she is a California Democrat whose instincts were to side with Bernie Sanders on virtually every issue of the day and then run for president on that platform. And so that's what people -- that's what Republicans believe she is, and they think there are real consequences about the future of the country under a president who would go so far left particular really if Democrats got or retained control of the United States Senate and eliminated the filibuster. This country, our government could take a sharp left turn in a hurry. And so Vice President Cheney, who I revere, I worked to elect this man, vice president twice.

Temperatures up near 104 degrees for parts of California. Downtown L.A. hit 112, breaking a record from 2020. The airport hit 102 and we even had temperatures as hot as 98 degrees as far north as Washington and Oregon.

Phoenix continues their stretch up near 110, Vegas near 105 through the next couple of days, and even Los Angeles near triple-digit heat through Sunday and through Monday as this really continues. So Los Angeles hit 112 for the first - I'm sorry, for the third time on record since 1877, so just incredible how rare heat like this is. They were one degree shy of their all-time record of 113 degrees that was set back in September of 2010. Again, forecast to be at that century mark through Monday, and average for this time of year in L.A. is 84 degrees. So Southern California gets hot, but not this hot this late in the season. Phoenix has been plowing through their records so far at 103 consecutive days at a hundred degrees or hotter, which shatters the previous stretch of 76 days that was set back in 1993. So again, you're just looking at the heat getting more extreme and lasting so much longer. So when you look at the climate shift index from Climate Central, that tool that tells us what that climate change fingerprint is, you can see all of the dark shading here telling us that, especially here in Southern California, climate change made these temperatures four to five times more likely. Again, that heat just getting more extreme, lasting later into the season, a little bit of relief coming for these people out west as we go into the work week, Jessica?",

And Sabalenka, with the win, that now means she swept the hard sport majors this season. She won the Australian Open back in January. She also won that last year, and she nearly went back-to-back in both of those majors. But in last year's U.S. Open final, Sabalenka, she lost to Coco Gauff. And in that one, she said that the New York crowd really affected her with everyone cheering for Coco. She vowed not to let that happen again this year, and she certainly didn't. She handled her best game when she needed it the most. She said afterwards, she'd always dreamed about winning the U.S. Open, and now she has it. And Jessica, she also thanked the New York crowd because she said she did hear those cheers when she did something well, and she fully understood why they were cheering for Pegula here today, because she's the American. She said it would not have been normal for them to be in her corner.",

I loved that Jess Pegula, whose parents own the Buffalo Bills and here we are at the NFL opening weekend, she came from behind and was able to not only recover from a set and three-love down and then take a 5-3 lead in the second. I thought the shot-making was terrific. The strategies were tough.But Sabalenka's the most powerful player in the world in the women's game. She's won, prior to today, two other hard-court majors. She's been the number one in the world. I think last year she felt when she really was the better player at the start of the match against Coco Gauff but let the crowd, kind of, disrupt her. She really showed the maturity and that she was ready to win the U.S. Open. I thought it was a great championship on the women's side.",

But let me tell you, I've also seen players from Australia where they have majors in England and France that they couldn't produce under the pressure of trying to win the home major. I thought Jess Pegula and also I've got to give credit to Emma Navarro who made it to the final four, you know, we have four Americans through taking up half of the spots of the semi-finalists. It was the best result on the men's and women's side since 2002 at the U.S. Open, so a lot of bright future ahead for U.S. tennis, especially on the men's side.As Andy mentioned, it's been a while since Andy Roddick won a major for the U.S. in '03, but it's - really looking promising. And I can't wait to see how Taylor Fritz brings it tomorrow because he's won a big, hard-court tournament in Indian Wells a few years ago which is in Southern California where he resides and I like the way Taylor Fritz is going about his business this tournament.",

I thought Sinner in the semifinals against Jack Draper didn't play his best tennis.We know Sinner came into the U.S. Open with one of the biggest controversies when he had tested positive back in the spring to a banned substance and was able to explain it to the right entities in the doping world so that he's been allowed to play. So he kind of started the tournament in a very disruptive way but he's shown why he's number one. But I still think Taylor Fritz - he's going to invite the crowd in tomorrow and Taylor Fritz, just like Pegula, starts underdog as Andy just mentioned, but I think Taylor Fritz has an even better chance than Pegula did today to cause the upset tomorrow.",
