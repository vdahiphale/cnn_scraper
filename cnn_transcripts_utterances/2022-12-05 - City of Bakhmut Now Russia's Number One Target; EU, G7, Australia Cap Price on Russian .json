Which the Ukrainian military says is Russia's target number one as they try desperately to show some sort of success on the battlefield that has eluded them after a series of humiliating defeats by the Ukrainians. Who have just been more effective in pretty much every category with the exception, of course, of bombardment. Because Russia has a huge arsenal and there is growing concern here that Russia will use that arsenal of rockets and missiles to launch a major attack on the power grid in the coming days. Power has been restored back up to 75 percent in liberated Kherson in southern Ukraine. But they also have been the targets on Sunday of bombardments, not necessarily missiles per se but artillery and rockets have been raining down. They have hit private apartment buildings, civilian homes and one civilian has been killed at least two others injured. And this is in addition to the huge mess that the Russians left behind there when you're talking about mines and trip wires and other dangerous objects. More than 4,200 explosive devices have been collected by the Ukrainians and seized. They managed to destroy just over 1,200 of them so far. So clearly, a very difficult and precarious situation for people both in south of Ukraine and also in the east as Russia continues its unprovoked assault on Ukraine. Will Ripley, CNN, Kyiv.

That will lead demand to spike at the same time the supply comes down if Russia does this. Best case scenario for this though is that it simply leads to a continuation of what we've seen which is a reshuffling of oil supply. So, if today China and India start buying more oil from Russia and Europe buys more from the Middle East and other areas and prices could in that scenario more or less stabilize.
