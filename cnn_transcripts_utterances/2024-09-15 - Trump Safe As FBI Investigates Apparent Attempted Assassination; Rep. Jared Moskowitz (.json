      "sentences": "We have some new information about the man detained tonight after an attempted assassination of foreign President Donald Trump. The 58-year-old man has used social media to criticize the former president. According to authorities, the former president was in the middle of a round of golf today. Secret Service agent was walking ahead of the President and his party to secure the area. That's when the agent saw the barrel of a rifle poking out of the fence.We don't know at this moment whether shots were fired by the man with the rifle, the man they've now detained. But the Secret Service says that an agent did fire shots toward that person. The man ran away. Authorities were able to capture him thanks to the help of an eyewitness who identified the man, took a photograph of his vehicle. They've now detained that person. Authorities also released these photos. They say that in the bushes where the man was seen, they found an AK-47 style rifle, scope, two backpacks, ceramic tiles and a GoPro camera. Ceramic tiles were in those backpacks you see hanging up as a kind of fence to protect the -- the alleged shooter. Authorities also addressed how someone with a rifle and scope would be able to get near the former president, again, just two months after that previous assassination attempt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY B. VELTRI, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, MIAMI FIELD OFFICE: Notice that the rifle was pointed out. Our agents engaged. We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot at our agents. But for sure, our agents were able to -- to engage with the suspect.",

You know right now the -- the language that -- that the -- that the authorities are using, they're not directly accusing him of attempting to carry out this assassination. But it is clear he is the one only person who was -- who has been detained.And we've learned a lot more just in the last few hours looking at some of his social media accounting -- so -- social media accounts. We know the FBI is combing through these accounts to try to get a -- a little bit be -- better picture of a po -- possible motivation. But a lot of it appears to emerge from those social media posts. He's a -- a staunch and -- and frequent critic of Donald Trump on those social media accounts. And he also is in support of Kamala Harris and -- and Joe Biden. I'll read you just a part of one of the -- one of the references he makes to the Butler assassination attempt on -- on Donald Trump back in July. He refers to that and he says to Kamala Harris, he says, you and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally, attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them. Now, he also refers to the -- the former president's MAGA movement. He refers to it as Make America -- MASA, he says Make Americans Slaves Again, and says democracy is on the line we cannot lose. He's also a frequent poster on Ukraine and encouraging people to go fight in Ukraine, Anderson. We know from his background, he ran a -- an affordable housing company back in Hawaii. But more recently, he appears to have been living in -- in North Carolina, where he voted in the Democratic primary, according to the state records. We also, Anderson, heard tonight, our investigative team reached out to his son and managed to reach him. I'll read you just a part of a text that -- that we got from him. His name is Oren, and he says that his father was a loving and caring father, an honest, hardworking man. And he also said that, you know, he hopes that these things have just been blown out of proportion, because if the -- if the little I've heard, it doesn't sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent. Now the -- the FBI is -- is investigating this as an attempted assassination, Anderson. We anticipate that federal charges are imminent, perhaps in the next day or so. Anderson?",

Of course, they wanted to make sure it was safe and secure before they moved him beyond the gates here. We actually arrived here at Trump International just as the motorcade was leaving here. They took him back to Mar-a-Lago, which is about 15 minutes from here in West Palm Beach.We have not seen the former president since then, but he did send out a couple of fundraising e-mails, writing, I am safe and well, my resolve is stronger. So again, we haven't seen him. We haven't heard from him beyond those fundraising e-mails, but I can tell you that House Speaker Mike Johnson did visit with him at Mar-a-Lago this afternoon, for several hours, he posted a photo with him, saying that he had been there visiting him.

We're here on Summit Boulevard, which still remains closed tonight, and the club entrance is right behind me. There's a guard shack that you would have to go through to enter.But the fifth and sixth hole, where we have been focusing on today, where this incident apparently took place, that is on the corner of Summit Boulevard, where we are in Congress Avenue. So it's just right down the road here from -- from us, where this apparently happened, and there are bushes there. It's unclear if that's exactly where the fence is, but that was roped off earlier, so perhaps someone could get through the fences, right off, through the bushes, right off one of these main drags, and then they would come upon a -- a fence that would be protecting the golf course. But it is -- there's no big wall that is -- that is surrounding this -- this Trump International Golf Club or anything like that. So somebody could certainly poke their way through those bushes.

They -- they'll know how -- when did he obtain this -- this firearm? Perhaps give them a -- a se -- a sense of how long he's been planning this. Clearly, he was aware and -- and -- and noticed what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania just a few weeks ago, because he posted on social media about it. So now the question is, you know, how long has he been planning to target the former president, at least, you know, again, looking at what happened today, there has to have been some kind of planning. One -- one of the things that certainly has been raised and I've seen Kristen Holmes reporting this, Anderson. The former president wasn't supposed to be golfing today. And so the big question is, then, how did this person know to be at this spe -- specific lo -- location. How long has they been there? How long have they been pursuing this goal, all of those things, of course, the FBI is going to try to answer in the coming days.",

He's not President Bush or Clinton, right? His threat environment is drastically different, both from domestic actors and the -- the overarching threat from -- from Iran. So that is something that is unprecedented, with a former president and the, you know, the -- the current Republican nominee for the office of the presidency. So we have to eliminate these labels and really focus on applying every appropriate measure to protect the individual based upon the threats that they're facing.And, you know, we're now know, because of today's actions, that these threats are just compounding for the former president. And they have to -- the Secret Service has to be aware of that, and they have to act quickly, because while nothing happened today, we still have to protect, you know, 360 days a year, 24 hours a day, and this dynamic threat environment is changing rapidly, and the Secret Service needs to stay one step ahead, not behind in, you know, their protective responsibilities.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:21:17] COOPER: More on now, breaking news, the second attempt at assassination of the former president, this time at his golf club in western Palm Beach, Florida. Early this afternoon, authorities detaining a man shortly after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of the fence surrounding the course, the agent fired at the man. They eventually detained this person. The man's son had said in a statement that it's not like his father, quote, to do anything crazy, much less violent, though he does have a history with law enforcement. Our Kyung Lah just reported that father had brushes with the law, including once barricading himself with a firearm inside a business and a standoff with police. I'm joined now by Florida Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz. He's also a member of a bipartisan task force formed by Congress in the wake of that first attempt at assassination. Congressman, first of all, your reaction to this second apparent attempt -- assassination attempt on the former president just two months. REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Thanks, Anderson. Thanks for having me. Well, I never thought in my first two years in Congress that I would be appointed to an assassination task force based on an attempted assassination on a former president. Let -- let little did I think that while on that task force, just two months from the first assassination attempt, only a month into the task force, there would be a second attempt. And so I'm deeply concerned about what's going on right now. I'm deeply concerned, quite frankly, for the former president's safety. You know, the Secret Service has a lot to explain how an individual was able to get again this close to -- to the former president.",

And we still don't know the motive of the individual in the -- in the first assassination attempt.And so look, I'm asking for the FBI Secret Service, Homeland Security to come out and start sharing some of the information with the American people. You know this, Anderson, you see it on -- on social media. On the left people think, you know, it was staged. On the right people think it was the deep state. And that's because we're not sharing information with the American people. This is something we have to do. I mean, I -- I have a lot of questions on how this individual got his firearm. In Florida, we have red flag laws here, very tough red flag laws that actually were passed in the wake of the Parkland shooting six years ago. I'm about a mile from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School right now, where I graduated from. And based on his previous history, he should not have been able to attain -- obtain a firearm in the state of Florida if he did get it here. And that's not clear. He may have brought it into the state. And so there are a lot of questions here, but I think the American people should be deeply concerned on why a second individual clearly disturbed, was able to get this close to the former president with a weapon.",

That's really what the task force is trying to do on a bipartisan basis. We're trying to restore faith in our institutions by getting to the bottom of what happened and sharing that information. I saw Governor DeSantis announced earlier today that he is going to have the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, I believe, conduct their own investigation. But that, you know, that's only warranted because, quite frankly, our national investing, you know, the FBI and -- and the Secret Service aren't sharing the information that the American people are craving on the first assassination attempt, let alone seeing a second one. We -- we have seen mass shootings in this country become normalized, and it's unacceptable.

And in, you know, in terrorism and counterterrorism, we teach about these cycles of radicalization. We teach about this mobilization of violence, and it often begins with a violent ideation and then moves into a stage that we call pre operational surveillance. And so just happening to be at the right time in the right place, this individual may have been filmed, or someone may have known that he was going there. I don't know how he knows that the President was going to be golfing that day, but that's certain -- certainly something they're looking at to see if they can link him to other individual or individuals that may have had information that assisted him.",

And so while the U.S. government has declared that the election process is critical infrastructure and is key to the ongoing success of our democracy, the individuals that are key to that process, the current vice president and the former president, President Trump, need to be protected as much as possible to ensure that the election goes smoothly and that there's a smooth transition of power to either one of those individuals.",

I mean, as somebody who was in Ukraine for a couple of weeks that started the war in Lviv, you would see a whole bunch of folks coming there from the U.S., some of them, you know, had legit military training in the U.S., and were there believing in the cause and wanting to -- to help and volunteer where they could or train others. And then you'd also see just some folks kind of washed ashore there with, you know, running from something or just seeing this as some kind of opportunity to jump start their -- their life.
