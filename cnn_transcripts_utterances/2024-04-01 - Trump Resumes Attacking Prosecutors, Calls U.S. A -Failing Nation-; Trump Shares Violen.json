      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with new questions about Donald Trump's extreme rhetoric. Perhaps the biggest question of them all, will Trump face any accountability? And will Republican leaders call him out after the former President shared a video on social media that could pose a security risk for President Biden? Here's that horrific video posted by Trump showing the President hog-tied in the back of a pickup truck. Over the weekend, Biden and Trump offered distinctly different Easter messages. President calling for peace, security and dignity for people around the world. As for Trump, he wished a Happy Easter to those. He quote, totally despises, and he quote, failing nation, end quote, that he hopes to lead. He reshared articles suggesting he's a modern-day Jesus who was being crucified and he accused the President of a quote, years long assault on the Christian faith. The President of course is a devout Catholic. This week he's pledging to address a quote, Biden's border bloodbath, putting a lot of these in quotes, just to make sure you understand this is Trump's rhetoric. This just 11 days after insisting that that rhetoric was exclusively about the economic consequences of a Biden victory. Here with me to discuss Trump's increasingly inflammatory and violent rhetoric is Ruth Ben-Ghiat. She's a professor of history at NYU. She's also the author of multiple books, including Strong Men, Mussolini to the President. And Ruth, great to have you on as always. You know, when we talk about Trump's sharing this violent video of the President, President Biden hog-tied in the bed of a pickup truck? You know, we saw the consequences of his words on January 6th. How concerned are you about this kind of stuff, sparking some kind of violence? What do you think? RUTH BEN-GHIAT, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, NYU: I'm very concerned. And it's, you know, when you work on coups and authoritarian takeovers, you look at this a bit differently. It's not just a joke. The fact it's a lifestyle image. It's really performing, you know, a work of imagination for Americans, because a sitting president of the United States who's hog-tied as though he's some kind of hostage, this implies, shall we say, not a Democratic transition of power. But something a bad end that is happening to the sitting President United States. And when it's shared on social media by somebody who already tried to overthrow the government, then of course, that is -- that is extremely serious. And -- and -- and be speaks very, you know, an intent to continue to incite violence against anyone who's trying to hold him accountable. But now also, the President of the United States.",

But now, it just seems that this kind of violent imagery, this kind of dangerous political rhetoric has become so commonplace, it makes you wonder what the authorities do with this kind of stuff.BEN-GHIAT: I -- I -- I share those concerns.

Now he's using the term to talk about the southern border. What was your reaction to that when he brought up this quote, unquote, border bloodbath, there's that term, again, bloodbath?BEN-GHIAT: Because with -- with propaganda, it's not just about getting somebody to believe a lie, a specific lie, like who won the 2020 election. It's really about creating associations and inciting emotions in people. So, Trump knows very well, he's very skilled at this, that when he talks about the bloodbath that will overcome the whole country, he wasn't only talking about the auto industry, it's not only about the border, it's about instilling a kind of existential fear in people. And that's how you have -- you get them to either commit violence on your behalf, which happened on January 6th, when he said, if you don't fight like hell, you won't have a country anymore. So, or they'll look away when violence is committed by others. And so, Trump is slowly and relentlessly kind of shaping an emotional climate, a psychological climate that is needed for autocracy.",

What does this mean for the judicial system? When this repeatedly happens, and there aren't any consequences for Trump? He's been admonished, you know, by judges not to cross the line rhetorically in certain ways. There have been limited gag orders put in place here and there. Nothing really does the trick.BEN-GHIAT: Yes, and this is a huge mistake, because this is exactly what authoritarians do. They go after prosecutors, lawyers, judges, anybody who can try and hold them accountable, and they go after their families. This is one of the regular things been happening since Mussolini. Even if people go into exile if regime takes hold, they go after your family who might be left in the country. So, what Trump did here was called the Judge's daughter, a Rabid Trump Hater, though that's a phrase which he knows is going to anger his opponents who are very loyal to him, and fess (ph) he's doing things deliberately to create a climate of hostility that could result in physical violence.

What's left of that Jim, are these tents. Now, what the protesters say is that they're going to stay here for till Wednesday, their plan to continue putting pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu.
