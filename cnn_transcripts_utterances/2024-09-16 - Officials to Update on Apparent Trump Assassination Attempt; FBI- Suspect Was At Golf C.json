And during this appearance, he was shackled. Both his hands and his legs. Remember here, there are no cameras inside federal court, so we are relying on the reporting from our colleagues and Richard, they tell us, he was wearing dark prison scrubs and he only spoke a little during this hearing saying, \"yes, judge,\" nodding his head a few times as he was asked a series of questions. And it was during this hearing that he first learned the charges that he is facing. He faces two counts, including possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and receipt of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Now, this investigation is still in its early stages. We are still gathering information and we fully expect based on what else they uncover that they will add additional charges against Mr. Routh. Now, there are questions about what those charges will be. Now, his next hearing is currently scheduled for September 23rd. That is what is called a detention hearing and there, prosecutors are expected to argue why they believe he should continue to be detained ahead of a possible trial. They will argue that not only is he a threat to society, they will also argue that he is flight risk.",

When we work with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, like, for example, yesterday, during that emergency action response, we had their local tactical team assets partner with our local tactic tactical team assets. We had their helicopter up in the air providing us 360 and situational awareness of the overhead for any, if there were, any potential threats coming to add us. So, what we did yesterday was exercise our emergency plan based on the number of tactical assets and the highest level of protection that we are providing. The sheriff and I have talked. Now clearly, when you go down southern Boulevard right now and you try to get over to Palm Beach, and you see the robust presence that's existing outside of Mar-a-Lago, the heavy uniform presence, the additional assets of the Secret Service. And for those of you that were here in 20 -- in 2017 when the President was in office, when you look at that footprint now, and you look at it today, I -- there's not much difference there. There is heavy uniform presence out there. And again, what I go back to is yesterday was an off-the-record movement. Off the record, and the President wasn't even really supposed to go there. It was not on his official schedule. And so, we put together a security plan, and that security plan worked. (CROSSTALK)",

And we have with us our senior Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey and Josh Campbell who is in Los Angeles. Now, an enormous amount of information in some shape or form. So, I'm just going to pass it out bit by bit. Essentially, the facts are as we know them, he was there at the tree line, several 100 yards away. Donald Trump is on the fifth fairway. This guy, Routh, is on the sixth green. Secret Service agents and the advance sector at the front line sees the -- sees the rifle, fires off a shot. Routh escapes witness. Pick gets the number and the rest of this (INAUDIBLE) in custody charge now with two holding charges. In addition to this, what was interesting is the way in which the Acting Director of the FBI framed the whole action. He talked about it as textbook, exemplary, hyper vigilance, hyper dynamic. He said that as a result of the Butler assassination attempt on Donald Trump back in July that President Biden had ordered the highest level of security for Donald Trump, that meant more counter snipers, counter surveillance, counter assault and counter drone activity or unmanned vehicle. Put that into place, he says, that was in place yesterday, which is why he describes Butler as having created a paradigm shift in the way the Secret Service adopts the highest level.

I would imagine he plays golf there quite a bit, so they probably have a security package that they've used in the past. They had no reason to believe that there was going to be an incident yesterday. But there are a lot of vulnerabilities on that particular course because of his proximity, in a couple places to that roadway. So, the question still remains, he's in the area for at least 12 hours. We don't know if he was actually in the bushes for that time. Was he somewhere nearby? He had that GoPro camera that they recovered. Did he have that someplace where he was able to remotely watch what was going on on the golf course? We don't know the answer to that. FBI may know, but we don't know at this point in time.

You know, the more you go without some type of serious incident, do you start to, you know, lose some of your, you know, being on you're a-game all the time? And so that was certainly a wakeup call. But your point here, Richard, you know, which is so interesting, you know, I've been talking with law enforcement sources over -- throughout the night and what they describe is that they're -- as good as they are as that first agent to actually spot the barrel of that weapon, this comes down to a little bit of luck as well. You can imagine that if that shooter had not presented the muzzle of that firearm outside of that fence, and then he was never seen by this advance agent from the Secret Service.

And so, as we talk about security and perimeters and all of that, there's also this larger debate that continues in this country about what to do with these high- power assault style rifles.",

You know, the reality is politics kind of like Hollywood, kind of pulls out the craziest in people and sometimes the most mentally unstable people. That's what you have here. The idea of saying that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy is like somehow a dog whistle for come and try to do violence is insane. And let's make it clear, as everybody should know, that's done politics for any amount of time. Political discourse is just that. It's political discourse. In politics, by the way, was invented to prevent violence. It's the whole reason we have politics.",

And now everything is so existential, an existential crisis. Yes, when you enter, you know, former American presidents or even candidates for president would never say things like hate, unless it's, I hate poverty or I hate inequality, or, you know, they wouldn't even say they hated the Soviet Union when we were fighting, you know, had a Cold War and Soviet Union.
