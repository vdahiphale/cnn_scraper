This press conference by the family, also, the lawyer you heard, saying that there must now be answers and action about allowing people to buy those guns. This was one of the deadliest school and campus shootings ever. And this press conference came after the Department of Justice press conference in which the attorney general said that this massacre at Uvalde could have been stopped sooner. He described critical failures in leadership because it took 77 minutes for the killer to be stopped. And you heard the lawyer saying why, because the police were afraid of that destructive gun. And therefore, everyone should be and therefore those guns should not be allowed to be bought. AMANPOUR is up next. Hello, everyone, and welcome to AMANPOUR. Here's what's coming up.

I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Pentagon insists that conflict between Israel and Hamas has not technically spread into a wider war yet. But experts warn just one miscalculation could change that as missiles fly around the region between hostile states at an alarming pace. The United States has today carried out further airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen. Israel, meanwhile, warning that the likelihood of war on its northern front with Lebanon is \"much higher\" than in recent times. That's the backdrop for a different escalation of hostilities, this time between Pakistan and Iran. Tit for tat airstrikes that both nations claim are aimed at terror bases.

Sheer panic. The first two months of war decimated Gaza's healthcare system as Israel launched an air, then land offensive on the north of the Strip. Out of 22 hospitals in Northern Gaza, CNN has identified 20 that have been damaged or destroyed between October 7th and December 7th. Imagery analyzed by CNN shows over half have been directly attacked. Several, including the two largest in Gaza, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, were directly attacked by the Israel Defense Forces, this evidence suggests.

We achieved an amazing success in November where we got almost half thehostages out. 110 people released precisely because of the military pressure Israel was applying. That was the only reason that -- Hamas didn't release the hostages because they suddenly became nice people. No, they were responding -- as President Joe Biden said, they respond to pressure. And Israel was applying the pressure through our military might. Now, if we would have accepted the advice of people in the International Community at the beginning of November to go for some sort of humanitarian pause that was talked about, you'll recall, we would never have got a single one of those people out. And they were women and children, as you will recall. Some very young children, all held by Hamas. They were released. So, that's one of the major successes so far of our operation. But as we go forward, we've managed to destroy in Northern Gaza Hamas' ability to work in an organized military framework. Their battalion and brigades, we've managed to destroy them. They still have, of course, the ability to cause us harm, but to operate as an organized fighting force, they cannot longer. And we'll get there in the south too, in the center of the country and in the south of the Gaza Strip as well. We have to win this war and we will destroy the Hamas military machine. We'll do it, Christiane, because we have no choice. We refuse to live any longer next to this terror enclave. And the Israeli parents have to (INAUDIBLE) in the middle of the night terrorists will cross the border and murder their children. No, we refuse to live that way any longer.",

They're a religious, political, and military grouping that now involves its religion in its politics. For example, their political arm is called Ansar Allah, which means partisan (ph) supporters of God. And They have a brand of religion called Zaydism, which is a branch of Shia Islam. And that's important because Shiasm is of course the kind of Islam that's practiced in Iran. Now, we shouldn't think of them as just a small rebel group. They actually control territory in which about two-thirds of Yemen's population lives, and that's about 20 million people. So -- and they've been at war for the last nine years in a civil war, and several years before that, since 2004. So, they're quite a considerable adversary. They should not be underestimated.",

But let's just zoom out slightly. The location of the Houthis down there in the Red Sea is really important because it completes a jigsaw puzzle of Iranian Proxies and partners in the region that, if you look at a map surround Israel. So, we've got the Houthis there to the south of Israel. And of course, we have Hamas in the west of Israel, in the Gaza Strip. And then to the north, we have Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy. And then in the north and the northeast, we have Iran backed Shia militias. So, the Houthis are a really important part of completing that circle of pressure on Israel.",

So, that's made them quite popular, not just with their base, which is, by the way, very tired after almost a decade of war, but also more broadly in Yemen and the Arab world. And then regionally, it works for the Houthis because they managed to gain more leverage over Saudi Arabia. Saudi doesn't want to antagonize the Houthis at a time when it's trying to extract itself from a very awkward and expensive war that it's been pursuing against the Houthis in Yemen. And it is on the cusp of being able to do that. And then finally, internationally, well, the Houthis have gained massive publicity for themselves and for the Palestinians.

As you say, the Houthis were militarizing the Red Sea, a couple of islands, and bringing in the kinds of weaponry that was required for these Red Sea attacks just before Hamas acted in October. And what is very striking is that the different partners in Iran's so- called axis of resistance have gradually ramped up their activity in the way that makes them look like they're being reactive and proportionate because they're responding to what Israel's been doing and what America is now doing, it makes -- it frames them as not as the aggressors, but as the defenders.

They're always flexing their muscles whenever they've signed an agreement before they've had deal remorse, and they've always gone back to try to get more. And so, this could be just another example of that, where they have no intention of sharing power, they simply want to keep finding excuses to carry on.

Are there any other things that we could do? Maybe. Maybe we could try harder with mediation. Oman would be a good route because Oman has not joined the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthis and has open channels to both the Houthis and Iran. And perhaps we could ramp up our indirect military action. Things that the Houthis couldn't point to the United States and say that was them. And maybe also spend more time building up local forces in Yemen who have spent the last nine years trying to push back against the Houthis.
