And it just being a hurricane already set a record for the farthest east that we've had a hurricane in June in the tropical Atlantic. Once it hits that major status of a Category 3 storm, it would be the third earliest major hurricane in the Atlantic and the earliest major hurricane within 100 miles of Barbados. So again, way ahead of schedule. We typically don't see a storm like this until mid-August or early September. Here's a look at the rapid intensification becoming that Category 4 storm, maybe even by tonight. You see the hurricane warnings for the Windward Islands, and it continues its trek in the Caribbean Sea as we go through the next couple of days, could maintain major status for parts of those islands. And again, when we're talking about Category 4 storms, there have only been five Category 4 storms in July in this part of the tropics. So again, just setting records. And it is because these ocean temperatures are incredibly warm. We're talking about ocean temperatures in the middle and upper 80s. This is more typical for mid to late August. We're not even in July yet, so these temperatures are just so warm. This is fuel and food for those hurricanes, and that's what allows them to rapidly intensify.
