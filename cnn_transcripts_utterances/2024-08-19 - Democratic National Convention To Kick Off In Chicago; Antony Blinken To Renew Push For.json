During one stop, Harris appearing to call rival Donald Trump a coward without mentioning by name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Frankly, over the last several years, there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.

Even Humphrey was a much better known figure after decades in the Senate, and his stint as Lyndon Johnson's vice president.Harris is more of a blind Canvas than we have typically reached this point. You know, with a candidate Dean, which means she has enormous opportunity, as Jeff said, to fill in especially about her story, her bio, who she is, what her commitments are, and much the way that Bill Clinton did in 1992 to try to connect her agenda to her life story. Tremendous opportunity because people don't know a lot about her. Tremendous risk because people don't know a lot about her, and if she doesn't fill Candace, she's leaving a lot of room for Republicans to do so.",

Yes, they consider him a very successful president, but they also believe that he, you know, had support and his ability to press the case both had deteriorated to the point where he was unlikely to be Trump. So on balance, I do not think that Kamala Harris wants him to be hugely visible. You know, his approval rating has been stuck in the low 40s for a year and a half. Presidents in that position, incumbent presidents have tended to lose reelection. It really is an example of one who won reelection with an approval rating down there. So I think they very much want this convention to be about her stepping out and essentially offering Americans a chance to turn the page with something new and different after this kind of, you know, extended period of polarization and intense partisan conflict.",

Kennedy was assassinated in June '68 and the party picked Humphrey over Gene McCarthy. Humphrey trail the whole race until he broke from Johnson at the end over Vietnam and then made it much closer against Richard Nixon before finally losing.Harris isn't in exactly that position, but there's no question that Biden's position on Gaza reinforced, intensified his problems among young voters. She has rhetorically taken, what, a half step, a quarter step further away from Netanyahu, then Biden did nothing substantive.

We've already heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here saying that there are some things that Israel can be flexible on and there are other things that they can't and there are other positions that they will absolutely insist upon.The Israeli prime minister is saying that all the pressure right now to get this bridging proposal that the United States has put forward, to get that agreed, the pressure must be put on Hamas, but barely was Secretary of State, Antony Blinken in the country here in Israel. And Hamas released its own press release about its position, saying that after meeting the mediators in Doha, it is clear that once again, they say it is Prime Minister Netanyahu who is placing obstacles in making progress, and they list some of the contentious issues. Israel wants to be able to control the movement of people in Gaza from the south back to the north. It wants to make sure that they don't have weapons. Hamas is objecting to that. It's the issue around, as they describe it, and then the Netzarim Junction, that's a big contentish issue. Who should control the border between Gaza and Egypt, the so called Philadelphi Corridor. Israel wants to keep its troops there because it believes that Hamas uses tunnels under that border to resupply and will rearm and reequip unless the IDF control controls that border. Hamas says no way on the Rafah border crossing, the actual crossing for trucks and goods between Egypt and Gaza. Again, Hamas wants to be able to control that Israel is saying, no, that's not acceptable. So these are just a few of the contentious issues, not to mention about prisoners, the hostages and prisoners, the numbers who will be released, how much advance information each side should have. So the bar is set very high here for Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, to really make any progress. And if you listen to the opposing sides, both the Israeli government and Hamas, they're both blaming each other already. So it does seem that these hopes of some positivity around the talks in Doha are really meeting hard reality right now. Nic Roberson, CNN, Tel Aviv, Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So as we have already shown in a \"New York Times\" story started together with my colleagues, Patrick Kingsley and (INAUDIBLE) indeed Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu has added some new conditions to the Israeli proposal. The proposal that Israel made in May 27 and just two weeks ago in a meeting in Rome, the Israeli chief of Mossad handed over to the chief of the CIA and the representative of the other mediating countries between Israel and Hamas have new conditions. This was put, I would say on top of demands that Hamas has made to change some of the phrasing of the draft that was adapted by the United Nations Security Council. So the bottom line, we have a big pile of hurdles and obstacles and contradictory between Israel and Hamas yet to be solved and were not solved in the last summit in Doha during the weekend. However, it seems that there is a -- there is a connection between the Iranian decision -- Iranian and Hezbollah decision to delay the revenge strike following the two assassinations, the one Israel has executed in Beirut to the one that you just reported that describe (INAUDIBLE).

But some have said that the inclusion of this float shows an anti-Muslim bias. Now the float in question depicts a Rahm temple. The temple was recently opened in India and it is built on the ruins of a 16th century mosque. That is part of what has created all of this controversy around this float. The mosque was destroyed back in 1992 by Hindu Nationalists mobs. And it led to one of the darkest periods in India's history. More than 2,000 people were killed as a result of violent outbreaks around the entire country, the majority of them Muslims. So Muslims here in New York who are members of the Indian community say that the inclusion of this float is disrespectful to Muslims and meant to send a threatening message to their community.
