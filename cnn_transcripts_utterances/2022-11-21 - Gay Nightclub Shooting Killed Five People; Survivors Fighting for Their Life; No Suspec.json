At least five people were killed and 25 others injured. Police have not yet released the names of the dead, but the parents of bartender Daniel Aston say their son was among those killed. They tell the Denver Post he moved to Colorado Springs to be closer to them two years ago, he found a job at the club only a few minutes from their home. Police say Aston's alleged killer 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich entered Club Q late Saturday and opened fire with a long rifle. Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who is gay, spoke with CNN about how the community is reacting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO):  This was just a place of safety for people. It was a place where people could, in a conservative community, often get the acceptance that too many of them might not have had at home or in their other circles.

The fact that the women were not assaulted sexually tells us something. The fact that he brought his own weapon tells us that he was expecting to kill when he went there. The two on each floor may have been all the person needed for whatever desire they had. We won't know until we get to the person. But what's interesting is they said some of the victims had defensive wounds. What that tells me is that the killer was attacking most of them, if not all of them, as they slept, as they had no chance to defend themselves, and maybe only one woke up in time.

Just in that there has been this unquenchable thirst to criticize Qatar, whereas maybe there is not that same thirst when powerful western nations are hosting these mega events.

But of course, that isn't a reason to not criticize Qatar. I don't think they should be hosting this World Cup. Because, you know, what happened -- what has happened here, what has happened to enable this World Cup and what continues to happen, albeit to a lesser degree, some -- to some extent with migrant workers, but it's pretty appalling.

This is a residential neighborhood just south of Buffalo proper. Residents have been working all weekend to dig their way out of their homes, clearing their driveways. The city, the county, they're joining the efforts, making sure that the streets are clear as well. They're also taking some extraordinary steps to not just plow the snow but also remove the snow.You see this lake effect, frozen precipitation, it's wet. It's very heavy. So according to one city official I spoke to on Sunday, it's not the kind of snow that you could just sort of plow and leave it there. So, they are taking these extraordinary steps by basically using equipment to remove the snow from these neighborhoods and then pile it up high tons at a time. In some of the city facilities that they have, they say that certainly snow and buffalo is not extraordinary, but the num -- the volume that they received, for the last three days, it certainly is.

And in that time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Russians have now used more than 4,700 missiles to strike his country. In an address on Sunday he said, quote, \"hundreds of our cities are simply burned.\" He also gave an update on the fighting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator):  The first topic is the front line. The fiercest battles as before are in the Donetsk region. Although there are fewer attacks today due to the deterioration of the weather, the number of Russian shelling occasions remains unfortunately extremely high. The second topic is energy, restoration of networks and technical supply capabilities, demining of power transmission lines, repairs, everything goes on around the clock. We managed to alleviate the situation in some regions where there were a lot of real problems yesterday. This evening, there are stabilization shutdowns in 15 regions and in Kyiv as well.

An activist group posted an unverified video allegedly showing Iranian forces firing indiscriminately in two Kurdish cities. And a warning, some of the video is disturbing to watch.The group says at least 36 people have been killed in the region since last Tuesday, including two 16-year-old boys. CNN has not been able to independently verify these reports. So, for more, let's go to CNN's Jomana Karadsheh who joins us live from Istanbul. Good to see you, Jomana. So, what were you learning about this apparent crackdown in in a Kurdish region of Iran?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, what we have seen over the past week is this new wave of protest that has erupted across the country. Many of these -- many of these demonstrations taking place in Kurdish cities and towns in the region in the western part of the country.And the human rights monitor Hengaw is telling us that there has been an intensifying crackdown in the Kurdish region and that they have seen what they describe as brutality increasing significantly. They say security forces have been shooting directly and deliberately at protesters, as you mentioned. So far, they have identified they say 36 victims, including two 16- year-old boys who have been killed since last Tuesday. But Hengaw is concerned that the number could be higher than that. And on Sunday, Rosemary, there was a lot of concern about what is going on in the city of Mahabad. Activists, rights groups were warning that a bloody crackdown might be coming. As we've seen, security enforce -- reinforcements being sent into the city, including members of the feared revolutionary guard corps. And then what we saw is a number of cities according to Hengaw and other activists, several cities and towns and villages in the Kurdish region they say rising up in support of Mahabad and they say that those areas came under intense attack as well. The Iranian regime, Rosemary, is confirming that it has sent forces into the Kurdish region. But what it's doing is continuing to push the narrative that what is going on in that part of a country is not protests, not real grievances by its long-oppressed Kurdish minority. What they're saying is going on is some sort of a separatist terrorist movement. The IRGC in a statement saying that they have sent troops to confront and deal with these separatists and terrorists. Also, as part of this government narrative, we're seeing once again the Iranian regime conducting strikes into Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Missiles and drones targeting several areas, several target in that part of Iraq. They say targeting Iranian Kurdish opposition forces who they've accused of fueling the unrest in western Iran's Kurdish region. So, a lot of concern, Rosemary, about what might be happening in the next hour -- in the coming hours and days in the Kurdish region of Iran. And in more disturbing news coming out of Iran on Sunday as well, Rosemary, we heard from state media announcing that a revolutionary court sentenced another protestor to death. This is the six protesters to receive the death penalty in a week. This protestor who hasn't been identified, they say was accused of blocking traffic and attacking members of the paramilitary besiege forces. Again, the sixth sentence in a week in what rights groups are describing as these sham trials. What I can tell you, Rosemary, despite these death sentences, the arrests, the violent crackdown, the rising death toll, the protests are not stopping. What we are seeing happening is people growing angrier by the day and more defiant.",
