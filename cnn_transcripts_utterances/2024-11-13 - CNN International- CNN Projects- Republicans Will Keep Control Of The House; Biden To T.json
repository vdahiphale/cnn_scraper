You mentioned that there's still nine seats, still too close to call. Whoever wins those seats is really going to determine how much of a margin Republicans have in the house, which will have huge implications for how Johnson is able to lead his very often, oftentimes divided and unruly conference but at this point, Republicans are trying to come together and unify, especially behind president elect Donald Trump, who visited them back here earlier this morning. Republicans believe that the results from the presidential election and control in both chambers of government, that this trifecta just shows that there's a mandate from the American people to deliver on their priorities, specifically on the border, on tax cuts, on immigration, but how that gets done and how Speaker Mike Johnson keeps his conference together is really a looming question here.",

The Senate usually likes to act as an independent body. They like to usually act with their own voice, but what's clear now is that Donald Trump is demanding that Congress, the Republican House and the Republican Senate, are loyal to him. He's saying that he has a mandate that many of these senators are in the Senate because of him. He not only handpicked them, he helped them win their reelections. And I am not finding a lot of dissent or willingness to even speak out of or potentially talk about trying to push back on any of the president's agenda, even things that are not traditional Republican orthodoxy like tariffs or some of these unconventional cabinet picks, Jim.",

I'm not sure he will. Trump, A, is a one-term president at this point. So I'm not sure how far he's thinking down the road on this. And there are consequences for doing away with the filibuster as we know. I mean, it's -- it's obviously one of the reasons that Mitch McConnell never did.

Ridiculous, said one. An F-ing nightmare euphemism inserted said another.These were senior commanders who have served under both Trump and Biden, and their critiques were not personal. None had anything negative to say about Hegseth. Their central concern is that they see President-elect Trump with these and other senior national security appointments, building out a team to put into action his America First agenda with lasting changes to U.S. foreign policy. To that point, Hegseth, from his perch at Fox News, has long been a vocal proponent of Trump's America first agenda. The common denominator, one retired four-star general told me, is clearly loyalty. And while some loyalty is essential, slavish fealty is dangerous. CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt has been following all these decisions by -- decisions by Trump.

And these guys are, you know, they're experienced, they\\re hawkish. They're more traditional, if you will. And then last night, out of the clear blue sky, we got this choice of Pete Hegseth for the head of the defense department. And you know, this is someone who is very much in line with the Trump values. And the Trump positions on the culture war of you know, the fact that the Defense Department has become woke and that woke generals need to be fired. I mean, he has some really extreme positions, including that women should not be allowed in combat. He talks about the need to take critical race theory and die training out of the military academies. And this is someone who, once you get past the shock inside and outside the Pentagon, you do hear some disappointment from current and former officials. I spoke with a senior uniformed official earlier today who said this is not a serious choice. Someone else who was recently in the Pentagon, pointing to the fact that he has absolutely no executive experience no policy experience. This is as you point out, Jim, a massive bureaucracy of thousands and thousands of people, all around the world managing these wars and other conflicts and, you know, standing guard, and you've got the relationship with congress.

And I think that's the key point, is that there is a majority with headroom. And I do think that this speaks to some confidence in the Trump camp and among Republicans that they can get these choices through. I mean, it's not going to be without drama, you know, with these confirmation hearings look like whether it's in the Senate Intelligence Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that are at least half Democrats. And so, those are going to be -- those are going to be pretty contentious with those Democrats digging in. Now, are there Republicans who defect? Right now, that's hard to see. And I think again, what you're seeing here is confidence from the Trump camp that they can get these -- these people through. You know, earlier, before these -- these two latest Hegseth and Gabbard were named, I think those more traditional choices point to the fact that maybe there was less certainty, or at least they didn't want to risk those that razor thin margin in the Senate. But now, clearly, they think they can get these through. And the other people out there who we still have to keep an eye on are very much in that same vein of MAGA America first as Hegseth and Gabbard and those as, you know, Jim, are Ric Grenell and Ric Grenell and Kash Patel, who may also get senior national security roles.",

He believes that Matt Gaetz would end weaponized government protect the borders, dismantle criminal organizations restore Americans shattered faith and confidence in the justice department. Now, that is something that a long line of people well-respected, both from the left and the right in the position of attorney general have tried to do make sure that there are prosecutions of gangs across the country. Whether Gaetz is up to that task is a real question.",

Gaetz at DOJ, Gabbard at DNI, Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host at DOD. What's the reaction you're hearing on the Hill?",

We are you know, trying to get members reacting to these recent announcements and I was trying to grab Senator Marco Rubio now that he was officially nominated. And obviously, we have seen a bunch of other nominations come through.I think Matt Gaetz in recent moments is going to be really shocking for some of the members who are coming out of this meeting. They typically don't have their phones in these behind closed doors meetings. It is important to point out that Matt Gaetz is still under an ethics investigation in the House of Representatives. He also was one of those folks who was leading the fight to oust Kevin McCarthy. Just a little over a year ago now, you know, he is someone who is seen as a rabble-rouser in the House. He's also someone who's seen as a pit bull for Donald Trump, in his pursuit of oversight in the House of Representatives. So this is going to be a really interesting choice. And we should just remind everyone again that is the Senate who will decide whether or not he is actually confirmed to that post. So, we are still seeking reaction. Obviously, this news just broke moments ago and senators are sort of spread out across the Capitol right now. But we are waiting outside of this hearing room trying to get additional reaction -- Jim.",

TIM HEAPHY, FORMER LEAD INVESTIGATOR, JANUARY 5TH COMMITTEE: Yeah, Jim. Horribly discouraging and it undermines the rule of law. It just can't be in this country that protest that becomes violent -- that violates federal criminal statutes, can be excused, right? We have a history in this country of serious disagreement and dissent against authority. But it stops with speech and cannot stray into conduct. And if the president of United States forgives criminal conduct, that went well beyond speech that is, that undercuts the rule of law so my hope is that he left himself room in that answer and said many of them that there is some principled line that that he draws in terms of what conduct he'll excuse. It's all criminal, but there are degrees obviously, of criminality. My hope is much closer to a very small number of people getting pardons, and the vast majority of them certainly anyone violence is convicted.",

My first reaction, Jim, is if I were still in the department, I'd have even more of a basis than ever to worry about the historic independence and integrity of the department. The department is full of men and women career again, not Republican or Democrat, but career public servants who turn the wheels of the federal criminal justice system. And my guess is that a lot of them are very concerned about either being told to do things they're not comfortable with or being prevented from doing things that that make sense.

But ultimately, in order for someone to be convicted someone to go to prison, someone to have a criminal consequence, in a democracy, that requires regular people, right, 12 jurors making a decision to convict someone unanimously beyond a reasonable that. The ultimate check is that, but what gets to them, right? That is the product of decisions by prosecutors.
