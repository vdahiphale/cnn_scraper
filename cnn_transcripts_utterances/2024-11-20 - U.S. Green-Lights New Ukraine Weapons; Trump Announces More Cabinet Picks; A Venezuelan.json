We'll speak to a top Finnish official as  tensions between Russia and the West hit a boiling point. President-elect Donald Trump announcing more cabinet picks. The details on the roles. A TV doctor and former pro wrestling exec could play in the new Trump White House. Plus, a Venezuelan migrant found guilty in the murder of U.S. nursing student, the latest on that case and how it became a political lightning rod in the United States. And we begin tonight in Ukraine where Kyiv is accusing Moscow of staging a quote, \"information and psychological attack by spreading lies about a potential large-scale airstrike on Ukraine's capital. The U.S. State Department just announced the American Embassy there will reopen tomorrow after it was shut down on Wednesday.

Ukraine's forces are expected to deploy the controversial mines in the east of the country where Russian troops have been breaking through Kyiv's defensive lines.

That secured line was set up back in the '60s to defuse tensions between Moscow and Washington.

This decision by the Biden administration to allow the  Ukrainians to use those ATACMS missiles, and of course, some of those strikes already taking place. It was quite interesting because there was a call earlier today, Erica, with the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, where he was asked specifically about the U.S. information about these massive strikes allegedly set to take place there in Kyiv, and the dangers that, that poses. And he said he was not going to comment on all of that because that pertains to what the Russians still call their special military operation, and that only the Defense Ministry would comment on all of that. The Russians, however slinging accusations at the White House, accusing the outgoing Biden administration of essentially extending the war in Ukraine, escalating the war in Ukraine. And it was also interesting to hear the Russians were asked whether or not Vladimir Putin would be inclined for negotiations around Ukraine especially with the incoming Trump administration. And one of the things that Dmitry Peskov said in regard to that is, he said, Vladimir Putin has always said that he's willing to conduct negotiations. However, the Russians are saying that they want definitely to achieve the things that they said they need to achieve in Ukraine, which is obviously the territorial gains that they already have. But they also want to make sure that Ukraine will not be part of NATO either. So, really those maximalist things that the Russians have said from the very beginning, at least as far as their starting point for any sort of negotiation, that still does seem to be the case. And at the same time, of course, what you also have here in Russia is them saying with the U.S. giving those ATACMS missiles to the Ukrainians, allowing the Ukrainians to use those to strike deep into Russian territory. That for the Russians, that has changed the very nature of the conflict that they now believe that they are in a direct conflict with NATO, with the West, and specifically, of course, with the United States. And that, of course, was also one of the reasons they say why they changed the country's nuclear doctrine to now include scenarios where, for instance, strikes by countries like Ukraine aided by countries like the United States could then lead to a nuclear response for -- from the Russians. Of course, the U.S. has said that they're not surprised by this change in the nuclear doctrine, something that they had expected. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint here from Moscow, I think that the Kremlin was definitely looking forward to a change of administration in the United States, and they do believe that the Ukrainians now being able to use those ATACMS missiles, certainly throws at least somewhat of a wrench in the process that they were hoping to start.

And then the Biden administration decides to move on and actually provide better weapons capabilities in the recent days. So, things are moving here. But I am skeptical because I think, there is a different mindset that President Putin has. He's going to -- you know, I don't see why he is going to negotiate or agree to any kind of ceasefire immediately, that simply limits his options. I think he will try to drag on and derail the conversation, any negotiations as long as possible, trying to test the new administration. They have always done that.

Authorities say Ibarra; an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela struck her in the head with a rock and choked her. Ibarra had requested a bench trial, meaning that his verdict would be decided by the judge, not by jury. Riley's father had requested her death not be politicized. But Ibarra's migrant status made the case an almost immediate flashpoint here in the United States which of course carried through into this most recent election.

KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: If a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock, trying to hold it all together --",

The U.S., though, had wanted the ceasefire conditioned on the hostages' freedom. Israel thanked the U.S. for its veto, saying the resolution amounted to what it called an appeasement of Hamas. Ismail's prime minister, meantime, is offering a $5 million reward for anyone who returns a hostage. Benjamin Netanyahu making that announcement while touring the ruins of Gaza on Tuesday. Netanyahu had vowed Hamas would not rule Gaza after the war, saying that Israel is destroying its military and administrative capabilities.
