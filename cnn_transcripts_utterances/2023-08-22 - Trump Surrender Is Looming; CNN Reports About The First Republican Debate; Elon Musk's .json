Mugshots have now been released tonight for the first two of the former president's co-defendants to surrender in the Georgia election case, John Eastman and also Scott Hall. Here they are right there. And we are now just two days away from Donald Trump's expected surrender at the Fulton County jail after, of course, being criminally charged, allegedly trying to overturn Joe Biden's election victory in the state of Georgia. Meanwhile, Mark Meadows. You know who that is, of course. He is trying a now last-ditch legal maneuver to try to avoid his own surrender by, of course, that Friday noon deadline. And you got a dozen defendants, including the former president. They've all struck bond deals that have been signed by a judge. A dozen, of course, is not yet 19. We also learned that tonight, Rudy Giuliani is set to meet with the Fulton County D.A.'s office tomorrow to talk about a possible bond agreement. I want to turn right now to CNN correspondent Tom Foreman, he is at the magic wall, breaking it down for us all on what's happening right now. We also -- CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI director Andrew McCabe is with us today, former Trump White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews and former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi.

If you make this illegal, how are we going to do our job? Scott Hall, bail bondsman down in Atlanta, he is tied to the Coffee County election machine breach. Remember, there were machines up there where the investigation found that a group of Trump allies went in there and took data from these machines, which the prosecutor says is in violation of law.

The bottom line is he would like to join them in migrating over to federal court with us. Question is, does that take everybody else with them or not? Why would they want to do that? There are several reasons. One, Trumps' strategy, it slows everything down. Every time you do anything in this case, it's going to slow it down. All these people, all these lawyers, a lot of things are going to get slowed down. That's one of the slowing things. Potentially more sympathetic jurors. Some debate about this, but the notion being if you broaden the jury pool in a federal hearing further beyond Fulton County, beyond Atlanta, which will lean so much more blue, you might get some more Trump sympathetic jurors in there. No cameras in federal courts. You don't have to appear on T.V. day after day, you know, blinking and being accused of things. And maybe some more legal avenues for defense.

Mark Meadows would be something, Sarah, that suggests, well, look, this is part of what he was supposed to be doing, and there is a claim it was acting in his office. MATTHEWS: I would love to see if Mark Meadows then is willing to say that the 2020 election wasn't stolen because that would contradict then that, you know, if he's saying, oh, I'm just doing my job and carrying out the duties that the president wanted, okay, well, so then you knew it wasn't stolen, that this was all a lie, but you were pushing it at the direction of your boss.

They've kind of made it easier for him to really not show up and appear because he's not going to get really a hostile crowd. Maybe, of course, Christie and Hutchinson to name a few.But let's just say that Trump actually does show up, Mark. If he does show up, who do you think suffers the most with him actually being present? MARK MCKINNON, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF \"THE CIRCUS\": Everybody on the stage. I mean, he'll just block out the sun. But, you know, something occurred to me tonight that -- thinking about why he's not going to be there. I mean, obviously, it's a political consideration that he's making. And I've worked for presidents running for reelection and, obviously, he's not running for real -- technically he's running for reelection, having lost the last one. But they never wanted to pay. They always think it's beneath them and that they don't see any advantage. That's obviously his political calculation. But I'll bet his lawyers breathed a big sigh of relief because think about this. We've got two former prosecutors on that stage, Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, and you can bet that they would be serving him some (INAUDIBLE) right down the middle on the legal cases, and we know that Trump is inclined to talk about things that he shouldn't be talking about legally. So, I'll bet his lawyers are very happy that he's not going to be on that stage. Not considering what his political consultants think, but the lawyers, I'm sure, are very happy. COATES: I mean, well, consider that one moment in otherwise dark times for the attorneys of somebody with four competing indictments, I'll mention. Molly, you have a new cover story for \"Time,\" where you write in part -- first of all, the actual -- the cover and the roller coaster of it, really interesting to look at. I think (INAUDIBLE) background there and the others who are on the stage -- who are going to be on the stage. It says, with just a few days before the first republican presidential debate, he is not even planning to show up. And why should he? He is running away with this thing as rivals flounder and leap to his defense after each successive criminal indictment. So, I wonder, are all of these troubles going to dominate the conversation? And if they are, is the litmus test of loyalty and how one addresses it weaponization-wise or, of course, pardoning, of course, it's outside of the state context, is that the central issue here that will take a lot of space here?",

They're not judged like a college debate. It's not a forensic debate. You don't get points. It is all about how you perform against expectations. Now, Ramaswamy and DeSantis have completely different presentation, which is that Ramaswamy has very low expectations. People don't know him. They're unfamiliar with him. He is doing well in the polls recently because he has run a pretty aggressive media campaign. But his expectations are low. People don't expect much from him. And he's very confident. I mean, he's very good on stage. He's very good in front of a camera. So, I think he will exceed expectations. Ron DeSantis has high expectations. He was the guy that came in, was supposed to be the giant killer, and hasn't gotten all the traction that he was supposed to. But his expectations for this debate are still very high.

But of course, that's really the tip of the iceberg and really his most recent venture.He has Tesla, of course. He has spacecraft and rocket manufacturer SpaceX and broadband internet system Starlink. Then there's his recently launched AI-focused company, XAI. He's also, of course, known, increasingly so, for his erratic behavior, and this has the U.S. government nervous. But the question for many is why. Well, Ronan Farrow, in a new piece from \"The New Yorker,\" notes that the U.S. has grown overly reliant on Musk's technology, putting them at the mercy of, well, his impulsive behavior. For example, Starlink is being used to support critical communications on the front lines of the war in Ukraine. But according to The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow, one Pentagon official says that Musk said he has spoken personally with Vladimir Putin. Farrow also appeared earlier on \"CNN Tonight\" and detailed Musk's critical role in Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, his role became very political, very fast. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've never really experienced that type of situation before.Now, of course, the Starlink example is absolutely critical and it puts the U.S. probably in its biggest bind as it pertains to this go- between role. But there have been other instances in which Elon Musk has forced the government to take an action on certain things related to technology. You think about autonomous vehicles. This is a huge priority for the Biden administration. The Biden administration had to really twist the arm of Elon Musk, giving him tax credits to ensure that the Tesla charging stations would be applicable to a bunch of different other auto vehicles. So, you can see a lot of examples in which the government has had to play ball with Elon Musk. We've never had some sort of private citizen in that, holding that much power over our government.",

Same thing again for autonomous vehicles. Even space, Elon Musk taking a leadership role in advancing the U.S.'s space agenda there. And so, I think that it's one of these situations where the U.S. government is kind of at its own fault here. They have not done enough.
