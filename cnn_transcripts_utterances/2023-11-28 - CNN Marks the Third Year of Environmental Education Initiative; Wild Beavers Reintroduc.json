And as informed family members this comes to us from a family member. So, that is going down the right path that might suggest that things are on a slightly firmer footing even to Monday when we know there were delays because of concerns that Israel had that the list included children without their mothers.That was eventually resolved but did lead to a slight delay in the hostages being released. The question now, of course, that we have this two-day extension agreed is could it even be extended further? Israel is making it clear that they see the ball is in Hamas' court. If they continue to release hostages, then Israel will continue to extend the pause by 24 hours for each 10 hostages that are released to the U.S. The White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby also say that they are hopeful that there could be further extensions even beyond this. Now there is a logistical question because we know that Hamas is potentially not in custody of all of the hostages that were taken on October 7th. That could complicate proceedings as we look to increase the numbers of hostages that are released. Mark Regev who is a senior adviser to Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he believes there are enough women and children hostages still in Gaza that Hamas will be able to fulfill this deal. But that they are also saying that because Hamas is the government in Gaza, that they bear responsibility, even if they don't have physical custody of these hostages.",

The Israeli Defense Minister who was speaking on Monday before the news of this extension came out. He was addressing soldiers saying, you know, you may face a tougher enemy but they are going to go and he said with a stronger force and will fight all across the Gaza Strip.He said the second thing that Israel has continued to maintain is that the two war goals, the release of these hostages and the goal of eliminating Hamas completely in Gaza are not mutually exclusive. They believe the idea of Israel coming back in with us stronger force is enough of an incentive for Hamas to want to extend the pause. [02:05:04] Of course, the reality is that if Israel comes back with a stronger force, Hamas may do the same. They will have had these six days minimum to regroup. There's been a drop in overflights by reconnaissance drones from Israel as part of this deal. So, they may have had time to regroup as well. I think this is going to be the next phase of this war that we're looking at potentially more difficult battles inside Gaza. Rosemary?",

I'm Rosemary Church.With the Israel-Hamas truce extended by at least another 48 hours, we are expecting the militant group to release more hostages in the day ahead. In total, 69 captives have been freed so far, including 11 Israelis on Monday. Hamas has agreed to release at least ten hostages on each day of the truce. Israel has freed another 33 Palestinians who were held in Israeli prisons, all of them women and teenagers as agreed. Meanwhile, two American women remain in captivity in Gaza, but the White House is hopeful they could be freed now the truth has been extended. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more on the U.S. role in the negotiations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The United States has been pushing for an extension of this pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas since the news came that a deal had been reached for a four-day temporary truce. More time the Biden Administration has argued would mean that Hamas would release more hostages and it would be easier to get aid into the Gaza Strip. Israel agreed, as long as Hamas kept releasing at least ten hostages per day. The U.S. has had a central role in getting to this point, in large part because an estimated ten Americans were being held in Gaza by Hamas and other groups. The U.S. used its considerable leverage to press mediators, Qatar and Egypt, to pressure Hamas, while speaking directly with Israel. On Monday, for example, as the fourth day of the hostage release looked uncertain, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Qatari counterpart, the foreign minister. Over the thanksgiving weekend, President Joe Biden spoke directly to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as the Emir of Qatar, evidence of how personally involved he is. Now, one of the main players in brokering this original deal is Bill Burns, the Director of the CIA. He quietly worked with Israeli, Egyptian, and Qatari counterparts to get the negotiations across the finish line. American officials have said that, no matter how long this current pause lasts, they will keep working towards freeing the rest of the American and all of the other hostages, a prospect that may become more complicated if or when Israel re-launches its military operations in Gaza.
