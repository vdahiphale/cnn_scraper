Ma'am, the only qualification he has as far as I can see or job on an job application is hookers and crack cocaine. Let's just be honest, this guy is bad news. And you all want to cover for him and that's fine. But there is a circuitous route of the money throwing from the Communist Chinese to Hunter, to one of his 22 shell companies, to the President of the United States. And there is a -- there's several checks that have been made available to you all and you just refused to show them. And by saying there is no evidence, ma'am. And I realize that's the Democrat national talking points that you all continue to regurgitate. But the truth is, is that this stuff is out there, and it would behoove you ought to look at if you are investigative reporters, if not, just put it at the bottom, paid for by the Democrat National Committee. Because this is clearly, clearly money. We're talking about $30 million. What qualifications does Hunter Biden have for receiving $30 million from Burisma, of all places, from Russian oligarchs, from Chinese Communist members?
