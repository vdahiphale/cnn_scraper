Okay? Because the federal government did pass a statute insurrection, Title 18 U.S. Code 2383, and that is the statute that says, if you're convicted of this, you have to serve up to 10 years in jail and you're disqualified from holding the office of the president. That -- their refusal to address that statute. In fact, at one point, they just kind of addressed it briefly and said, well, that doesn't really apply because it doesn't say that's the only method. But the reality is many grand juries sitting here in D.C. have examined the events of that day. They've all declined to bring charges of insurrection. One came close.

In other words, if the court is going to say, you know, we want the people to decide, not us, then they've got to give the people all the facts, and that means certainly whether or not Donald Trump is a felon. And, you know, speeding the decision on the immunity and allowing the trial to take place means that the American voters will get an answer to that question. Is he a felon?
