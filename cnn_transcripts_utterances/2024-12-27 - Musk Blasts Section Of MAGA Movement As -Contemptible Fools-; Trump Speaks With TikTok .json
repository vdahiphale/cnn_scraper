Whose side is Donald Trump on? And we'll speak with a House Republican, on that critical election, for Mike Johnson, that is now just days away. By this time next week, we could know if he remains as the House Speaker. And with the clock ticking for TikTok, I have new reporting that Trump just spoke with the company's CEO. The President-elect tonight is calling on the Supreme Court to pause the nationwide ban set to go into effect the day before he takes office. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. And tonight, that internal battle that's underway in Trump world, that we laid out for you here, last night, is only escalating even further today. In his clash with the far-right over immigration, Elon Musk is now going after the hardliners, the very heart of the MAGA base, labeling them, just a few hours ago, as, quote, \"Contemptible fools\" who \"must be removed from the Republican Party, root and stem.\" Musk now finds himself pitted against the likes of Steve Bannon, however, Trump's former White House aide, who came out against Musk's push for H-1B visas, which allow highly-skilled foreign workers into the U.S., and has long been the lifeblood of Silicon Valley.

He -- and you can just go on to X and see the vitriol around this conversation. I mean, they try and say it's about visas and everything else. But really, you don't -- do not need to scratch the surface too far, just to see the level of racism and hate and just really ugly stuff that's happening on that platform. And that is in part, right, because a lot of the white supremacists, and racists, and others, who had been suspended by Twitter for spreading hate in -- under the previous ownership, were all brought back onto the platform under Elon Musk.

We saw her getting off of it with him, earlier, during the -- during the 2024 race, not that long ago.She is claiming Musk is censoring her. I heard from people, who are opposed to her, earlier today, saying that's not what's happening here. What is -- what did happen with her account? O'SULLIVAN: So, yes, Loomer has about 1.5 million followers on X. She's a big voice in the MAGA world, right? As much as I think maybe a lot of Establishment Republicans, even people who are close to Trump, would like to say that she doesn't have influence? She does, certainly in this space. What happened over the past 24 hours is she has a verified blue badge account, which I think to -- a lot of people would just say, So what, it's a blue badge? But what that allows her to do on the platform, under Musk, is it allows two things. One, it allows her to get revenue from the ads that are shown next to her post. So, that's a way that Musk has set up the platform, to try and monetize it, to try and make -- encourage people to post more on the platform. And also, she has paid subscribers on the platform. We don't know how much money she was making. But oftentimes that can go into the many, many thousands every month. So, that has been taken away from her. We haven't heard from X.

They don't want an America that's going to become brown, or they don't -- they're trying to preserve kind of a white Christian heterosexual culture that they believe is the core American culture and ought to be the one that exists. Now, Laura Loomer ignores, when she says Europeans built the country, she ignores the African slaves. She ignores the Chinese immigrants who did the railroads. She ignores the people from Mexican heritage in the southwest who worked, and then Native Americans who were here first. She ignores everyone else who was in the country. So, the problem is, they've got to figure out how to bring -- Trump has got to figure out how to hold these people together. I just don't know if it's possible. Because at the end of the day, the only way the country grows is if we do have more immigrants who come into the country, who help populate and move the country forward, and that we make it more diverse, where we recruit and retain people from different backgrounds, into these tech industries, so that we can have an economy that can compete with everybody in the world.",

But the bottom line is, this is something we're going to have to deal with.The reason, Democrats were so upset about the debt ceiling being thrown into the mix on the CR, was because ultimately they want to use it as leverage in a negotiation. So, there's two ways to deal with this. One is through reconciliation, which would not really require Democrat participation in the Senate. The other, obviously would, if you have to rely on 60 votes, and you don't do it through reconciliation.",
