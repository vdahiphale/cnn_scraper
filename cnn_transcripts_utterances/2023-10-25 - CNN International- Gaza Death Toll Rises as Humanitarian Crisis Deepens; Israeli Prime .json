People nearby rush to help. \"There is no ambulance, we have to get people, out\" a man shouts. Men dig with bare hands. It is dark, dusty. The screams are jarring. \"Look at the children, look at the children,\" he says. It is sheer chaos and carnage. This is the aftermath of just one of the hundreds of bombings a day that batter the Gaza Strip, the scene captured by a journalist. Israel says it is targeting Hamas and aims to wipe out the group. But Palestinians and aid agencies say it is civilians that are dying by the hundreds. Drone footage shows entire neighborhoods already leveled by the near constant bombardment. Nothing is spared -- schools, mosques, shelters, medical centers, all struck, according to the United Nations. Gaza is all too familiar with war but has never seen it on this scale. And for survivors, there is little life left here. Baby Sana Halabi (ph) is now an orphan. But he is far too young to understand that. \"What did this little boy do? An airstrike hit his house while he was sleeping,\" his uncle says. \"His whole family was killed. He's the only survivor. Stop this. Stop this suffering.\" There are calls for Israel to pause hostilities but the IDF is only ramping up its attacks and preparing for what is expected to be a full-on ground invasion of the enclave. But Gazans say they can endure no more. Amar Al Batah says nearly 50 members of his extended family were killed after they followed Israel's evacuation instructions. \"We were hosting our family from the north, 50 to 70 people, because it was supposed to be safe,\" he says. \"But at dawn, our home was bombed. We don't know what to do. We have lost our minds.\" Gaza is praying for relief. But the cries of anguish here are so far unheard, the bloodshed won't stop. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London.

      "sentences": "Well, sources are telling CNN that a small group of Hamas operatives used hardwired phones in the tunnels beneath Gaza to communicate over a period of two years. That's according to intelligence shared with U.S. officials. Those old-fashioned landlines allowed Hamas leaders to communicate with one another in secret. They avoided using computers or cell phones in order to keep from being tracked by Israeli or U.S. intelligence, according to the sources. Instead, they held meetings in person among a small group and stayed off all digital communications we're told.Now this partially explains why Israel and the U.S. were so caught off guard by the attack and how 1,000 Hamas fighters were able to pour across the border without being stopped. As we have seen in the propaganda video released by Hamas. All of this communication, we're told, happened in the miles of underground tunnel system that is beneath Gaza, that the IDF nicknamed the Gaza Metro. Another way Hamas was able to keep this under the radar is that they kept the planning of the October 7th attack a secret even from other members. Only a very small group knew about the mission until just before it was carried out. Hamas ground unit commanders and fighters were in training for many months and kept in a state of general preparedness, but only found out about the specific plans just a few days before the terrorist attack. And one of the sources said, some of the training above ground was observed but didn't ring major alarm bells. The thinking was, oh, Hamas always trains people like this. It didn't look different. And we also know that Israel had found hardwired phones in Hamas strongholds in the past. In fact, the Israeli military found this similar kind of communication system when they raided a city in the northern West Bank over the summer. That's according to an Israeli official. They called it a Joint Operational Command Center, and they had hardwired communication lines and closed-circuit surveillance cameras to give advance warning of Israeli troop movements.

And the situation, I don't know when it's going to change because Israel took and look back then, look and look for a for a target that's called to eliminate Hamas. I don't think that we can eliminate Hamas. Because you have to remember Hamas is a political social national and then terrorist and terrorist and terrorist group, wherever you are going to find two-three Palestinians, one of them going to be Hamas.

And they are giving all the help to -- all the help to Hamas, including training and including sending weapons, sending a lot of money.Qatar, that's the big problem. Because Qatar is playing in the Middle East like a big country, a big power. It's a state that has a television and with the television they control all the Arab, all the Arab world. It's the richest emirate in the in the Persian Gulf, just the population is 2.6 million, but just 300,000 citizens.

He plans to take it to the floor.Then this coming after three other nominees saw their bids collapse, including one Congressman Tom Emmer, just earlier in the afternoon, just a couple of hours after he won his party's nomination, faced a fierce backlash on the right, and then decided it was time for him to drop out because he had no path to the speakership. Well, Mike Johnson then won the nomination himself. The fourth time a nominee has come forward in the aftermath of Kevin McCarthy's ouster. There was some concern inside the room. There were roughly 44 members who voted for other candidates, someone who is not Mike Johnson or any of the other declared candidates. Ultimately, though, some of those came to his side when it came to one of the final votes to decide whether or not they would back him on the floor. There were -- 22 members were missing from that vote, and there were also three members who voted present. And Mike Johnson on the floor on Wednesday can only afford to lose four Republican votes. So he has some work to go. But still there is confidence in the ranks and that after all this in fighting that even though the members who flatly opposed pushing out Kevin McCarthy, even they say it's time to put this to an end and back Mike Johnson to the speakership.
