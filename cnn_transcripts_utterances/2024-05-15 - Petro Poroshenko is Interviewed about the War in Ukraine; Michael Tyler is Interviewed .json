Officials say about 8,000 people have now been evacuated from the area.Joining me now is Petro Poroshenko, former president of Ukraine. Sir, thank you so much for joining us. I know you're there near the front lines in Kharkiv. You had been certain that Ukraine could win the war. But with this loss of territory and with this barrage coming from Russia, do you still believe that Ukraine can win this war?",

The town is completely destroyed. Before the war it was almost 20,000 people live their. Now the finish, the evacuation of people from there. And I was in there (INAUDIBLE). I have a meeting with our soldiers. They are definitely need more air defense, more artillery, more electronic warfare system. And, unfortunately, the are delayed. In December 2023, the aid definitely has its consequences (ph) and Ukraine pay for that already with the life of our soldiers and the kilometers of our territory.

So, I think Donald Trump just said yes to President Biden's proposal. So, what now? MICHAEL TYLER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN 2024 CAMPAIGN: Yes, I mean, Donald Trump says a lot of things. We'll see if he actually shows up. What the president communicated this morning, and what this campaign is proposing, is that we have two debates, one in June and one in September. I think we're ready to go. The American people deserve to see both of these candidates argue their case on the merits well before people actually go and cast their ballots. We believe that when people see Joe Biden vs Donald Trump, there'll be able to see the very stark choice between the president, who's been fighting for the American people since the day he took office, and Donald Trump, who's campaign of revenge and retribution will be on full display for the American people to see and reject once again.

So, we should have a debate between the two candidates on the issues. Joe Biden will articulate his historic record of accomplishment, his vision for the future, and Donald Trump will go out here and try to explain why he's bragging about overturning Roe v.

She even began invite - was invited to the White House because of her activism on TikTok. But now she's up against the Biden administration over this new law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIERA SPANN, TIKTOK CREATOR SUING U.S. GOVERNMENT OVER POTENTIAL APP BAN: Thousands of people in our communities showing up in huge numbers. And because of that, we were able to change safety lights on my campus, create new safety initiatives for fraternities and sororities on my campus, introduce new Title Nine legislation into my state, starts survivor support groups, all of which never would have happened without an application like TikTok.

KIERA SPANN, TIKTOK CREATOR SUING U.S. GOVERNMENT OVER POTENTIAL APP BAN: Well, the first thing I want to say, thank you for having me on, is that this definitely isn't a condiment about TikTok potentially being sold. It's not a divestment bill. The authors of the bill have said multiple times that this is about TikTok being banned. They don't have enough time to potentially sell. And if they were to sell, the app just wouldn't be the same. There's something about TikTok that it is controlled by the people. It's one of the only applications where politicians aren't able to promote, that people control the algorithm. So, my community would be completely shifted. I've created a community of sexual assault survivors and domestic violence survivors on my page. It's something that can't be replicated on other - any other social media platform. And it would just be completely devastated if this app was changed. And so that's what I'm fighting for. I'm not fighting for myself, I'm fighting for that community that I've cultivated.",

TikTok has invested billions of dollars into Project Texas. All of our U.S. data is stored here in the United States. So, if it's an issue of data privacy, I would fully support an application that covered all social medias. But when it just targets one platform, it is not a concern enough for me that covers our free speech rights. When it's - it's taking away my free speech, it's taking away all of my followers and all of Americans' free speech rights to access information, to consume information, to share information freely, when it's just targeting TikTok, to me that is not enough of a concern when I'm more concerned about my data being sold on applications that has already proven that they have sold their data to foreign agencies in the past.",

And I mobilized tens of thousands of people to vote in the 2020 election. It was hugely important for both people that are currently in Congress and our current walking - sitting president. I mobilized people to vote for him. And I also currently use it to educate people. It's a hugely important platform for education. And then on my college campus there was a very brutal domestic violence incident and I used TikTok to bring awareness to that incident that was swept under the rug by my university. And in doing so, we were able to bring huge changes to my college community. Based on my TikTok video that you showed a minute ago, we changed IFC fraternity laws, and changes in Greek life.
