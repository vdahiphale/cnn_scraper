We do not expect that tone to change today when he does give these remarks.Now I'm told that he will speak for about 10 to 15 minutes. He'll give remarks in both English and Spanish, but he is not expected to take any questions today. You know the scene where we are, we're at Community College in Union City, New Jersey. This is where Senator Menendez grew up. And it's where he began his political career, the place he's choosing to make these first statements today. Now, this is the beginning of what will be consequential week. On Wednesday he and his wife and the three New Jersey businessmen who are all co-defendants in this case will appear in federal court in Manhattan where they will likely be arraigned on these charges. It will be their first appearance. But we will hear more from the Senator shortly and see what kind of tone he's going to set coming into this big week. John?",

And the government had a hard time connecting a quid pro quo with the benefits received with the favors that were extended. Here, it's not even a close question. You've got the government of Egypt involved. You can't say that's a close friend. You've got two situations where you have individuals that are under indictment by a federal grand jury, another one in a state case.These are people that he just happened to meet through his wife after he met his wife and was dating her. So the arguments here are completely different. The government is going to be able to show that he performed official acts in return for very specific benefits, which were the gold bars, the Mercedes Benz, cash, payments on mortgages, a whole series of things. And it just seems to me he's got no place to go with this but to resign from office. And he's known about this since June of last year, when the government executed a search warrant on his home.",

One of the members of the Congressional delegation from New Jersey, Andy Kim has announced his supported primary, Senator Menendez, which I think is significant, there may be more to come.But the Senate does tend to operate sort of like a boys club. And they don't -- they want to preserve this idea of innocent until proven guilty as is appropriate and not be seen as sort of forcing one of their colleagues out, especially because they did just that, in effect, with Al Franken, I think too much regret down the line. But the core ideas should be clear. A Democratic crook is as bad as a Republican crook. And you got to hold equal standards and principles above partisanship.

The Justice Department under a Democratic president going after a Democratic senator shows that justice is actually ultimately about equal justice under law. It doesn't ignore facts, regardless of party. And so that removes one of the Republican talking points.They'll try to muddy it and create moral equivalencies, but the moral equivalence between the senator whoever powerful, and the former president who tried to overturn an election is now the frontrunner to be re nominated. They're in two different ballparks, morally and practically. And so I think you got to keep in mind the difference in the responses.

But he is still pushing his conference to unite behind some kind of short term spending bill that would at least give them more time to negotiate on a full year spending package with the U.S. Senate. Here's what he told me about members who are holding out against that idea.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: Well, you have to keep the government open. I mean, if people want to close the government only makes a weaker. Why would they want to stop paying the troops or stop paying the border agents or the Coast Guard? I don't understand how that makes you stronger. I don't ever stand what point you're trying to make. We've got a border that's wide open today. We say it's getting worse each month under Joe Biden. We've got now border agents. You saw this morning being bloodied. Why would you want to stop paying those individuals? I couldn't understand somebody that would want to do that. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOX: Right now the plan from Republican leaders is to try to pass a series of individual one year long spending bills on the floor of the House that would fund agencies like the Department of Defense, State, Agriculture and Homeland Security. But those bills have no chance of passing in the United States Senate, which is why you have Republican leaders rallying their members to try to get behind a short term solution. But let's say they can't get behind that solution and that there isn't time to negotiate with the Senate. The Senate right now is trying to work its way through a standalone short term spending measure negotiated between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that they say could potentially avert a shutdown if McCarthy put it on the floor, but a lot has to play out, a lot has to happen. The Senate has to find an agreement, pass it out of the Senate, send it to the House Speaker and then he has to decide to put it on the floor. And the tricky part about that equation, of course, Sarah, is that putting anything on the floor that has Democratic support could imperil McCarthy's future as Speaker. Sara?",

As this Congress does seem to be headed toward a possible shutdown, you're colleague Chip Roy spoke of this group of five to six, seven, eight, maybe Republican holdouts on the rule. He said of them, I honestly don't know what to say to my fellow Republicans, other than you're going to eat a -- an S sandwich rhymes with rich, and you probably deserve to eat it. In this context, Congressman, what is the S sandwich? REP. BRUCE WESTERMAN (R-AK): Well, John, good to be with you this morning. And, you know, that sandwich is getting a bill from the Senate that tries to jam us to do a clean continuing resolution, but it's not just going to be clean, it's going to have a lot of other funding, tagged along to it. And you know, a continuing resolution just says we keep spending at the same level we spent last year and I don't know anybody in the Republican conference that wants to spend at the same levels, the Democrats put in place last year. Speaker McCarthy is the only one that's articulated a conservative path forward. And he's articulated many paths forward. We've got another one this week, where we've got these four big spending bills that should be on the floor. This would account for about 75 percent of the funding through the normal appropriation process. And another thing we can do is pass our own short term funding bill and focus on an issue that's a huge issue in our country right now and that's the southern border. And whether we do that through the Homeland Security Bill, or whether we do it through short term funding resolution, this is something that has to be addressed. You know, the Biden administration right now is planning to build migrant shelters on park service land in New York City. And they're waiving environmental laws to do that. They're waiving the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act so they can build these migrant centers. And it's got people in an outrage. Even New York Democrats have joined a lawsuit to stop the Biden administration for doing it. So I think we should be focusing on keeping the government open but closing the border, and we've got a pathway forward to make that happen.",

But if we don't keep working, if we don't address these issues, and we're going to lead opportunities, like closing the southern border, like addressing some of these outrageous spending tickets that the Democrats put in the spending bills last year, we're going to let that continue on.And I don't see how it helps a conservative cause. I'm all for being fiscally responsible for cutting the budget. But you've got to have a plan. And the plan can't just be we're going to shut down the government. It's got to be something that's proactive that gets results. And that's what we're all working for.
