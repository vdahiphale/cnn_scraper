The Hillsborough Bay right here in front of Tampa General Hospital, the region's only level one trauma center, we saw these waters go up five to six feet. It's the first time that it has actually reached the walls of the hospital. The Tampa Bay surging that much with Helene, and with Milton, we're expecting eight to 12 feet storm surge. This is extremely serious.I just spoke with the Sheriff of Hillsborough County, Chad Chronister. He is saying that this is the 11th hour to evacuate, calling on people in these evacuation zones, a, to please, please get out of here, to listen to directions. He also wants to inform people that there is another challenge in all this that might inhibit your ability to evacuate, and that is the wind speed. Once it reaches 40 miles per hour, that is when they start shutting down the bridges, the Sunshine Skyway, the Courtney Campbell, the Howard Frankland, these things shut down. That is also around the time that he and other law enforcement leaders will not send out their officers, their deputies. So, he says that he is fearful of the situation where someone chose not to evacuate, and then will be on the phone with 911, and no help will be coming, Rahel.",

Our generators, our boilers, our fuel are at 35 feet. Our power feed from the local power company is buried under the channel by 80 feet. We bring in supplies from a warehouse located in Central Tampa, about 300 pallets, about 10 semi-trucks full. But, that's all in place.Our hurricane teams are here.

That call taking place right now, according to Mr. Netanyahu office. Last week, Mr. Biden said that it would happen after Israel decides how to respond to Iran's unprecedented missile attack, although it's unclear if Israel's plans have been finalized. Iran is trying to rally support from its Arab neighbors to discuss efforts to stop what it caused Israel's aggression in Lebanon and Gaza. Iran's Foreign Minister is visiting Saudi Arabia today. Mr. Netanyahu, meantime, addressing the Lebanese people on Tuesday. He said that they need to, quote, \"stand up to Hezbollah, or else the country would be engulfed in a war\". That would mean the kind of destruction already seen in Gaza.New clashes are reported in southern Lebanon between Israeli forces and Hezbollah. And an Israeli Minister says that soldiers have occupied one village, sharing an image of IDF troops hoisting an Israeli flag. Hezbollah, meantime, is escalating attacks on northern Israel. Israel's national emergency service says that two people were killed by rocket fire today. Let's get more now and go to the region. We have Jeremy Diamond live for you in Tel Aviv, and Fred Pleitgen, who is in Tehran. Jeremy, let me start with you. What do we know about this phone call between Biden and Netanyahu?",

Israel, of course, has vowed to respond militarily. The question is, how big will they go, and what exactly will they strike? We know that the Israeli Prime Minister is considering a range of potential strikes, including strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The U.S. President has made clear that he does not want to see Israel carry out strikes on nuclear facilities, and he -- the U.S. also appears to be advising, again, strikes on Iranian oil facilities as well.This phone call will be aimed at trying to get these two partners on the same side. But, of course, whether or not that can actually be accomplished, is another matter altogether. The Israeli Prime Minister really has been thumbing his nose at U.S. advice for quite some time, going against what the U.S. would like to see, both publicly and privately. And so, whether or not they can get on the same page remains to be seen. But certainly, President Biden will be aiming in this call to rein in a potential Israeli response towards Iran, looking for something more proportional.

The director at Kamal Adwan Hospital pleading for some other kind of solution, saying that this is putting patients who are in intensive care there at severe risk. And as this is happening, we are also witnessing people who have been trapped in homes and buildings, as the fighting goes on around them, also accounts from some Palestinians who were fleeing yesterday, heeding those orders from the Israeli military and then being fired upon by what several people said was one of these Israeli military quadcopter drones firing on people who appeared to be trying to flee from northern Gaza and head for safety. And this just speaks to the horrific decisions that people are having to make, whether to take the risk and flee south, knowing that people have been fired upon, or whether to stay put and risk the bombardment and the tanks approaching in those areas. It really is a horrific choice that people are having to make, and one where it seems that there are no good options. If people do indeed make it out of northern Gaza, they are then going to this, what's been declared as a so-called humanitarian zone in western Gaza, in the Al Mawasi area. But, we know that that area is already overcrowded, under-resourced, and of course, the Israeli military has also conducted some strikes in those areas as well, saying that they will go after Hamas wherever they are.

But, the other reason why demand is so high is because of some of the people who are staying and they're filling up tanks to try to power their generators. So, at the last update at 09of those metro areas that are bracing for this hurricane. 59 percent of the gas stations in the Tampa, St Petersburg region don't have any gas, according to GasBuddy, 39 percent in Sarasota, around one in three in Fort Myers, Naples as well as Gainesville, and even in Orlando, this is a significant issue. Now, GasBuddy says that if you are looking for gas, you should be going to the major travel stops. You should be going to the large chains, because they're more likely to be supplied. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he did just address this earlier this morning during a press conference. He said that right now there is no fuel shortage, and he said that officials are doing everything they can to surge emergency fuel supplies. They're even using state troopers to escort these fuel tanker trucks to the gas stations that need it the most. Now, remember, all of this is happening before the storm even arrives. After the storm, we're, of course, going to be paying very close attention to the damage to the infrastructure, in particular, what happens to the Port of Tampa Bay, because that is a massive source of fuel into this region. It's really the -- it's -- almost half the fuel in all of Florida comes in through that port.

We have a lot of old trees dating back to our founding, and they haven't really been tested since Hurricane Irma. So, it's been seven years since we've had a really strong hurricane come through.

So, it's going to take a few days to return to some sense of normalcy. I know when Irma hit, myself, I was out of power for about five days. So, I think we're probably going to see something like that.As Governor DeSantis did say earlier today, they've staged quite a few linemen. It's quite incredible they've been able to amass that amount of people here just with Hurricane Helene recovery going on right now. So, I think you're going to see several days, maybe a couple of weeks, before we get to some sense of normalcy. But, we just want people to be patient. We're going to get through this. Things will come back to normal, and we'll move on. That's what we do here in Florida. We've been through this before, and we'll get through it.",

Milton's tropical storm force gusts have reached the Florida Keys and is forecast to make landfall overnight on Wednesday.And as thousands evacuate Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton, Vice President Kamala Harris is urging people across the southeast not to believe misinformation about federal hurricane response efforts. Here is part of her message on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: To all of those folks in North Carolina and Georgia, please know that FEMA and the people on the ground are there to help you. You are entitled to help. There is a lot of misinformation. And I beseech you. I beg you to please not pay attention to it, because there are a whole lot of folks who are there to give you help and aid in terms of the immediate aftermath and what people need to do in terms of getting through the height of this emergency and this crisis, but also in terms of long-term help.

Apple is talking about upgrading iPhones to iOS 18 if you're in the danger zone. People using an iPhone 14 or a later model will be able to send messages via satellite, and that's important if your area loses cellular or Wi-Fi access, because with a satellite connection, you can still send iMessage and SMS texts, emojis and reactions. Let's bring in CNN's Clare Duffy, who joins us from New York. So, Clare, explain to us a little bit about how this new feature could be really crucial right now as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.",

And so, it's really important that people are aware of this satellite messaging feature that could help them reach friends and family and emergency services. So, if you're in the path of the storm and you have an iPhone 14 or later, this should be part of your prep today for the storm. You should make sure that your iPhone is updated to iOS 18, and then when you go into your settings, you can actually do a demo of this satellite messaging feature so that you know how it works if and when you need to use it.To use it, you actually just hold your phone. You need to be outside with the view of the sky and the horizon, and you should know that it may take a little bit longer than usual for messages to go through, but they will go through. However, and this is a really important but, if you are in an actual emergency, a medical emergency, rather than using the regular satellite messaging feature on iPhone, you should use Emergency SOS, which still works via satellite, but it will also send emergency first responders the medical information you have saved in your iPhone and your emergency contact so that you should make sure that those things are updated as well, Rahel.",
