Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Today, we look at global developments that could impact the outcome of Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine and shape alliances from Europe to the Americas. We begin with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's lightning tour of western capitals. Over the weekend, he met first with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who promised Germany's biggest military support package so far. Almost $3 dollars-worth of weapons. Then, to France and President Emmanuel Macron, who announced plans to send dozens of light tanks and armored vehicles in the weeks ahead. Today, President Zelenskyy landed in England, meeting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Britain is already ahead of the curve, arming Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. Zelenskyy's tour comes at a critical time as countries like Brazil and Turkey, as well as China, look to assert themselves on the diplomatic scene. We'll have more on that in a moment, but first, Correspondent Matthew Chance is in London. Matthew, how come the Brits are so way ahead of the rest of, I guess, NATO in what they're giving Zelenskyy and what they're pledging?",

And they're certainly doing that. They provide these Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which is the longest-range weapon that Ukraine now has in its arsenal and could be a game changing munition on the battlefield. Today, there was a warm embrace between Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, Vladimir Zelenskyy of Ukraine, as well. As yet more weapons were pledged, we're talking about long-distance attack drones, air defense missiles, training for Ukrainian pilots as well. Because one of the things that President Zelenskyy wants, not just from Britain but from other European powers and the United States as well, are you know, fighter jets so they can really strike hard at Russian occupied areas of his country. Take a listen to what the two leaders have to say on that issue earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Turkey has not gone with western sanctions, in fact has increased, hugely, his trade with Russia.

So, overall, there's still this net positive effect. And the types of roles that are being displaced, on the one hand, were roles that for a long time were predicted as coming under displacement. But exactly to your point, it's now a set of high -- relatively high skills, middle income, middle class roles that are going to come under this type of new displacement. Now, when we speak to businesses that are actually integrating some of these technologies, they're finding that most of the time this is not about full displacement, this is about augmentation. So, the same person will continue to do some version of those tasks, but they will be integrating more technology and they will be expected to apply more creative thinking, more analytical thinking, more leadership, more social influence, more connecting with other people.

Some people in, for example, the health care sector, feel burned out or don't feel treated during the time that they were having to work under very high degrees of stress, and some people in service work who were potentially fully laid off during that time and now, has to come back are simply not interested in coming back in such a difficult environment. So, there is a set of people that have potentially ruled themselves out for some time, and that's leading to those talent shortages. There is a second element to those talent shortages, which is skills.

A second element is specific technical roles like people who are working in solar energy. A third element is somebody who is working in waste management and the circular economy.

So, the entire care sector will be in much higher demand than it was before. And on the other hand, if you look at the pipeline of, especially younger people, very few want to go into this sector because they've all just observed how that sector is generally underpaid, yet in high demand, is qualified as essential work, but not necessarily valued as such by society.

And there's interesting opportunities here because if you start looking at people with the sort of skills first mindset, it does create a lot more opportunity for those without college degrees who potentially come from lower income backgrounds, it creates more opportunity for women and for minorities, and that's starting to show up in some of the data.",

I think that's something employers will very seriously have to think about because they are not simply going to be able to go to the market and buy ready-made talents for what they are looking for. So, much more investment as responsible employers is one piece of this. I think governments truly thinking through -- you know, industrial policy is back and (INAUDIBLE) across most of the western world. But if governments expect to be serious about investing in the digital transition and investing in the green transition, they equally have to invest in the skills that are required to make that happen.

It's very clear already that they have to think about technological literacy, they have to think about leadership and social influence skills and they have to think about analytical and creativity skills, regardless of the subjects that they choose across what they do, which degrees they pick, which certificates they get, they have to have those three generalized skill sets.",
