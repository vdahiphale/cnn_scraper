I'm Pamela Brown in Washington.And we begin this hour with exclusive new video into CNN that will give you more perspective on the scope and the scale of the catastrophe in the Southeast and what people are dealing with right now in this very moment. You are looking at the ruins of Asheville, North Carolina, one of the cities that Helene hit the hardest. Take a look here. This is the River Arts District. Just more than a week ago, it was a vibrant, beautiful area until the storm did this. And here's a look inside one of the buildings there, just a -- just a complete -- just a disaster inside. There is barely any room to walk and nothing is left standing, as you see right here. And, outside, fallen trees are balancing on power lines. Right now, hundreds of thousands of customers are still without power access across the Southeast. We're going to keep it right here on CNN. Later in the hour, we're going to go live to Asheville to talk to the North Carolina National Guard and find out how troops are helping people across the state. And moments ago, we learned the death toll from the storm has risen to at least 200 people in six states. Right now, President Biden is about to arrive in Tallahassee. He will see the damage in that state firsthand. Let's bring in CNN's Arlette Saenz in Perry, Florida, near where Hurricane Helene made landfall a week ago.
