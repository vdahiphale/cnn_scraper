Today was the first time that the Israeli government sort of reformed their reforms in any way. This is something that I had been hearing from sources that was likely coming, that there was going to be some sort of softening of their reforms. And what they've announced today is regarding how judges are selected. And when you speak to people who support these judicial reforms, they say that's actually their number one issue is the fact of how the judges are selected. They point to places like the United States, where you know, the elected politicians; the president is the one who appoints the Supreme Court nominees. And that's how they essentially want to change that. And what they've done is a very small change; it still gives most of the power to the parties in power in the parliament in order to select the judges. But it reduces the number of their members on this committee that would select judges from having a vast majority to having just a one seat majority. And then the other concession, if you can call it that is announcing that the rest of these reforms, because these are dozens of reforms that are passed that they are trying to push through, they won't bring them up for further votes until after the Passover breaks that would give till the end of April. And the coalition is saying in the statement that they want to have conversations about this before they continue. So clearly, it seems as though the pressure at least is making a potentially a small difference. But the leaders of the protest movements and opposition leader Yair Lapid are essentially saying you know that's not enough. And some of them are even saying that these are just, you know, nice words. But ultimately, they still believe that the way these reforms are in even this concession is the protest leaders are even calling it a declaration of war on the Israeli people, Becky.",

It's also just a couple of days, remember, since Vladimir Putin was indicted at the International Criminal Court for war crimes. And so, the symbolic potency of this diplomatic visit has not been lost on anyone here in Russia or anyone internationally that's watching this, of course, very closely, not least in Ukraine, in the United States and in the West, in general. Look, I mean, they're going to be discussing a couple of issues. One of them is this issue of the Chinese diplomatic peace plan, that it's put out there last month, to resolve what it calls the crisis in Ukraine; it doesn't refer to it as a war, just like the Kremlin doesn't refer to it as a war. There are a couple of points whether it's 12 points in this plan. One of them is that the two parties Ukraine and Russia should sit down at the negotiating table to hammer out their differences. But it's stopped short of calling on Russia to, to withdraw from the territory in Ukraine, that it's conquered over the course of the past 12 months, at the very least. And for that reason, it's got a very lukewarm response in Ukraine and in the west at large. But Vladimir Putin, speaking sitting side by side with Xi Jinping of China earlier today said, you know that this was something that the Russians were looking carefully at, take a listen to what Putin had to say.

Now what that direction would be Ukraine and the president have been very, very consistent. They say that the starting point of any negotiations for peace would be Russia to depart from areas of Ukraine that it has taken over in this bloody war. And you don't see Putin doing that anytime soon, of course. So you have this situation that there's talk of peace, at least a consideration of the negotiations in public by both Putin and Xi Jinping. But really no prospect of that in the short term, I would say. Here in Ukraine, they've also said that they look at the attitude of China and Russia. And while they're not saying directly, they certainly believe that China is on the side of Russia, but they are open to talk should Xi Jinping I think contact Zelenskyy after these meetings, Becky.",

But really, this is a big crisis of confidence that really finished it off. All the pressures on the banking sector hit the weakest link and it buckles. And this takeover happened incredibly swiftly and the markets are still digesting. What this really means for various players, I think within this sector. First of all, what does it mean for Credit Suisse shareholders? Well, their shareholdings have been diminished. And of course, they weren't consulted at all. Think of Saudi National Bank and the Qatari Investment Authority who are some of the biggest shareholders of Credit Suisse you know, this is being sold essentially for 60 percent less than it was worth on the closing share price on Friday. And that's where we're seeing credit shares trade, currently roundabouts. Also, the bondholders of Credit Suisse, this was really interesting, highly controversial. Normally, shareholders rank below bondholders of all varieties when it comes to this situation. But shareholders are getting some return on this, but bondholders have 81 which is sort of convertible bond. They are having their holdings of those bonds just wiped out, they are worth absolutely nothing. That's around $17 billion worth. And I've just seen an e-mail from a law firm saying they're considering a lawsuit here and getting in touch with all of those bondholders. So, there's a lot to digest. Interestingly Becky, look at UBS shares right now, because they opened this morning sharply down as investors looked at this, but they are trading higher now. Whether that's on these lawsuits, whether that's just because in the long term, big picture with all of the comments from various central banks and regulators around the world, they feel this draws a line under it and makes UBS a stronger bank, perhaps. But I'm watching it carefully because I don't believe share prices are staying anywhere steady anytime soon, Becky.",
