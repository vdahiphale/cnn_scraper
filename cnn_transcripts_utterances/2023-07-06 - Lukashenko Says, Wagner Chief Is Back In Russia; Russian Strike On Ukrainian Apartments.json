This as Kremlin media airs stunning images of Russian police raiding his homes, seizing guns, passports, cash and wigs.In Ukraine, at least six people are dead after a Russian strike on an apartment building in the western city of Lviv, a relative safe haven, largely spared by the war so far. CNN is on the ground with new information. And also tonight, indicted Trump Aide Walt Nauta finally pleads not guilty to all charges. This hour, we'll be breaking down what it means for the special counsel's classified documents case against the former president.

Now, what has emerged in the aftermath is that because Lviv is so far from the frontlines, in a place where many people fled to during the early stages of the war, they discovered that ten bomb shelters had been locked shut and, therefore, at the moment of greatest need, the people could not actually find any shelter.

Do you think the U.S. should be giving cluster munitions to Ukraine? And how much of a boost could they offer to Ukraine during this counteroffensive?MAJ. GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, the short answer is, I think they should. I applaud the administration's decision. Look, DPICM, dual purpose improved conventional munitions, that's what we're talking about, really have the capability within a single bomb to disperse over a hundred bomblets, both anti-personnel and anti-armor-type capabilities. This is a weapon system that the Ukrainians can use to great effect now that the Russians have this incredible defensive position in Ukraine that they've built up over the course of the last few months. Conventional munitions cannot have that same effect. The DPICM, the cluster munitions, can. It's a good decision. But like anything else, look, there's no silver bullet. Ukrainians have to be able to conduct synchronized warfare and we're seeing right now that they don't have sufficient air support, which is absolutely essential, you got to have this three-dimensional fight, and it all has to be synchronized. So, it's a good thing. I think it's going to improve what Ukrainians can achieve, but they have to be able to continue to bring all this combat power together, be very cautious, very effective on the ground and then they can exploit.",

They are charged together, a co-defendant with the president, and their defense is being coordinated. In fact, his legal team is being paid for by the Trump political action committee. So, right now, Nauta and him and -- their fates are intertwined. He is charged, of course, as you know, with conspiracy to obstruct the government investigation as well as concealment of these documents. The question is, how much longer are their fates intertwined? I mean, at some point, do they separate, simply because, you know, Donald Trump's and Walt Nauta, you know, they are not the same person.

So, the government, if they use Nauta as a witness, would have to essentially rehabilitate him on the stand. The longer he plays that tangled game and curries favor with Trump and is represented by lawyers who are paid for by the Trump Organization, the more his value as a witness may be diminishing.

It will rub up against that. If you have another, say, indictment, and you have one in Manhattan already, a defendant can't very well prepare simultaneously and cannot do, say, a trial that ends on Friday and one that begins on Monday. They're aware of this. And we're, what, 480- something days away from the presidential election. Not a primary but the actual election day, they can't go that far.But here's a point of reference here. As we're talking about the idea of who might flip, remember, the DOJ doesn't necessarily need to have Walt Nauta flip. He was listed in the indictment, and there are others who are employee number, whatever it is, who may have already seen this, and the surveillance tapes do a lot of the talking already.

He was there for all of that and was often asked about it, frankly, and rarely, if ever, said anything negative about what Trump was saying and doing. That's going to be a real problem. But an answer to your question, yes, there absolutely still is a good chunk of the Republican Party that is still -- still wants to be a forceful foreign policy voice, and it's a real differentiator when you have frontrunners, like Ron DeSantis and others, trying to go the other way. This will be a dividing issue in this Republican primary.",

Well, it's a little surprising at first glance, right, because the Freedom Caucus has become this group that is dedicated to former President Donald Trump, and Marjorie Taylor Greene is perhaps one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters on Capitol Hill.But, Alex, in talking to my sources, I can tell you that there have been frustrations bubbling up inside the Freedom Caucus over Greene for sometime now, really what those frustrations boil down to is the fact that Greene has actually become a very staunch ally of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and she's also been publicly critical of many fellow colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus. She criticized members of the Freedom Caucus for not supporting Kevin McCarthy for speaker, she criticized members of the Freedom Caucus for not falling in line over the bipartisan debt ceiling deal. And the real straw that broke the camel's back, according to Congressman Andy Harris, a member of the Freedom Caucus was a heated camera station that Margaret Taylor Greene had with another member of the Freedom Caucus, Lauren Boebert on the House floor, just before the July 4th recess. And Greene confirmed to CNN that she called Lauren Boebert a little B- word, I'm not going to say the word, but you can fill in the blanks there. And Greene, again, did confirm she said that. So, we did reach out to Greene for comment. She would not comment on her status as a member, but she was pretty defiant in the statement. I want to read you part of it. She said in Congress, I serve northwestern Georgia first and served no group in Washington. My first -- my America First credentials guided by my Christian faith are forged in steel, seared into my character, and will never change. The GOP has less than 2 years to show America what a strong unified Republican-led Congress will do when President Trump wins the White House in 2024, and this is my focus, nothing else. And, Alex, we also reached out to the House Freedom Caucus for comment. They said they do not comment on membership or internal meetings or internal process, but this is a big deal. She is the first member to be removed from the Freedom Caucus, which means she can no longer attend meetings, and she can no longer call herself a member of the group, Alex.",

He is expected -- she is expected -- Yellen is expected to meet withChina's premier, the number two in the country who is Li Qiang. Now, that is just below and a close ally of the Chinese President Xi Jinping, who Secretary Janet Yellen is not expected to be meeting on this trip. But she's going to be talking with a lot of other people. Obviously, the economy is going to be the main focus, this coming on the heels of Secretary Blinken's trip where both countries said they made a lot of progress in stabilizing relations after a very fraught period of months. Remember, Blinken was actually supposed to go to Beijing and then there was the Chinese spy balloon that derailed that trip. Things really plunged and there were a lot of close calls including in the South China Sea and in the skies where planes and ships were coming dangerously close to each other. U.S. and China were at a security summit. They didn't talk, they just had a brief handshake, but now the exchanges are continuing. And the big topic they're going to be talking about on the economic side is this vigorous competition particularly in the area of chips, the semiconductors, the highly advanced technology that powers everything from our smart phones, to our cars, to our laptops. This week, China actually announced it's restricting exports of one of the two metals that are used to make most of the world's chips, gallium. And so China controls this raw material that's used in chips, and yet interestingly, Alex, here in Taiwan, they actually produce a majority of the world's semiconductors and you have the United States trying to strike deals with both to make sure the world's supply doesn't get interrupted for any reason.",
