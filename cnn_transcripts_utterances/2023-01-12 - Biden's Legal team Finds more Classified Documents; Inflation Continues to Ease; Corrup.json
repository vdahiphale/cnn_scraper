Plus, President Biden's legal team has discovered a second batch of classified documents. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. Republicans certainly have much to say.

The White House is making a deliberate decision not to get out in front of this matter and to allow this to leak through the press. I'll let MJ handle the reporting on why that is.But we know, of course, this is the second batch of documents that has been discovered. Previously we learned that they discovered ten classified documents in an office that they were cleaning out. That those documents included top secret information. And we've learned that those documents cover subjects like Iran, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. So, right now, we certainly have more questions than answers. We're asking, where were these found, how many documents, what did they contain. And the other big question hanging out there, is this it? So far they've been very careful not to definitively say that the first batch or now the second batch is all there is. The other big question, of course, is, what will Attorney General Merrick Garland do with this? He has, of course, tapped the U.S. attorney in Chicago to review we certainly know the first batch. It's unclear what is happening to the second batch, if that was part of this review.

That's the first decline from one month to another in the CPI since May 2020. When you look at the chart, you can clearly see those six months of slowing annual inflation growth. Now, 6.5 percent is still too high, you guys. The Fed still has a long way to go. It would like it to be more like 2 percent. So, there's still work to be done, but it looks like the worst of this national nightmare is behind us here. When you dig in the numbers, it is gas prices declining both month to month and year on year. You've probably seen that if you've been filling up at the gas station. But food prices still high here and shelter up 7.5 percent overall here. Egg prices up 59.9 percent. So, you're still seeing these higher prices at the grocery store for a variety of reasons. But overall inflation, everybody, a lot of economists, it looks like it has peaked here. Still some work to go. The Fed meets again in February. And the feeling is those days of 75 basis point interest rate hikes might be behind us. The Fed will continue to raise interest rates to cool this inflation, but maybe not by such big moves.",

They can't take off without it. It's in the federal regulations bible and verse. They must read the NOTAMs. It gives them all that information about the airport they're going to, also the airspace along their route.We are learned from multiple sources that this damaged database file caused the system to melt down on Tuesday evening. And the FAA first realized it then. They tried to reboot not only the main system but also the backup early on Wednesday morning when they thought it would have the least impact on air travel, but that ultimately failed, paralyzing airports across the country for about 90 minutes. A nationwide ground stop, we have not seen that since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. What's also interesting that we're learning from sources is that the FAA is not totally clear just yet on whether or not one person is behind this damaged database file, whether or not it was a particular entry into the NOTAM database system, whether or not it was one particular action even that caused this to meltdown. They simply unplugged it and plugged it back in, for lack of a better metaphor, and that just didn't work. I want you to kind of listen now to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The FAA fall under him. He's been very critical of the airlines' own meltdowns over the summer and this winter. This was not an airline problem. This was on the FAA. And there's been so much criticism about the FAA's own systems, whether or not they're outdated and whether or not they're underfunded.

Kevin McCarthy does not want to lose another seat and they might lose this seat if there's a special election. But you do have five members of his own party calling for him to resign. What -- which wins out, the party math here or a sense that this guy just can't survive?

Santos has not been charged with anything. While federal and state and local officials are investigating things, there are no indictments against him or anything like that. And so the -- I checked in with leadership this morning. The calculation there is, they can't force him to resign because then -- at this point because then they set the standard that every Republican lawmaker who somehow generates bad headlines or potential accusation, they'll have to take the same move. They want to see this play out a little bit more. They have told him to get a good lawyer. They have advertised him that he cannot talk his way out of this, as we reported this morning. Now, that being said, as you said, five members of his own party have already come out and said he should resign. And we expect more as -- if more allegations come out. Just this morning, \"The New York Times\" reported that there was an unregistered super PAC that funneled thousands of dollars of donations to his campaign that wasn't even registered with the Federal Election Commission.

It could go to Democrats short term, right? But long term, it could swing decisively towards Democrats, and it could put a stain on the entire delegation in a state, New York state, where arguably Republicans made some of their biggest gains. New York state gains accounted for about one-third of the overall gains that Republicans made in the last midterm elections. And what you see there is practically unified delegation saying - and at the local level as well, saying that this guy needs to go. And while Speaker McCarthy may not be able to force his resignation at this point, there's other levers that he could be pulling that he's not. For instance, censuring. We saw in the last Congress Paul Gosar, for instance, he's retired -- he's out of Congress now, but he was censured simply for putting up a cartoon that depicted him violently - or I think it was pointing a gun or killing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

They know that part of that process, it does not help you to start speaking out before you know everything, right?The situation here is different in that it appears that these documents were handled by aides, or mishandled if you will in this case potentially, by aides. So, Biden may not know if there's more out there. It sounds like they're doing a search. And so right now the best strategy may be just to allow his surrogates to point out the differences. Republicans certainly will be trying to liken this to the situation with Donald Trump, but it's up to the president's allies to point out that, number one, this is different because these were the aides who most likely were responsible for this, that they were turned over after they were discovered, whereas President Trump knowingly took these to his residence, took the documents to his residence, refused to turn them over, to the point where he was being accused of engaging in obstruction and federal agents had to issue a search warrant and the DOJ get involved. So, that will be up to the surrogates.",
