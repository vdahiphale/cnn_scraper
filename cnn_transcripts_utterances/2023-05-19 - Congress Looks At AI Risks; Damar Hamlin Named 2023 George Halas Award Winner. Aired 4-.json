He faced serious questions about how hisprogram and other major tech intelligence apps can pose a threat to humanity and possibly put us all out of work. Altman, however, did urge lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence, describing the technology`s current boom as potential printing press moment, as he described it, but it`s a moment that he says requires safeguards. Also in his remarks, the OpenAI CEO says the potential for AI to be used to manipulate voters and target disinformation are among his areas of greatest concern, especially because there`s going to be a presidential election next year. And he says these models are getting better. CNN`s Nick Watt has more for us from the hearing.

Given each year to the NFL player, coach, or staff member that overcame adversity to succeed, Hamlin was cleared to resume football activities last month after suffering cardiac arrest on the playing field in January.
