An enemy country invading Russian territory. 12 days ago, Ukraine's forces major cross-border incursion into the Kursk Oblast. They are still there and the fighting is fierce. We'll examine what is happening on both sides of the story with a former Ukrainian defense minister and a Russian journalist in exile. Also, how to appeal to America's heartland. Democrats are seen as the party of city slickers, while country folks support the GOP. But Democrats hope Tim Walz could reclaim some rural voters. Kansas journalist Sarah Smarsh tells me why she thinks it just might work. And this summer the world has witnessed storms wildfires, and some of the hottest days in modern history. Is catastrophic climate change inevitable? Activist and former presidential candidate, Tom Steyer, tells me he still has hope. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
