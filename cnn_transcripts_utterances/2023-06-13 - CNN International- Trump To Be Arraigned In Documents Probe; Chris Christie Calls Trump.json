Donald Trump is set to be arraigned in a Miami courtroom on federal criminal charges.Also, Russian missiles strike Central Ukraine overnight. The number of dead in the residential area is rising, and many are injured. Plus, K- Pop sensation BTS turns 10, and South Korea shows its appreciation with a show of lights. Just hours from now, former U.S. President Donald Trump will walk into a federal courtroom in Miami. He's facing 37 felony charges in relation to his handling of national defense documents after he left office. Mr. Trump maintains his innocence and calls his prosecution a witch hunt. It's possible we won't see him at all. Cameras aren't allowed in the courtroom, and he's expected to enter the building through an underground garage. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, security is tight. Police have officers keeping watch, along with the FBI and Homeland Security. That's in addition to Mr. Trump's Secret Service detail. Miami's police chief says his force is ready. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, they are expecting not only supporters, but a lot of protesters who are against the former president. So they are expecting very, very large crowds. So that's why there is quite a bit of concern, not only at the Miami Federal Courthouse, but even here at Doral.We have been inside Doral. We actually saw the former president twice yesterday when he first arrived here in the Miami area. He came in through the lobby. His son Eric was waiting for him. He greeted some supporters, just a small group waved to them and then disappeared with his legal team, presumably to strategize. But then later in the evening, he came back down to the lobby. We weren't sure if we would see him again, to have dinner at the main restaurant. He greeted supporters there. There was a small group as well. They were yelling to him, \"We're behind you. We support you. You're going to win\". And he gave them a thumbs up. And then once he was in the restaurant, he actually stopped and talked with some of the people who were in there, took photos, gave him more thumbs up, and then disappeared into the back room of the restaurant to have dinner with his lawyers and his son, Eric Trump. So it was an interesting evening ahead of this very, very important day, as you can imagine, for the former president. There were supporters inside, also supporters outside, but there were protesters out here, too, which really is why there is some concern. There was one man walking around in a prison jumpsuit carrying a ball and chain. Police had to separate some protesters from some supporters. At times, it was getting a little ugly between them. Of course, there's quite a bit of concern about possibly a call to action, as it's known. Basically, they want to make sure they can avoid another January 6, like the attack on the Capitol, the U.S. Capitol. So they just want to make sure that they are ready, prepared. They have everybody in place. Miami Police says they are prepared. Secret Service will have their eyes on the president. There will also be FBI, U.S. Marshal as well, just to make sure that the situation is under control. Max?",

Local officials say five civilian sites were hit, including a residential building, killing at least 11 people and wounding dozens more. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted this video to his telegram page. Kyiv, meanwhile, is claiming more gains in the south as fierce fighting continues both there and in the eastern Donetsk region. CNN's Sam Kiley joins me alive from Kyiv.

One of the war really, of targeting civilians, this time -- excuse me -- in the central Ukrainian city, a big industrial city with very important steel industry, water reserves, generating capabilities and so on. But it's a residential building that was targeted.Eleven dead, two dozen injured in yet another civilian catastrophe. This all going on whilst the Ukrainians, I think we could safely say now, are prosecuting a counteroffensive with significant increase in their attempts to break through the Russian lines in the south of the country between Zaporizhzhia and the city of Donetsk, the latter being Russian held. There have been reports of incremental advances into that area by Ukrainian troops using a lot of the equipment that they've been donated by NATO and inevitably some losses both of personnel and of that equipment. And at the same time, there is perhaps connected. But I think unconnected advance being conducted by the Ukrainian south of Bakhmut. I think that has been an opportunity where the Russians have been folding up in the face of Ukrainian counterattacks, in part of the ebb and flow of the fighting that's been going on there. But inevitably they will no doubt take advantage of that, the Ukrainians, and incorporate it into their planning for this wider offensive which I think now is underway. We're not seeing the full onslaught yet. There's a lot of Ukrainian reserves, a lot of NATO type weapons still yet to be thrown into the fray. But they also say that this privately is going to be a long and bloody campaign and they do anticipate very significant casualties on both sides, Max.",

But, of course, there was also that third incident, a man found dead in the street in another location just over a mile away. So these three separate incidences have now been linked by the Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Police, who has described this as a tragic and horrific incident, but has, of course, confirmed that no motive has been established that just yet. And this will be the key focus for investigators. We do know there is a large cordon line that has been set up across these areas. Forensic police have been deployed to some of these areas as well, and police are appealing for eyewitness accounts as well as any CCTV footage available.

A state funeral for the billionaire and media tycoon will be held in Milan tomorrow. Berlusconi died in hospital on Monday at the age of 86. A national day of mourning has been declared for Wednesday and flags are being flown at half-staff on institutional buildings across the country. Berlusconi's body is at his villa outside Milan, where mourners have been paying tributes to the man who dominated Italian politics for more than 20 years. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us live from Rome. I mean, it's a national event, it's a state event, isn't it? Whatever you thought of the man as a politician and businessman?",

It's going to be broadcast live on all Italian television stations who choose to broadcast it.And as you said, tomorrow is going to be an official day of mourning. We expect many of the best and the beautiful of Italy to attend that funeral, that funeral ceremony. And we understand, as far as guests from abroad, the only head of state we're aware of is Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary. This funeral seems to be organized in a fairly rushed manner, given that he died on Monday and he will be buried on Wednesday. But nonetheless, it is going to be an important event. And different Italians are looking at his death and his legacy in different ways. Here we have El Mensajero,, a Roman newspaper which says, Il Sogno Italiano, the Italian Dream. And for many Italians, he was the Italian dream. He was -- he came from modest circumstances. He became the richest man in Italy at one point, Prime Minister for four different times. He dominated Italian politics for two decades. And also part of the Italian dream, he successfully evaded the onerous taxes by and large, with the exception of one conviction back in 2013. Four years, he was sentenced but ended serving four hours of weekly community service instead because of his advanced age. Other Italians not such a bright view of Mr. Berlusconi's legacy. Here we have Il Fatto Quotidiano saying Banana Republic suggesting that Berlusconi able to evade the law so many times, sex scandals and whatnot somehow managed to debase the position of prime minister of Italy. He left after two decades in the public view as prime minister, as I said, four different times. The economy during that time shrank. Italy's debt skyrocketed. The Italian economy, some might say, still hasn't recovered from the Berlusconi era. Max?",

In just a few hours, he'll appear in a federal courthouse in Miami, Florida, where he is expected to be taken into custody and placed under arrest.Mr. Trump will then have the charges read to him and is expected to plead not guilty to all of them. Trump is campaigning to regain the U.S. presidency in November 2024, the general election. And it's unclear whether this case will go to trial before then. He's currently the front runner for the Republican nomination, at least. Trump's court appearance will be unprecedented as he is the first former U.S. president to face federal charges in the history of the country. For more on the legal process, let's bring in CNN's Katelyn Polantz, who is outside the federal courthouse in Miami, Florida. Thanks for joining us, Katelyn. We were trying to get cameras in the court, weren't we? But that wasn't possible. So just talk us through what we would have seen. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Max, unfortunately, it won't be possible, and it never is possible in federal court. You just are not allowed to have video or camera there. So here we have sketch room -- sketch artists who go into a courtroom and illustrate what they're seeing, what the courtroom looks like, what the judge looks like, what the defense and prosecutors look like. And in this courtroom, it's going to be a fairly big courtroom. It's a pretty solemn courtroom. All courtrooms are, and all of these folks are going to be clustering inside what's called the well. And then there will be a section where the public can be watching, and members of the press will also be able to be there watching this proceeding. Now, Max, this could be a very short proceeding today. It is before what's called a magistrate judge. So a judge that essentially handles some procedural things, a ministerial role, where the defendants come in, they are formally presented with their charges. They enter their initial pleadings, which we do fully expect to be not guilty at this time. And then they're given some rules, essentially, that's something that we're not exactly sure how that's going to play out. Is the Justice Department going to ask for certain things that Donald Trump must do, that his codefendant must do as they await trial? Do they have to turn over passports so they can't travel out of the country? Other things like that. Can they talk to potential witnesses in this case? We don't know if that's going to be the case, how that will work, and then they go on their way. There is the formality of the arrest around this court proceeding today. So both of these men, Donald Trump and his codefendant Walt Nauta, they will be processed into the federal system so that the court is aware of them as criminal defendants, that they are under arrest. But then that after this proceeding, we fully expect them to be released on what's called personal recognizance. So they wouldn't have to put any money up for their bond very likely. That is typically how cases like this go. And then we're off. Then we watch the court case on paper, in the docket, notes from the judge's announcements, waiting to see what comes next, what the timing will be, when a trial will take place, and then what sort of arguments both sides will be making about what's going to be allowed at that trial, both the law and evidence. What evidence may be able to be presented and remain part of the Justice Department's case. Max?",
