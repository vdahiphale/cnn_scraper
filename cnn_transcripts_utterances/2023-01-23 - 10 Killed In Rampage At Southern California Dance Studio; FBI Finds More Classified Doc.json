Police have identified the gunman as 72-year-old Huu Can Tran. He was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound as officers closed in on his vehicle following a massive manhunt.And this morning, we are hearing from one of the heroes that helped to stop the carnage. A 26-year-old man who subdued and disarmed the gunman at a second location is speaking out for the very first time. Natasha Chen joins me now live with this hero's riveting account.

And then he described feeling as if he might die in that moment. And he said he got up the courage to act. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'll shoot. Get away. Go. And at this point, I thought he would run away, but he was just standing there contemplating whether to fight or to run away. I really thought I would have to shoot him if he came at me. This is when he turned around and walked out the door, dropped back to his van. I immediately called police with the gun still in my hand.

You know, Don when I heard that interview, he said, when I overcame or when I got the courage to do, it wasn't the courage, it was his natural instinct that there was a threat in front of him, and he addressed the threat.You know, for a long time, DHS other law enforcement entities have been promoting run hide fight, right? We've heard this a thousand times. We've talked about it on this program numerous times as well. That has been a great program to raise awareness of what to do, you know, when faced with a hostile intruder, an active shooter situation. But like any program, it needs to evolve. You know, critics of run hide fight have actually focused in on the fact that it really aligns to linear thinking. And what we saw here with this hero was breaking free from that linear thinking and using the instincts to, you know, address that threat and mitigate it. Again, he is a hero. He prevented, you know, numerous other, you know, tragic events from happening. But, again, we think we have to think about applying this to improving how we think about active shooter situations in the future.",

The second thing, which I still can't wrap my mind around is, you know, Jonathan and I were both former federal agents. We went through training academies and agents are trained repetition, repetition, repetition, constantly preparing for the unfortunate event where you might find yourself staring down the barrel of a gun or, you know, faced with some kind of violence.You're constantly going through the motions mentally, how will I act in any type of situation where I find myself in danger. But this was a civilian. This was a person who had no law enforcement experience, yet it was his bravery that kicked in quickly, trying to subdue that gunman. And, you know, there's something called tunnel vision that happens. Anyone who's ever interviewed a victim of a crime, particularly gun crime, you laser in on the threat that's in front of you, and hearing the retelling of that young man's story, that's what he did. He saw the gun. He knew he was laser focused. He had to get that gun away from that individual. He did so to danger, to himself. He even talked about the bruises, the suspect, you know, beating him on the head. Yet he knew that there was a threat that had to be mitigated. And he certainly did it in just an incredibly, incredibly heroic way.",

You know, we saw, you know, senior leadership briefing the public, trying to reassure them that the community was safe. We saw patrol acting very quickly on identified items of evidentiary value, specifically the white van. We saw the tactical units deploying the appropriate level of tactics to mitigate that white van and try to stop that threat from continuing.So when you think about the arch of this investigation, we really saw law enforcement at its finest and bringing a peaceful resolution to a really, really tragic event.",

And obviously, you look at the two crime scenes here, this one obviously resulted in a massive loss of life here.But over at the second location in Alhambra, they were both dance studios. And so he was certainly trying to inflict some kind of, you know, pain on patrons at these locations. But, again, we might never know exactly what was going through his mind. We know that police are executing search warrants, trying to gather information from his residence, you know, were there any notes left behind? Were there any forms of communication talking to people that he knew that were in his orbit to try to determine, did he, you know, talk about wanting to, you know, do this type of thing or to hurt other people? That's all the information that they would be gathering to include from the vehicle itself. Again, every piece of evidence is going to be important. They can't interview the suspect, obviously, because he is deceased, makes their job a lot harder.

He has been such a powerful force inside this White House, it's hard to overstate what a role he has had on every facet of West Wing deliberations, from decisions small to big political decisions to policy decisions so often when you talk to people inside the White House, around the White House, you ask them, well, who has been taking point on XYZ issues?And so often they will answer with just one word, and that is Ron. Now, the person who is going to be taking over for Ron Klain, as you said, is Jeff Zients. He, of course, serves as the COVID coordinator for President Biden and he is seen as an implementations guy, an operational guy with less sort of political experience and certainly not a part of that very small, very tight circle of advisers that Ron Klain has been a part of. But what we are told is that the skills that Jeff Zients would bring to the table were seen as being critical for this next stage of the Biden White House, including implementing some of the legislation that got passed during the first two years that Biden has been in office. Now, of course, I don't have to tell you that this comes at a very pivotal moment for President Biden politically as well. We are expecting a 2024 decision in the coming weeks. And of course, the whole issue of the classified documents that is really ramping up as well. So there's going to be a whole lot on Jeff Zients' plate whenever he takes over in the next couple of weeks.",

Jeff Zients is the man who came in and essentially fixed that website. Since then, he's been known as Mr. Fixit inside the Obama administration and earlier in the Biden administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. So that is what his role is. He's a managerial expert. He oversees processes. He keeps the trains rolling. He's a leader. The one thing he does not have is political experience. And talking to a variety of a former White House Chiefs of Staff over the weekend, he probably has less political experience than virtually anyone in the modern era, but that could be seen as a good thing as well heading into the new Republican Congress where relationships, old relationships may actually not be that helpful. So when he comes in, likely next month, he is going to oversee processes and that is what his strength is actually.",

So we don't know exactly where this is going. But, Kate, I was so struck by that interview with Dana over the weekend from Senator Durbin as well as from Senator Manchin. And they are allies of this president. They were quite blunt in their description and characterization of how serious this could be.So we don't know exactly where this is going from here. We do know that it has certainly undercut the President's really central argument that he has the competence and the adulthood, if you will, to govern. That was one of the things he drew a distinction with himself and the Trump administration. So of course there are tons of differences, but right now it's not the differences that are the most important thing. The Biden administration is clearly trying to move this forward and move this quickly to not have it hang over them.

I want to look ahead to 2024 with you because I wanted to get your take on Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego. He just announced this morning that he is going to be running for Senate.

Would they support an incumbent Senator or would they support a Democratic member of Congress who certainly has the support of the left here. So what he is doing is going, you know, front end center into this race, jumping in right now at the beginning of 2023 to start raising money and to start owning this race for himself but without question, the Arizona Senate race is something we'll be talking about until election day on 2024 I can promise you that.",
