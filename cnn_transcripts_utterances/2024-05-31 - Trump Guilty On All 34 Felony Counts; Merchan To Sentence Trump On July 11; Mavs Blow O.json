They feel even more energized about trying to go out and do whatever they can to get other Republicans to see things their way.I think the concern though here, if I'm just putting on my strategist hat and looking from a 10,000-foot view, what do you do with some of the Nikki Haley Republicans? What do you do with some swing voters who lean to the right? We call them swing voters, but they sort of act like partisans in terms of their voter profile. What is the message to them? And I've spoken with some folks on the campaign and my advice to them was you guys, the base is energized. Yeah, they're going to be more energized, but this is still an election that's going to be won by the margins. And so, electorally and mathematically, you still have to figure out a way, Kasie, to make some appeals to those Nikki Haley voters.

That he has set -- has tried to and will continue to try to take away our rights and freedoms.

Dallas fans have been waiting for this moment for 13 years since Dirk Nowitzki led the Mavs to the first and only championship that the team has ever had. Luka Doncic assumed that mantel and now he's heading to the Finals for the first time. The Slovenian superstar delivering a knockout performance in last night's game five in Minneapolis. He dropped 20 in the first quarter, singlehandedly outscoring the entire Timberwolves team in the period. The 25-year-old hit four threes, including one from the logo at center court, to put an exclamation point on the 12-0 Dallas run. Luka ending up with 36 for the game. He is tied this postseason with Kyrie Irving, also scoring 36 for the Mavs in the 124-103 win. Doncic was named the Western Conference Finals MVP. And afterwards, he told the \"INSIDE THE NBA\" crew that the job isn't done yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then she landed the drink twice more before managing to hit the green with her chip shot and two putting for a 10. So, Korda ending the day carting an 80. She's near the bottom of the leaderboard, 12 shots off the lead. But she said afterwards -- hey, she's human. She just had a bad day. Hashtag relatable for every other golfer on the planet who has had that kind of day on the golf course.
