She was then discovered at the base two weeks later.CNN's Camila Bernal is at Camp Pendleton - outside of Camp Pendleton. She's joining us now.

But we do know that the 14-year-old girl was actually found at the barracks here on base. And then after we do know that a Marine was taken into custody for questioning.This all happened on June 28th. And that's according to a statement from the Marine Corps. I want to read part of that statement. Here's what they're saying. This command takes matters and the allegations very seriously. The incident is under investigation, and we will continue to operate with NCIS and appropriate authorities. Now, NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and we reached out to them as well. They declined to comment out of respect for the investigative process here. But the San Diego County Sheriff's Department did give a timeline as to exactly how these dates played out. They said that the girl's grandma reported her missing on June 13th. She talked to deputies that day but told them that she had actually ran away from home on June 9th. And so they put her name on multiple databases for missing persons. And it wasn't until the 28th of June that military police actually found the girl here on base. Detectives interviewed her. We know they offered services. And she was reunited with her grandmother. But, unfortunately, they're not answer a lot of the questions that we have. So, we will have to wait for this NCIS investigation to really get more details here because so far we're just left with a lot of questions, Kate.",

Police say a fight broke out there Sunday among partygoers and at some point shots were fired. Two victims were 28 and 32 years old. Police say the other five are expected to recover. They have not yet made any arrests in that case.Also there is now a $10,000 reward for information about this man, an escaped inmate who police say is very dangerous. Officials say Michael Charles Burham used tied up bed sheets to descend from the roof of the Warren County Prison. He is also a survivalist and state troopers say they found small stockpiles in the wooded areas near the prison they believe are associated with him. Burham was being held on arson and burglary charges and he's also the prime suspect in a murder investigation. All right, it's a wrap.

      "sentences": "Well, yes, they just - they're just coming back. And, remember, they go back on recess for the month of August. So there just simply is not much time.Now, very few legislative days between now and October 1st in order to get a deal to avert a shutdown. And it's not just disagreements between Republicans and Democrats. It's also disagreements among Republicans themselves, particularly House Republicans and Senate Republicans. Recall that as part of the deal to raise the national debt limit to avert the first ever debt default, a deal that was reached between the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy and the White House, they agreed to an overall spending cap, an overall spending level for the entire federal government that represented actually a cut. That was an agreement that was signed into law. But after that was cut, Speaker McCarthy actually backed off that agreement amid a rebellion among a handful of hard right members who wanted spending cuts to go even further. So, as a result, Speaker McCarthy came back and said they're going to try to move legislation to fund the government for even deeper cuts in the coming fiscal years. That has caused a lot of concern, particularly among Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats worried about the cuts, not just to domestic programs, but Republicans in the Senate concerned about the impacts on defense programs as well. So, the House Republicans are moving on one track, Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats moving on another track, all trying to get an agreement, get this signed into law to avert a shutdown by October 1st. So just a lot of questions, Sara, about whether or not they can get there. Congress, once again, headed for a messy fiscal clash to avoid yet another government shutdown this fall.",

      "sentences": "Well, the speaker of the House himself, Kevin McCarthy, floated that idea, threatened the possibility of moving forward in the impeachment inquiry against Merrick Garland, the attorney general, in the aftermath of allegation from that IRS whistleblower who said that the Justice Department improperly interfered in the investigation of the ultimate plea agreement that resulted between Hunter Biden, the president's son, and the Justice Department.Now, Merrick Garland has denied any improper interference, as has the U.S. attorney from Delaware in that case, someone who was appointed by Donald Trump and held over into the Biden administration. But nevertheless, the allegations from the whistleblower is essentially expected to form the basis of a potential impeachment inquiry against Merrick Garland. It is still uncertain, Sara, whether they will actually go that far. There's going to be a lot of pressure on the speaker to support an actual impeachment of Merrick Garland, but that would be a very rare occurrence. Only once ever in American history has a cabinet official been impeached, charged with high crimes or misdemeanors. And that happened in the mid-1800s when the secretary of war was - that happened to him back the, William Belknap. Will that happen again with Merrick Garland, the first -- second time ever in history, still a major question, but one that the speaker will have to confront in the weeks ahead. Sara.",
