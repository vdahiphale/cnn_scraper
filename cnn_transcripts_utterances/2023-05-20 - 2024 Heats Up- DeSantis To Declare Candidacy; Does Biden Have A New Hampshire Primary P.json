This coming week Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will file paperwork formally declaring his candidacy to challenge former President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination. He follows South Carolina Senator Tim Scott who filed on Friday and Chris Christie is said to be on the verge. This is in addition to already declared challengers Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson and Vivek Ramaswamy.Former Vice President Mike Pence has said he'll decide before June meanwhile, names being floated for a so called Unity ticket. The idea from the bipartisan political group No Labels include Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Larry Hogan, the former Maryland Governor. Trump's biggest obstacle still seems to be his own legal entanglements among them his recent seemingly self-incriminating remarks here on CNN regarding Jack Smith's case about the withheld Mar-a-Lago documents and the investigation into interference in the 2020 election by Fulton County, Georgia Da Fani Willis, who recently signaled that a decision from her could be coming in early August So into this fray finally steps Ron DeSantis. Joining me now to discuss is Gary find out he writes for Florida Playbook for Politico previously worked in the Tallahassee Bureau of the Associated Press. Gary, nice to see you again. So DeSantis is dug in on this Disney issue. And I find it interesting that your reporting suggests that issue started, the feud that started was not initially a priority for him, please explain that. GARY FINEOUT, REPORTER, POLITICO/AUTHOR, FLORIDA PLAYBOOK: Yes, basically, what happened was the legislation that sort of sparked this entire battle, actually was came from the Florida House, there were Republicans in the House who decided to pursue it. And then basically what happened very early on, I would say that very early on, is he got questioned about it. And he defended it. And he suddenly then became the face of the legislation. And he defended it very vociferously. And, you know, basically said, you know, he was in favor of the legislation, and he supported it. And so sort of, then when everything began to the ramping up of the opposition, including Disney's sort of talking about it, he stuck up, he stood up and, you know, then it became sort of a central to his identity. And he has become the lead protagonist in this drama.",

So we've seen this kind of go a few rounds now Disney sued. Now they say they've pulled off out of this project in Florida, although the financial conditions should just that, you know, there was a lot of questions about where they were going to go forward that anyway.

For 50 years the nomination process has started in Iowa and New Hampshire. This year, the DNC voted to adopt a schedule suggested by President Biden making South Carolina the first contest on February 3rd, and moving New Hampshire to February 6th, the same day as Nevada, the idea being to better reflect the demographics of the national electorate and presumably to give President Biden an advantage.So far, New Hampshire hasn't agreed and is insisting on going first. In fact, their state law requires that they go seven days before any other primary. Remember now in 2020, Biden lost both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. In New Hampshire, he finished a distant fifth, and his candidacy looked dead on arrival for a while. Then house whip Jim Clyburn endorsed Biden before the South Carolina vote, which he then won, and several moderate candidates dropped out threw their support behind Biden. That's how we won the nomination. This week when CNN Chris Wallace asked Jim Clyburn, if the move was stacking the deck for Biden, Clyburn said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC): I don't think you're stacking the deck, I think you avoiding embarrassment. And that is what he is attempting to avoid here. And I would expect anybody to do the same.

But if you do lose, first of all, the odds of Biden losing the Iowa caucuses, which is currently scheduled to go forth, is greater than zero, because the Iowa folks are not the Democrats are not thrilled about it.Now, this was a case because they couldn't count the votes back in the 2020 Democratic Iowa caucus. I think there was a broad consensus that Iowa should not go first. But I think New Hampshire Democrats feel like they're being unfairly punished for that. But their primary ran without a hitch back in 2020. And so it's like, wait a second, why are we getting shoved back to fourth place? We're behind South Carolina, and they strongly suspect with good reason that this is mostly about they're being punished for not having voted for Joe Biden.

The popularity of working from home doesn't appear to be going away and about a third of U.S. workers with jobs that can be done remotely continue to do so full time while 41 percent of workers have settled into a hybrid schedule. Plus, the number of companies that require employees to be in the office full time it dropped from 49 percent in February, to just 42 percent in May.Elon Musk calls working from home BS morally wrong and accuses the quote laptop class of living in la-la land. As Bloomberg reported, perhaps an accidental side effect to working from home gives employees too much time to indulge with daytime drug and drinking habits now on the rise.

SUZY WELCH, NYU STERN PROFESSOR &amp; SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE BRUNSWICK GROUP: Oh, fun employment is a term that Gen Z uses to describe the period between jobs. And the first time I heard it, I was teaching. And a student said, well, I don't have anything quite yet. Until then I'll just do some fun employment. And I literally screamed. I said what, what, what, what did you just say? Did you say fun employment? Because I think like you come from a generation where unemployment was never fun. We never put those two words together. But times have really changed and the whole contract between the worker and the company that they were first changed, and my students and many people from Gen Z, not all of them, of course, believe that unemployment doesn't have to be dismal and dreary and scary and bad. But when you're not working, you can actually be living and you can be having fun, and you can be enjoying it and they've got all sorts of great ideas for fun employment.

I have people say just one day a week, that's enough for them. And so I think they also look at their parents and say, what did all that hard work get them? I don't want that life. They want to opt out. Now, the complicating factor is that some of them still want to be corporate Titans. They want to be on the cover of magazines. They want to and touchingly really honestly, they -- a lot of them want to give money away. And so they want to make money, no really to give away some or most of it.

Students required to work after school or take care of their loved ones like older relatives or younger siblings may give them a disadvantage to finishing their homework on time.

It's about making sure that when we tell students where they are in their learning we are telling them accurately and without regard to their circumstances outside of the school.",

That's a slogan that originated in the U.K. It refers to refraining from mowing one's lawn for the entire month of May.The theory propounded by environmentalists and conversationalist -- conservationists is to allow weeds to grow and flower which helps feed pollinators during a period when little else is in bloom. Detractors, they feel it makes a neighborhood look unkempt. Well, on May 3rd the mayor of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Kahlil Seren, actually issued an executive order on the topic. It read in part, throughout the month of May, except in the case of clear health or safety concern, enforcement activities related to violations for tall grass will be suspended. Joining me now is the Cleveland Heights' mayor Kahlil Seren. Mayor, explain it to me. What's the purpose? What are we trying to do here?",

We are looking to provide a little bit of room for plants that flower, that provide pollen for the pollinators, you know, to grow a little bit before we cut them down in the early season.

And so, we've -- say, for instance, on the medians, on divided roads, we have thus far mowed a perimeter strip for visibility on our medians in order to provide a bit more visibility to drivers as the grass and the other plants on the medians grow taller.But we're taking a look at those medians and seeing where it's simply tall grass and where we have got natural flowers blooming when otherwise they wouldn't, so that we can sort of adjust course on the fly as we go. This is sort of a test case to see what comes up out of the ground if we don't just strictly mow. And if you drive through Cleveland Heights right now, you'll see a wide variety of pristinely manicured lawns. Some other yards that are native planting, you know, gardening, you know, extravaganzas, and others that are just trying this for the first time. And in that case, it's probably a little less structured than the people who really know their native plantings. But you'll see a wide variety of yards in the city.",

What do we have? Waste water, fertilizer, mower costs, gas, pollution, all to watch it grow, mow it and put it in plastic bags and take it to the landfill. What a waste of resources, time and money.
