Welcome to the very last edition of EARLY START. After more than 12 years here on CNN, we'll have more on what's next for us at the conclusion of this hour. So stick around. It is 05:00 a.m. here in Washington where the Biden administration is set to announce what they're calling a major new round of sanctions on Russia today. The sanctions in response to these sudden death in Russian custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and after two years of war in Ukraine. Officials say the sanctions will hit more than 500 targets, including President Vladimir Putin, himself. That's according to President Biden who met with Navalny's wife and daughter in California. He's out there on a fundraising swing. The White House said Biden expressed admiration for, quote, Navalny's extraordinary courage and his legacy of fighting for a free and democratic Russia. Navalny's mother is in Siberia. That's where her son died. She said she was allowed to see his body in a morgue there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYUDMILA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S MOTHER (through translator): They blackmail me and set conditions for where when, and how Alexei should be buried in Russia. And they want it done secretly without saying goodbye. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was quite interesting because president of Russia, Vladimir Putin yesterday he spoke to sort of his personal reporter that he always has with him when he travels around them, when he's in the Kremlin as well.And he once again reiterated that for him, he would rather have another term for President Biden than have President Trump return -- or former President Trump returned back to the White House. He did say that he considered those remarks that President Biden made about Vladimir Putin that he considered those to be rude though, the Kremlin echoing that as well. But right now, as far as sanctions are concerned, the Russian certainly have said in the past that they believe that sanctions aren't going to further derail the Russian economy, aren't going to derail Russia's war in Ukraine, also so far aren't derailing Russian arms production either. Right now, Vladimir Putin certainly fields that he is in quite a strong position. At the same time, you do have Russian authorities lashing out at the U.S., lashing out at the White House. This in the form of the Russian foreign minister. I want to listen to into some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  This hysteria about Navalny's death has convincingly shown this, that the United States position themselves as a prosecutor, a judge, and an executioner all in one. I did not even want to comment in detail. These people have no right to meddle into our internal affairs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, trails front runner Donald Trump by double digits in most polls there. But Haley has remained defiant.

If I did, I would've been out by now. But if Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election.

      "sentences": "Good morning and hello from Myrtle Beach.The one word I would use to describe Nikki Haley's campaign right now, it's the same word that you used in your intro. It's defiant. Haley gave a splashy speech in South Carolina this week explaining that she's not dropping out of the race. She hasn't won a state. She can't say where she would. But she insists it's important to give voters a choice, especially when some few have actually gone to the polls. And I hear that from a lot of voters at her events. I was with her in Georgetown, South Carolina, yesterday and then here in Myrtle Beach. After stepping very carefully when it comes to Trump over much of the last year, she's now really laying into him, making a sharper case against him. She's calling him out for making fun of her husband's absence from the campaign trail. He is, of course, deployed. She's calling him unhinged. It's all more personal now. And for voters who come out to see her, they are tired of Trump. They are looking for somebody else. They are looking for someone that they think that they see as maybe trying to bring people together, unify voters as opposed to divide them. And they really do see that in her. But, of course, as you said, down about, you know, 30 points to Trump here in her home state. It's sort of forced her to campaign as if she's an outsider, even though she's from here.",

One of the things that is going to be central in the general election trend is early voting, which has really bedeviled Republicans, especially with the way that the former president has talked about this. I want to show you two things. First, what Lara Trump, who is, of course, Trump's daughter-in-law and is set to become part of the RNC, had to say yesterday about the imperative that Republicans vote early, and you're also going to see here how Donald Trump frames this. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be. The votes -- it mean, it has to be. LARA TRUMP, TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:  If we want to compete with the Democrats we cannot wait until Election Day.

How much damage is the former president going to do to his general election prospects if he keeps saying what we saw him say in that clip? BIDGOODMeanwhile, Democrats have had a unified message encouraging their voters to get to the polls early. And what we've seen time and time again in 2018, 2020, the 2022 midterms is Democrats running up a pretty big advantage in early voting while Republicans wait until the day of. And then, of course, on the day off, you know, things can get go awry. Someone can get busy an emergency can come up and they don't make it to the polls. This is something that we know really, really worries a lot of Republican officials at the national level, at the state level and that's why you hear Lara Trump making this case.",

But the negotiations are stuck on the number of Palestinian prisoners to release and how to determine that list. [05:15:05] Meanwhile, Israeli president, excuse me, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, revealing his post-war plan for Gaza. He stresses in a document obtained by CNN that reconstruction will only be possible once the Gaza Strip has been completely demilitarized. Let's bring in CNN's Max Foster for more on this. Max, good morning. Always good to see you. So, looming over this, of course, is the Israeli set to invade Rafah if there is no hostages deal by Ramadan. That's around March 10th.

We know that Egypt is there. They'd be speaking to Hamas. There's just this sense of momentum behind these talks, pressure behind these talks and certainly potentially the people, right?

So a state, as we know it is independent has its own military. I think what Benjamin Netanyahu is doing here is presenting an alternative to that. And it's far from a state describing the free movement of Israeli forces through the Gaza area, having approval for all the building contractors that go in. And crucially, they will not be able to have a military.There will be some weapons to -- only those required really, for effectively the police to maintain a law and order. But as far as -- you know, that's as far as it'll go in terms of how Israel looks at it. So, I think what were really seeing there is Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's government plan for a post-Gaza, and we've got the rest of the world, the Western world, their vision of miles apart. So that's where, you know, we'll have to look at how that comes together, if at all. And that's a huge amount of tension between Israel and all its allies actually.",
