That's how the Biden campaign is labeling Donald Trump in a new ad as the current president leans into attacking the former president for his 34 felony convictions.Plus, who wants to be a running mate? Countless Republicans are vying to be on the ticket with Donald Trump, but only one contender was chosen as the favorite at a conservative conference this weekend. And the surgeon general is warning that the threat of social media two children is so dire. It needs a warning label just like cigarettes and alcohol. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, the Biden campaign is airing its first ads, targeting Donald Trump's new status as a convicted felon. It's part of a $50 million ad campaign this month that Tim Biden hopes will remind voters why they rejected Trump four years ago. CNN's Arlette Saenz is live at the White House. Arlette, talk about the reporting that you have about the decision making that went into this? Because we definitely heard both sides of the argument from lots of Democrats about how heavily to lean into Trump's convictions.",

The campaign today is now really sharpening their attack on Trump of releasing this ad, directly calling him a convicted criminal at a time when they have their eyes on that first debate in just 10 days.Now, what the Biden campaign is doing with this ad is laying out all of the criminal cases that have faced President Donald Trump really leaning into the fact that they're using these legal issues. As part of their argument to that he -- that Trump is unfit to serve in the office of the presidency. Take a listen to how this ad is trying to frame the election for voters. (VIDEO PLAYING)",

The Biden campaign said that that fundraiser brought in $30 million in that one night alone. That is the largest Democratic fundraiser in U.S. history. And the president and Obama also use that really to try to make a stark warning about what a second Trump presidency could hold with their eye on the debate as the two men prepare to face off for the first time since 2020.",

A spokesperson criticizing this ad for just that on social media.Now, I'm also told when I talked to the Trump campaign that when it comes to debate prep next week. They know that this is going to be a core potential question that will come up. And so, they are preparing for that even though Donald Trump's campaign says he doesn't need to do debate prep, he's not going to be doing any mock debate. We'll see if that happens or not.

And that is among one of the many contrasts that they want to make with president, oh -- former President Trump before the campaign. Because I do think they're aware that President Biden's own numbers aren't good right now.

So, it's just how we get information.But one thing, I think talking to voters out there, who are sort of exhausted by it all. The question is, will they see this election as an important one to vote in? And that's what both sides are really trying to do. So, it is still early in the sense of, you know, people are living their lives in the summer. And when I go out and ask voters their opinions are like, why are you doing this now in June? Like, give me a minute. So, I do think that double haters are not an unenthusiastic vote counts the same as an enthusiastic vote. The question is, do they go and vote?
