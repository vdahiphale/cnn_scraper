Hello, I'm Julia Chatterley in New York, and welcome to our continuing coverage of the war in Israel. Tonight, one of the hostages freed by Hamas is offering a dramatic account of her time in captivity. Yocheved Lifshitz, pictured here on the left, spoke Tuesday in Tel Aviv, less than 24 hours after she and Nurit Cooper were released. Lifshitz described her violent kidnapping on October 7th. She was taken to Gaza and forced into underground network of tunnels. She said her guards made sure that she was fed, however, and she received medical care. Now during the news conference, she also criticized the Israeli government for failing to protect her community. Bianca Nobilo has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LIFSHITZ (through translator): \"It was a hell I could not have known.\" BIANCA NOBILO, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): An 85- year-old grandmother, one of the two Israeli hostages released by Hamas Monday night, expressed anger towards her government for not taking the Hamas threat seriously in the weeks leading up to the horror of October the 7th. LIFSHITZ (through translator): \"The lack of awareness by Shin Bet and IDF hurt us a lot. They were warned three weeks beforehand. They burnt fields. They sent fire balloons, and the IDF did not treat it seriously.\" NOBILO (voice over): Safely reunited with her daughter, Yocheved Lifshitz detailed the horror that unfolded in her home in southern Israel. LIFSHITZ (through translator): All of a sudden on Saturday morning, everything was very quiet. There was a hard pounding on the settlement. I was kidnapped on a motorbike on my side while they were driving towards Gaza in the field. NOBILO (voice over): The ensuing two weeks, she was held hostage in Hamas' secretive network of underground tunnels. Upon her release, her testimony of the traumatic ordeal extraordinary, from horror to displays of humanity from her captors. LIFSHITZ (through translator): When we got there, they told us they believed in the Quran and would not harm us, and that they would give us the same conditions that they had inside the tunnels. For each of us, there was a guard. They took care of every detail. There were a lot of women and they knew about feminine hygiene, and they took care of everything there. NOBILO (voice over): She was released alongside her female neighbor, but her husband remains held in Gaza. Her freedom, a relief from Yocheved's daughter and a glimmer of hope for the families whose loved ones who remain as hostages under Hamas. Her experience now a potentially critical insight into a Hamas' spiderweb of tunnels and their behaviors, planning, and objectives of a group, which shocked the world with their capabilities, preparedness, and brutality on October the 7th.

Exactly to this point, hospitals are hours away of running out of electricity, which provide life-sustaining systems for newborns and for health care emergencies to be performed. Now, what are we hearing on the ground? We're hearing -- we've heard testimonies from pregnant women in Gaza. Let me share one with you. A pregnant woman who was displaced four times from her home and the very shelters in which she was walking between, every step she is taking as moving between these places with vast insecurity, she is saying, quote, \"Each step felt like a race against death.\" Now when she -- when we've heard from another testimony of another pregnant woman who managed to make those dreadful journeys and managed to find her way to Al-Shifa Medical Hospital, which features on a number of these reports, the biggest health care facility in Gaza. And what she described was after being able to get there and be able to summon that strength to get to Al-Shifa Medical Hospital, after three hours after giving birth, she had to be discharged and had to make way for another pregnant women who had to come in, as well as the huge amounts of wounded people. So the challenges that not only the pregnant women, but the Gazan population are facing is huge, including the medical staff because we also hear from medical staff, midwives that Al-Shifa Hospital as well describing the dire, dire conditions. And this comes back to your earlier point. You asked about fuel and how important fuel is to be able to sustain these life-sustaining systems. But it's not only about water, pregnant women need more water than a regular person. And the conditions there are deeply, deeply worrying. Usually, on a regular day, it's recommended 15 liters of water for hygiene and consumption purposes. Usually, about three liters per day that a human should drink. Pregnant women needs more, needs another 300 milliliters. Lactating women, so one of these pregnant women who gives birth, has to sustain the life of her child through breastfeeding, requires even more. And so the challenges right now are ensuring a safe and steady flow of aid can come in with food, water, medical products, and fuel being a key issue at the moment.",

The $10,000, as you mentioned, after the former president went to the microphones in the hallways and made that exact quote that you just said. It's very important to paint a picture for you and your viewers about what this courtroom looks like. The judge is seated at his normal position. To his right is his court clerk and to his left is the witness stand. When Trump made that comment, he says he was talking about Michael Cohen, the witness at the time. The judge actually made him go and testify to that under oath. Well, the moment that the former president left the witness box, the judge said this. \"As the trier of fact, I find that the witness is not credible and that he was referring to my law clerk.\" This did not make Trump's defense team very happy. They objected to the fact that a $10,000 fine was handed down, a second fine since that gag order was put in place against the president. If you remember, that gag order says that the former president cannot speak ill of anybody that works on the staff of this judge. They said that it's unusual that this judge's clerk sits directly next to him. And they tried to make their case that this trial really is unfair to the former president. Well, the judge did say that the $10,000 fine is going to stand and there's going to be even more stricter sanctions if he does not continue to abide by the rules of this gag order. So that was just the beginning of the last hour that I just said to you was full of drama. The second part was when testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's former friend and personal attorney, was on the stand. He was being cross-examined by the defense team. They essentially caught him flip-flopping from testimony he gave to Congress, basically, the reason this whole civil trial came about, according to the New York attorney general's office. That testimony back in 2019, he said one thing about preparing Trump's financial statements and then he sort of said something different on the stand in the civil trial. Well, Trump's attorneys tried to tell the judge that he's lying, it's right there, you can see it and this should no longer be a trial. The judge disagreed. That made Trump put up his hands, get angry and leave the courtroom, essentially saying they won this trial. And he was very agitated, the fact that the judge has not yet agreed with him. So listen, it is still going on, this cross examination of Michael Cohen, as they continue to catch him or try to catch him in a lie. But a lot of tense moments, including that fine, and  the former president leaving the courtroom while that cross-examination was happening.",

And I think that the Israeli nation -- or at least a large chunks of, it certainly the government -- is not prepared to be, if you like, in their view, would be lectured about how to respond to the Hamas attacks. That said, the United Nations has a long record of criticism of Israel, particularly the General Assembly, which of course is not the Security Council. Remember, of course, you know that. It is the much wider membership, if you like. They regularly have had resolutions that have been critical of Israel. And lately, United Nations officials have said or indicated, that, in their view, it was possible that the Israeli response to these attacks of terror inside their territory in Gaza and the resulting high levels of civilian casualties could potentially amount to a war crime. Now that is the view of elements within, the senior elements within the United Nations. So that gives the context to how the Israelis responded, when the secretary general attempted, he said, when he was trying to clarify things today, to put the Hamas attacks in the broader historical context. Then, of course, he did use this phrase, as you rightly point out, they didn't happen in a vacuum, toward the end of what he said. And that, for people whose country has suffered that kind of an attack, would have obviously be -- felt to be highly provocative.",

Footage from Israeli emergency services shows damage to a building and responders, as you can see there on the scene. When we get any further details on, that we will bring them to you. For now, the IMF says the war in Israel could hurt Middle Eastern economies. The fund's managing director says tourism and investment could suffer and the cost of doing business will rise, as insurers demand higher premiums. Kristalina Georgieva spoke to Richard Quest at the FII summit in Saudi Arabia and Richard joins us from there now. Richard, great to have you with us. As we were discussing yesterday, there's bound to be a chilling effect in the regional nations. There's also perhaps the bigger question of the uncertainty that it creates for things like oil prices going forward. And that has an impact on inflation. There are many angles here to consider.",

You see, the reality is, whilst the fighting and the awfulness of the humanitariancrisis continues, the further you get away, in a sense, from the locals, the more people are starting to discuss the wider implications, especially if there was an escalation. Here at the FII, obviously that is to do with the economics of the situation. It's not just  dollars and cents or reals or dirhams or whatever you want. It's about the way in which people will live their lives in these other countries, the industries that will suffer and the problems they will face. I spoke to Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the IMF, and this is her concern. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Why we are concerned, we are concerned first and foremost for the epicenter of this war, the tragic loss of lives but also destruction and reduction of economic activity. Long term consequences: kids not going to school today mean they won't have the skills for tomorrow. You expand the circle and you look at the neighboring countries -- Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan -- there, the channels of impact are already visible. You have tourism dependent countries. Uncertainty is a cure for tourists inflows. Investors are going to be shy to go to that place. Costs of insurance, if you want to move goods, they go up. The risks of even more refugees in countries that are already accepting more. And then you expand the circle to the world, Richard. What we see is incredibly resilient world economy but jittery and more so. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
