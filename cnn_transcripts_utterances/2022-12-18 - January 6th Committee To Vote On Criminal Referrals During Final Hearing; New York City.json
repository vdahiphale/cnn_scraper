He is on the Republican leadership team for the Financial Services Committee. And I'm going to get his response to the possibility of Congress banning crypto.The next hour of CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. The top stories on this Sunday. It all comes down to tomorrow. The revelations to expect from the January 6th Committee, as they prepare for their final public meeting. Plus, growing concern that cities aren't prepared to deal with the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico. We are live at the southern border and the White House for a look at what's being done. And check out this live look right here. The party is on in Argentina after Messi led his team to a World Cup win. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, just hours from now the House committee investigating the Capitol riot will present its closing arguments to the American people and after 17 months and hundreds of interviews likely deliver a legal condemnation of a former U.S. president. Tomorrow the January 6th is expected to call for the criminal prosecution of Donald Trump for his role in inciting the Capitol insurrection. And the committee is expected to refer at least three criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): If you look at Donald Trump acts and you match them up against the statute it's a pretty good match. I realized that statute hasn't been used a long time, but then when have we had a president essentially incite an attack on his own government? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a moment for the committee to speak with one voice, to lay out the evidence they believe they found that Donald Trump committed a crime and sort of helping to set off this riot, and they've said they think it's important for them to lay out that evidence for the historical record as well as for the Justice Department. As we know these are not legally binding. The Justice Department does not take it cues from members of Congress on who it is going to bring charges against. But I do think it will be a significant moment especially give, you know, over a year of work the committee has done, roughly 1,000 interviews, is really the culmination of all of that.",

But that's really the issue, right, is how is an insurrection defined? And when you have a criminal charge that hasn't been used very much you have fewer definitions out there that you can rely on as far as a judge giving instructions to the jury. So that is a challenging charge for them just because it hasn't been used very often.It may have to establish that in fact it was an insurrection that the former president was inciting and then you talk about the authority of the United States. Now that's not going to work because he was in charge of the United States still at the time but he indeed -- the insurrection was against the laws of the United States. The laws include the Constitution and include all of the provisions around the peaceful transfer of power and elections, and what Congress was doing on that day. So it does seem to be a good fit but there are a few wrinkles there in terms of getting it across the finish line for a charge. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're building structures on the border to help house some of them. And they're increasing transportation routes and so some of these migrants can go to areas of the country that are less crowded.

And this is something that we've seen all weekend long, and there are hundreds if not thousands according to local officials in Juarez. People waiting for Wednesday. We hear some of the Venezuelans who have already tried and Border Patrol agents have told them to wait until Wednesday, and they give that advice to others trying to cross. We've seen more people also come back and trying to find some place to stay in Ciudad Juarez. And like we said, south of the border in the Rio Grande Valley, also thousands of migrants are waiting for the opportunity to go into the United States. You've been talking about whether President Biden should be at the border. After the last report we did one of the Venezuelans reminded us that President Biden and the first lady went into Ukraine to see the refugees and be with them as they arrive, and they're wondering why they are not allowed the same way into the United States this way. So it is a political policy. Politics is also in the mind of the people trying to get in.

Did he consciously disregard a risk that his son could injure people based upon or kill, right, as happened here both, right? The fact is, is that he has that as the father a heightened responsibility. He lives in the household. He was aware with respect to the issues that were occurring in the household. He was aware of the domestic concerns that police were engaging there and repeated responses to that household. So why would he sponsor the application? I think he has a lot of explaining to do.

Both have been majorities in Congress. Both have been in the White House. That's the bottom line. But I do want to be clear with our viewers on the fentanyl aspect and so forth. I know that that is a common talking point.A majority of the fentanyl seized, it is at legal points of entry, and the majority are from legal residents or American citizens. So I do want to point that out. But, you know, what else -- I mean, what specifically would you do? What specifically as a Republican who's going to be in the majority in the House? What specifically would you do?",

Here's what they tell me. And they would tell the president if he would show up at the border and listen.Number one, enforce the existing immigration laws. They're not doing that. We're not deporting felons who are in the country illegally at the same rate at even President Obama. We're not enforcing the asylum process correctly. President Trump made some proposals to do that. So number one, do that. Next add judges. We added judges during the Trump administration. We need to continue to add judges to adjudicate those cases. We need to amend the laws, the immigration laws, and we can recommend for example the definition of credible fear should be fine-tuned there. And then we need to build the border security that the Border Patrol recommends and that's what President Trump tried to do in the fight over the so- called border wall, and President Biden stopped building it. And we're still paying for it. We're just not building it. So there's a number of concrete proposals but first and foremost the administration should go to the border and listen to the people whose job it is to secure it for those best recommendations.",

So, Pete, what are you hearing? PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Well, we're getting very basic information right now, Pamela, from the FAA. And they tell us that this flight with severe turbulence about three hours ago, 10:45 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time, that's five hours behind the East Coast. This flight, an Airbus A-330, a very large airplane, had to hit very extreme turbulence for this to happen. The FAA calls it severe turbulence but an Airbus like this weighs about a quarter of a million pounds, 274,000 pounds. Twin-aisle airplane. Very large. You probably have been on one before. They usually fly on Trans-Atlantic, Trans- Pacific routes. This flight we know from the FAA injured -- the severe turbulence passengers and crew. We do not know the exact number of how many people were injured just yet, although the FAA said it's looking into this. I looked in FlightAware, flight tracking site, also overlaid some of the weather at the time. It looks like there were thunderstorms in the area at the time of this accident. Thunderstorms produced incredible up and downdrafts, typically they're avoided by airplanes large and small. That will be something that investigators will look into here that the weather at the time of the incident, the altitude of the airplane, it was cruising at a relatively high altitude in that long stretch of water between California and Honolulu. But also, whether or not the airplane was in a descent, if it was coming into land. A lot of big questions here.",
