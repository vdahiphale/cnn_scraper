      "sentences": "Yes, Boris and Brianna, not only did not speak for long, but he also didn't take questions, even though he was looking directly at us reporters shouting at him.But he clearly had a message he wanted to put out there, which was that the party was unified behind him. And just given the indication of what we saw with the Senators on that warm welcome, the party is rallying behind the former president as the presumptive nominee. Now, with all that talk about unity, we heard a very different tenor from Donald Trump, or at least according to our sources, earlier this morning when he met with House Republicans. They described him as bouncing around from topic to topic, at times, airing his grievances, talking about the justice system, insulting some of the congressional Republicans who had impeached him and saying that he was happy that many of those would impeach him were no longer in office. This was a very different Donald Trump. And according to Senators who were talking to our reporters up on the Hill, they said, even in the meeting, it was a different tone, that he was positive, that he was talking about unity. And I will remind you that Republicans on both sides, Senate and House, had hoped that this kind of message of unity would be something that Donald Trump could deliver. Just a reminder here, Donald Trump himself is not somebody who gets rid of grudges. But according to the Senators, he was saying it was time to move on. Now one thing that's notable, he did talk to Mitch McConnell. McConnell has endorsed him. But the two still hadn't spoken since that election was certified for Biden. McConnell, obviously, had blamed him, in part, for that insurrection on January 6th. One other notable part about that, despite the fact that they talked, despite the fact that McConnell said that it was positive, there is a whole slew of Republican Senators who stood behind Donald Trump when he spoke just now, McConnell was not one of them. Now the question I would have asked, I was trying to ask, had he actually taken it, was what they talked about and if he would be willing to work with them. But unclear now from Donald Trump's side what that would look like.",

I wonder, how did the spy network during the Cold War pave the way for modern-day agents? LEON PANETTA, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY &amp; FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, I think it's fair to say that what happened during the Cold War and, frankly, what's happening today, is that there is no question that both countries have engaged in probably one of the most dangerous and risky and consequential spy games in history. In the Cold War, we had the Rosenbergs. We had Ames, who was another spy. Plus who worked for the CIA, high-level spy for the Russians. Robert Hansen, who was an FBI agent, who was a spy for the Russians. The United States, we had a high-level spy named Oleg Penkovsky, who gave us very important missile information in the Cuban Missile Crisis. We also had Gary Powers shot down, U-2 flight over Russia. And that -- that continues today. When I was director of the CIA, the Russians tried to place 10 spies in the United States in an effort to try to move them into sensitive positions. We were able, from our own sources, to be able to stop it. But it is continuing today.",

So he's going to try to punch back. And I think his sending those vessels into Cuba is kind of a signal that -- that he is not pleased with what the United States is doing. And he's going to try to get back at us. I think we have to be cool here. We have to look at the situation. We have to make sure that nothing on those vessels involves anything that could be a threat to our national security.",

Does the fact that, you know, the election could impact on things, is that is that a threat here? Of course, it is a threat. But the issue then becomes whether a new president is going to be serious about protecting our national security when it comes to dealing with the Russians.

Putin is counting on revenues from these projects. Our sanctions will disrupt those plans. Plus, at the G-7, we discussed our shared concern about countries like China who are resourcing -- supplying Russia with materials they need for their war machine. And we agree that taking collective action to push back against that activity. Let me close with this. We've taken three major steps at the G-7 that collectively show Putin we cannot -- he cannot wait us out. He cannot divide us. And we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war. First is a bilateral security agreement just signed. Second, a historic agreement to provide $50 billion in value from Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine. And third, an agreement to ensure our sanctions efforts disrupt third countries that are supplying Russia's war efforts. That will increase pressure on the Russian economy. Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions. And will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine's success. Two-and-a-half years ago, Putin unleashed a brutal war in Ukraine and it's been a horrifying ordeal for the Ukrainian people, who are so brave and incredible. It's also been a test for the world. Would we stand with Ukraine? Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom and against tyranny? The United States, the G-7 and countries around the world have consistently answered the question by saying, yes, we will. We will say it again. Yes, again and again and again. We're going to stand with Ukraine. And thank you. And I now yield to my friend from Ukraine. Mr. President?",
