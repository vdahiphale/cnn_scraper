A source within the Hobbs campaign tells CNN these pictures show the man who broke in earlier in the week. CNN has blurred his face because police have not identified any suspects in the case. Phoenix police say items were taken but the Hobbs campaign says it hasn't been able to get a full inventory. The campaign says Hobbs and her staff have faced hundreds of violent threats since she declared, which she blamed on her Republican opponent. Quote, let's be clear, for nearly two years, Kari Lake and her allies have been spreading dangerous misinformation and inciting threats against anyone they see fit. The threats against Arizonans attempting to exercise their constitutional rights and their attacks on elected officials are the direct result of a concerted campaign of lies and intimidation. Kari Lake pushing back against any insinuation she is responsible for the break-in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE (R), ARIZONA GOV. CANIDDATE:  I'm saddened that Hobbs and her camp would try to pin this on us. It's defamatory and it's wrong and it's so obvious what's happening. Her own party is attacking her. She's trying to deflect her own abysmal campaign and the fact that, you know, nobody even knows where her campaign office is. Person who broke into it probably didn't even realize it was a campaign office. It's really sad. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
