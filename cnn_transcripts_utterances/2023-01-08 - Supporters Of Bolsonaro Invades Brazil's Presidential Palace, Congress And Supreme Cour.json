You have the capital of Brazil.Protesters not only stormed the congressional building, but also the Planalto Palace which is Brazil's presidential building, Pam, as well as the country's Supreme Court building. In the last hour, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who took office only a week ago, as you mentioned, reacted to the events describing them as barbaric and calling those responsible for acts of vandalism fanatical fascists. And this -- here's a statement of what he had to say just a few moments ago. He said, \"These people are everything that is abominable in politics to invade the government headquarters, the headquarters of Congress and the headquarters of the Supreme Court like true vandals destroying everything in their path.\" That's what president said. Pam, it started a few hours ago as a peaceful protests in front of the army's headquarters in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil.

What I can tell you, Pamela, is the big question is, will the president actually get a clear picture of the reality here on the ground? I want to show you around.I'm in the second ward in downtown El Paso. This is a church. And you can see that there are hundreds of migrants who are still living on the streets. They have been living on the streets for weeks. That's why you see these piles of blankets. These blankets that you see here, this is what mothers use to block the wind. All of the clothing and the items you see here, most of them are donated from Good Samaritans from the El Paso area. You can also see that there's lines for everything. There are lines for food. Migrants are getting in line for water. They get in line for toys for their kids. This is the reality on the ground right now. What we know that President Biden has done is he's gone to the Bridge of the Americas. We have video of that. But from talking to advocates, there's really nothing to see when it comes to the migrant crisis there. What he will see, of course, is the enforcement side, what CBP has there, some of the tools that they use for the traffic of cars and inspections and such. But a lot of the advocates, Pamela, that I've been talking about, what they question is, if the president doesn't come here to see the actual reality of what is happening on in the streets of El Paso, will he actually leave the border with a clear picture of what is happening here? I can tell you that in mid-December, the number of migrant apprehensions according to border patrol was at about 2,500. It has drastically improved. Drastically improved. According to DHS, that number has dropped to about 700 per day, but as you can see, the situation is still very chaotic here and the big question is, will the president stop by here before he leaves? Will he actually speak to migrants? Will he actually understand that? And Pamela, one final thing I want to leave you with is, a lot of advocates that I've been talking to say that they were hoping that then -- when President Biden campaigned with humane immigration policies, they were hoping that he would really have his heart in the immigration policies that his administration was going to roll out. And instead, they say, that these immigrations are Trump-era policies. And on top of that, that he is expanding those Trump-era policies and they say and they describe the chaos that you see around me. Pamela?",

So, I know you and your colleagues have a full agenda starting tomorrow. Hopefully, you've been able to rest up since that late night vote Friday. But first I have to ask you about that wild scene then on Friday night. What did you think, being in that chamber as Congressman Mike Rogers went storming after Congressman Matt Gaetz after the 14th vote? REP. MIKE CAREY (R-OH): You know, we're that -- where Mike went up to Matt was completely on the other side of the House. I was sitting with the Ohio and the Michigan, and believe me, Ohio and Michigan actually do sit together on the floor of the House. But I was sitting with them on the other side. There was a little bit of loud voices, but there was no altercation. So, I agree with what other people have been saying. Let's -- let bygones be bygones and let's get the rule package forward. Again, there have been many concessions made. There were many concessions made before we entered the voting for the speaker. So, I think we're going to have a good rules package.
