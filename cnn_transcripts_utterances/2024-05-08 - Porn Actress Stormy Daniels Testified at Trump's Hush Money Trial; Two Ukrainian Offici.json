The Kerem Shalom crossing was closed on Sunday after a rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers. A government statement says trucks are already arriving at the crossing and will be allowed into Gaza after inspection.Meanwhile, Israeli's military offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza is now in its second day, despite weeks of very public opposition from Washington. And one U.S. official tells CNN the White House paused a shipment of 2,000 pound and 500 pound bombs to Israel last week over concerns about civilian casualties in Rafah. The Rafah incursion has killed at least 27 people since it started late Monday, including six women and nine children. An IDF spokesperson says approximately 20 terrorists have been killed so far. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant visited an artillery battery at the Israel-Gaza border near Rafah on Tuesday, where he outlined the IDF's mission. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): This operation will continue until we eliminate Hamas in the Rafah area and the entire Gaza Strip or until the first hostage returns. We are willing to make compromises in order to bring back the hostages, but if that option is removed, we will go on and deepen the operation. This will happen all over the Strip, in the south, in the center and in the north. We know that Hamas only responds to force. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Some have gone to the expanded humanitarian area of Mawassi. Others have gone to Deir al Balah. We think as the U.N. that people should choose where they want to go and we will provide aid to them wherever they decide to seek shelter with their families. It does create a bit of a challenge. Mawassi certainly does not have the infrastructure that you would expect. And Khan Younis is just recovering recently from an operation that took place there. So a lot of the infrastructure that we would normally rely on in terms of water generation and distribution, in terms of sewage and solid waste, all those things are frayed or broken. And everything that we do now has to be trucked in. Moving water and moving food for over a million people is very much a logistical challenge.

There aren't roads that lead into it. And all this creates a problem for us to get people aid, but also for people to receive aid and just meet their basic necessities every day. It's a challenge also for health. The hospital in Rafah that was evacuated.

On top of all that, Ukrainian officials say they thwarted a Russian assassination plot against Mr. Zelenskyy himself. And Clare Sebastian joins me now live from London.

The Air Force saying that it managed to avert the majority of the missiles and drones. There were 76 in total, it said, that were fired at the country, various different regions.But one of the Shahed attack drones and 16 missiles did evade its air defenses, including some of Russia's most powerful ballistic missiles. So that is the reason why we're seeing some of this damage. This morning, Ukraine's biggest private energy company, DTEK, saying that three of its thermal power plants were damaged, severely damaged, calling this an extremely difficult night for the Ukrainian energy sector. They say that this is the fifth time that their facilities have been damaged in the past one and a half months. Significant uptick in these kinds of attacks that we're seeing from Russia. Now, of course, this does coincide, as you say, with Ukraine's celebrations of Victory Day. Significantly, Ukraine marks Victory Day on May 8th. Russia marks it on May 9th. Ukraine is using this as one of the ways that it seeks to distance itself from Russia by doing this. And President Zelenskyy, in what appears to be a counter to the rhetoric that Russia uses around Victory Day, its rhetoric around degasifying Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, in a post on social media, saying the entire world must understand who is who. The world must not give a chance to new Nazism. Rosemary.",

Not everywhere is warm. There are some cooler spots, but with the El Nino in the Pacific and also the very hot areas here in the Atlantic Ocean, yes, the warmest sea surface temperatures globally that we've ever had.

We're losing Arctic and Antarctic sea ice at a record pace with enormous ecological consequences for marine mammals here in the Arctic that depend on sea ice. So the ecological impacts of this are dire. And unfortunately, we have governments and certain political parties that are still in this delusional mode and pretending this isn't happening.

Last year we released 38 to 40 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent, so we're still increasing our emissions. On the adaptation side, what you just mentioned, clearly we have to do, these are engineering solutions. Basically, we have to do better at building climate-resilient urban communities and rural communities, flood-resistant, wildfire-resistant, drought-resistant, better access to fresh water, heat-resistant. Heat stress is going to be killing thousands of people, it already has throughout the world, so we need to be very serious about investing in climate adaptation for these extreme weather events, which are only going to increase in frequency and severity in the near future. And, I might mention, this is a job for governments. Governments have to step up and look out for the welfare of their people. We have two very critical international meetings coming up later this year in November. One is the G20 in Rio, a group of 20 industrialized nations, and the other is the U.N. Climate Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. Both of these are happening at the same time, in November, just after the US presidential election, and these two conferences, international global conferences, are in planning stages right now. They need to do away with fossil fuel subsidies and agree, very importantly, and they agree on a global minimum carbon tax. They agreed on a global minimum corporate tax a few years ago. They need to get with a carbon tax. We can fix this. Governments know how to do it. They just need to do it.",
