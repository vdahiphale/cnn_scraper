Dramatic new video showing a desperate situation. You see a large crowd of people running after aid trucks, climbing on top of them. That aid just arriving today from a floating pier set up by the US military. The UN says the food shortage in Gaza is dire because with the Rafah Border closed, critical aid cannot get through. US officials saying that floating pier will help bring in 500 tons every day of life- saving aid to the Palestinian people. Also breaking tonight, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejecting an ultimatum from a member of his own War Cabinet. Former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz is threatening to quit unless Netanyahu agrees to a war plan by June 8th. Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey.

In trying to help guide or shape what happens when this war is over? GOTTHEIMER: Listen, as you know, Israel is a critical ally of ours in fighting terror in the region, we need to make sure we do everything we can to play a role as, and I think that is you're going to see Sullivan doing this weekend trying to bring the parties together and figure out what is the best path forward that ensures security in the region, right? And economic stability and make sure we do everything we can to move forward here. But listen, we still have got and we shouldn't lose sight of this more than a hundred hostages. They still continue -- Hamas still continues to fire into Israel, Hezbollah from the north, the terrorists from the north continue to fire into Israel. So, you know, you still have a very volatile situation and Hamas is continuing, and as you know, continuing to be active in the region. So what does it look like the day after when Hamas is no longer actively trying to run Gaza? And of course, how do we find a way? You know, how do we find a regional way forward there as we saw during the Abraham Accords?

They should retract that. They should apologize and they should stop doing this and playing these political games. It actually undermines the US-Israel relationship and that is exactly the opposite of what we need to do right now. The US-Israel relationship should be bipartisan. It is critical to our national security, to America's national security to our fight against terror in the region as we are seeing right now with Iran and all of its proxies attacking America, not just Israel.

They continue to hold Americans and others hostage after killing 44 Americans and 1,200 brutally in what they did. So I can't imagine the pain these hostage families are going through. I spent a lot of time with the Alexander family here in Northern New Jersey, whose son, Edan Alexandra is 20 years old and as a hostage, they haven't heard from him at all. There is no Red Cross visits on his health, no updates just like these other hostages. So listen, I can't begin to imagine the pain that these families are going through every single day and they just want to see their loved ones, and so we've got to do everything we can, both as Americans helping our key ally and, of course the Israelis, the same, to do everything to get those hostages out, and that is why we need to find an agreement here for a pause, and that is why everyone has got to go back to the table, stay at the table, and never leave the table, all the negotiators, until we find a way forward here, right?

CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Alice Stewart has passed away.She has been a staple on this network for years, participating in many political panels, taking us deep into politics with her incredible insight. She was a former communications director for Senator Ted Cruz. She worked with Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Mike Huckabee, just to name a few, and she hosted a podcast with her friend and Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona, called \"Hot Mics from Left to Right.\" It is a massive loss for all of us here at CNN and for her friends and family, a legion of people out there who loved Alice Stewart, and you can count me among them. Joining us now on the phone is former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson. Governor, thanks so much for being here with us. I am so sad to be talking to you about this tonight and I know you knew Alice as well from all of our days in Arkansas and then beyond. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR (via phone): Well, you're right. As you described, it is a massive loss for everyone who loves people, but politics and friendships and Alice was such a dear person and I am proud that you recognized her Arkansas connections while she has her heart in Atlanta and her Georgia roots. She did work in Arkansas in television in her professional life as a commentator, but also as an adviser, working on presidential campaigns. So we are proud of that connection. And just from a personal standpoint, I look at Alice, she is someone that believes that politics was about making friends and not creating enemies, and that is a special characteristic anymore. And she encouraged me. I spoke with her immediately after I dropped out of the presidential campaign. She was one of the first ones to call me and encouraged me. And then just last week, I spoke with her and she was giving me advice, and the she has been a dear friend.

She was guest-hosting a radio show on Friday morning. We had a great segment and it was fun. We talked about the debates that are coming up and also talked about what the breaking news of the morning was at the PGA championship, and we just had a delightful conversation because she was the kind of person that could lead a delightful conversation. One of my best -- one of my best memories of Alice is that I had a chance to recommend her to the Harvard Institute of Politics where she had one of the most successful fellowships. They bring in political operatives and you have a semester and you have these students that come to your seminars and she had just such an accessible semester with students who often don't get a chance to interact with people like Alice. You know, people from Middle America, Republican political operatives, they are there to learn, and Alice was someone you can learn from and she was so successful, that then they put her on the board of advisers for the Harvard Institute of Politics, and one of the things she was most passionate about and something we shared was this idea that people from Middle America need better representation in elite political corridors, whether that's in the media, whether that is in places like Harvard at the IOP. She really believed that her people, Middle America people needed to be get better represented in these elite circles to try to bring our country together, you know, so that we wouldn't constantly feel like there was this divide between the coast and the middle of the country.
