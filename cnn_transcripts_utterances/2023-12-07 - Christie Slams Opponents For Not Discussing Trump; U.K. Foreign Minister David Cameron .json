And now, he's calling January 6 an inside job? I mean, this guy -- there is nothing that he won't stoop to.But I will tell you this, too. Ron DeSantis, last night, proved himself to be a coward. He won't answer whether he would send troops to Taiwan to defend if China invaded. He won't say whether he would send troops for a credible plan to try to save American hostages in Gaza. And he won't say whether Donald Trump is fit for office or not, even though he got all three of those questions directly. I got those questions directly. I answered them directly. Voters can agree or disagree with the position I take -- that's absolutely fair. But he is, like, evading every question up there because he's afraid of offending. And in very much the same way, Nikki won't offend on Donald Trump either.

But I will say to you that at the end of this if we don't deal with the mental health crisis in this country and provide much more mental health treatment for folks and make it easier to involuntarily commit people who have obvious mental health issues and are speaking violently, we're going to continue to see this violence, whether we ban a type of weapon or not. We have 350 million guns in circulation, Poppy, and banning certain weapons, unless you're going to confiscate them, too -- which I would never do -- you're not going to change the problem unless you get to the root cause, which is the mental health of the people who engage in these mass shootings.",

And let's (audio gap) speaker. Did it seem that he was committed to getting that funding to Ukraine, even if it means Republican concessions? DAVID CAMERON, U.K. FOREIGN MINISTER:  I think he is committed to getting that money through, and most of the people I saw on the Hill yesterday support backing Ukraine because it's the right thing to do. I mean, if you fundamentally think about it, the countries supporting Ukraine add up the economies and we outmatch Russia 30 to one. We've just got to make that economic strength show and make it pay, and that's what this is all about. Obviously, it's complicated about exactly how a bill goes through Congress and what it gets attached to it, and I don't want to get involved in that. But I just absolutely know that this money will make a huge difference to a Ukrainian campaign that actually is, in many ways, far more successful than people give them credit for. They've taken back half the land that Russia stole from them. The other night, they destroyed 20 percent of Russia's attack helicopters in one night, thanks to American equipment. They've driven the Russian Navy back across the Black Sea. They're exporting grain again, so their economy is growing again.

And to people who call for an immediate ceasefire now, if we leave Hamas in charge of even a part of Gaza, there will never be a two- state solution because you can't expect Israel to live next to a group of people that are -- want to do October the seventh all over again. But, of course, as Israel takes the steps that it's taking, we want them to obey international humanitarian law. We want them to minimize civilian casualties. I know you had Tony Blinken on your program yesterday and I'm going to be meeting with him today.

The case for engagement for trying to bring about stability and security in the Middle East, the case for beating back Putin in Ukraine -- the cases for those things are very strong. They're in our own national interest. But I think there's something else we both have in common, which is our domestic politics have been sort of disrupted by problems over immigration, by problems over unequal economic development, and some people and places left behind. And we have to address those issues, too. So -- but there shouldn't be alternatives.
