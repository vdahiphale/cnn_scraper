So, one count has to do with the fact that a weapon was involved, a deadly weapon, which is a baton. And the other count had to do with the fact that there was serious bodily injury endured by Mr. Nichols. And so what is unusual about a kidnapping charge in a confrontation with law enforcement officials is we obviously deputize law enforcement officials to make seizures, to make arrests.

So, every criminal charge, there is going to be some sort of gray area. This is an adversarial system that we have. And those are exactly the kind of statements that I would want to hear from the defense counsel in this situation. But in terms of second-degree murder, here, under Tennessee law, which is where I was originally licensed to practice, was that it takes an awareness that there is a sort of just likelihood, right, that you are reasonably certain that your conduct would result in somebody's death. And so here, there are facts that would have communicated to the officers that they should have known that what they were doing would have resulted in Mr. Nichols' death. His arms were pinned and they were striking him repeatedly in the head with their boots and with a baton. Those are both deadly weapons. And this idea that they had to have knowledge -- that's what we require. So, every criminal act requires an actus rea and mens rea.

It includes the ultra nationalists and ultra religious parties. Earlier today, Blinken was in Cairo meeting with the Egyptian president and the foreign minister there. He was talking about all of this. And we should put this in context because all this is coming as we're also learning in recent days about a U.S. Air Force general who is predicting that the U.S. and China will go to war in 2025. The Washington Post is reporting that General Michael Minihan sent a memo to troops under his command that said, quote, I hope I'm wrong. My gut tells me we'll fight in 2025. Taiwan's presidential elections are in 2024. They're going to offer Xi a reason, he believes. The United States presidential elections are obviously also in 2024 and will offer Xi a distracted America. He says Xi's team an opportunity are all aligned for 2025. Now, of course, this is what he is saying. This does not necessarily the reflection of the consensus of the U.S. military.

But there is no hard data, hard intelligence to predict that a war is going to happen in two years. I do want to give you a read from the U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson, Patrick Ryder, and he notes that this is in the national defense strategy. He says the national defense strategy makes clear that China is the pacing challenge for the Department of Defense and our focus remains on working alongside allies and partners to preserve a peaceful, free and open Indo-Pacific. What does that all mean? It means that the U.S. has identified China, even with Russia and Ukraine, as the primary national security threat to the U.S. They see potential flashpoints, particularly in Taiwan. They know that there is a risk of war over Taiwan. But it is not the U.S. assessment that war with China over Taiwan or any other issue is going to happen in two years. And, frankly, I have spoken to folks both currently in the U.S. military and very recently in the U.S. military, and they say that it's not the position of the commander of U.S. mobility, Air Mobility Command, to make such a public prediction given, of course, China would be watching such comments very closely as well.",

Then when I hear he might run, I consider that very disloyal. I talked to her for a little while, but I said, look, go by your heart if you want to run. She's publicly said that, I would never run against my president. He was a great president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Frank, we saw former President Trump on the road in New Hampshire, making several of these stops in South Carolina as well. I don't think it's surprising that he is criticizing DeSantis and Haley. I've been told he doesn't think anyone should run against him in 2024. But what did you make of it?",

      "sentences": "And that's the whole problem. That's the challenge that Donald Trump faces, is that he sees everything from his perspective. The reason why he was successful in 2016 is because he offered to be their voice. He offered to take their concerns to Washington. Now, it's just a series of gripes and revenge and it's all about him.And the Republican Party has a very difficult but important decision to make. Are they going to be focused on the future or the past? Are they going to be litigating the 2024 election or the 2020 election? And you see this all across the country. And I want to make one important point about politics. Yes, Donald Trump is leading nationwide in every survey, but in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Ron DeSantis has pulled even or ahead on the states that really matter. This is a duplication of what happened in 2008 when Barack Obama was winning all the key states, even though Hillary Clinton is winning the country. In the end, the country does not vote in January and February, just these key states do. And Trump is already falling significantly. And he's even behind some of his opponents right now.",

We don't know. DeSantis is not in yet. Chris Sununu is not in. It's not the first time that Chris Sununu has said Trump can't win. He said in December he's not stopping anybody from joining the race, any Republican. Chris Christie said the same thing. He doesn't believe Trump can win.So, if we can move forward and talk about something that is going to happen, the actual reality on the ground now, several polls have shown a drop in President Biden's approval rating ahead of next week's state of the union address. This is the CNN poll. It shows approval rating is now at 46 percent among registered voters, down from 48 percent in December. There is a new Marquette University Law School poll shows Biden down by 44 percent, the approval there. What does that data tell you?",
