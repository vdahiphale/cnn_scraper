They worked at Cornell College, a small private liberal arts institution in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Footage that appears to show the aftermath of that stabbing appeared on China's social media, but it was quickly censored. Little is known about the instructors' conditions. There's still no word on a motive. All right. I want to bring in CNN's Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong following this story. Good to have you with us, Kristie. So this has been described as a brutal stabbing by the Iowa representative for the district where this university is. Do you know if these four are still in hospital? What else can you tell us about their injuries and whether they were targeted? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Lynda, one of the victims is said to be doing well. This is a very chilling, stabbing incident, especially keeping in mind that violent crime against foreigners are rare in China. And this is the latest what we know. So it involves four educators from Iowa's Cornell College. They were wounded in this stabbing incident when they were visiting a park in Jilin City. That's located in the northeast of China. And we do have video of the aftermath. Let's bring it up once again for you. In this social media video, I want you to look at the three wounded people lying on the ground. This is in Beishan Park in Jilin City. They are covered in blood. They are waiting for first responders. And one of them is pressing his hand on the back of his waist. All three in the video are awake, they're conscious, and they're using their smartphones to try to reach out to others. The brother of one of the wounded Americans, David Zabner, says that his brother is, quote, \"doing well, but the condition of the other three at this hour is unknown\". And there are no reports yet of a motive. Now, the president of Cornell College said that the four in China, it's part of a partnership with a local university called Beishan University. And in his statement to CNN, this is what he said. Jonathan Brand told CNN, quote, \"we have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time\". Now, Brand says that they were with a Beishan faculty member when the stabbing took place. This took place Monday morning around 11:35 a.m. local time. No students were involved in this program. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, says it is aware of reports of a stabbing and it is monitoring the situation. The stabbing in Jilin City has been trending high on Chinese social media today, with posts occasionally censored. And some netizens, you know, they called it a terrible incident. Let's bring up some example responses for you, with some saying this, the current state of public security is not supposed to let such a thing happen. Another said it will definitely further hinder foreigners from visiting China. Now, China has low rates of violent crime. Again, violent crimes against foreigners, very rare. But the stabbing comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-China relations. These two countries, they're trying to strengthen relations, they're trying to strengthen people-to-people exchanges at a time of deep tension. As we reported earlier here on CNN, Chinese leader Xi Jinping plans to invite some 50,000 young Americans to China in the next five years. And although no American students were targeted in this stabbing incident in Beishan Park, this incident has a chilling effect. It could discourage some young Americans from going to China. Lynda.",

Our thanks to you, Kristie Lu Stout, joining us from Hong Kong.Well, now turning to two major stories from the U.S. justice system, Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be interviewed by probation officers in New York ahead of his sentencing for his 34 felony convictions. And Hunter Biden awaiting a verdict in Delaware in his trial on federal gun charges. Jurors are set to resume their deliberations later today. But let's go first to New York, where Donald Trump spent less than 30 minutes meeting virtually with probation officers.

But what is customary is the fact that this always happens after a defendant has either pleaded guilty or is convicted of the crimes that they're charged with.We know some of the questions that are asked are about the criminal history of that person, the family background, their financial background. Did they ever abuse alcohol or drugs? Things like this. What's also not customary in this situation, of course, is the fact that there is a former president as the person who is being interviewed by the probation office, but also that it happened virtually. We know that the former president was at Mar-a-Lago. He was there with his attorney. That was allowed by the judge in this case. Now, what's going to happen next is that Trump's defense team is going to submit their own sentencing recommendation. And both that, along with this report made by the probation officer, will be factored into Judge Juan Merchan's decision about what sentence Trump should face for being convicted on those 34 counts just a few weeks ago. So we are waiting, of course, for that to happen. The sentencing date is still set for July 11th. Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The missiles hit at midday, a daring operation meant to maximize the element of surprise, turning a refugee camp into a battlefield. After weeks of preparation, Israeli forces moved into Nuiserat in central Gaza on Saturday, aiming for apartment buildings in this area. The goal, to rescue four hostages that Hamas held in this densely populated neighborhood. One witness says some Israeli special forces were disguised as Hamas militants or displaced Palestinians.

It's claiming quite a significant success over the weekend, claiming to have severely damaged a state-of-the-art Russian fighter jet, an SU-57 fighter jet some 600 kilometers from the front lines. Satellite images also backing up that claim. So that is something they say that is bearing fruit.Now of course the other side of this is that this conflict is extremely deadly at the moment. The U.N. Human Rights Monitor mission in Ukraine said that there was a 31 percent increase in civilian casualties in May compared to April. It was the deadliest month in almost a year. Russia is managing to wreak havoc using aerial guided bombs, glide bombs, things that can evade Ukrainian air defenses.

That additional four brings our total so far this year up to $11 billion disasters.Comparing that to the previous year, we ended up with 28 total for the entire 12-month timeline. But we are currently on pace to make it very close, if not possibly being higher than that number from last year. One of the biggest drivers of these disasters was a lot of the severe weather that took place, not only in May, but also in April. In fact, the stretch of April through May, we ended up with 801 tornado reports. That is the second most since 1950. When you look at tornadoes specifically, the reports, just since January 1st, we've had over 1,100. Yes, this is a busy time of year. But even with that said, the average would only be right around the 800 mark. So it's definitely a busier year than normal. In fact, even compared to a lot of the other years, so far, we are just behind 2011, coming in second place. Now, one thing to note is that May traditionally is when you end up seeing the most of those tornadoes, followed by June and April, respectively. So this time of year is when we normally would see it. It's just a little bit higher than usual. The big concern is going forward over the next few months, because there is a concern whether or not FEMA will run out of money for these natural disasters, because hurricane season specifically is now upon us, and it's expected to be an incredibly busy one. Looking at the numbers, the official forecast from NOAA calling for 17 to 25 named storms. The average is only 14. Eight to 13 of those are expected to be hurricanes. In an average year, you would only have seven. Another concern in the coming months is heat. Thanks to climate change, it's been a big driver in a lot of these increased heat waves. And for some of these areas, we're already starting to see a very early start to that heat.
