And he has been booked at the Fulton County Jail. He does have his bond agreement already set, and so it is very likely he will be released. We don't have an indication that John Eastman has been released from the Fulton County Jail yet on the charges he faces here in Georgia. But he is the most prominent defendant to head over to the jail and go through this process of the criminal justice system, something that every one of these defendants in this case have 19, the racketeering case against Donald Trump and others for what they were planning to do to stop the transfer of power after the 2020 election, all of them are going to be negotiating their bond, as far as we know. And then they will be arrested, they will report over to the jail, and then very likely be released on either cash bond, some sort of surety or even personal recognizance. But Donald Trump himself, he has his bond terms set. He has some restrictions, no intimidating witnesses, including on social media in this case. And we're going to be waiting for him to come into the state of Georgia to also go through this process of being arrested and report to jail as a criminal defendant in Georgia in Fulton County.",

In this case, it's Judge McAfee. And so what would happen is, the state would file a motion to revoke bond. At that point, there'd be a hearing, where the judge would make a decision, and I believe the standard is probable cause, meaning greater than 50 percent, that the defendant has violated their bond. You don't get a jury trial. You have, essentially, a hearing before the judge. And so the state's going to put up whatever evidence it has with regard to the bond violation. And then the judge is going to make a decision, has that bond violation been violated or not? But the other interesting thing is, if you have witness intimidation in this case, you can always add -- file a superseding indictment. And witness intimidation is a RICO predicate. So, what could happen in this case, if Donald Trump violates his bond, is not just that his bond could be revoked, but that the indictment could be added to with these additional charges.",

So it's a really serious thing.I think people don't realize when a judge says, you better not do this, you better be careful about how you skirt the rules. I do want to put up a couple of things that Trump has posted on social media since this agreement was made. He put up a couple of different things. One of them, he goes after or criticizes Fani Willis, the DA in Fulton County. And you see them there side by side. One of them, he talks about her being a radical left district attorney. And he said that a couple of different times. But she is not in this, correct? He can criticize the judge. He can criticize the attorneys. Would that ever change?",

But I don't think we have ever seen a tweet from Donald Trump where he has threatened physical violence. So I think that's unnecessary. But, usually, when you have got a bond order, where you're looking at a condition, the biggest issue is going to be witness intimidation. And the other issue is, are they going to come to court? So, that's why a bond is typically in place. What's interesting is, this is a $200,000 bond, which would be hard to meet for most individuals. And, usually, the bond is that high because you're concerned with flight. But, in this particular case, when you have got Donald Trump, who I believe is literally a billionaire, $200,000 just pocket change to him. So that wouldn't prevent flight. But what's really going to prevent flight is, I believe, am not sure, but I think Donald Trump would want to trial in this case, and he'd want an opportunity to address the entire country, if not the entire world, on the issue of whether there was voter fraud in Georgia.",

Of course, that is former President Donald Trump. But those eight candidates who will be on stage include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum made the cut. Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson did as well. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy did, former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. So that will be the lineup on stage. Now, there is no doubt that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has a considerable amount of pressure on him going into this debate. I'm told he has been practicing extensively for several weeks, hired a very practice debating coach. Of course, he is trying to make the case that he deserves to be and should be the second leading candidate to Donald Trump. But he will be at the center of all of this as those Republican rivals are trying to point out inconsistencies, in their view, in his record and his experience to lead. But even though former President Donald Trump will not be on stage -- that's a decision he made, because he simply wants to essentially not be compared with all these candidates -- he will be at the center of this conversation. All of the candidates, of course, have been practicing for the idea of him being on stage or not. But even though he's not, of course, his policies in many of his statements will be front and center to all of this. But as we talked to many of the strategists advising these campaigns, they are indeed looking for a potential breakout moment to introduce themselves to the country. For all of the months and months of campaigning in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, this represents their biggest opportunity on one stage, on one night, on national television to make their case to Republican voters. The question, of course, is if any of them will be able to break through or if former President Donald Trump, when he surrenders to the Fulton County, Georgia, authorities on Thursday, we will simply swallow up any type of bounce or bump a candidate could get out of this. But, for now, at least, the candidates are descending here in Milwaukee.They're spending their final days preparing.
