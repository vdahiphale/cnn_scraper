Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Israel is in chaos. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is desperately trying to calm protests rocking his country. Protests that started after a controversial decision he made to reform the judiciary. Demonstrators are beyond angry over the move saying that it threatens the very foundations of Israel's democracy. One of the bills would give a simple majority in the parliament the power to overrule the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, violence has flaring in the West Bank. And now, one of the Netanyahu senior ministers is facing backlash after making incendiary comments. Saying the Palestinian town of Huwara, \"Needs to be erased.\" Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, made those remarks just days after settlers went on the deadly rampage there setting fires to cars and homes with families inside. The U.S. has strongly condemned the comments. With me now to discuss all of this is Arab journalist with Israeli Newspaper, \"Haaretz\", Shireen Falah Saab. Shireen, thank you so much for joining us. There is a lot to get through here. Before we go over the judiciary overhaul, let's talk about what's happening in the West Bank. Just to give our viewer a sense of just the past few days in the cycle of violence. 11 Palestinians were killed in IDF raids in Nablus last week, then two Israelis murdered on Sunday in Huwara, just south of Nablus. One American Israeli was killed in the Jordan valley, in the evening then a rampage of hundreds of settlers, as we talked about in the open there, in Huwara as revenge, killing one Palestinian, injuring over 100 people. We've got damage to property and livestock and animals. Give us a sense of why this is happening right now, this violence from settlers.",

The last escalation is about 400 settlements that attacked Palestinian properties and their lands. I think that the first time that I see an attack of this scale and carried out in front of large of -- police and army present and -- it's -- these settlements are protected by the members of Knesset like Smotrich and they are not arrested, unfortunately. And if they are arrested, they are free right now. So, there is not a real solution for this violence against Palestinians. And we see this violence that's protected by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich.",

He say, that they are similar, and it's not similar. Netanyahu keep pressing also the demonstration by the force. This is the Ben-Gvir police that using the force against Israeli protesters. And I should say that interesting point also, and for me, an optimistic point. Yesterday, some protesters say for the policeman, where were you in Huwara? For the first time, the Israeli citizens, they understand that there is a really direct connection between the occupation in the West Bank and the force that they used against Palestinians, and now we see it in the hurt of Tel Aviv.

You know, when they released OxyContin which is, sort of, this is like the -- they were so driven by money and profit when they promoted this drug when they released it. And so, they took these quotes and they quoted Richard Sackler and they made these fake prescription slips. And then the activists from Nan's group called PAIN, Prescription Addiction Intervention Now. They went to the rotunda and then they started just dropping these prescriptions slips and then they started to fall. And it looks like, to her, like hundreds of activists but there's actually a very small group. And they put these banners and then they staged a die in at the bottom of the rotunda. And you know, this was a really remarkable action, it was covered by all of the media. And this, I think, was the tipping point. This was about a year into after Nan first created the organization. So, they've been very diligently trying to bring attention to what was happening in the Sackler name. And then after this was when the National Portrait Gallery in London. Nan was set to do a retrospective and she said, I won't do a retrospective with you unless you refuse Sackler donations. And they refused $1.3 million donation from the Sacklers. And then that was, like, the domino. Everything started to fall after that. And so, all the museums said OK. We're not going to take money anymore from the Sackler family.

And I'm also one that they can go over and they can -- they have a shoulder to cry on if they want to, or we can take a walk talking, or even in silence. And so, through time, I think we developed a mutual relationship based on trust.",

But now, obviously with the new full-scale attack on Ukraine, you could be worried that this problem will spread to encompass most of Ukraine. But what I'm most proud about is that it means so much for a lot of Ukrainians that this film has actually made it this far. And it helps a lot, internally, to focus on this topic and to hopefully make, you know, families open up their homes and taking one or two or more of these kids.",
