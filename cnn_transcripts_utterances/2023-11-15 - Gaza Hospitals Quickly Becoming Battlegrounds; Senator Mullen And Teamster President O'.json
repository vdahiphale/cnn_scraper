We'll tell you everything you need to know about the situation on the ground. And Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet next hour -- what two of the world's most powerful men hope to accomplish. And later, meet the teacher who took her entire class to Mexico without passports or tickets. We'll tell you how exactly she pulled that off just ahead. All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianna Golodryga is on assignment. Let's get right to our top story. Explosions are shaking Gaza's largest hospital as Israel launches a raid on Al-Shifa. A reporter inside the complex says that Israeli forces entered with a large number of soldiers, tanks and bulldozers in the apparent search for Hamas fighters. Take a look at this video, because this is a glimpse inside the sprawling complex, the sprawling grounds, where, as you can see, the scenes inside, smoky and hazy. You see doctors and various personnel trying to move around, trying to function without electricity. Thousands of Palestinians, including patients, are believed to be sheltering inside. The supervisor of the E.R. department describes the scene as horrific, saying that the sounds of gunfire are mingling with the screams of older people and the cries of children, as well. He says that he's seen people handcuffed, he's seen people blindfolded. The Palestinian health minister based in Ramallah calls the raid at Al- Shifa a new crime against humanity. The U.N. aid chief says that his concern is right now about the patients and about the civilians who are trapped inside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR: Our concern is for the patients of a hospital that doesn't function. I understand the Israelis' concern for trying to find the leadership of Hamas. That's not our problem. Our problem is protecting the people of Gaza from what's been visited upon them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And you can hear the terrifying sounds of that military operation in the background of this doctor's call. But of course, as we know, thesituation facing Al-Shifa, as well as other hospitals in northern Gaza has been deteriorating for some time now. There is now only one hospital really functioning at normal, perhaps not normal, functioning at all really in northern Gaza, the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. All other hospitals have been said to become inoperational including the Al-Shifa hospital. While there are still hundreds of patients inside, doctors have been telling us that they have been unable to provide the adequate care that is needed. And of course, at the Al Ahli Hospital, we are hearing that doctors are carrying out surgeries without even anesthetics. So, you can imagine the situation that these doctors are working under, patients, of course, requiring urgent medication, unable to get that, hospitals unable to keep their generators going. And as we know, the IDF has said that it is focused on Hamas, it is not looking to target civilians, it has called on civilians to evacuate and says it has allowed for a safe evacuation route from the eastern side of the hospital. But we've been hearing from doctors throughout the day, including the head of Gaza's hospitals, who have said it is simply impossible to begin to even consider evacuating many of these patients -- A, because the situation is so insecure on the outskirts of this complex, but also because many of these patients will require specialized medical evacuations. They cannot simply walk from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, as we have seen hundreds doing in the last week, although it has to be said that route is hugely difficult and some have even died along the way. So, that is a primary point of concern for doctors inside Al Shifa, for doctors across the Gaza Strip. And as we continue to see the idea of carrying out operations around Al Shifa, the concern that we've been hearing from many human rights organizations, including, as you heard there, from the U.N.'s relief chief, is that hospitals are quickly becoming battlegrounds, and there are fears that patients, civilians who flock to hospitals to take shelter, are not safe anymore.",

All right, the Gaza hospital's chief says that newborn babies at Al-Shifa arein severe danger right now as conditions continue to deteriorate. On Monday, some were moved to a part of the hospital which still had electricity, but even there, even there the conditions are still said to be precarious. Egyptian officials say that they're working to bring three dozen babies from the hospital to Cairo, but as you just heard Nader Bashir mention there, that is a complex undertaking, transporting these babies is certainly a difficult thing to do safely. A few wounded Palestinians have also been able to receive medical care in Egypt. CNN's Eleni Giokos spoke to Egypt's health minister. She joins us live now from Cairo. What is involved, Eleni, when you think about what the patients at Al-Shifa, especially when you're talking about premature babies, what they're dealing with in that kind of situation?

After years of record growth, the world's second largest economy is struggling. Its housing market in crisis, youth unemployment at record highs. And for the first time in 25 years, a deficit in foreign direct investment. International companies increasingly uneasy putting money into China, in part because of Beijing's unpredictable crackdowns. The U.S.' reputation has also taken a hit in China, fueled by state media's anti-West messaging and nationalistic posts on China's tightly controlled social media. Ahead of the summit, rising skepticism towards U.S. intentions. One Weibo user posting that, \"This is a U.S. delaying tactic. Its strategy of containing China won't change but only intensify.\" Another posting, \"Anyone who thinks that China-US relations will become better is simply naive. It' just your wishful thinking.\" Many in China supporting Xi's proposed new world order, one that's not led by the U.S. The U.S. now hosting this high-stakes West Coast meetup, with low expectations on the outcome. No more love seat for the leaders of two superpowers. Instead, both on a hot seat with the world watching if they can tamp down tensions. (END VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (on-camera): And we look at China's struggling economy, Zain. We look at what they might want to do to help it, to essentially boost it. And that is turning to U.S. businesses in particular. It's something that President Xi intends to do himself after his meeting with President Biden. But that, in turn, is creating a controversy. One U.S. lawmaker is demanding the names of the businesses and individuals who will be attending a welcome-Xi dinner, essentially. And at that dinner, it's expected that some of those businesses $40,000 for a seat at the table of President Xi. So, that's concerning for U.S. lawmakers, this one in particular calling it unconscionable. Zain.",

Number one is just really re- establishing the lines of communication between both countries, but also Taiwan, Russia's war in Ukraine, Israel, of course, likely to come up and a whole host of other issues, as well -- climate change.

So, that's what he's getting out of this. He's getting legitimacy. And then on top of that, he's going to get whatever he can get from these American business leaders. Now, the American business community has been very strenuously pushing for improving ties because it's in their financial interest. In other words, they're lobbying from Wall Street and the American Chamber of Commerce and their friendly lawmakers is such that they want to get back into the Chinese market and Xi Jinping holds the key to that. And so, they can help each other. Now, the problem with that is that runs counter to the U.S. foreign policy and national security policy which is meant to protect American businesses from what's really going on in China, which is a massive crackdown on economic data, on economic freedom, on foreign businesses, the arrests of foreign executives. So, Xi Jinping has to say that China is open for business while he's cracking down on foreign businesses and he needs the American companies in order to sell that and I think that's a big part of why he's in San Francisco today.",
