We also know, of course, that those military operations have taken a toll on civilian lives as well over the course of the last month. Some residents of those areas have been allowed to return home. They were told so by the Israeli military today. And already, people who have returned home are finding very little. Their homes are in ruins. Infrastructure has been totally destroyed in some of those areas. No power, no sewage, no gas lines as well. Some people are even setting up tents next to the ruins of their homes. And there's a lot of anger, of course, not only directed at Israel, but also at Arab governments, who they feel have not done enough to rein in Israel, and also anger at Hamas as well, with one man saying, let Sinwar be satisfied. Can you hear? They ruined us -- Boris.",

And last month, the first confirmed case of polio was found in a 10-month-old baby.And now there are concerns that this could spread further throughout the Gaza Strip. And so there has been enormous international pressure brought to bear to allow for pauses in fighting so that the vaccines can be distributed to an estimated 640,000 children under the age of 10. And so beginning on Sunday, the Israeli military has agreed to pauses in the fighting in specific areas of the Gaza Strip for about 12 days. So beginning Sunday, starting in central Gaza and then moving to southern Gaza, followed by northern Gaza, you will see the distribution and the administration of vaccines in those specific areas, something that the Israeli military has agreed to. Now the question is, how will that actually be implemented on the ground? Will we see pauses in the fighting from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., as a World Health Organization official said, would take place in these three areas of the Strip over the course of these next 12 days? Will the troops on the ground follow that? Will Hamas follow it as well? And one other thing that's important to note, this is a two-dose vaccine. And so the question is, after two weeks, they would need to get a second dose. Will there be another pause in the fighting once again at that time -- Boris?",

Absolutely heartbreaking, it really is.The Columbus Blue Jackets forward Johnny Gaudreau passing away on Thursday night along with his brother Matthew. This after the pair were struck by a vehicle. They were out riding their bicycles at the time, Boris, in New Jersey. The siblings were actually in the area preparing for their own sister's wedding which was scheduled for today, Friday. Police say a man has now been charged with two counts of death by auto. A news release outing the 43-year-old was suspected of being under the influence of alcohol. Now, just for context here for our viewers. Nicknamed Johnny Hockey he was, Gaudreau playing 11 pro seasons and was going into his third with the Blue Jackets. He actually spent his first nine seasons with the Flames where he became one of the league's top players, the absolute fan favorite as well. In a statement from the National Hockey League on Friday, the league saying it was shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Gaudreau and his brother Matthew. Adding: While Johnny's infectious spirit for the game and show- stopping skills on the ice earned him the nickname Johnny Hockey, he was more, he was more than just a dazzling hockey player, he was a doting father and beloved husband, a son, a brother and teammate who endeared himself to every person fortunate enough to have crossed his path. Just an unthinkable tragedy, Boris. His current team, the Blue Jackets, adding in a statement of their own that Gaudreau played the game with great joy, the club and its fans also establishing a memorial tribute there outside of Nationwide Arena where he played.

My thoughts and prayers going out to the Gaudreau family. May Johnny and Matthew fly high, guide and guard and bless their families from the heavens above. Boris, this is a desperately sad moment, and it goes without saying, of course, our own prayers are very much with the entire Gaudreau family at this time.
