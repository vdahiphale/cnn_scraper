Yesterday was the deadliest day since the truce came into force last Wednesday.Israeli airstrikes killed nine people in southern Lebanon on Monday. And that was after Hezbollah fired into Israeli-occupied land, blaming Israel for breaking the rules of engagement. A U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon has said Israel has breached the ceasefire about 100 times. Now, Israel says it will target the state of Lebanon, not just Hezbollah, if this ceasefire collapses. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following it all from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, how can this be called a ceasefire if both sides are violating it?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's a very good question, Boris. And it seems that it's only remains a ceasefire because of the political will that seems to exist on both sides to call it that and to allow it to maintain and not devolve entirely back into the state of war that Israel and Hezbollah were in until the beginning of last week.For now, what we are seeing are exchanges of fire that have happened across the border. Hezbollah firing two rockets yesterday at Israeli- occupied territory. Israel has been firing and carrying out airstrikes in southern Lebanon every single day that this ceasefire has been in effect. But it is a question ultimately of narratives and of what each side is claiming when they carry out these actions. Hezbollah said that when they fired those rockets, it was going after Israeli violations of the ceasefire over the course of the last week. Israel has said that every time it has carried out strikes in southern Lebanon, it was because Hezbollah operatives, they're saying, we're violating that ceasefire. And Israel has vowed that it will enforce that ceasefire. That is obviously at odds with what the Lebanese government has said, in claiming that Israel is violating the ceasefire. And we know that U.S. and French officials, who are part of this monitoring mechanism, have also raised questions with Israel about some of the attacks that they have carried out over the course of the last week. But now there is also a warning from the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, who is effectively saying that if this does return to a state of war between Israel and Hezbollah, should this ceasefire end, then Israel will go further than it has before. Both in terms of striking deeper inside of Lebanon -- he termed it as not distinguishing, for example, between the Dahiya, the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, which is a Hezbollah stronghold, and the rest of that city of Beirut. And he has also said that Israel will not distinguish between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government, the Lebanese military, effectively suggesting that Israel will begin to strike at Lebanese government targets in addition to Hezbollah. That would take things to a very, very different level. But for now, there is no indication that that is going to happen. It seems, at least for now, that, you know, both sides would like to maintain the ceasefire. The question is, can they? Especially if Israel carries out this role, as they say, of enforcing through fire -- Boris?",

I think that that is certainly the understatement of the early morning hours before we hit dawn.We, Boris and Brianna, are just a couple of yards outside of the National Assembly where this drama unfolded. So to take a look at what we have, just over my left-hand shoulder, protesters who are gathering to let the president of South Korea, Yool Suk Yeol, know that this is unacceptable, that South Korea has come such a long way since military rule last initiated martial law in 1980. These protesters are saying, essentially, they are not going back to 1980. In fact, just over my shoulder, that bottom banner with the National Assembly in the background that says, \"Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol,\" the president of South Korea. So as you mentioned, Yoon Suk Yeol is saying, OK, we're going to lift martial law, not happening anymore. Why there seems to be this sort of delay, so he institutes this declaration about 10:30 local time, takes the country by incredible surprise, this breathtaking announcement. And then all of these legislators come back to the National Assembly and unanimously vote to say, you know what, we're going to suspend this crazy idea, paraphrasing what so many of them have said during the overnight hours. It takes the entire cabinet of the presidency to come back and sort of rubber stamp the parliament's decision. So that's why we're kind of in this, you know, wait-and-see space of, is this official? Is it not? But such a degree of relief now that the president has said, all right, as soon as we go through the motions of getting the cabinet together, martial law will no longer be in place across South Korea. Just a stunning development when this place has been such a bastion of democracy across East Asia. So what we're expecting to see in the next few hours, the main question, Boris and Brianna, what is going to happen to this president who is a huge ally of the United States? No fewer than 28,500 U.S. troops, who are stationed throughout the country. U.S. military officials, of course, are saying no impact as of yet. But of course, stability of the country is paramount when we're talking about all of our brave men and women who are here. Expect this to grow in the coming hours. And demand that the president step down after this huge moment of unrest and martial law being instituted briefly across South Korea, Boris and Brianna?",

Political observers have said it -- was this a way for South Korea's president to potentially quash dissent? He had said that opposition lawmakers were trying to essentially sabotage the country, paraphrasing him. And this was his way -- again, I stress, his way of taking back control when he is in such a weak position. But one must wonder, what was his exit strategy? What did he think was going to happen? We, hopefully, will hear from him. We expect that the least he can do is address the nation now that we've had this rise up against his declaration of martial law -- Boris and Brianna?",

In a statement about the suspension, Jon Runyan, the NFL's vice president of rules, said, in part, \"To Al-Shaair, your lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach and enjoy watching it is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL.\" It went on to say, \"Your continued disregard for NFL playing rules put the health and safety of both you and your opponents in jeopardy, and it will not be tolerated.\" Now, earlier today, Texans general manager, Nick Caserio, he came to Al-Shaair's defense, saying that the league is being inconsistent in the way that they handle these incidents.

Turns out that that was produced by bottlers and petrochemical manufacturers trying to offload the moral responsibility of waste onto the consumer, with the idea that they could recycle. And people diligently have tried. But less than 10 percent of the trillions of tons of plastic that have been produced in generations have actually been recycled. A lot of it ends up in landfills, more and more in the oceans. That's a major concern there as well. But in the last three COPs, there was also a biodiversity conference, there was the big climate COP in Azerbaijan, and now this one.
