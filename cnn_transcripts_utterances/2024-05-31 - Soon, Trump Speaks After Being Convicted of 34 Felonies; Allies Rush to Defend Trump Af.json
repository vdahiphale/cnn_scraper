I'm Erica Hill in New York.In just one hour, we will hear directly from Donald Trump, the 45th president, now also a convicted felon. He is set to speak from Trump Tower following yesterday's historic verdict. A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. The seven men and five women deliberating for about 12 hours over two days to reach that decision. This, of course, marks the first time in American history a former president has been convicted of a felony. Sentencing is set for July 11th, an appeal expected to follow in short order. Following the verdict, Donald Trump repeated some all too familiar falsehoods and made clear his focus is the 2024 election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people.

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTBut I will note that while his senior advisers have briefed me on that, it is unclear that Donald Trump will stay on message. Since just moments ago, they had a teleprompter set up that was taken down. And as you know, when Donald Trump and I think it's a very when the president goes off the cuff, he tends to say almost anything. So, we'll stay tuned to see what kind of messaging he has. I will say that after being shocked, stunned after that verdict came out, I am told by sources close to him that he started being in better spirits after being told by donors, allies, lawmakers that they would all stand by him. I think one of the most critical pieces of this, we talked a lot about how historic this is that a former president of the United States has now been convicted felon. But the other part of this is that he is still the presumptive Republican nominee. And in fact, the sentencing set for July 11th is just days before he is expected to become the actual Republican nominee for president at that convention in Milwaukee. It's very difficult now to separate the political and the legal here, something that has been hard now for months, but just gets harder every single day. Now, while his team is promoting confidence, they just said that they had fundraised in the last 24 hours since that verdict, $34.8 million. Now, of course, this is not cooperated yet. We don't have that FEC filing, but that is what they're saying they got in donations. They did crash that small donation website, Win Red, yesterday after the verdict. They are saying they feel good, but there are still a lot of questions as to how this actually plays out in November. We have seen poll after poll. It is a very small margin of Trump voters who say they are less likely to vote for him if he is convicted, but that small margin matters a lot in an election like we are expecting in November, where that margin of the winner is going to be so narrow, Erica.",

We're going to vigorously appeal this verdict. I think this case is replete with reversible error. We are going to take this as high and as far as we need to, including to the U.S. Supreme Court, to vindicate President Trump's rights, because there was nothing legal, there was nothing normal about what happened in this New York courtroom over the last month-and-a-half.We moved for a change of venue here. I completely agree with Todd Blanche that it was impossible for President Trump to have a fair trial in Lower Manhattan. We also moved to recuse the judge off of this case. We believe that he was irretrievably conflicted and biased and there was no way that he ever should have been presiding over this case. So, look, in the days and weeks and months ahead, we are going to be challenging this verdict. I do not believe that it will end up standing. And as President Trump said last night, the ultimate verdict is going to be that of the American people at the ballot box next November. And I believe that they will be so outraged by this verdict that, if anything, it will help his chances, not hurt his chances of gaining back the White House.",

You know, under New York State law, they're not required to say which it is, but when they do, the judge has to instruct them on that specific crime.And the problem here is, you know, they don't have to prove that they actually committed that other crime. They don't have to prove that they actually had, you know, FEC violations, but they have to show that what they intended to do was, in fact, a crime.

The jury itself took about 12 hours over the span of two days to find Donald Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records. And the judge in this case, as we've noted, went to great lengths to keep jurors' personal information private. During jury selection, he urged the news media to limit reporting any personal information that could unmask these individuals, and he urged that for their own safety. I want to bring in CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller and Trial and Jury Consultant Carolyn Koch. It's good to have both of you with us today.

I've also seen jurors not be truthful about their true biases and had the personal experience of discovering during jury selection that a juror who filled out a written questionnaire under oath talking about how fair she could be has social media posts that were the exact opposite. And I think that this Trump jury selection, they encountered people who were not truthful in open court during jury selection as well. So, I think the high-profile changes the stakes.

The courthouse is not just about one trial, where other trials are happening in the background. It goes back to day-to- day business. The key thing here is going to be the sentencing date, if that remains, 11th. And why is that the key? Because that puts a distance between the verdict and then the prospect of Donald Trump being sentenced to 400 hours of community service, or perhaps a year or more in prison or heavy fines. And that is the kind of thing where there is time to organize demonstrations, rallies, supporters, counter-protests. So, this is something that they're going to be looking at very carefully in terms of what kind of resources they're going to need, what is the social media telling them, what's in the threat stream, and so on.",
