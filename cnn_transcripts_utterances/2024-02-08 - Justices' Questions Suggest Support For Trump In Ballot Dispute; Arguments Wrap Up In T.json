Even some members of the court's so-called liberal wing seemed to pose some difficult questions to the lawyers opposed to Donald Trump. Let's turn back to our esteemed panel of lawyers. Including now joining us, conservative attorney, James Bopp Jr. Mr. Bopp, let me start with you. You have argued in front of the Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times. What were your takeaways from the oral arguments earlier today?",

You have to be cautious in reaching the conclusions about the questions they ask.But many of these justices were talking about not just asking questions or devil's-advocate question, but they were expressing their own concerns about the Colorado decision and where it would lead the country. It is very important that our elections be considered legitimate. And this willy-nilly state-by-state, maybe just one bureaucrat or one state court judge taking a presidential candidate off, with the result of affecting the outcome of the election just is intolerable. So it does -- I think it is Congress's role, and that's what they will leave it to.",

It's too much power, because it's a federal office. What if, then, a Democratic Congress and President Trump are elected in November, and during that period, there is a conviction of Donald Trump, not for an insurrection, but for January 6th-related crimes by Jack Smith. And then on January 6th, 2025, this Democratic Congress says, we're not going to seat an insurrectionist. He's clearly in violation of the 14th Amendment.",

We know that he was watching them, and then he came out and talked about it, saying it was a beautiful process, he wants democracy to work.But as you mentioned, he quickly turned this into a campaign speech, attacking President Joe Biden. Unsurprisingly, particularly, given that he is still in the middle of this primary season. He actually just took off moments ago for Nevada, where he is expected to win the caucus tonight. He's also the only viable candidate. Part of his speech was very dedicated to this general election run that he has, at least he anticipates it to be. He's hitting President Joe Biden, saying that none of the things that are happening now across the globe would've happened. But the other part of this that we have seen routinely was something that we heard again today, which is, despite the fact he thought the arguments went well, despite the fact that his advisers have told him it is a good, solid legal case, he still seeks to turn all of this into one giant legal mess. By all of this, I mean all of the various cases that he's fighting. Continues to say that they there are political persecutions, that they are election interference, and they're all at the hands of President Biden. Obviously, none of them, or most of these cases aren't linked to each other. Only two of them actually directly involve the Justice Department. Again, this is how he started to campaign, how he is going to run the campaign if he is, in fact, the nominee, which it seems that it's likely that he could be.",

M.J., any reaction from the Biden camp to the U.S. Supreme Court hearing and the suggestion from many observers that it seemed as though Donald Trump is going to be on the ballot in November? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Look, Jake, we don't expect the White House or the Biden campaign, for that matter, to weigh in, in any serious way as far as these legal proceedings are concerned. That has been keeping with the strategy that they have kept with all along. They've been extremely careful to not weigh in any way in public about any of this, basically saying that these are legal decisions to be made in the judicial system. Now as far as the president is concerned, he himself has talked about this at times, as recently as last week when he said that, as far as I am concerned, that is fine. That, referring to whether the former President Donald Trump ends up remaining on the ballot heading into November. The thing that we will consistently hear from White House officials and campaign officials and the president himself is on the matter of the threat of Donald Trump that President Biden believes poses to democracy. We have heard him talking about this in his speeches. We have heard him talking about this in casual settings, time and time again. This is the message and the argument that we have heard consistently from the president that he believes that the former president was responsible for calling for an insurrection. And that this is a threat he has been preparing to run against in November. That is sort of the main argument that continues to sort of frame and be central to the Biden campaign as they are making the full pivot to the election -- Jake?",

The reality is that if this Supreme Court today, under the circumstances that we now have and the legal situation that we now have, whether to throw Donald Trump off the ballot, it would send our country and our political system into a world of chaos. I think this whole thing today, Jake, is a way to begin to clear the decks so that American people can decide the future of Donald Trump. He's going to be eligible to be on. I think it's obvious. This immunity case is coming up. Maybe they'll say he's not immune, which they probably should do. Then Judge Chutkan has to get her trial going. I mean, the docks need to be cleared so that the American people can finally vote. And when they do, know what they're dealing with. Are they dealing with a convicted felon or are they dealing with someone who's been acquitted? To me, that is paramount here. What is the best thing for voters?

We don't believe we have these constitutional guardrails to make sure that democracy doesn't elect popular, crazy people. Democracy can elect popular crazy people, popular criminals? John Gotti might have been elected president. Who knows? But that you have a constitution to make that certain people, they were too young, they weren't born here, they're treated as treasonous traitors, can't become president.

They really expressed the strongest skepticism for the Colorado voters' lawyer. Jonathan Mitchell, who was representing Donald Trump, had a pretty easy time at the lectern. And as you just commented to Van, even justices from the left side seem to be willing to understand where he was coming from. And it was a combination of kind of the practicalities of the situation. Just as Elena Kagan said, you want one state to dictate what's going to happen nationally? This seems like an awfully national question that we're wrestling with here. But also, the history of the 14th Amendment, Section 3. They didn't seem to buy the argument that that somehow would preclude Donald Trump from being on ballots. Perhaps because Congress needs to authorize legislation perhaps because the terms of the amendment don't cover Donald Trump.
