In video from the scene, you can see protesters throwing a wooden pallet, fireworks, parking cones, a scooter.These clashes have been ongoing for hours. There had been minimal police intervention, but we are told that the LAPD is now on scene. That from tweets from the LAPD and from the L.A. mayor's office. Joining me now is Donell Harvin. He is with Georgetown University's Emergency and Disaster Management Department. Donell, good morning to you. How would you assess the response here? We know that there's been some reluctance on the part of these universities to call police for fear of escalating the situation. But the violence that we're seeing at UCLA does seem unique and an escalation from -- even from the taker of the building at Columbia. DONELL HARVIN, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S EMERGENCY AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT: Yes, Kasie, this is a failure of planning on part of the university public safety officials and administration, especially when you have this amount of people. You may have competing or warring factions. To not have a real physical police presence or barriers between these groups is really unconscionable. This is something that we've done in many of the cities I've worked in. You have to be able to protect people's First Amendment rights to protest. You also have to be able to protect them from counter- protests. And to let this devolve into the anarchy that the viewers are seeing on their screen right now is something that, hopefully, will never happen again and we won't see. The LAPD and the surrounding jurisdictions -- I'm sure they'll be calling what we call a mutual aid -- are very good and adept at civil disorder. But they're coming in kind of late and behind the eightball, so to speak, on this. This is unbelievable, to see students on student violence in an American city in this time and age.",

And, you know, I study and analyze homeland security issues and domestic threats.And so I don't look at these particular demonstrations, which started off as perfectly fine, peaceful First Amendment protected activities, in isolation. You will recall for the last five or six months, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, has been wanting the American public about outside agitation in our domestic politics, particularly as it pertains to the Israeli-Hamas conflict. He has said, in no uncertain terms, as well as the the intelligence community, that they are seeing the highest level of external threats to our domestic security since 9/11. And so what you see is a lot of foreign terrorist organizations and other agitators stoking violence here in the United States, stoking radicalization. Now I want to be very clear. I'm not saying that these students are radicalized. But on the spectrum of radicalization, you may have a lone actor who is out there, who's becoming radicalized online. And it's really easy to track these things online with social media and with some of the tools that law enforcement has.",

We saw the barricades that were loaded in and brought out yesterday afternoon. We see that they were being used overnight, as well.We did see that the -- UCLA came out last night, saying that this was now unlawful. And then, as things devolved, the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, coming out saying that they were asking for help from LAPD in the situation we've seen. Now that there has been a mobilization here around here, there's a strong police presence on this side of campus where we are. You can still share chanting going on. There have been skirmishes that have continued throughout the night here on the campus of UCLA. And the presence now being felt. There's not a lot of movement here. I've seen a lot of videos of the police officers standing in place. But obviously, what we've seen are basically agitators on both sides here who have started up skirmishes. We then see also people on both sides trying to stop it, trying to quell these little skirmishes that become bigger as they're trying to break down the tents on the inside of the pro-Palestinian side. So still, when you take a look at it, right now, you can hear through here. You can hear the chanting. You can hear that there's still a lot of activity, despite the fact that it's just after 3 a.m. in the morning here at UCLA -- Kasie.",

Like this front area here where I am, this has been the part where you see pro-Israeli demonstrators who've been out here. They're out here with their flags. They're out there showing their support.And then across the double barrier behind that where you see those -- those plywood walls and such, that is where the pro-Palestinian side, the encampment that has been here. So when you were out here, you can see it's actually clearly delineated -- I think more so than perhaps on other campuses -- here at UCLA. That's how they've been able to hold this. And we did see people from other sides encounter the other side and there would be -- again, there'd be some yelling, there'd be some shouting. There was some tension, but they'd walk away. That was most of what we saw during the day here yesterday. But it's very clearly delineated when you get further onto this campus and into this green -- Kasie?",

I just want to kind of get your reaction to what Stephanie was describing in terms of the reporting of how these two groups were separated, this kind of ten-foot space, barriers that are being, you know, deconstructed, potentially thrown. How does that -- what is your understanding of how -- whether that setup would be effective? Clearly, it didn't prevent this. Maybe it couldn't have, but you're the expert.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So I want to pull on a thread that Stephanie said. While there may have been barriers, the barriers clearly weren't sufficient. I mean, we had barriers in D.C. to protect the Capitol on January 6, and the protesters picked them up and threw them at law enforcement.And so these barriers have to be reinforced with a physical law enforcement presence to let people know that they can demonstrate peacefully. They can voice their concerns, but they're not going to commit what we call interpersonal violence. And so there will obviously be some after-action report on how those barriers were set up. I have to be honest with you, college campuses are not used to dealing with this type of issue. But they better get used to it. The longer that this Israeli-Palestinian conflict goes on, as the FBI and the intelligence community has warned us, the more you will see this type of level of discourse and, in some cases, violence. We didn't see violence in Columbia university. It was civil disobedience. Those students were arrested and displaced without incident, by and large. Here, I think the -- the energy is different. And I think you're going to see a different type of unfold -- law enforcement action unfold as this operation starts taking place. And a lot of that's because they didn't have the proper security posture in place at the outset to really set a tone that this will not devolve into the lawlessness that we're seeing right now.",
