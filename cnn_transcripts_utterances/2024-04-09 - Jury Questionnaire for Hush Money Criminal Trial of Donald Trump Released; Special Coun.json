Starting on Monday, Trump is required to sit in a courtroom four days a week for at least the next several weeks as arguments over his 34 charges involving lies, payments to an adult film actress, play out.The first part is already underway with a jury questionnaire released overnight.

      "sentences": "Yes, John, 42 questions these potential jurors are going to be asked and have to answer. That's only the start of the process of jury selection that will start next Monday, April 15th, in this first trial of former President Donald Trump in New York. These questions are built to weed out people who may have a strong bias for or against Donald Trump and cannot find a way to be an impartial juror.So some of the questions will just give enough information to the defense team and to the prosecutors to ask further questions. So an example of that is there is going to be a question asked of these potential jurors of what print publications, cable news outlets, or other online media they are consuming regularly. Do they watch CNN? Do they read \"The Washington Post\"? Do they watch FOX News, MSNBC? Do they read \"The New York Times\"? That is one of the questions. That doesn't necessarily mean something one will be tossed just because they say yes to that or because they say they watch one of the cable news networks, but it does allow both sides to ask further questions to see if there's a bias. One of the things, too, that the judge has said here, just being a member of a political party or voting for Donald Trump, that is not going to be even asked. He says there are no questions asking prospective jurors whom they voted for or intend to vote for in this upcoming election or who they have made political contributions to. However, there are questions about do, do you have a strong opinion or belief about Donald Trump as president four years ago or as his candidacy continues for president now in a way that makes you unable to set aside the facts here? And then there are also questions, if you have worked for or volunteered for him in the past. John?",

His lawyers will be making it in person on April 25th, but this is in writing. And he rejects across the board in a very unequivocal way Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity. He says that nothing in U.S. history dating back to the founding or any Supreme Court precedent since would allow a president to claim absolute immunity for any kind of actions in office, after office, against criminal prosecution.And what he does here, remember, Jack Smith has brought several charges, all related to the aftermath of the 2020 election. Fraud against the U.S., obstruction of an official proceeding, denial of the right to vote. And first he reaches back to the founders and says, the framers never endorsed criminal immunity for a former president, and all presidents from the founding to the modern era have known that after leaving office, they faced potential criminal liability for official acts. And I want to stress, this is after leaving office. And then Special Counsel Smith pivots to a more modern precedent, and that involves Richard Nixon, who engaged in misconduct related to the Watergate cover-up, remember the 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Campaign headquarters in the Watergate building. And Richard Nixon was an unindicted coconspirator related to that cover up. And Gerald Ford, when he became president after Nixon was forced out of office, pardoned Richard Nixon. And what Jack Smith is saying is that that pardon implicitly acknowledged that a former president could have been criminally prosecuted for his acts while in the White House. Kate?",

He is saying he would be absolutely immune from any kind of criminal prosecution for any actions, including actions that would involve really serious alleged crimes. It would go -- it would even go to as emerged in the lower court hearing to the president ordering some sort of hit on -- using Seal Team Six against a political a rival.And what lower court judges did was just absolutely reject that out of hand. And there's a line that I think will strike this Supreme Court from the lower court ruling in this case that said, whatever kind of executive immunity President Trump might have enjoyed while he was in office dissolved once he became citizen Trump. And that's what the court will be looking at here, not what he could have been liable for while in office, but once he leaves office, could he face charges. And in this case, because of Trump's really no exceptions argument, I think they're going to reject it in the end. Maybe with some caveats, but I think he's heading for a rejection, Kate.",
