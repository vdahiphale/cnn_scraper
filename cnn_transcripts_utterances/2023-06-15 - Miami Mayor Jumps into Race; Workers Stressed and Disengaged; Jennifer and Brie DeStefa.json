This certainly is now front of mine again as we hear former President Donald Trump talking still about the election that he claims he won to Joe Biden, which, of course, is not true. But he is also talking about the need for someone from outside Washington, someone to run as an outsider. So, that is how he is presenting himself.Make no mistake, this is a very uphill battle for him. The race is very crowded. He's not well known at all. The biggest challenge of course will be trying to get on that debate stage in August, the first Republican debate August 23rd. The candidates must have 40,000 donors from 20 different states to make that debate stage. But certainly he's in the race today. A growing field, which likely benefits the frontrunner, Donald Trump.

Can he break through when you're dealing with this many people and one very loud, very well-known main contender? AMIE PARNES, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT AND SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE MESSENGER\": That's the thing, I mean no one can really change the conversation because the former president is dominating the headlines and the news cycles and it's hard to. I think what people are looking for now is someone who is going to say, be a Chris Christie, for instance, and say, well, what are you doing? Like, what -- why are you going to elect someone like Donald Trump again? So it's -- this is a vanity campaign. I don't expect that anything will come of it. But, you know, name recognition maybe for him down the road. And it all benefits the former president really. I mean there's a huge lead right now between the former president and Ron DeSantis.

We need to stop claiming that that was stolen.And it seems like that's sort of become now the majority consensus opinion within this field. But then there's the trickier one, which is, how about this indictment now? How about this documents indictment? And he has struggled and tried to thread a needle a bit on that one.
