And sometimes the forces that you're dealing with are actually divided among themselves and knowing that -- knowing who the players are, knowing who is the local commander and knowing who the overall people who are responsible for things, that becomes a key element here.So when you have these negotiations, you have to expect them to go wrong or at least to be difficult, but there are certain pressure points that you can exercise on some of these forces and those are the things that you have to do. You have to tell them, you know, that there will be consequences if there is firing on the civilians, for example. There are consequences if you don't let this happen.

That is overcapacity. And while those numbers fluctuate, is an indicator that there is an increase in migrants crossing the U.S./Mexico border ahead of the May 11th date. That is when Title 42, a COVID era border restriction, will end.And since March of 2020 that restriction has allowed authorities to quickly expel certain migrants at the U.S./Mexico border. They will no longer be able to do that after that May 11th date. So that means that the administration will go back to decades-old protocols. Now, that is difficult at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the western hemisphere. And so, administration officials have been putting preparations in motion. That includes, for example, setting up regional processing centers so that migrants on their way to the U.S. southern border can a apply to come to the U.S. legally, doing the same thing with other programs for other nationalities so that they don't have to come to the U.S./Mexico border and can apply to come from where they are. But they are also reminding migrants that they will restore legal consequences when this Title 42 restriction ends. Now, you of course, this is an issue that has been a political vulnerability for President Biden and has opened him up to criticism from Democrats and Republicans. So, all of this is front of mind as the administration moves ahead in trying to manage the flow of migration ahead of that May 11th date. But even with all of that in place, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas anticipates the next few weeks will be challenging and also noting that smugglers are prone to spreading misinformation.

Good morning. Great to see you. Daniel, I mean, May 11th is less than two weeks away, the expiration of Title 42. So, let's start with the Biden administration's plan to handle this influx of migrants after Title 42 expires. So, the White House recently announced new measures, right, including those regional processing centers in Colombia and Guatemala that Priscilla just talked about where migrants can come and apply to come to the U.S. Daniel, can you talk about this balance that Biden is trying to strike, discouraging these border crossings at the same time creating a legal pathway for migrants fleeing poverty and violence?",

But at the same time, they recognize the political reality, which is that there is a lot of Americans in swing states who don't want to see our border get overwhelmed and our border states get too kind of clogged with migrants, you know, coming to their country.And so, I think those migration processing centers are going to be helpful, but at the best they sometimes can handle 6,000 people a month, when we're expecting double that number per day coming into the country and who are getting turned away. And so, I think the Biden administration is going to be trying to send a strong message that if you come to America you are going to be turned -- you're going to be turned away and that the laws apply to all people coming into the country.",

There was some damage to an apartment complex around the West Palm Beach area yesterday, having a lot of storm reports spread out across the state. So, it's not like there was just one portion of Florida that got hit versus another. You had tornado reports, wind reports, hail reports, spread out over the state. More of the same expected today, mainly in the first half of the day. You've got this tornado watch that's the entire red area here in effect until 2:00 p.m. A lot of this, however, is going to drop off well before that. Some severe thunderstorm warnings mixed in there. This is that main line that's going to slide across the state as we go through the next few hours. Further north, however, we also have the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms across areas of the East Coast and especially in the Mid-Atlantic. Damaging winds, a few tornadoes, and hail will still be issues there as well. Most of the rain exits by lunchtime in Florida. However, off to the north, it really starts to ramp up in the afternoon hours, especially across the Carolinas, and Virginia, portions of Maryland.
