Meanwhile, Hezbollah confirms one of its senior commanders has been killed in an air strike on a southern suburb of Beirut. Lebanon's health ministry reports at least six people were killed and 15 injured in that attack. Cross border fighting has increased dramatically over the past few days. Lebanese officials put the death toll at well over 500. The Israeli military says more than 200 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel and the Golan Heights on Tuesday. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas. The Israeli prime minister visited an intelligence base on Tuesday before meeting with his cabinet and security officials. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator): I say to the people of Lebanon, our war is not with you. Our war is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the brink of abyss. I told you yesterday to evacuate the houses where he put a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage.

Well, the defense minister framed it to troops at the border yesterday as destroying some of the command and control, undermining Hezbollah's morale. He said that their morale was low at this point. But it doesn't and it hasn't changed Hezbollah's intent to fire rockets at Israel. The ballistic missile is the late this morning -- is the latest example of that. But yesterday, 250 missiles -- the day before 215 missiles. So, while the IDF is able to target some of Hezbollah's weapons system storage facilities, it has not taken away Hezbollah's intent to use what they have.

And he basically argued that was the reason he had taken territory inside Russia. So, this will all come to a head on Thursday when President Zelenskyy comes to Washington and again, presses President Biden to let him use those long-range American weapons inside Russian territory.

It is still determined to try and destroy parts of the Israeli military, so that is something that they need to continue to fight against. Now, we've certainly seen that there is an exodus from the southern Lebanon towns, some of the villagers heading to Beirut as civilians are desperately trying to get out of the way of these significant strikes that we are seeing in the southern part of Lebanon and also in the Beqaa Valley and in southern Beirut. But we've spoken to some of those, they've spoken to our teams on the ground in Beirut that have made that journey. One said, it took 14 hours just to get from southern Lebanon to Beirut, a trip that usually takes far less than two hours, because of the sheer number of people that are desperately trying to get out of the way of danger.

The legal team of American gymnast, Jordan Chiles, has submitted a new application in Switzerland's federal supreme court over the decision that lost her an Olympic bronze medal. Chiles was stripped of her first individual Olympic medal after the Romanian gymnastics team challenged the decision to revise Chiles' final score in the floor exercise. The court of arbitration for sport upheld the challenge, so Chiles' bronze went to Romania's Ana Barbosu. However, Chiles' lawyer says new video evidence from a documentary crew that was filming the floor finals proves that the court's prior decision rests on factual error.Octopuses might have eight arms, but that doesn't mean they don't sometimes need a helping hand. Researchers have found that not only do they hunt with other fish, but they enforce punishments on those not cooperating. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EDUARDO SAMPAIO. POSTDOC RESEARCHER, MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR (voice-over):  A new study found that typically solitary octopuses can actually work together with other fish to hunt. Researchers in Germany found that different species of fish share different leadership responsibilities within hunting groups, and that octopuses typically decide whether and when the group should attack its prey. Octopuses were even observed using their tentacles to punch uncooperative fish as punishment to get them to leave the group. This footage helps researchers better understand why different groups of species stick together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
