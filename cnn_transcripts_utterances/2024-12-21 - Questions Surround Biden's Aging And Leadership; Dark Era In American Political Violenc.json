He was not speaking regularly with some key cabinet members, including his Secretary of Treasury, his Secretary of Defense, we found. And he was not always getting the information, he was not always getting -- you know, his news clippings did not always include some of the negative stories. There was a big effort to make sure there were lots of positive stories about a particular event. So there was a limit to the information he was getting.And instead of meeting with some of these people, he was getting briefed by his staff. And the problem with that is you have a filter. Even the most well-meaning, well briefed staff member is still a filter. And we just found that wall meant that the president wasn't necessarily getting a complete view of information that was happening in the world, but also top Democrats and the Democratic elites in this town and in this country, were not getting a full sense of Biden himself and his decline.",

I mean, Axios was really on top of this. \"The New York Times\" is on top of this. But we had the most complete reporting before the debate. And it was a real -- you know, the White House pushed back very hard every step of the way. And I know that my competitors felt that pushback when they were doing similar stories. And, you know, it was an enormous amount of pressure coming from the most powerful institution in the world. But that is what we do. That's what we do at the Wall Street Journal.

And there were times when he really struggled to remember the lines that his team was suggesting as they prepped for how to answer the special counsel -- the answer to the special counsel in what was going to be a five hour interview ultimately with the special counsel.And I was really struck when I learned that, too.

Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old suspect accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, expected to be arraigned Monday on New York State charges which include first degree murder as an act of terrorism. He also faces four federal counts in connection to Thompson's death.Mangione arrived in New York Thursday by helicopter, swarmed by a team of heavily armed officers, with Mayor Eric Adams walking a few paces behind. Our CNN chief, law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller says the tight security is likely due to Mangione's support from the public and concerns about anyone trying to free him from law enforcement. His supporters were seen holding Free Luigi signs and wearing green hats like the Luigi character from the Mario Brothers video games. The acts of political violence are not only becoming more frequent, but appear to be glorified. Once his identity was revealed, Mangione's followers on X, they surged from 67 to nearly half a million a day later. Joining me now is Robert Pape, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. He specializes in security affairs and has been studying political violence for 30 years. A \"New York Times\" interview with him just published under the headline, What the Glorification of Luigi Mangione Reveals about America. Professor, thank you for being here.

Well, that accounts for the meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his issue, immigration.That accounts for the reaction, the violent and aggressive reaction against Donald Trump. And unfortunately, it accounts for many of the acts and growing acts of political violence where increasingly people believe they should take violent action to solve social ills.

And so what we are seeing is a spectrum of perpetrators, and that's reflecting the normal spectrum of the distribution of people in our country. And unfortunately, we are now on the slippery slope where we have to understand that this is occurring not just against targets or corporations we might be angry with today, there's no doubt that there's anger.

And that's exactly, Michael, what we are seeing here on social media. And now it is certainly true that we need to study more about the exact, precise nature of this support related to corporate America.But as we do those future studies know that we already recognize the clear warning signs that this is -- we are on the slippery slope. We're crossing new thresholds. And there's no reason to think that this will stop here, stop with this one corporation. The problem we have is we, again, we have seen political violence against our political leaders across the political spectrum. We've seen political violence against Jewish students on university campuses. Now we're seeing political violence in corporate America. And unfortunately, these are just threshold after threshold that we have been breaking.

But now, a growing trend is changing the way that we drink, live, and socialize without going all in or all out.Almost half of Americans, 45 percent, now say that having one or two drinks a day is bad for your health, according to Gallup. It might not be surprising, but it's actually the highest percentage recorded since the survey started in 2001. This shift in attitudes reflects the rise of non-alcoholic options at restaurants, hotels, and bars. Between 2020 and 2022, non-alcoholic spirits grew by 500 percent globally. The non-alcoholic beer market hit $22 billion in 2022. It's projected to grow 5.5 percent annually through 2032. These numbers tie into dry January, a popular new year's challenge to avoid alcohol for a month. And that's where the sober-ish trend comes in. It's a movement gaining popularity as people reassess their relationship with alcohol, choosing to cut back without fully giving it up. Author and journalist Hilary Sheinbaum knows all about it. Her success with dry January inspired her book \"The Dry Challenge.\" Hilary embraces a mindful approach to socializing, swapping hangovers for non-alcoholic cocktails. Her latest book is called \"Going Dry: A Workbook: A Practical Guide to Drinking Less and Living More.\" Hilary Sheinbaum joins me now. So, what lies behind the trend, and is it just a fad, or do you think it's here to stay? HILARY SHEINBAUM, AUTHOR, \"GOING DRY: A WORKBOOK\": Yes, I think it's here to stay. It's definitely not a fad. People are more in tune with their wellness than ever before, and it's really hard to escape that alcohol has detriments, not just hangovers.",
