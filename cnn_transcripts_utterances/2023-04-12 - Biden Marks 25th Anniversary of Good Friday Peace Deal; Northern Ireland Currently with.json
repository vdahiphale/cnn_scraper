This comes as Mr. Biden made a historic visit to Northern Ireland. Some observer's hivers say his time in Belfast felt a bit brief. After a short meeting there earlier with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Mr. Biden gave a speech marking a quarter century of the peace deal that ended a violent era known as the troubles take a listen.

And this is what he said the United States was coming with a commitment to help ensure the peace here but bringing his envoy to Northern Ireland Joe Kennedy has a specific remit to try to help businesses here. President Biden talking about a huge number of U.S. businesses that want to invest in Northern Ireland said the economy here had almost doubled in the past 25 years. He said that it could triple in the coming years. So there was that aspiration side of it. But I think where the President wanted to push the narrative forward was that bit where he spoke about the importance of the Good Friday Agreement, the importance of the institutions the power sharing government that it created, and the importance of that power sharing government to be up and running. And it isn't at the moment, and it isn't because the main Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party here doesn't think that the Windsor framework and the out flowing, if you will, of Brexit are done to their satisfaction. So the President knew that he had, you know, difficult diplomatic tightrope to walk here because the perception on the Unionist side is too pro-Irish, he doesn't care for their pro Unionist, British sentiments. But he was at pains the President was at pains to point out is English ancestry because everyone and he do talk about his Irish roots. So I think there was an effort there to appeal to the other side. But he was never going to come in here to try to pressure the Democratic Unionist Party because he clearly had been advised that to do that would just backfire. So this was as far as he could go with his language today in trying to persuade them that was the way forward to get back into the power sharing government.",

But just remember, many years ago, an agreement was reached between all of the parties on this island as to what those mechanisms would look like. And the British government came in sighted national security and put a stop to the whole lot. So I not the issue here and Sinn Fein is not the issue in terms of reaching closure and justice for victims. The problem has been and remains the British government and in fact, they're bringing legislation through their own parliament, to grant an amnesty to British soldiers, British agents and their proxies most unhelpful a move that's been condemned domestically and internationally.

Now CNN can't confirm the location where this happened. Now the second video appears to have been shot. We believe in the summer, its location also unclear what you see there and it's somewhat blurred that video. But what you do see is a soldier appears to be a Russian cutting the head with a knife off of a Ukrainian soldier. And it appears that from this video that the Ukrainian soldier was alive when the knife started to slit his throat. Clearly the Ukrainians are enraged at these videos of the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that how easily these beasts killed. Now the Kremlin we heard from Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman, the chief spokesman there saying describing the video as terrible. But he says the authenticity of the video has yet to be ascertained. Now Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Head of the private military company, Wagner Group, who many people believe may have been involved in these atrocities has said that there's nothing in the videos that indicate that his men were involved.

So notably, one of the things here that the Ukrainian prime minister askedSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for when he arrived here this morning, were those F-15, F-16 fighter jets as well as long range missiles. And the secretary of defense would not really comment on those requests directly, instead saying that the U.S. was going to continue to ramp up its production of relevant weapons. But I think that against the backdrop of these leaks that request is very interesting, because in one of these documents that we have reported on, in fact, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is overheard by U.S. eavesdroppers telling his advisers that he wants to strike inside of Russia. And that has been one of the main fears that the U.S. has had about giving the Ukrainians these kinds of long-range weapons is that the Ukrainians will then use them to attack inside Russian territory. Now, the Ukrainians have said repeatedly that they would not use long range U.S. weapons and U.S. provided equipment writ large to strike inside Russia. But obviously this is part of really what's driving the U.S. reluctance to send them that kind of gear. Now, we're also hearing, of course, from allies who are saying that a lot of what is in these leaked documents is not accurate, and also that it can, it could contain some disinformation. It is not our understanding that these documents are in authentic; we are told that they are part of a larger, daily briefing that is provided to senior Pentagon leaders here, but that at least one of them has been doctored. And that is one that shows Russian and Ukrainian casualty figures in the war. One of the documents has an estimate that is a lot lower of Russian casualties than what the Pentagon has actually assessed here. So, there are some questions about how the U.S. is smoothing this over with allies, including with the Ukrainians. Obviously, there is a high-level meeting happening today between the Ukrainian PM and the Secretary of Defense. But a lot of these documents do expose some very sensitive information about Ukraine's military operations that the Ukrainians definitely did not want to be out there, Eleni.",

Because as we saw, some of those documents do have some pretty explosive allegations about things that U.S. allies are doing, including one that said that Egypt was considering sending up to 40,000 rockets to the Russians. The U.S., between the White House and the Pentagon and the State Department, they have been really doing damage control over the last six days or so trying to ensure allies that their secrets are safe, and that their national security is not compromised. But according to our sources, the allies are also very willing to try to help the U.S. in any way they can try to figure out how this happened. And that is really the bulk of what the U.S. is doing right now as well. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation; there are investigations within the Pentagon to try to figure out how this happened. For now, though, the allies, you know, some of them are releasing public statements saying that they are categorically denying the allegations in this intelligence. But the U.S. trying to reassure them, that their partnership is still solid, and that they should continue to share intelligence we'll see whether those allies of course continue to do that as robustly, Eleni.",

Those boats were serious, you know, states of disrepair let's say they weren't very seaworthy, but they have arrived safely. These other two boats, as far as we know, from the NGOs that keep an eye on these things have not been, there's been no operation of rescue that has been started on that yet. But of course, this comes on the back of this state of emergency and we're hearing a little bit of criticism. Italy's arm of the Amnesty International criticized it, saying that they didn't think using the word emergency with migrant was very good for public opinion, especially a year like this when so many people are arriving. And you know, it's very, it's kind of up in the air, what it means in terms of the civil protection and what they're going to be able to do. It's going to be easier to expel people to repatriate people to not maybe give them the chance that asylum that a lot of people might have expected when making that risking their lives coming across here. So, it's a little bit up in the air. We haven't seen, you know; let's say a lot of acceptance from the humanitarian rights groups, but these boats just keep coming. This is year we've seen four times more people arriving this time of the year than we have in years past. And right now, usually April, May, is when the boats start to arrive. This is when we're seeing the calmer weather. So, this puts a lot of pressure on this government under Giorgia Meloni who won last September on an anti-immigration stance. She promised, she want promising to stop those from arriving, Eleni.",

It is set to take place next month at Westminster Abbey in London. Harry will be attending solo, his wife Meghan will remain in California with a couple's two children. The news comes after months of uncertainty over whether or not the pair would attend the coronation due to the fallout over their Netflix documentary and Harry's bombshell memoir Spare. CNNs Royal Historian, Kate Williams joins us now live from Wales. Kate, great to see you! I think we've all been asking that question in some way, you know, is Harry going to attend the coronation? And here it is. But I guess many people are going to be asking why Meghan will not be attending. What are you reading into this?",

She'd remain in California with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. Of course, it is Archie's birthday on May the sixth. We understand that that's played into the decision. But certainly, as you say, Eleni, there's been this endless controversy will Harry come? Will Meghan come? What's going to go on? And there was actually a lot of people saying that they thought Harry and Meghan wouldn't even be invited, which I thought was, I mean, just ridiculous considering that Harry is the king's son. But it is clear that Harry and Meghan have been invited, but only Harry is coming. That's obviously going to be the case. It's only Harry. And we understand that also it's going to be quite a short how he's just going to kind of pop in and out. He's not staying for all the extra banquets and all the extra meet-ups before, so it's going to be a real flying visit from Harry to come around. And so, I think that really what we're seeing here is that Harry is coming to this major event of his father's coronation. But he is not; it's not going to be a family reunion. We're not going to see lots of big family meet-ups. Certainly, there has been damage done.",

You know, Harry's, what Harry's role is going to be. It is interesting to see that they've put you know emotions and feelings aside and Harry attending.
