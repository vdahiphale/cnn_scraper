The provinces governor reports at least 103 people have been killed and hundreds injured.Aftershocks, power outages and the threat of landslides are complicating rescue efforts. The government is putting up tents and building shelters for more than 7,000 people forced from their homes, and Indonesia's location on the so called ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean makes it prone to earthquakes. This one was a 5.6 magnitude. A 2004 quake off Sumatra killed more than a quarter million people in the region. CNN's Anna Coren is following developments for you live this hour from Hong Kong. Anna, what's the latest? What more have you learned? ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Laila, as you say, this earthquake struck yesterday around 1:20 in the afternoon, many people inside particularly women and children after lunch, children at school hence that death toll. It does stand up more than hundred at the moment, but according to officials, that number will rise. The area that we're talking about Cianjur, it's a mountainous area, southeast of Jakarta, about 75 kilometers away from the capital and they could feel the earthquake, that 5.6 magnitude earthquake even in the capital. But here in this mountainous area, the concrete structures, they just collapse. And we're talking about hundreds of buildings collapsing. Authorities saying that most of the injuries caused from the rubble just falling on their -- on people's heads. At the hospital, they're saying it's head trauma, it's fractures that they are treating. And you mentioned the landslides that has also hindered the efforts of rescue crews to get to the area. The main road was shut off at one stage that has now been cleared. But you know, this is time of heavy rain in Jakarta. So, that is another concern that they're dealing with. Plus, these aftershocks. They are in the dozens that have been reported, more than 160 according to local sources on the ground. Now, the survivors were taken to the main hospital that was also evacuated, Laila due to concerns that it was also going to collapse. They were power outages there, people were then treated in the car park and on the grounds. The military has now been called in to set up a makeshift hospital because it's just now at over capacity. But let's have a listen to one mother at the hospital who has a child missing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I have seven children and one of them hasn't been found. The children were downstairs and I was upstairs getting laundry. Everything collapsed beneath me and I was crushed beneath this child. One of my kids is still missing. My house is flattened. Good God, two of my kids survived. I dug them up and this one, two others I brought here and one is still missing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And unfortunately, we have lost Ms. Husein, we have some technical problems there. In China, state media report 36 people are dead and two others are missing after a fire broke out at a factory.

England produced a dominant win over Iran, the U.S. and Wales finished with a draw and the African champions Senegal lost its opener. But the most memorable highlight game before the games were even played. As the Iranian team took the field. The players declined to sing their national anthem, it was considered a sign of support for an anti-government uprising, which has been gripping Iran for months. CNN's Don Riddell reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT CORRESPONDENT (on camera): In the first two games of this World Cup, the two most local teams have played and been outplayed. On Sunday night, the host Qatar were well beaten by Ecuador and then England thrashed Iran 6-2, it was a dream start for Gareth Southgate's men who went to the semifinals in Russia four years ago, and England assume complete control of the Khalifa International Stadium. 19-year-old Jude Bellingham's first international goal was memorable. And there were redeeming goals for Buckeyes soccer, and Marcus Rashford, who missed penalties in the European Championship final last year, and both were racially abused for it. But this game will be remembered for other reasons, England's players all took a knee before the game, a gesture to promote inclusivity, the significance of such an act cannot be underestimated in Qatar, where human and civil rights are often denied. And Iran's players also made headlines by not singing the national anthem that was widely interpreted as supporting the demonstrators who've been protesting against the Iranian government, many of whom have paid for it with their lives. England's win now sets up a mouthwatering clash against the United States of America in Group B on Friday. That's the day after Thanksgiving. The USA are back in the World Cup for the first time in eight years playing against a Wales team that hasn't played in the tournament since 1958. Tim Weah gave the Americans deserve first half lead but they had to settle for a draw as the Wales' megastar Gareth Bale leveled the score with a late penalty. One all is how it finished. Monday's other games saw the African champions Senegal lose to the Netherlands but the game was also heading for a draw until a couple of late goals from the Dutch, Cody Gakpo and Davey Klassen on target there. So, we're now looking ahead to an action packed Tuesday where four games will be jammed in from Group C and D. The defending champions France will be playing Australia, whilst Argentina will be taking on Saudi Arabia meaning the legendary Lionel Messi will be taking center stage in what is his fifth and quite possibly final World Cup. Back to you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Controversies continue to overshadow this World Cup. Let's start with the 11 players of Iran's national team refusing to sing the anthem of the Islamic Republic of Iran, an indelible image. What kind of pressure are these athletes under competing at the World Cup while there is an uprising back home? CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST (on camera): Laila, this is more than a sporting event. Obviously, this is a real test I think of the character of athletes from their nation and young people representing a country. And it's so much more than that, for the Iranian athletes of the soccer players who didn't sing that national anthem who, who clearly could get in trouble back at home for doing -- for not singing the national anthem. And yet, they went ahead and did it in solidarity with Iranian women in the wake of all of the protests and the tragedy over the last month or so there. This really is an incredible stage for those athletes. And they're taking advantage of it and at potentially great personal cost. But what a lesson in doing the right thing, and being role models and leaders for their nation.",

Would they really have issued yellow cards to all those team captains?It's hard to imagine the fallout from that. If you are literally doing that, you are as an organization, as the International Federation running the sport, you are actually tainting your own event basically, is it's just beginning. And so, I would have loved to see England and Wales and Germany and the others call the bluff of FIFA. And say right now FIFA, you're just acting as a mouthpiece for Qatar. And you know what, this is wrong. And we know what's right. And we're going to continue to do what we want to do, I would have loved to have seen that. My guess is that FIFA would have backed down. And it's a shame that those nations didn't really take a page from the Iranians and have the guts and the courage to stand up for what's right. HARRAK: This does raise a lot of questions, though, doesn't it, Christine?

It's purplish. That is why I'm covering it. He forced himself on me. ELBAGIR: Then, a fight broke out with another protester, drawing away Hannah's attacker. Hannah and others could hear screams, and they believe a woman was raped in an interrogation room. Hannah sketched out the police station as she remembers it. She estimates 70 to 80 men and women were together in a main hall that accessed four private interrogation rooms. It was in these interrogation rooms, she says, that she was assaulted and others were raped. CNN was able to locate the police station through Hannah's description, eyewitness corroboration and geolocation, using key landmarks. It's in the Islamabad neighborhood of Irmir (ph). Based on this testimony and speaking to a number of sources, a pattern of repression comes into focus. Police centers used as filtration points, moving protesters from one location to another, often families left not knowing where their loved ones are held. One Iraq-based Kurdish militant opposition party, PAK, identified over 240 people who they believe are missing within this maze of detention centers. Human rights organizations believe the number is higher, in the thousands. Some of the victims as young as 14. Many are man, supporting female protesters. Their punishment, as severe as the women's. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They brought four men over who had been beaten, screaming intensely in another cell. And one of the men who was tortured was sent to the waiting room where I was. I asked him what all that screaming was about. He said, \"They are raping the men.\" ELBAGIR (voice-over): Based on witness testimony, CNN traced the location to an Iranian Army intelligence headquarters. Voiced here by a translator, a 17-year-old boy sent CNN a voice note following his imprisonment. We are withholding his name and location for his safety. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): When a security guard heard me discussing the rape of the other inmates, he started torturing me all over again. They tortured, raped me from behind. ELBAGIR (voice-over): Even as authorities visited sexual violence on protesters, regime figures accused female protesters of prostitution, of quote, \"wanting to be naked.\" Of the incidents of sexual violence against protesters, inside Iranian detention facilities, most occurred in the Kurdish majority areas to the West of Iran, home to a historically oppressed minority. Disturbingly, in some cases, the rapes were filmed and used to blackmail protestors into silence. There has been a real escalation, where female protesters are, as you can see here, being openly assaulted, often sexually. But the violence against women, like the protests, are not confined to the Kurdish areas. They're often focused on locations where the protests are most intense, like here in the capital, Tehran.",

And that means China is tightening restrictions even more than it already has. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: There is a surge in COVID-19 infection across China, with outbreaks in multiple Chinese cities, from the Chinese capital in Shijiazhuang in the North, to the economic engine of Guangzhou in the South, and the mega city Chongqing in the country's Southwest. On Monday, China reported 26,824 new local cases of the virus. That is the highest daily COVID cases reported since mid-April. And although these cases numbers are very low compared to global standards, China has been holding tight to its zero-COVID policy. This policy of mass testing, snap lockdowns, and border controls, which has disrupted both lives and livelihoods. And that policy is testing residents across the country. In Beijing's most populous district, Chaoyang, which is home to nearly three and a half million people, officials have urged residents there, including students and workers, to stay home. According to the deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, quote, \"The number of cases discovered outside quarantine is increasing rapidly at present. And there are hidden transmission risks from multiple places. The pressure on Beijing has further increased.\" Also in the North, Shijiazhuang is undergoing five days of mass testing as the city urges its residents not to leave unless necessary. All shopping centers, entertainment venues are closed, dine-in services and in-class learning suspended. And the tough measures there come just days after the city relaxed COVID restrictions, according to state media. In Guangzhou, the Baiyun district is under lockdown until Friday. The district is home to the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. And on WeChat, local health authorities said this. Quote, \"The risk of social transmission of the epidemic in Baiyun district has continued to increase, and the prevention and control situation is grim.\" Last week, scores of angry residents in another Guangzhou district took to the streets to protest China's tough anti-pandemic policy. Chongqing, China's biggest city, with a population of over 30 million, is also battling an outbreak. Last week, the city government announced that residents are not allowed to leave the city unless necessary. As winter is coming, COVID-19 cases across China are set to rise. The state-run \"People's Daily\" warns that the pandemic may worsen, writing in an editorial this. Quote, \"The situation of pandemic control is severe. We must maintain confidence that we will win, resolutely overcome issues such as insufficient understanding and insufficient preparation,\" unquote.
