It is just awful. And the concern is that we could potentially see more storm-related deaths when everything is said and done.Though we don't know the circumstances of that latest individual, there was still a big concern here for authorities and those folks who've been stranded in their cars, especially last night when there was just whiteout conditions, that people would disoriented and get lost in the storm. So what they're doing, and they've been doing all day, and they'll be doing into the night will be basically just driving the streets of Buffalo and the surrounding regions, and making contact with those people who are stranded in cars. The mayor saying that potentially 200 individuals that could still be out there, that they are trying to make sure that they get safe. There's also some frustration in the voice of officials here, as they say that people do not -- are not really getting it right now. That they are still seeing individuals violate the travel and driving ban, and braving the streets. You could see that should be off in the distance here. Of course we don't know where they may be going. Because officials do say that only essential travel is allowed right now because what they're doing is basically clearing out the streets so they could be drivable, just like the one that you see here in downtown Buffalo, and allow first responders to basically make it out to calls if necessary. But as far as the storm, I'll tell you what, this has been just -- it has not stopped. It really just started yesterday morning, went all day yesterday, continues today and then just a few moments ago, county officials here in Erie County saying that the storm is going to just hover over Buffalo overnight until perhaps we'll get some relief tomorrow.

And so it's made the day so much better for a lot of these migrants. They're having menudo, which is a soup. They brought tamales, which are very traditional during Christmas. And they brought pizza. So people are very excited to have the pizza as well.And when I've asked people, you know, why are you here, why are you doing this, the thing they keep me telling me is, we feel so blessed, it is Christmas because a lot of people in Central and South America celebrate Christmas on the 24th. And they feel like they want to give back, making the lives of these migrants just a little bit easier on this Christmas Eve. I'm going to sort of ask my photographer to turn around because this is a really an impactful sight. There are people bringing gifts for the children. The truck here is full of gifts. And they've already given out so many to the children. So you see the moms picking out gifts for their children. You see the locals handing those out. Again, this is a day that these people normally celebrate Christmas. So it has made a difference for them. I've asked a lot of them, you know, how does it feel to spend Christmas here in El Paso essentially on the street, and a lot of them telling me that it's been difficult. That they'd rather not necessarily think about it, but they're thankful. They're thankful to be here. Look, a lot of them, as you mentioned, cannot go to the city shelters. The convention center is open. But if you don't have the proper documentation, you have to come to one of the nonprofits. So this is what the church has been doing. They have been doing everything they can to fit as many people as possible inside of the shelter at night. And then during the day you just have so many people out here. This is probably the most people I've seen throughout the last couple of days. So there's a lot of movement throughout the day. It's been good because it's been a little bit sunnier so that has helped a lot in terms of the weather and how they are feeling. So overall, I think they're trying to stay positive. A lot of them saying, look, we don't want to stay here. They don't want to live on the street. They're hoping to go off to places where they have family members or friends. But a lot of them don't have money for a bus ticket or for a plane ticket to get to wherever they want to go to. So that's why you see a lot of them still here, still trying to figure out what to do next.

I'm not so sure that that actually could happen. And also there's the criminal referral to the Justice Department. But that's not up to Congress. That's up to the Justice Department whether to prosecute Trump. But that last bullet point here, reforming the Electoral Count Act, which is from the 1800s, that is going to happen. This is a law from a long time ago that dictates how we count the electoral votes. This is literally what Trump and his attorney, John Eastman, and Rudy Giuliani, were trying to exploit when they wanted Pence to throw the election to Trump at the last minute. It was those weaknesses in the law, those loopholes in the law, that they were trying to take advantage of. Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to straighten that out, shore that up. They passed it this week. And it's awaiting President Biden's signature in that massive spending bill. So that's a bit of good news.

But when you talk to 1,000 people, they're not all going to be household names, right. So in this report, in 900 pages, there were details that were just absolutely fascinating.We found a story of an RNC staffer that was ordered to write up fundraising pitches that included claims of the stolen election and assertions that he knew were false. He didn't want to do it. He got fired. And of course the RNC and Donald Trump raised over $200 million with those false claims of fraud. There was lower-level Trump campaign staffers in Georgia that were able to connect him directly to the fake electors plot. That's huge for the committee. They were talking to these lower-level people that were able to provide details that directly connected the president to the scheme. It was a very notable thing. And finally, Paula, there was also a story of a National Guard colonel. I want to give him a shoutout. Craig Hunter, who, a lot of people described as an unsung hero that day because he quickly came up with a plan to get his troops to the Capitol to save the Capitol. Unfortunately, that plan fell victim to bureaucracy and slowness and all of the handwringing among the Trump appointees at the Pentagon. Very slow response. But there were also some heroes that day that people don't really know about that almost were able to get the troops there faster to get everything under control. So in 900 pages, if you look hard enough, you can find some really interesting stuff. And, Paula, of course, now it's all preserved for history.",

Even former President Trump again has constantly called this apartisan witch hunt and says that what is in this report is based on fraud and false allegations and does not claim any responsibility whatsoever, and says that there is no basis for what they found. And he even went so far as to say there is not a single shred of evidence, to say that he's responsible for the violence. Well, it's true. He's right. There's not a single shred of evidence. There's an 845-page report and thousands of interviews that say that he is responsible for this.

The only thing that I can see plausible is for Congress to pass legislation.We know that going into the next Congress where Republicans have control of the House of Representatives, that is going to be all but impossible for them to do because while I completely agree with everything that Alice said, and there are many commonsense Republicans that agree with her and the majority of Americans that agree that Donald Trump is unfit for office, the sad reality is that the majority of Republican voters that include Donald Trump's base, and way too many Republicans that are still in Congress today, including Kevin McCarthy, they were all there helping Donald Trump do what he was going to do. They lack the political will. They lack the spine and the backbone to stand up to what they know were absolute deceitful lies that put our democracy in danger and put us at the point of toppling our democracy. These Republicans will be in charge in the House of Representatives next year. And so while I absolutely concur with the committee, that Donald Trump, we should do everything possible to not allow him to ever hold public office again, I agree with Ron Brownstein who was on with you earlier, who said the blame has to go out wider and bigger in terms of the net. Because there were plenty of Republicans, plenty of lawyers, plenty of elected officials, who went along with Donald Trump. While he was solely responsible and it would not have happened without him, he could not have done it alone. He didn't do it alone. And much of what is in the committee absolutely lays that out. So I hope that that is going to be something that Republicans really look inward to figure out where they stand. Do they stand with Donald Trump, who criminally tried to topple our democracy and the lawyers and the elected officials who tried to do it with him and helped him do it? Or do they stand with the American people, with our country, with democracy and with our Constitution?",

Look, anyone who's ever worked with the White House knows that actually going somewhere with the president takes attention away from the place and puts all of the resources at the trip that the president needs to take. And right now, the border needs all of the resources and all the attention that it can give, in terms of what is going on there.What this president is doing and what this White House and the administration are doing, are trying to put in place a process that will enable a nonchaotic way for these migrants to be given the papers that they need to be given the asylum processes that they are allowed under the law. But let's be very clear, Paula, the White House can't fix this. This has never been an issue that the White House was every going to be able to fix alone. No president can do this alone. The only way that the border will be fixed is if Congress comes together, Republicans and Democrats come together, to figure out a real solution. And I know my friend, Alice, agrees with me. We need to figure out a way to have a legal flow of migrants who want to come here and work and go back home. We know we need workers in this country. So let's try to figure out a way to allow them to do that. We also need to put more resources at the border for security as well as for processing asylum clams. It's the only way that this is going to get fixed, Paula. And so whenever Republicans decry that there is chaos at the border because there is a lack of border security. because the border is open, that to me is a red flag of Republicans not really wanting a solution, of Republicans wanting to continue to use these migrants as political footballs. This is very personal to me. As you know, I am an immigrant. My family came here from one of these countries that these migrants are fleeing from. And to see them today, I just think, my god, there but for the Grace of God go me and my family. And we should be focused on especially today and these days now during Christmas is what can we do to make the lives of these migrants less miserable. You did a great report just now with Camila Bernal at the border. And my heart just goes out to these migrants who, tonight is the night that we celebrate. It's called Noche Buena. We celebrate Christmas, the birth of the baby Jesus at Christmas. And tonight is the night when all of these families are thanking God that they are here even in these miserable conditions, Paula. So you can imagine the kinds of conditions that they fled from, where they were coming from. So let's figure out a solution. Let's be that shining beacon that's sitting on a Hill that Ronald Reagan talked about because we have been anything but with Republicans trying to politicize this every chance they get.",

David, do you suspect any connection between these massive attacks and the Ukrainian leader's speech to Congress earlier this week? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: You know, it's hard to tell, Paula, because we were seeing pretty big attacks in the weeks leading up to Mr. Zelenskyy's visit. So I'm not sure there is, but, you know, the very fact that nobody's discussing Christmas ceasefire or any of the kinds of things that would be traditional in this really tells you that right now we're in the long, hard slog of this war.

He was supposed to have been deposed and perhaps eliminated by the Russians in the first three days, or certainly the first three weeks. For the very fact that he was here nearly a year later, to go celebrate the fact that Ukraine remained an independent state was the first.The second I think was to shore up aid in Congress by thanking the United States for all that it had done, but then putting out a list of what needs to be done in the future. And I think the third thing that was critical to all of this was his effort to try to show that the Western alliance that came together with surprising unity this year, could hold together over what Putin is betting will be a winter of fracture. That is to say that energy shortages, refugee flows, all of that, Putin has been hoping we'll begin to break up the NATO alliance. There is no evidence so far that's the case.

So even if Kevin McCarthy and others will have been questioning whether or not the U.S. wants to continue aid at this pace, even if they're winning adherence to this, I don't see that it's going to make much of a change for the next nine months.I think as you enter the presidential election, the Republican Party is going to have to decide whether or not it sort of sides with Mitch McConnell, who said, aid as long as we need to go, he's essentially taken the same position that President Biden has, or signs up with McCarthy and a number of the Trump wing of the party, who have argued that this can't be a blank check.",
