And those four votes can matter in a close race, they are now leaning much more strongly democratic. But the big one, I think, is Georgia. Most of the Georgia experts that we know and check with felt that Georgia was clearly leaning to Trump for most of this year, even before Biden's troubles. But that isn't true any longer. There is so much enthusiasm and energy for Kamala Harris and the Democratic ticket that those very same people, some of them Republicans, think that this is a very competitive state that Georgia could go either way.

Now, that is normally a Republican state. Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry it in 2008, and he lost it running for reelection. But that is becoming more competitive, because, first of all, the demographic demographics in North Carolina are changing, and those who have professional degrees of one sort or another are becoming more dominant in certain parts of North Carolina. But we're also looking at that because the Republicans nominated, without getting into the details, a pretty extreme candidate for governor, and the Democrats have a more mainstream candidate, and of course, there is a Democratic governor there now who served the past two terms. So, that's having an impact, because some Republicans get turned off by the gubernatorial candidate, and they may not be excited about Donald Trump, and they may not vote. So, will that happen?

At a time when she's had a few good weeks now, of enthusiasm, of momentum, first from her selection, but then the selection of the governor of Minnesota as her V.P. And now, she'll have a convention in about a week and a half that's going to give her another boost, going hopefully into Labor Day or so.

She said basically that she just crouched down and started praying. That was just her next-door neighbor right there. So, I asked her, like, how far was this from your house? Was it 50 feet? 100 feet? She's like, no, no, no, Julia, that is my next-door neighbor. So, she is saying she feels like the luckiest woman in the world right now to have survived this. Also, just to give you some context, this is outside in the countryside of Sao Paulo. The flight was carrying about 68 passengers, four members of the crew, the flight was supposed to be only about an hour and a half. Eight minutes before it was supposed to touch down in Guarulhos, which is the largest airport in Brazil, the busiest one, the hub. Though, it was these flights like this every day, and yet, this happened just about eight minutes before they were supposed to land. She is saying, right now, first responders have blocked off the scene completely. There are firefighters, police, other kinds of first responder, medics, but she can't even go back to get her belongings. Her animals are out with her. The whole scene, of course, is still chaotic, as we're trying to figure out if there were any survivors on this fight.

I thank you for that warning.But when we talk about that type of spin, how we get into those spins is unknown at this point. How the aircraft got into that predicament or not. But we refer that to as a power on stall. Meaning, it didn't have the engines lost, and then it stalled and fell to the ground. This is a power on stall, in which, they are trying to attempt to keep moving forward and get air flow over the wings enough where they can recover from this spin that they're in. And that's sometimes referred to as a flat spin as well. So, as low as it was, and I think they were just on approach to land. As low as it was, it takes quite a bit of altitude to recover from that, because you have to get the nose down and get the aircraft to get some airflow over the wing so that you can recover and pull out of those, those flat spins. And there just wasn't enough airspace for that to be accomplished, and tragically ended the way that it did.",

So, the ones that I would be aware of that have happened before is when there is a last- minute change in the approach path.So, if the aircraft is already planning on making their descent, and they are in that descent, they are coming down, and then, at the last minute, there is something on the runway, or there's something that causes them to make it quick and rapid change to that plan, they may have already had their flaps down, they may already have been in this more slow, slow speed scenario for landing, and if they are in that speed, it's more vulnerable to a flat spin. What can happen is if those flaps then are brought up too quickly, and that airspeed has not been recovered, then at that point you have a low air speed. Your wing isn't configured for that low speed, and then you put the power on. At that point, that aircraft doesn't really know where to go, because it doesn't have enough air flow over the control surfaces to make it go in the direction you want it to. So, in that case, it can stall. And that means that the air flow over the top of the wing is interrupted, and that the aircraft just kind of stalls. It doesn't go forward, it's not going back, it's just stalling. So, it starts to go downward, straight downward, and that's what happens. And then, when you try to recover from it, you put full rudder on, and you try to crank it to one side. And if that doesn't work, you try to get the nose down to get some air speed.
