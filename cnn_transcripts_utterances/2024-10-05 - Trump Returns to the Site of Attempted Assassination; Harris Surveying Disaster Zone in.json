I remember speaking with you when all of that went down, but despite being at the exact same venue today here in Butler, Pennsylvania, a lot is actually very different and security is one of the main things I've noticed. One is that there are far more Secret Service agents and local law enforcement here on the ground in Butler.They're also working together now, under one command center. That is different from what was going on back in July, on July 13th. Another thing we've noticed, they have drone circulating, a much stronger drone control system here right now in Butler, again, increased from July. And then the other thing I've noticed is just the amount of guardrails and barriers they have. And then also, if you will remember, Jessica, when those shots were fired back in July, they came in this direction over Donald Trump's right shoulder from a group of buildings known as the AGR Building off to my right over this shoulder here. They have set up trailers. I can't show you because we're a bit -- we're stationary right now, but there are a ton of trailers that they have put up, blocking that line of sight. So those are just some of the things that they are doing on the ground. Now I can tell you, for the attendees themselves, I've spoken with many people here as some of whom were in the crowd on July 13th. Some of who decided to come because they wanted to honor the victims of that day and they wanted to be a part of this. I spoke with one woman. Her name is Sherry O'Donnell and she told me that she is from Butler. She actually wasn't at that first rally, but she wanted to come to this one because she feels like the community and the town itself needs to close the page on what had happened and have this kind of push them forward into that next chapter. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERRY O'DONNELL, ATTENDING TRUMP RALLY IN BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA: I'm happy for today because Butler can now not have the reputation of having a near assassination attempt. It's redeemed I think as of today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She went to Georgia earlier in the week and now to North Carolina today. And we heard from the North Carolina governor there before she spoke, really banking the administration, saying that significant progress has been made thanks to their efforts, but acknowledging of course there has been a level of devastation and certainly many deaths from that hurricane. So that comes as Harris and the White House are really beating back some accusations from Trump, former president Donald Trump, and her opponent, saying that they have not been getting aid fast enough to that area, so certainly today pushing back on those assertations from the Trump campaign and trying to clearly look presidential, look competent, and it shows some leadership in the aftermath of the storm damage -- Jessica.",

And that he's, you know, essentially a persecuted person. And so I'm sure it will be almost like a vigil in some ways in which he's lauded by, you know, his vice president who's going to be there, who would offensively be on the campaign or his running mate would be there offensively on the campaign somewhere else like in Michigan or Wisconsin. Elon Musk, his children, the Senate candidate David McCormick, and to bring all of these top players and surrogates together suggests to me that this is a larger production than what we're used to from a Trump rally and a moment to really idolize him and maybe, you know, elevate him to, you know, martyr level, like you said.",

Now he had ascended to what Harris said martyrdom status. He had survived.I remember at the RNC the attitude was complete just calm, honestly, and confident. And now this is a much closer race than it was at that time. But, you know, if there was any state for this to happen is Pennsylvania because both campaigns are basically on track to spend over $400 million in this state because this state is the most important state at the moment in this presidential race.

We inherited Trump's disastrous economy. We turned it around, but I'm working for you to push this even further forward. And I acknowledge what you're going through.

And this seems to be the images that they would use or are using to back that up. And what we've also seen on the IDF video, separate videos, they show big cement trucks coming in and pouring cement into those tunnels. Unlike tunnels in Gaza, these ones are hewn into really tough rocket. The border, we know that the IDF has discovered Hezbollah tunnels along that northern border in the past. But this is an indication that they're saying that they are finding these sites that they thought were there. They say that they've killed 440 Hezbollah fighters on ground, ground fights along the border or airstrikes along the border there. And this operation they're indicating or these operations are far from done. The army chief of staff was saying that they will continue to press this offensive right along the border there. And I think it's an indication in these videos that the IDF is showing is discovered what it said it was there. We also understood from Hezbollah that when the troops had been going across, they've set ambushes for them. They've claimed that they've got into intense firefights with the IDF.

So, the Ayatollah, President Pezeshkian, the IRGC and other things. If they want to go after a military capability, then top of that list has to be the nuclear facilities and work that Iran has undergoing. Which I might add that, in the wake of what they've seen with their feckless ballistic missile attacks now twice, my sense would be that the Iranian regime is probably going to conclude that they need to pursue a nuclear weapon at some point here. But continuing along, other military capabilities that they could attack would be ballistic missile launch sites, production facilities, drone factories, also air defense sites would be part of that. And then, the third category of items would be economic targets. So, the most obvious are Irania oil processing distribution refining facilities, most of which are on - are in Western Iran and on the Gulf Coast, which are much easier to attack, to strike, with less risk to Israeli pilots than the strategic leadership targets and nuclear targets, which are deeper in Iran, Northern Iran.",

And that was the right punch that the counterstrike that Iran always had in its back pocket. And at this point now, also, you have had two series of missile strikes, drone strikes by Iran, which have proof feckless. I think the strategic environment has changed dramatically. It calls for reassessment. And the question is, can you reorder things in the region? Because for 45 years - for 45 years the Israeli's have been under attack from three angles, the North with Hezbollah, the South from Hamas and then from the East with Iran.

We are also dealing with incredibly warm sea surface temperatures in the middle and upper 80s. So we're looking at another rapidly intensifying hurricane. It could be up to category two, maybe even category three storm at landfall. Landfall will be sometime late Tuesday into Wednesday. Something to watch closely -- Jessica?",

Based on what we know about today's events and what you have seen unfold since that assassination attempt, do you believe that the Secret Service has learned some lessons here?",

And it highlighted things that the Secret Service was lacking in their protective model.[16:45:03] They had to go through the rigor of a full diagnostic of, how are they applying the protective model not only to the president and vice president, but also to former presidents and political candidates? And out of that review, you will now see an extraordinary amplification of protective measures for all of our political leaders, to include former President Trump helping others that are engaged in the political process. So the Secret Service definitely has learned their lesson. What you're seeing today is the mobilization of, you know, significant resources that are necessary to address the threat environment that former President Trump now faces as the run-up to the election continues.",

The working shift, the women and men that you see around former President Trump or the president United States, they need to be able to communicate with each other.But just as important, Secret Service agents need to be able to communicate with their local law enforcement partners, anywhere they go. And if you think about the thousands of protective events that the Secret Service engages with every year, domestically, that communication is critical. It's a critical component and key to the success of the protective models. So that was one of the key breakdowns on January 13th that has now been addressed. And what you're seeing today is this extraordinary structure that has been set up around communication, command and control, accountability, responsibility among all stakeholders, federal, state, and local law enforcement combined.",

They, just last week, came off the U.N. General Assembly, which was the largest protective assignment around the globe, bringing, you know, over 134 heads of state, plus the president, vice president, and political leaders all to New York. They executed that national special security event near flawlessly. But there's no rest for the weary here. They have to move on. They're in the middle of this campaign. And what you're seeing is agents going from site to site. Burnout is a consideration right now. And that is why, you know, with new funding, they need personnel to be applied the right way to be able to get over the final mile of this election. And then recalibrate their protective model, the staffing models and the retention of special agents moving forward so they can meet the demands of this new dynamic threat environment that they are charged with protecting against.",
