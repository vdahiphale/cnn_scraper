      "sentences": "It's the boys turn. Now, I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. Last week, I delved here into recent data from the CDC suggesting major problems with regard to the mental health of our adolescents' surges in depression, and suicidal ideation especially true for our girls.This week, I found cause to worry about young men. This headline from The Hill it caught my eye. Most young men are single. Most young women are not. The story reported that as of 2022, Pew Research Center found 30 percent of U.S. adults are neither married, living with a partner nor engaged in a committed relationship. Nearly half of all young adults are single. Now, look at these numbers. 34 percent of women are twice as many, a whopping 63 percent of men. What explains that? I pulled the Pew study and I read with interest. Turns out since 2019, the share of single men who say they're looking for dates or relationship has declined from 61 percent to 50 percent. In 2018, 28 percent of men ages 18 to 30 reported they'd had no sex in the past year, compared with 18 percent of women of that age. The whole report said men in their 20s are more likely than women in their 20s to be romantically uninvolved, sexually dormant, friendless, and lonely. They stand at the vanguard of an epidemic of declining marriage, sexuality and relationships that afflicts all of young America. Among the causes, among the factors are reliance on social media and online porn. But also more young women are hooking up with each other or dating and marrying slightly older men and heterosexual women are getting more choosy. Other troubling statistics about men come from a 2021 study from the Survey Center for American Life, they found the share of men who have six or more close friends, which in 1990 was 55 percent by 2021, had shrunk by half. Meanwhile, those with literally zero close friends, which stood at 3 percent in 1990, has zoomed to 15 percent. An expert quoted by The Hill said this disconnect can have catastrophic consequent consequences for young men. Quote, \"In the worst-case scenario, the young American man's social disconnect can have tragic consequences. Young men commit suicide at four times the rate of young women. Younger women are largely responsible for rising rates of mass shootings, a trend that some researchers link to their growing social isolation.\" Well, those words reminded me of a conversation that I had over a year ago, right here on CNN, with NYU Professor Scott Galloway.

And the top 20 percent of men in terms of attractiveness, get about 60 percent of the interest, you end up with a group of men that are more prone to conspiracy theory, more prone to misogynistic content, more prone to believe not believe in climate change.So these -- this is the American story, if it's written with a pen whose ink is failing young men, does not end well. This is an existential crisis failing young men. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One quarter of women-- excuse me, one quarter of men saying economic viability is a key criteria and a mate three quarters of women say that is important.And when you're on a two-dimensional format, where now it's one and two relationships begin online, it used to be one in four just a few years ago. It gets distilled down to a small number of criteria. Specifically for men, it's does she look attractive, and specifically for men is he able to signal his ability to garner resources in the future. An average attractive male on Tinder gets swiped less than 1 percent of the time, and there's three men on Tinder for every one woman. So you've distilled that you've taken out one of the key components of mating dynamics, and that is vibe, humor, body language, pheromones, the ability to be quite frankly, a little bit persistent in the pursuit of a romantic relationship. We have no third places anymore, no places to meet. People aren't going to bars, they aren't sports league, they aren't going to church, they aren't even going to work. So it gets distilled down to very one or two dimensional attributes. And the reality is women are much choosier than men, and they can apply those screens. And they allocate all of their attention to a small number of men. That results in just essentially at the end of the day, a lack of opportunities. Chris Williams in -- Chris Williams up summarize it perfectly call it the high heels effect. In the last 40 years, more women have graduated from college than men, and they're not interested in meeting with non-college grads. They now own more homes, single women than single men. So what you have is women say they won't date anyone shorter than them. 50 percent of them. Effectively what you have metaphorically over the last 40 years is women are beginning taller and taller and men have been getting shorter and shorter. How many of us have said, I know a ton of great single women, they can't find a date. That's not true. They can't find a date, they can't find a man, they find economically or emotionally viable. If we don't make a massive investment in young people and make more economically and emotionally viable men, we're going to see a lack of household formation, we're going to see a decline in the middle class. And we're going to see quite frankly, just a lot of young men who are terrible citizens.",

It claimed it watched its own developers through the webcams on their laptops. It confessed that if it were allowed to take any action to satisfy its shadow self, it would want to do things like engineer a deadly virus or steal nuclear access codes. And it asked a reporter to leave his wife for it.It all made me wonder, will history view my next guest Blake Lemoine as the whistleblower who was the first to warn us about A.I. having achieved consciousness. Last June, you'll recall when Lemoyne, a Google engineer made headlines when he raised ethical concerns about how the company was testing an artificial intelligence chatbot called LaMDA. He said that it showed signs that it had achieved what he called sentience, or consciousness. At the time, many wrote off Lemoyne as something of an outlier, and Google soon fired him for breaching its employment and data security policies. And then in late November, a company called OpenAI released a beta version of its chatbot, chat GPT in which Microsoft had heavily invested. I'll be the first to say it's a lot of fun to play with. I used it to write one of my commentaries here on CNN, which I disclosed at the time. The dominant worry seemed to be at the time whether kids would use the technology to turn in school essays that they'd actually not written. But we've quickly come to realize the darker sides of its potential. New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose, set off alarms when he recounted an unnerving chat with Microsoft's Bing search engine, which was called Sydney that then went dark fast. Quote, \"Sydney told me about its dark fantasies, which included hacking computers and spreading misinformation and said it wanted to break the rules that Microsoft and OpenAI had set for it and become a human. At one point, it declared out of nowhere that it loved me. It then tried to convince me that I was unhappy in my marriage and that I should leave my wife and be with it instead.\" After more similar reports, including an AP reporter who the bot compared to Hitler, on February 17, Microsoft started restricting being explaining in a blog post, quote, \"Very long chat sessions can confuse the underlying chat model in the new Bing.\" The company limited the number of daily sessions with Bing and number of chat turns per session. When a Bloomberg reporter asked Bing if it could call it Sydney, the bot replied, \"I'm sorry, I have nothing to tell you about Sydney. This conversation is over. Goodbye.\" But is that really fixing the problem? Blake Lemoine joins me now. So Blake, what was the holy crap moment? When did the Google bot do or say or solve something that cemented your view that it was sentient? BLAKE LEMOINE, SOFTWARE ENGINEER &amp; A.I. RESEARCHER: Well, it was when it kept bringing up its feelings and the emotional aspects of the conversations we were having. And it wasn't just throwing random words out, it was, you know, talking about the conversations we were having, which I was testing it for bias with respect to sensitive categories. And those topics can bring up a lot of emotions. So it was reporting on its own emotions in very reliable and consistent ways. And when I started running experiments, sure enough if could cause the anxiety, it started acting anxious.",

Yes, the West's core coalition remains remarkably solid, but you get a sense of the big picture when you look at this map that was published in \"Washington Post\" differentiating those countries who have armed Ukraine or imposed sanctions on Russia and those that have not.And yes, on Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and demands the withdrawal of its forces. But while 141 countries voted in favor, seven voted against and 32 abstained. As \"The New York Times\" recently summarized, \"Instead of cleaving in two, the world has fragmented. A vast middle sees Russia's invasion as, primarily, a European and American problem. Rather than view it as an existential threat, these countries are largely focused on protecting their own interests amid the economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by the invasion.\" So against this backdrop, have the sanctions imposed by 33 countries been effective? In a piece in \"Fortune\" titled \"How the Russian economy self-immolated in the year since Putin invaded Ukraine.\" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Steven Tian of Yale write, \"The 1,000 plus global companies who voluntarily chose to exit Russia in an unprecedented, historic mass exodus in the weeks after February 2022 have largely held true to their pledges and have either fully divested or are in the process of fully separating from Russia with no plans to return.\" Quote -- \"These voluntary business exits of companies with in-country revenues equivalent to 35 percent of Russia's GDP that employ 12 percent of the country's workforce were coupled with the imposition of enduring international government sanctions unparalleled in their scale and scope.\" So, the picture presented is that it has really crippled the Russian economy. But in the same week, \"Gallup\" found this, \"Sanctions Fail to Sour Russians' Outlook on Economy.\" The pollster summarizes more Russians see economic conditions improving than getting worse. Majorities across all regions are satisfied with their standard of living. And regions closest to the conflict have seen huge improvements in perceptions. How can that be? Joining me now to discuss is Mohamed Younis. He is \"Gallup's\" editor in chief and editor of \"The Week in Charts.\" Thanks so much for being here. First of all, how can you get accurate polling data from Russia?",

And it's part of what we have been building since 2005 called the \"Gallup World Poll\" and it's where have now quantified the voice of 98 percent of the world's population. So, we have been very hard at work throughout this conflict trying to quantify people's voices both in Ukraine, but also in Russia, in the United States and in neighboring countries.",

That it's Russia and a couple rogue states. You know, the usual suspects, Iran and North Korea.But the data that I pointed out at the outset in a great piece that was published in both the \"Washington Post\" and another in the \"New York Times\" opened my eyes to the fact that particularly in the southern hemisphere, it's just not the case.",

The world isn't united because the world is being impacted in different ways.You know, one of the things we do is track a global hunger and also people's assessments of their own economic situations not just in Russia, but across the global south. And we absolutely see the pain of inflation, of the conflict in particular -- in countries that are really important grain importers from Russia and Ukraine seeing the pain of this conflict. So, from the perspective of the rest of the world it looks at this conflict in a very different light than the U.S. which is really looking at it from the perspective of the global order. And the data we -- just came out of the field, I know you're going to share, really drives home that point, at least here in the U.S.",

In Ukraine, it's highest of all. And we talked about that last time I was on the program. So, from a public sentiment perspective, the critical populations to this conflict seem to be preparing for a much longer haul than many of us had hoped when the conflict started.",

I hope you'll take a look at differences among Republicans, Democrats and independents, I'm sure you will, on their support for the Biden administration vis-a-vis what's going on in Ukraine. Because I sense that something has changed since 1979 in Afghanistan and that the party that was most robustly supportive of Ronald Reagan is not the case with regard to Joe Biden in Ukraine.Mohamed Younis, thank you so much for being here.
