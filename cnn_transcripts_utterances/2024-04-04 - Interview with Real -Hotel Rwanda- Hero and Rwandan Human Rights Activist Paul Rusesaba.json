Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Almost one million people murdered in just 100 days. It seems unfathomable, but it did happen. In Rwanda, in 1994, militias and civilians from the country's majority ethnic group, the Hutus, killed their Tutsi neighbors and moderate Hutus. That genocide was 30 years ago. So today, we take a look back at the terrible atrocities committed, the absence of any international intervention, and the legacy of that massacre. President Biden is sending a delegation to Kigali this weekend, led by former President Bill Clinton. In Rwanda, reconciliation is the word, as President Paul Kagame makes clear on every anniversary.

And in many ways, I went into journalism because I wanted to keep myself out of the story. You know, I had grown up in an environment where a lot of people around me, to be quite honest, had a lot of confidence about the answers. And I didn't always have that same confidence. And I think journalism, in retrospect, was a place where I could ask questions and look for answers rather than try to start with them. So, I want to say that, first of all. But, you know, when I was assigned to cover the 2016 election, I was assigned to cover the Republican primary by NPR. Donald Trump, of course, was, throughout most of that race, the front-runner, even though a lot of people didn't believe that he would really stay in that position, and so much of the story wound up centering around the white evangelical Republican base. You know, would they accept this, you know, thrice-married, rather brash, often crass person who seemed so antithetical to everything the movement said it stood for? And I did those stories, you know, our colleagues, and I think you did some of those stories about how were white evangelicals responding to Trump, and I covered them just as a journalist, as we always do. But over time, as I thought more about that election and the white evangelical movement and sort of watched the aftermath of that election unfold, I realized that I had a story to tell, and that I had been seeing things throughout that campaign and in the years that followed that resonated with and reminded me of things I saw as a child. And so that's really, you know, what this book comes from is a desire to integrate my personal story with my professional story, two things that ran headlong into one another in 2016.",

It might be described as not having their heart right with God, as having not accepted Jesus, of not following the right path, not walking with the lord is even a phrase that be applied to people who were, you know, sort of in the church but maybe not expressing it enough or not showing through their behavior in ways that people in that church thought was adequate, that they were part of the -- you know, in-the-fold. And so, there was a lot of fear. There was a fear of stepping out of line of angering God, of displeasing God and ultimately, of going to hell. I mean we -- you know, that hellfire and brimstone imagery that you associate, you know, maybe with sort of old-timey creatures, that was a big part of my life. And, you know, something I talk about in the book is the fact that while most people I knew were evangelical Christians, I was kind of deliberately and intentionally surrounded by evangelicals at my Christian school and my church and so forth. One of the few people I knew who was not was my own grandfather, and we were very worried for him. I would lie in bed at night. I talk about this in the book, just, you know, fearing for his soul, afraid that he was going to go to hell forever.

And again, my grandfather was a really big part of that for me. I always struggled with the idea that there was something wrong with him, you know, both because he wasn't a Christian and also because, as I talk about in the book, he had come out -- after my grandmother passed away in the '80s, he'd come out as gay, late in life. And that was a source of a lot of conflict and tension in my family. You know, this was, again, a time when, you know, the moral majority was on the rise, the Christian right was rising. My parents were very influenced by people, by, you know, right-wing leaders like James Dobson and Gary Bauer and Ralph Reed and others, and, you know, people who were fighting against same-sex marriage and fighting the abortion rights. And so, the idea that my own grandfather was living in this \"lifestyle,\" I think was very difficult for my parents. It really clashed with their beliefs. And it meant that we were -- my siblings and I didn't spend a lot of time with him because he was seen as sort of a threatening figure.

You know, something I talk about a lot is the fact that if you left a religious community 20 or 30 years ago, you know, there might be a few books out there, you probably would run into other people who'd had a similar experience, but there was no major organized way to find other people who'd been on that journey, which can be very disorienting and isolating. And today, because of the internet, there are Facebook groups, there are podcasts, there are hashtags, there -- you know, ex-evangelical is a hashtag I first came across when covering the 2016 campaign and talking to some white evangelicals who were feeling a bit disillusioned with the alignment of evangelicalism and Trump. But that has -- you know, that hashtag has kind of blown up online in recent years. And there are conversations going on around religious disaffiliation across the board. This term deconstruction is kind of a similar related idea that people are talking about. It's become a language, really, for this experience of rethinking one's faith background. And I should say that, you know, evangelicals are -- evangelicalism has been on sort of a long-term downward trajectory as a percentage of the population for the last 20 years or so. It used to be about one in four people were white evangelicals. Now, that's more like 14 percent. But that is not unique to evangelicalism. White Christianity as a whole is on the decline, and the country is becoming more secular, perhaps more like Europe. And so, there's a lot of shifting that's happening. There's also some evidence that some people are actually attracted to the evangelical label because of Trump. And so, what seems to be happening is there are a lot of risks in churches and a deepening of some of the sort of political polarization that goes with the evangelical label.",

I think it's early to say, and I think people who have left religion in part because of disaffection with some ofthe politicization of religion, both ex-evangelicals and some former Catholics, they form a pretty big group of people. And there's a host of reasons why people leave. A lot of it -- some of it has to do with just simply not believing the things that their churches teach. But the polling I've seen from groups like the Public Religion Research Institute suggests that particularly the treatment of LGBTQ people by much of the Christian right is a major factor for particularly a lot of younger people disaffiliating from their churches. And, you know, if you take this group on the whole of people who call themselves Nones, N-O-N-E-S, or nothing at all, they are a group that leans left. They tend to vote for Democrats, but they're also less politically engaged than white evangelicals. So, what you have is maybe a big group of people that's sort of loosely connected in the sense that they've left religion maybe partly for political reasons, but they don't seem to be organized yet around a common goal. I think that's the challenge for political organizers, you know, that white evangelicals, while they are a shrinking part of the population, remain a very politically engaged and unified voting bloc. And that's really what Donald Trump saw and tapped into. Now, where that goes long-term, I think is a fascinating question because there is so much that's in flux right now when it comes to American Christianity and American religion in general.",

I wanted to include those people. I wanted to love them. I wanted to see them as just as valid as me. And that necessitated a shift in my own thinking, but that shift, and not just for me, for many people I talk to, it can be very isolating and scary because it means -- you know, it sorts of leads to the question of, well, if I change this part of me, then what else changes?
