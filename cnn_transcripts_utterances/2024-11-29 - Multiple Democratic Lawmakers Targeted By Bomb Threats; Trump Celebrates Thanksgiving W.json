We are safe, and there was no evidence of a bomb on our property. Now this follows at least five such threats yesterday, targeting Democratic lawmakers from Connecticut and multiple bomb threats and swatting calls on Wednesday aimed at President-elect Trump's cabinet picks and other appointees.

Thanks to the swift reaction from law enforcement, no devices were found, members of Congress and their families were kept safe on the holiday. That's what the minority leader is saying right now. The authorities who are investigating this are not saying much at all. The FBI the U.S. capitol police, they're keeping it very close to the vest on this, in large part because one, they want to get all the information. They can also because they do not want to spur a lot of copycat efforts out there. And I must say, there's really no indication where this is coming from at this point or if it is even a localized threat. There is some thought in law enforcement to say you have to look at whether or not these are international players who are just trying to stir the pot here around the holidays after this very contentious election. They have a lot of information to go through. It's something they are experienced at. I must say, though there are thousands of these threats that come into members of Congress every year and they have been growing in recent years.

Both of these leaders had described the call as relatively positive as being cordial, but then walked away with very different accounts of what was said.Now, the reason this is so important is because we know that the relationship between Donald Trump and President Sheinbaum is going to be one of the most important, given what Donald Trump had vowed to do throughout his entire time on the trail, really trying to crack down on crime, as well as illegal immigration. And one thing to keep in mind as well is we know that as I'm talking to Donald Trump's team, they have been floating, bringing back the policy informally known as the remain in Mexico policy. That would require migrants to stay in Mexico while they seek asylum and go through the immigration system. Unclear how this is going to be handled moving forward, but of course, as well. Another very important thing is that this also came after Donald Trump threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico, something we also saw Sheinbaum respond to. She said that they would Mexico would retaliate with their own tariffs in like if Donald Trump were to do that. So this could be a very tense relationship moving forward -- Erica.",

So as we look at where things stand, the reality is it is not uncommon for leaders to maybe highlight different parts of a call. They want to bolster their own messaging. But the fact, Tiffany, that there is such a clear disconnect here, specifically on the border and what was said there, does that surprise you? TIFFANY SMILEY (R), FORMER WASHINGTON SENATE CANDIDATE: No. You look, you know, Trump's tariff threats are a clear negotiating tactic and it is how President Trump governs. That's why he was so successful in his first term. Since he has been elected, I think we also need to look at the E.U., who is now considering switching their gas supply from Russia to the U.S. The president has had talks with Canada very productive talks. They're looking for ways to work together. And as far as Mexico, 80 percent of Mexico's exports, 30 percent of Mexico's economy comes directly to the U.S. So President Trump clearly has the leverage in these negotiations, and Mexico's president, she knows that she has to work with President Trump. She really has no other option.

Look, we've had 75 percent lower border crossings already this year for which Donald Trump will take full credit on January 20th, despite the fact that he ran on some crazy unsecured border. The reality is, the situation at the border has gotten better in the last year by leaps and bounds. That's one.Two, if you want to talk about retaliatory tactics, most of our fruits and veggies come from Mexico. One out of every five cars is made in Mexico. If we want to have these kinds of crazy tariffs on Mexico, Mexico could easily retaliate. But we export more to Mexico than we import. And the problem is that it's going to be the American worker who's going to be harmed. And Donald Trump knows that. And the people around Donald Trump know that. So he's going to go ahead and bluster, which is what he does best he's going to go ahead and say that he threatened Mexico, that Mexico caved. But the reality is that there are already many, many, many fewer border crossings. And so he's going to just say, I threatened them and that's why there are so many fewer border crossings on day one of my presidency. Of course, that's not the case. They've been going down all year this is typical Trump. None of this is going to happen. As for and let me just fact check one thing -- Russia and the E.U. have not had the best of relationships in the last four years. So if you think that somehow Russia is supplying the E.U. with all of their energy after what's been happening the last couple of years, I think there's a lot of things that we have to go back and fact check about that fact. But, of course, that's all going to change now that Trump and his best friend Elon Musk are back in power and Vladimir Putin is going to start getting his way. Watch those, watch those sanctions evaporate and look for Russia to start exporting much more of its energy back into the United States and all around the world because of the leadership failure of Donald Trump.",

But here's the thing, a judge in Denver, a federal judge, decided essentially that, yes, this player identifies as transgender but allowed her to play because she meets those standards. The appeals court upheld that decision, and the conference commissioner also put out a statement which I want to read to you, where she says the student athlete in question meets the eligibility standard.And then she went on to say it breaks my heart because they're human beings, young people, student athletes on both sides of this issue that are getting a lot of national negative attention. And despite the negative attention, despite the lawsuit, the back and forth, a judge said that this player is going to be able to play. So what is going to happen is that they're likely going to be able to play that final match on Saturday, despite all of this controversy, Erica.",

So, Christine, when we look at this, as Camila points out, the Mountain West Conference, you've got a federal judge, a federal appeals court, all saying this player is eligible and as Camila also pointed out, this came up in April. This is a player who, as I understand it, has already played multiple seasons with no issue. Is it your sense that this is maybe a sign of things to come in college sports?",

And here we are again. And I do think this is a -- an issue that has roiled the nation in many ways, our culture and sports. And it's certainly an issue that's not going away. I think it is important to note that this one really does have that political genesis, so to speak, the conservative website in April that you were referring to that that did out this player and did mention this and got this, this whole story going, and it is set against the backdrop, of course, of the election year, and the Donald Trump campaign and his use, of course, of commercials and anti-trans language and policies. So this is something that is as if we, as you mentioned this player has played for three seasons prior to this without any incident. As far as we know, with no injuries to other players, no problems at all. Two at San Jose state prior to this one, and then a year before that at another college. So why now?

We are seeing videos of prisoners being liberated from regime jails. This is a massive development in a situation that had been fairly stalemated for the last 4 or 5 years, certainly since March of 2020, when Russia and Turkey, which both have military forces in northern Syria, had agreed to a ceasefire which by and large held there had been occasional skirmishes and the rebels had been fighting among themselves. But now, they've united into this coalition which, as I said, has managed to really sweep aside regime forces. Now, why is it possible that they've done this now? Well, for one thing, Erica, Hezbollah, which had provided ground troops for the Syrian regime because of its fight with Israel, had basically withdrawn all their troops from Syria leaving the Syrian regime largely exposed. They do have the backing of Russia Russian air and ground forces. But it appears that they have not intervened in a meaningful way to stop this dramatic rebel advance into Syria's second largest city -- Erica.",

The Paris landmark, of course, was heavily damaged by fire in 2019 as workers in the French public applauded outside. French President Emmanuel Macron toured the inside of the cathedral ahead of its official reopening next weekend.CNN's Melissa Bell was also there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A new dawn for Notre Dame Cathedral, more than five and a half years after a fire tore through parts of the gothic structure in the heart of Paris, sparkling stonework highlighting the stunning results of the estimated $737 million restoration as it was unveiled to France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. After the 2019 blaze, the president had vowed to rebuild Notre Dame even more beautiful than it was. Entering the cathedral with his wife Brigitte on Friday, it was clear that France had achieved just that. It was at the same time repaired, restored and re-baptized, Macron said. Millions had watched in shock and horror as Notre Dame's 96-meter spire tumbled into the church during the 2019 blaze. Now its renaissance is complete. Touring the epicenter of the blaze, the medieval roof structure known as the forest, Macron saw the beams rebuilt by hand from 1,200 oak trees from across France. Among the highlights of Macron's tour, a mural in the north enclosure of the choir that was badly damaged in the fire, and the Virgin of Paris, a 14th century statue that became a symbol of resistance when it was found standing resolute surrounded by burnt wood and collapsed stone. And the beautiful Saint Marcel's Chapel, one of 29 chapels that have been lovingly restored. Viewing the 12-meter wide grand organ, Macron described it as sublime. More than 1,300 people involved in the restoration were invited inside, as the French president wrapped up his final visit to the site before its formal reopening. You have transformed ashes into art, he told them. The whole planet was upset that day in April, the shock of the reopening will be as big as that of the fire, he said, thanking the crowds.
