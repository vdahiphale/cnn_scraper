Plus, 19 days out, from the first votes of 2024, new ads and new strategies, from Trump's Republican rivals. The question is, will it make a difference? Also, a new frontier of one of America's biggest media companies, now go into battle, with artificial intelligence and what it means. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, two State Supreme Courts, with two very different outcomes, over whether or not Donald Trump is disqualified, from seeking the presidency, for a third time, under the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban. In Michigan, justices there, rejecting an effort, to boot Trump, from the primary ballot, on procedural grounds, though appearing to leave the door open, for renewing these efforts, playing out in many states, in the general election. Meanwhile, the Republican Party, in Colorado, has just asked the U.S. Supreme Court, to overturn that State Supreme Court's unprecedented decision, to kick Trump off the primary ballot, with the ruling arguing that he not only incited an insurrection, but participated in it. Trump responding, to what happened in Michigan, and what could happen soon, in Colorado, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: It's very bad for Colorado. Very, very bad for Colorado. But we just had the big win in Michigan today. And that was a good one. And we have 31 -- and we have 33 wins. And this isn't a loss because we'll have to see what happens. This is not a final determination as you know. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Tonight, decisions are still pending, in Oregon and in Maine. Whatever these states decide, it does appear increasingly clear that all of this could ultimately be up to the nation's highest court, to settle this matter. Here tonight, CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, and former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. Also, with us, conservative lawyer, and Contributor for The Atlantic, George Conway. Elie, let me start with you. Because this Michigan ruling is obviously a win for Trump. But can you just kind of walk us through how the Michigan Supreme Court comes to this decision, when we saw a very different decision, still a 4-3 one, from the Colorado Supreme Court, just last week?",

I mean, we see different states, seemingly every few days, coming to different resolutions, based on different criteria.But if I had to sort of unify what happened here, how do we get one resolution, in Michigan, the other in Colorado? The answer is that in Colorado, there's this pre-existing legal procedure, that you can use, to challenge someone's qualifications, for the ballot. So, they had this mini hearing, took five days, back in October, November. And the Colorado Supreme Court said \"Good enough.\" In Michigan, there is no comparable proceeding. So, the Michigan Supreme Court, today, essentially said, we don't have a way to do this in this state. My general criticism, complaint, about this 14th Amendment effort is I don't believe it's up to the states at all. I think the 14th Amendment is clear, on its face, that it's up to Congress, to tell us how this works. And they've not delegated that to the state.",

That nowadays, they've been looking at the last three years, and they've been saying, \"Gosh, I voted for Biden, because I thought he was going to put things back to normal.

They certainly aren't thinking about Donald Trump. And so, I think the challenge, for the Biden campaign, the task for them, in this coming year, is to really make this contest, about what Donald Trump has said he will do. I thought, actually, John Bolton said it very, very well. Donald Trump cares about Donald Trump. He doesn't actually care about, about you or your family. And he's not interested in doing anything that's actually going to help you or your family. And so, for the Biden campaign, what they've got to do is define the contours of this race. Make very clear what a second term of the Trump presidency would mean. Because Trump, of course, is an incumbent this time around too, right? That's another key difference between the kind of race he ran in 2016, and the race, he's got to run this time. There are a lot of promises he made, he didn't keep. And then, of course, there was a lot of chaos and a lot of damage that he did that sort of, swing voters is dwindling, as they are, are comfortable with. And the more they're reminded of that, the more they see the clear choice between the two, I think Biden will benefit over time. But that, to me, that's what this campaign is going to be about.

But I can tell you that when we detain people, it's only when we know that they are involved in the terrorist activities. And unfortunately, we saw in Gaza, many cases of teenagers, and women, that are actually collaborating with Hamas. And that is why we take precautions, when we arrest them. If we found out that they are not involved, we'll release them immediately. But we have. We have arrested the hundreds of people, who collaborated with Hamas. And many times, they were able to attack our troops. So, it's disguising, when you see somebody who seems innocent. But right after he passes by the troops, he will -- bombing himself. We had one issue of a suicide bomber. That's why we take those precautions.",

We still have the hostages. We still need to eradicate Hamas. We are moving forward. Sinwar and the leadership of Hamas, I am sure that they can hear the tanks stay above them. So, we are operating in order to capture the leadership of Hamas. But we are willing to talk about the day after, which will for us, it's very simple. We need to demilitarize Gaza. And we need to have a process of denazification of the people of Gaza. That's the challenge. The same way the U.S. and the Allies did in Nazi Germany, or in Japan, that's something we're looking to do, including partner for the international community, to do in Gaza, to build a new future, for the people in Gaza, not to reconstruct a terrorist state all over again.",

And in that gaggle that Mexico's top diplomat, Alicia Barcena, gave to Spanish-speaking media, and obtained by CNN, it was a short gaggle. But the diplomat did mention that this was a very good meeting. She said, and hinted at this agreement that would be later announced, in a joint statement, by both countries. So, we'll see what that will be.She also mentioned that some of the discussion points were about the root causes of migration, things like violence, and also family separation and reunification, why some migrants decide to make the trek, and come to the United States, is to reunify with their families. And she also mentioned the economic impact, of the port of entry closures. Now, these closures were made by the United States, to respond to this latest surge. There are multiple ports of entry, including one here in Eagle Pass that is closed. While Barcena mentioned that that was one of the top priorities, for Mexico, because as you know, Mexico is the United States' top trading partner. So, both countries have a lot to lose, economically, if these ports of entry continue to be closed. So, that was one of the things that she mentioned. As for what the United States was hoping for, in these talks? Kaitlan, as we've talked about before, the United States was expected to ask Mexico, to move migrants, south, to control the railways, which are used by migrants, to move north, towards the U.S. southern border, and also to provide incentives for migrants, to stay in Mexico. And bottom line, whatever Mexico does, or doesn't do, Kaitlan, it will impact how many migrants end up on the U.S. southern border.",

What are you hoping will be included in that? EDDIE MORALES, (D) TEXAS STATE HOUSE: We've got to stop the 100 percent commercial inspections that are taking place. That is a Governor Abbott initiative, in order to send a message to Coahuila, and to the rest of Mexico, that their migrant surge, and their help with Texas and the United States is not doing enough. I think we've now seen that Mexico has responded. Our numbers, in Eagle Pass, has drastically reduced. And I think we can end those 100 percent commercial inspections on commercial trucks. Because we're going what used to be a 30-minute drive, from Piedras Negras, into Eagle Pass, is now taking anywhere from five to 10 hours, for these commercial vehicles to cross. And it does nothing to stop the migrant surge. Because the migrants are not coming through the 18 wheelers.

And one of the things that The New York Times notes in its complaint is that they're not just scraping, its free content, but they're also scraping content behind its paywall, which I think will help The New York Times. But ultimately, this is the type of battle that's going to play out, in courts. Don't expect Congress to pass laws.
