There have been a lot of studies done, especially after -- around the 2016 election, 2020 election, that showed that black women had the highest level - had the highest level of anxiety around the election results.In part because they know the effect that liberal policies or the erosion of civil rights could have on their day to day lives. Not only that, it's not just a fear, it actually, for many of them, it came true. And we have seen the erosion of many of these rights. Affirmative action, reproductive rights, maternal rights, economic rights. And so I think part of what Michelle Obama is trying to tap into is a reminder that there is so much at stake. With that being said though, I think that the - the Obama - the Obamas have to be very careful because it's also true that many of those anxieties have arisen during other presidential administrations. It's not just Donald Trump. It's our leaders more broadly, right? That our leaders in this country are, you know, eroding the very fabric of democracy. And so when you hit on that, I think it also reminds people that it's not just Donald Trump, although that is the most explicit, but that there are other leaders under whose kind of - whose guidance people have seen mass erosion of their rights.",

This argument that Trump's lawyers are about to make in court, that he's choosing to be there to witness, what does it mean for history either way that it goes?",

He would probably be the closest in any event. But nothing on the scale - nothing on the scale of what Donald Trump is offering today, right, and what his lawyers are arguing and essentially saying anything that he did under the - you know, the rubric of the presidency he is immune from prosecution.With Richard Nixon it was something different. It was something about a very specific, can presidents be held to a very specific standard and be forced to turn over things to, you know, the independent investigation surrounding the case of Watergate. So, what Trump is trying to do is something radically different, and his lawyers are trying to do. And, in fact, it would actually change because what it would mean going forward is that any president couldn't be held to any kind of criminal standard or investigation or kind of consequences outside of impeachment if we say that presidents have immunity for anything that is done in office. Now, on the one hand I think perhaps that is, you know, it is a question that we need to investigate. It is one that his lawyers are trying because it is a relatively good legal question that needs to be answered. For many years we've had questions about the actions of presidents while in office. But we've never actually gotten to, is this a - is this criminal, is it civil, can they be held liable. Now we are answering that question. And I have to say, while I'm sure that the independent counselor in this case, Jack Smith, is pretty pissed off, it's been a roller coaster with Donald Trump deliberately, I'm also sure that he probably wants to get - wants to get an answer to this as well. Like, stop wasting my time. If I need to be here, then I'll be here. But if I don't need to be here, let's abolish this. And moving forward we don't hold presidents to that standard.",

You can see it in the poll numbers since the New York - the New York case back in April.Do you see a moment where that diverges? JOSH BARRO, WRITER, \"VERY SERIOUS\" NEWSLETTER: Well, I think it's different than a general election than in a primary. I think that there's a lot of sympathy for Donald Trump among Republican primary voters who think that he's being railroaded. I thought Harry's point about that, you know, it helps him raise money, and you can see the spikes when he shows in court on these days when he doesn't need to be there. I think that's interesting. In a general election, I mean most voters have an unfavorable view of Donald Trump. If he's to win this election, it will be by winning voters who have an unfavorable view of both him and Joe Biden. He's not going to win them over through sympathy over his legal problems. He's going to win them over by attacking the president for having allowed prices to go up too much and, you know, chaos at the border and that sort of thing. So, perhaps once he's locked up a nomination, there will be a shift in that strategy and he won't be showing up voluntarily at these things anymore.",
