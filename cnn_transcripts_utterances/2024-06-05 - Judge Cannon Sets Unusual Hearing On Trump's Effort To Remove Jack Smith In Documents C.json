The Georgia conspiracy case now on ice indefinitely. And in Florida, Judge Cannon's unusual decision about Trump's push to get Jack Smith fired. Plus, post-conviction payback as Trump's most serious threat, so far, is sounding more like a promise, to investigate his enemies, and potentially have them thrown in prison. And also, we're tracking significant new concerns, tonight, about a potential new front, in Israel's war with its enemies. An influential former Prime Minister of Israel will join me here, live. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Fresh off a felony conviction, and awaiting sentencing that could include prison time, potentially, Donald Trump is scoring some pretty big legal wins, tonight, in his push to delay any other case, from going to trial, before Election Day. In Georgia, an appeals court has just halted the conspiracy case against Donald Trump, and his co-defendants, indefinitely, as it considers whether the District Attorney, Fani Willis, should be removed from the case, which they are obviously trying to do. All of this stems from that romantic relationship that she had with the lead prosecutor that she put on this case. Nathan Wade is now gone from the case. But this trouble is still here, for Fani Willis at least. The accusation is that she benefited from -- financially, from his appointment, by spending his salary, on things like vacations together, an allegation that I should note Willis, in a very dramatic courtroom moment, flatly denied.

The judge, in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case has now kicked the can so far down the road, it's hard to even see it, at this point. There's just about zero chance that this trial sees the light of day, before the election. Judge Aileen Cannon has also now agreed to hold a hearing, on Trump's push, to get Jack Smith removed from the case. Of course, Trump and his team are claiming that Smith was illegally appointed, as the Special Counsel who's overseeing that and the case in Washington, D.C. But not only is this a further delay in Florida, as Trump motions are stacking up like planes on a runway, motions that I should note Cannon has yet to rule on. The most immediate issue now becomes, is Judge Cannon considering giving Jack Smith the boot? Well, what we have learned is that she at least wants to hear the two sides out. My top legal sources are here, tonight, joining me at the table. CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Elie Honig. Criminal defense attorney, and CNN Legal Analyst, Joey Jackson. And retired federal judge, Shira Scheindlin. It's great to have you all here. Judge, I want to get your take on this in a moment.

Number one, they didn't have to take this case, the appeal, and they chose to. The other thing is they didn't have to pause the district court. In fact, the trial court judge, when he issued his ruling, allowing Donald Trump, and the others, to ask the appeals court to take the case, the trial court judge specified, while you all are doing that, I am going to continue holding proceedings, in this trial court. And now, today, just a couple hours ago, the appeals court said no, no, no, pause that too. So, that tells me that they are taking this appeal very seriously.

Judge McAfee found those comments to be, quote, legally improper, and then he did nothing about it.

And secondly, somebody that actually can help bolster, from a professional standpoint, if you're talking professional politics, how government is run. And that's where I think like Mike Pence came in, and it was really helpful, because he had that government experience. In this field that you talked about, I think there's one person in particular that I think would be a great pick for Trump. And that's Doug Burgum. And the reason why is because Doug Burgum is, from a respectability standpoint, in Trump's eyes, he's a business guy, who's sold his business, and made a ton of money. So, he's a peer.
