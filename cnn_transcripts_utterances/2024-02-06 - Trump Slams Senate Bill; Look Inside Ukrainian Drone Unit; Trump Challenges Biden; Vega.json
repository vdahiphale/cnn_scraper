Obviously not only using the sea drones, but the sea drones are a very important part of that.Now, we met a really secretive unit of Ukraine's defense intelligence directorate, and they had actually just taken out a Russian warship, so a couple days ago, and they showed us exactly how they did it. Here's what we learned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): It was one of the most brazen and most successful operations by Ukraine's military intelligence service. Sea drones attacking and the Ukrainians say sinking a Russian warship inside occupied Crimea. And he was one of those involved. His call sign is 13 from the elite sea drone unit named Group 13. So secretive we had to hide his face and change his voice. We used ten drones in the operation, he says. Six of them hit the corvette Ivanovets. CNN cannot independently verify that the Ivanovets was sunk, but video provided by the intelligence agency seems to show the many sea drones evading machine gun fire from the warship and then massive explosions. Their weapons are not designed to deal with such small sea drones, 13 says. In most cases, they use anti-ship guns. Ukraine barely has a functioning navy, but the MAGURA drones pack a massive punch, around 500 pounds of explosives.",

Asymmetrical warfare they call it, and the Ukrainians, outmanned and outgunned, say they need to do a lot more of it. After visiting the southern front this weekend, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling Italian media he not only plans to fire his top general, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, there could be a larger government shakeup. A frontrunner to become the new commander in chief, the defense intel boss known for brazen attacks against Russian military and infrastructure targets. The Russians are wake up at night to explosions, he says. Explosions in the air, explosions directly at the facilities. They see the real picture of war. They see burning oil depots, destroyed buildings and factories and so on. This is all beneficial.
