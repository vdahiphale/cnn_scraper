They, of course, were touting some of the few deliverables that they were able to announce yesterday, including chiefly that military to military communication being reestablished between the two countries, that announcement on cracking down on fentanyl. And the press conference last night was so interesting, because even though that summit was entirely focused on U.S.-China relations, the President fielded a number of questions about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, everything on the civilian casualties, the status of the hostage negotiations, where he said he was mildly optimistic. And then he had this to say about the duration of the war and the future of Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We continue to move up, we continue to do better. I think this is really now a three person race in New Hampshire, with myself and Nikki Haley and Donald Trump.

What you don't want to have ever are circumstances where there are miscommunications between the two largest militaries in the world that lead to a problem that will be difficult, if not impossible to fix. So I think that's a good thing. But in the end -- and calling him a dictator is, by the way, what he is. It's not like they have free elections in communist China. So, you know, I saw some of his staff members got weak in the knees because he said it. Well, good for Joe Biden that he said it. He is a dictator. He doesn't have free elections and fair elections. And so he called them exactly what he is.
