That of -- all of course, since hardliners ousted Kevin McCarthy.But like other nominees before him, Johnson has to clear a really big hurdle. And that is, he needs 217 votes in order to lock up to speaker's job. He can only afford to lose four votes of fellow Republicans. That means it's going to be very tight again, given the party's very slim hold on the majority. So, the question is whether Johnson can seal the deal, we're going to find out soon.",

But now, Republicans believe it's time to move on. Members of the hard right are aligned with Johnson on his politics. Members who are more centrist, more to the swing members just say it's time to move on and get a speaker elected here.Now, just moments ago, Johnson told our colleague, Annie Grayer, that he will win on the first ballot. That is his expectation at the moment. And so far, we have not heard opposition within the ranks. They tested this behind closed doors yesterday. There were 22 members who did not appear for the vote. There are three members who voted present. Those three members who voted presidents are expected to vote for Johnson and we expect the Republicans who are to attend this vote to vote yes. That means that Johnson could be elected speaker in this hour and take the -- assume the speaker's office just down the hall from me. And then confront huge issues that he will have to deal with that have been completely sidetracked as Republicans have tried to resolve this -- these -- all these -- this internal leadership battle and this crisis within their own ranks. Namely, how to fund the federal government, and how to deal with aid to Israel and Ukraine. All major issues are on his plate, assuming he has the votes later this hour. Dana.",

He was an attorney with a focus on constitutional law. He worked as a college professor. He was a little bit in our industry. He was a conservative talk show host. He served in the Louisiana State House.Now, what about in Congress, right? So, he's been representing the Louisiana's 4th Congressional District now for since 2016. Now he is in the leadership, but he's not too high in the leadership, right. So, he's the vice chair of the House Republican Conference. Here's the other big thing you should note about him. He served on Trump's first Senate impeachment trial defense team. He is an ardent defender of Donald Trump. And we can see that in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, right? So, what we see is that Johnson, in fact, had drafted the House GOP legal brief, supporting the Texas suit. And he objected to certifying the 2020 election results. Of course, now perhaps, there's some interesting sort of back and forth where perhaps some Republicans want to forget about it. So, let's take a look back a few years ago, and compare it to now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA): Madam Speaker, we have a solemn responsibility today. We must vote to sustain objections to states of electors, submitted by states that we genuinely believe clearly violated the constitution and the presidential election of 2020. This is the threshold legal question before us. And it's an issue before us for the state of Arizona.",

And you kind of get this idea that Republicans perhaps don't want to necessarily focus on what's dividing them. They want to be united as a conference. And I think that, you know, we should sort of note why Mike Johnson couldn't fac succeed. He kind of tries to get in that middle of the Republican caucus. He doesn't want to be too far out there on the right side of it.So, he voted to raise the debt ceiling, but not to avoid the government shutdown. Now, though, he's asking for a possible continuing resolution to keep the government open. Here's the other thing about Johnson. He sponsored more bills that passed than the average Republican, so he has an ability to get things done. And he's been able to sort of get this broad GOP support. So, remember, of course, what we had was Matt Gaetz here. Matt Gaetz, of course, essentially sunk, sunk, Kevin McCarthy. And of course, Mike Lawler, what we saw there was he of course, sunk Jim Jordan. So, we had support both on the left and sort of on the right side of the GOP caucus. One little last thing I'll note, in terms of fundraising. Mike Johnson has not necessarily been the biggest fundraiser in the world. He is not anywhere close to Kevin McCarthy as a fundraiser. He's not even near where Tom Emmer who saw some improvement from 2019 to 2021. So that's something I think that a lot of Republicans will sort of be wondering about. Can in fact, Mike Johnson raised the money they need, we'll just have to wait and see. Just like we'll have to wait and see whether or not Johnson becomes speaker later today. Wolf?",

He will do that in the presidential race.Here's a chance here to say, let's move on. Let's flush that away. It is not true. It is a mistake. Let's move on. No, they're going to elect the speaker today. It looks like who, as Jamie said, was driving the train. Not just voted for it but he was driving the train trying to help Trump. But the question is, so this is a victory for Republicans that they end the circus after three weeks and they get a leader. OK. So, they've picked a leader. Now what happens? Can he get the votes to, you know, to avoid a government shutdown, like Israel aid, no brainer? Can he get Ukraine aid? Or will the party have a fight over that. And then what? Every time they need to vote on anything significant, that's when they fracture, because they have a very fractured narrow majority. And so, can a guy who's never let a committee, now lead what we have seen is an incredibly fractured, divisive conference in which a decent number of them don't really care about governing. They care about attention. They care about -- they like disrupting the process. They like taking the wheels off the car.

Paul Ryan was pressed into the speakership. and then resigned from Congress. Said, you know what, I'm not only am I stepping out of the speakership. I am leaving town because this was so frustrating. Kevin McCarthy badly wanted this job and got thrown out because of these dynamics. Just because Mike Johnson today doesn't have enough people saying hell no to him, doesn't mean that any of those problems have been fundamentally fixed. It's just that these two groups of people are increasingly apart from each other, the institutionalists and the pro Trump MAGA wing of the party, but they can't govern it, they can't hold any power at all without each other.

So, now the plan is either January or April, he says he'll go into the conference, they elect him speaker then they'll go into a room and say what do we want, January or April, OK.

And this is an alliance that has so much right now to do with, trying to counter China's influence in the region. You'll recall that it's within the last few years of the two countries reached a major agreement to provide Australia with nuclear powered submarines.

Even if it waits for a few days, it will not wait indefinitely to move forward with those plans. And we know that overnight, the IDF carried out airstrikes that destroyed several tunnels, they say, and also took out several Hamas commanders. But what we also know, Jake, is that these intensified airstrikes are leaving a, you know, a significant number of casualties, including civilian casualties, more than a third of casualties of those killed inside of Gaza, in these two plus weeks of war have been children, which you know, you see these absolutely devastating images, not only of the aftermath of some of these airstrikes, but also in hospitals, which are increasingly running out of fuel to be able to carry out operations. Not only for those who are critically injured in the strikes, but also of course, for patients who need lifesaving care, whether that is dialysis or prenatal care. The World Health Organization now says that 12 of Gaza's hospitals are out of service because of a lack of fuel. And so, there's no question that as Israel continues to intensify its air campaign inside of Gaza, as Hamas continues to harbor its fire fighters in civilian areas as well, that the toll for civilians inside of Gaza is only growing.

The one of the other key things I should say, as well, of course, is the continuing artillery strikes or continuing airstrikes that we've been seeing down along close to the border to Gaza today. But I think when we consider where these apparent negotiations are, both sides seem to be coming down to the wire and Israel lost the initiative to Hamas, because they captured so many hostages.
