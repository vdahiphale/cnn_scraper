And also heard I think, a lot of good ideas about some of the things we need to do moving forward, including practical ideas on getting assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who are in need, but also good and important conversations about the future and where we hope ultimately, together we can, we can bring this in a much more positive way.

Yes, I think fairly early on in your program was you mentioned 2,700 deaths, 9,700 injuries, hundreds of thousands of people acutely displaced, crammed into overcrowded settings, poor sanitation, poor access to water. Psychologically, that's an enormous strain, ongoing shelling. Now, there may not be -- the shelling may not be striking these collective centers, but it's landing not too far away. And the mother of a colleague of mine who stuck there at the crossing, said it was just the most horrific night of her life last night. Just the constant chilling, chilling nearby.Of course, the other big concern we have is just the major disruption of health care, hospitals and health facilities. For example, in the north of the 22 hospitals, three of them are non-functional at all. All of them are working well under capacity, lack of electricity, lack of water, as you've mentioned, lack of fuel, loss of staff, and soon to run out of medical supplies. They are -- haven't -- they have a huge patients, not only from the trauma, but, you know, women are still having babies. UN estimates there are 200 babies being born a day in Gaza, people still need their insulin. I was talking to my (INAUDIBLE) colleague, Dr. Seto (ph) just earlier this evening, and he said they're running out of insulin in the next two weeks. So, a health system that is clearly on the brink at a time where the needs are increasing and enormous. It is catastrophic. ANDERSON: Thank you for joining us.

And of course, the focus now, though very much is really on the spiraling humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which you've already been discussing this hour. The UN Commissioner for the Relief and Works Agency coming out and saying the world has lost its humanity, calling it unprecedented. Reminding people that some 60 percent of Gaza's population rely on food aid in order to survive because of the blockade that's been in place there for 17 years. He went on to say that not a drop of water, no electricity, no food, no medical aid has been able to enter Gaza for eight days now. And there is a sense that the situation is quickly spiraling completely out of control.We spoke to a young dentistry student, 22 years old in Northern Gaza, which has been given an order to evacuate, but she told us that her family hasn't been able to evacuate because they have no place to go. There is no place where they know that there is electricity, there is real fear about the roots to move towards the south. And so really, I would say an all-round state of chaos and confusion. Now, Israel's Defense Forces have said that water has now been turned on again to southern Gaza. We have not been able to confirm this yet. But I did want to just pull up a tweet here for a moment, if you will. This is actually from October in 2022, and it's from Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the EU Commission, she's talking about Russia with regards to Ukraine, she says, cutting off men, women, children of water, electricity. And then she goes to say heat (ph) as well, these are pure acts of terror. And we have to call it as such. I think it's no secret that there has been a huge amount of anger not just from Palestinians, but from others as well at a perceived double standard in terms of the language coming from U.S. and Western leaders. Now, I will say that we have seen something of a recalibration of that language. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasizing today that while the U.S. is in lockstep with Israel and supports it every step of the way that Israel really must abide by international humanitarian law. But for now, Isa, from what we are seeing and hearing on the ground in Gaza, there is very little in terms of relief or refuge coming their way. Isa.",

Originally, the Egyptians had said that they would allow for Americans, Canadian, some other nationalities who were trapped inside Gaza to leave Gaza through that Rafah crossing, that did not end up materializing. But basically, the Egyptians are really trying to avert having this humanitarian catastrophe spill in to the Sinai Peninsula and into Egypt.What that means is it becomes all the more complex to try to come up with some kind of a mechanism that all parties can agree upon, to at the very least get aid into Southern Gaza. You played some of that interview that Wolf Blitzer did with President Herzog, in a different part of the interview, he also talks about how they're trying to create a kind of refuge center that would be safe, where there would be relief handed out, he says that it would have capacity for hundreds of thousands of people. But in order to make that happen, realistically, you have to have a huge amount of relief aid workers and infrastructure allowed to go into Southern Gaza through that Rafah border crossing, and there are a number of security considerations to be taken into account. We know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been meeting with his Egyptian counterpart, those meetings continue, there is a sense of urgency to them. But so far, no clear timing as to when this purported or putative, I should say, refuge center would be established in Southern Gaza.

There's a lot of questions of course about Egypt, them allowing people -- them allowing the border to be opened for Hamas to allow the border to be open. Now there has been a flurry of reporting that this could be open, this could be happening within the next even potentially few hours. But we can't believe anything until we actually see people leaving Gaza and those aid convoys entering Gaza at the same time because of course we are in such a desperate situation.Now, Antony Blinken has literally been hopscotching around the region. And ironically, Isa, he was actually already supposed to be in this region for visits in Israel, in the Palestinian Authority with Saudi Arabia. This was pre-scheduled actually, before this war broke out and ostensibly that was mostly about Saudi-Israel normalization. Now, of course, he's hopscotching around the region for a very different reason trying to establish not only these humanitarian quarters to try and establish, get Americans out, get this aid in, but also to try to keep a lid on the situation keep the north from blowing up, keep Hezbollah from trying to get even more involved. So, it's been interesting to hear his -- it's been most interesting for me to hear what that -- the soundbite that you play just than from Antony Blinken, because I do think that the pressure is ratcheting up on the Israelis about this humanitarian situation, about the water, about the electricity about the field. The Israelis turn this off in the opening hours days of this conflict, essentially, because of the barbarism that they saw from Hamas, saying that they will not be turning these things back on until the hostages are freed. But now we're in a situation where the civilians are running out of the -- of running out of water, when situation where hospitals are running out of power. And I think that the pressure is mounting hour by hour, day by day for Israel to turn this back on for the civilian population. Now from Israel's point of view, they want to keep the pressure on Hamas. So, they will bring the hostages out. They also don't want to provide electricity and other things for Hamas, the -- that Hamas could then use in their attacks on Israel. But I do think that what we're hearing from Antony Blinken, that's the beginning of that sort of clock ticking down for Israel saying, listen, we understand that the Americans support what you're doing support what you're doing against Hamas, but for the civilian population for their sake, you have to turn these things back on.",

You know, and we've talked about the colossal failure of intelligence to have actually, you know, seen what was coming last week because they've got so many soldiers now deployed in the West Bank to try and ensure that that doesn't just blow up.
