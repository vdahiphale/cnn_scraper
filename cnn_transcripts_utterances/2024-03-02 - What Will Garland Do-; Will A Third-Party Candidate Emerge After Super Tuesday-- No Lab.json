There's always this sort of push and pull going on where prosecutors saying, judge, we'd like to try this case soon, usually sooner. And typically, defendants are seeking to push it back. Donald Trump did not invent the delay tactic. Take my word for it.Ultimately, it is the judges call but you are absolutely, as a DOJ prosecutor, you are making a conscious specific strategy call in when you ask a judge for the election.

But that letter, what it says is that, we at DOJ need to be careful and avoid taking publicly visible steps on a case that might affect the election to close to the election. But nowhere does it actually say the number 60.In fact, there's a little bit of variance where I was a prosecutor in New York, we were always taught it was 60 days. But you can get people from other districts, federally, who will say they were taught it was 90 days. But the spirit of the rule throughout is basically we don't want to do things that will be visible to the public that might influence an election to close to an election.",

And the right, it applies to, for example, you would never do a search warrant on a candidate 12 days before an election. You would never indict a candidate 14 days before an election.But if you look elsewhere, if you look at the actual justice manual, now, this is essentially the internal Bible for DOJ. We all have them printed out on our desks. There's a provision in there that says, prosecutors should never select the timing of any action. Let me say that, again, any action with the election in mind, with the timing of the election in mind. And it's hard for me to square that with Jack Smith making decisions, asking for trial, asking for everything to be mega expedited, because even though we won't say it, I don't think anyone would disagree that what's motivating him is the Election Day.

Merrick Garland has made very clear, I'm not calling the shots here. But I do think it's also worth noting, Michael, if we have to apportion blame here within DOJ.Let's remember, the reason we are under a time crunch is because DOJ had unilateral control of this case, and when they charged it, and they did not charge it for two and three quarters years. Most of that blame falls on Merrick Garland. Jack Smith actually indicted this case about nine months after he took over. And so when they indicted this case, I don't know if people even remember this. This case was indicted in August of 2023, seven months ago. And when they indicted in August 2023, DOJ left themselves and all of us with about one year to get this case tried. In enormously complex case, they should have know there would have been major constitutional issues like this. I wrote about it in my book, before this case was even indicted. It was obvious they left themselves with not enough time. And the fact that we're in a time crunch now, I think mainly the blame here falls on DOJ, specifically Merrick Garland.",

RFK Jr. just got on the ballot in the crucial states of Arizona and Georgia and is still in play for the libertarian slot. Meanwhile, Friday No Labels, next Friday, No Labels going to gather reps from all 50 states and decide are they moving ahead with a ticket? One person who has already pulled out is Nikki Haley.

And people who identify as pro -- excuse me, pro-choice, people who identify as pro-life are now back on the upswing. So the Dobb's (ph) reaction is in the middle of a calibration, recalibration, back to where things were. Decisions like what happened in Alabama are only going to refocus people who are prioritizing this issue to continue to focus on it.

He's the editor at large at Reason, the nation's leading libertarian magazine where he recently wrote this piece \"Presidential Ballot Will Be Crowded With Third Party Candidates.\" So, Matt, nice to have you back. What chance is there that RFK Jr. ends up as the libertarian nominee? MATT WELCH, CO-HOST, THE FIFTH COLUMN PODCAST: I would put it right now is pretty much slim, none and fat. He was just at the California Libertarian Party Convention, as you just mentioned, and they held a straw poll afterwards, 95 votes. He got one. He came in 11th place. Lars Mapstead got 24. He has a series of decidedly nonlibertarian policy positions on things like environmental regulation and the minimum wage, free speech and plenty other things besides.

More than 400 pages of heavily redacted U.S. Secret Service documents revealed that there had been two dozen attacks in a year. One incident left so much blood on a White House floor that a tour had to be interrupted while it was mopped up. Another, in Rehoboth Beach left an agent needing six stitches in his forearm. Another sent an agent to the hospital and that doesn't include additional incidents that CNN has previously reported involving executive resident staff and other White House workers.
