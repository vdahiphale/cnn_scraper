      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, that was the anticipation. In fact, the McCarthy allies that I've been speaking with including members who just came up the floor say they had been expecting this to fall short of 218 votes on the first ballot, but how this ends is still anyone's guess. They still somehow think that McCarthy can get them despite the stiff loss here, 19 Republican votes. He needs to cut those defects down 15 more votes, he needs to win back. How does he get there? That is not clear because he has not been negotiating.You see McCarthy on the floor right now just talking to Scott DesJarlais. He's a Republican of Tennessee. That is -- they're not in negotiations over what to change and the like. They're having a very amicable conversation. McCarthy is essentially done negotiating. Now, will he have to change that posture going forward? Perhaps. But at the moment, that is not what they plan to do. Jim Jordan about to speak right now. The expectation is that he might signal his -- that tell his supporters to back Kevin McCarthy. Jordan is a close ally of McCarthy. They have developed a close tie over the years, and that has been a key source of alliance between Jordan and McCarthy. Now, will Jordan saved come vote for -- tell his supporters to vote for McCarthy? Potentially. Will that change the math? No. And that is the real issue here. So, right now, we do expect after this vote is closed -- it's not officially closed right now. There's still some paperwork being done. Once that vote is officially closed, they will -- then they will can move on to that second ballot. We will see. Here's the Clerk of the House about to make an announcement here. But we will see them the second ballot takes place -- we'll see if anyone else is nominated. Conservatives are planning to nominate potentially another person here on the second ballot. We'll see if that actually plays out here. But at the moment, Kevin McCarthy will almost certainly will fall short and the next round of voting. But at the moment, now it's time to step aside and just trying to grind it out for as long as possible.",

She had been on the camp and maybe skeptical on McCarthy but has not explicitly said she would vote against McCarthy. Last night, she told me she has not officially said that she was against McCarthy.So, there was really not a real clear sign of where some of these numbers would go. It was a sign more that they're not willing to support Andy Biggs, but they wanted to vote for someone who they aligned with ideologically. But Jordan has been made very clear that he has no interest in becoming a speaker. And, Anderson, even if he were to be put up as a candidate here, he too would fall short of the 218 votes. And that is the real Republican dilemma here because McCarthy can't get 218, who can? Steve Scalise, I'm told by a number of Republicans also would fall short of 218 votes, the same concessions that McCarthy cut with that hardline group of members, some would have to be approved by the full House. A number of members who would swallow those concessions don't like those concessions say they would not support that with any other speaker candidates who leads to all sorts of problems here for Republicans going forward, Anderson.",

Now, if I'm Kevin McCarthy, I'm wishing Jaime Herrera Beutler, John Katko, Peter Meijer, and so on are in the House today. Those are votes that would very likely be with McCarthy, kind of rock-ribbed moderates in many cases. But instead, you know, some of the more far-right type characters won this election cycle and that's just chipping away this majority.

He's not trying to go across the aisle and try to win over conservatives at this moment. He knows that they are standing against him. He's not trying to win them over by trying to have these side discussions, at least not right now. And maybe this is coming because after that meeting this morning, a conference that got very heated according to multiple sources we talked to, he doesn't feel like there's any goodwill at the moment to try to win them over. But obviously, an amazing moment because when I've watched negotiations happen in the past in the Senate, in the House, when the votes aren't there, typically, what you see is leaders trying to work across the aisle, trying to find some kind of consensus, and you just aren't really seeing that in this moment with Kevin McCarthy, Anderson.",

We have a bad energy policy, bad education policy, record spending, record inflation, record deaths, and a government that has been weaponized against, we, the people, against the very people we represent.So, we need to pass legislation to address all that.

Second, we can never ever let a bill like the one that passed 12 days ago, $1.7 trillion spending -- we can never ever let that kind of legislation pass again. We have to -- we have to pass a budget that makes sense. That's good, common sense, then do the 12 appropriation bills that recognize the people's money, not ours, and send it to the Senate and then stand firm on that legislation. And again, if they will take it up, and Joe Biden won't sign it, we can stand firm on a CR or something.

The work that we've done for the people over that time.We are unified behind a speaker who will continue that progress despite the chaos on the other side, Madam Clerk. We are going to stay here to get this done, we are unified and we are all going to support Hakeem Jeffries for speaker. The lead vote-getter -- the lead vote- getter in the last ballot. Madam Clerk, as chair of the Democratic caucus, I'm directed by the vote of the caucus to present for election to the Office of Speaker the House of Representatives for the 118 Congress, the name of the honorable Hakeem Jeffries, the representative-elect for the state of New York once again. And we will be unified once again in our support for him.",
