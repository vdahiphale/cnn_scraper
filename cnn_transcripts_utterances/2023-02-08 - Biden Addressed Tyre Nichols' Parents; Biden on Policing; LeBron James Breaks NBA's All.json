But imagine, imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law. Here's what Tyre's mother shared with me when I spoke to her. When I asked her how she finds the courage to carry out and speak out, with faith in God, she said her son was \"a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.\" Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It's up to us. It's up to all of us. We all want the same thing. Neighborhoods free of violence. Law enforcement who earn the community's trust. Just as every compliment pin on that badge in the morning has a right to be able to go home at night. So does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely.

Because someone else will get a knock on their door that says that law enforcement just brutally beat or shot your child, that is going to happen. And the reason it's going to happen is because many Republicans in the United States Congress don't have the fortitude or the empathy or the understanding to change and challenge the status quo.We're having a very interesting conversation in this country about culture versus policy. Look, people have said give them body cameras, we gave them body cameras. People have said trained them. We've trained them. People have said we need more cops and higher pay. We've given higher pay. We've given more cops and this brutalization still happens at the hands of law enforcement. It's a question about culture. But at the end of the day, I was in a room with Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, and the families of victims along with Ben Crump. And you could see that Tim Scott actually genuinely wants to tackle this issue. The problem is that Tim Scott didn't have any help on his side of the aisle. And Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell simply don't have the warmth or the fortitude, or the empathy to understand what it's like to be black in America, to be afraid that your child is not going to come home at night, and therefore, this will never change. This is going to be cyclical. We'll have another George Floyd moment. We have another Nichols moment. I just pray to God that is not a Sellers moment, one day.",

And he's kind of kept his head down. He's -- he's incredibly intelligent. He is somebody who -- should you choose to run for President is certainly going to get a lot of looks. If he can get the policing thing through, that's only going to be helpful to him, because he'll do it in a way that I think that conservatives, you know, will be accepting of it.

We're talking about more than 38,000 career points at the highest level of basketball over a career that spanned 20 years to this point. That's an accomplishment and itself. But when the moment finally happened, him hitting a fade away off the left elbow, almost nothing but net essentially, the entire arena erupted, anticipating that moment. That's why they showed up to this arena on a Tuesday night against a non-playoff team and the Oklahoma City Thunder. They wanted to witness history.And there was a question about whether LeBron would do it tonight or do it Tuesday night, I should say, or whether he would wait until Thursday night to do it against the Milwaukee Bucks. It was very clear in the first few minutes of the game that LeBron was going after it tonight. And he solidified that goal over the course of the game and just really with -- with so much more to go before the game ended. He was embraced by family. There were so many others that were here who had been cheering LeBron on from before he entered the NBA and for them to witness this moment alongside the many, many fans that were here.

I mean, things that because I think there was so much partisanship on their part that they couldn't even manage to applaud things that everyone agrees with. That's, I think, disappointing, and I'm afraid it signals a lack of willingness on the part of my Republican colleagues to work with this President.

I want to bring in now CNN's Political Analysts, excuse me, Ron Brownstein. I guess I got a little tongue tied looking at Bono. I don't know, there's a moment there.

And going back all the way to the 1920s there really has not been a celebrity who has been quite as politically effective over the years as Bono. He was kind of renowned for being able to work with both Republicans and Democrats, built a relationship with the late Jesse Helms. And I think he was there. You heard the President Biden as part of his -- the outreach part of the speech, praise former President George W. Bush and his work on combating HIV/AIDS in Africa and that was something that Bono was very involved in.",

And at some point in their presidency, voters signaled their dissatisfaction with the way things were going by revoking that unified control and turning over one or both chambers to the other side.And, you know, I have recently gone back and looked at the first State of the Union that each of those four predecessors, Clinton W. Bush, Obama and Trump delivered after immediately after that, and they all involve a mix of conciliation and confrontation. I thought Biden tonight was very effective. I mean, he started off talking about where the parties have worked together, and where they might be able to work together going forward. But as the speech went on, he leaned more into what he would not negotiate with Republicans, he would not negotiate because Social Security for Medicare. He would not accept a nationwide ban on abortion. He would not accept a debt ceiling increase, that imposes cuts as part of the price, forgetting that. And that reflected, I think, what you just put up on the screen, the increased confidence that he had relative to Clinton and Obama, who suffered much bigger losses in the midterm election, their first bid. And clearly felt that they had to send a stronger signal to voters that they were changing course. You did not get that from Joe Biden tonight. He did not give off the vibe of someone who felt that he had to kind of recalibrate and reposition himself to get ready for a reelection. Instead, he felt very comfortable drawing clear lines of distinction with a Republican Party that is still operating in the shadow of Trump as all of those cat calls from the audience. Trumpian politics, at least as all those cat calls in the audience demonstrated.",

I wonder if that surprised you to see I mean, this was in some respects a maybe a dipping one's toe into the reelection pond.
