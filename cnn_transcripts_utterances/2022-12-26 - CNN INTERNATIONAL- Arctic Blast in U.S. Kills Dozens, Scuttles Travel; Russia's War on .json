All eyes on whether, after Putin's visit last week, that could lead to that new offensive up from Belarusian territory toward Kyiv. As we saw, Paula, at the very start. For the time being, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence said that that is an unlikely scenario and they are considering that any military activity going out of Belarus right now is much more aimed at drawing some of Ukraine's firepower and its soldiers distracting them from the eastern front and trying to occupy them with that. Without any serious intention of launching a new ground offensive. But this is clearly an important meeting and that particular partnership is under close scrutiny. Otherwise these eight leaders meeting with Vladimir Putin right, now this is about deepening the economic ties at a time when Russia is, of course, extremely isolated. Economically. But it is also, we heard from the Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu about looking at increased military cooperation between the states. We have yet to hear anything official from inside that meeting. But clearly, all eyes on what might come out of that particularly in the context of that strike you mentioned today.",

And they believe one was in the vicinity of the capital Seoul and the others were flying around the island off the west coast of the peninsula. The military says they did fire at the drones but are not confident whether they managed to hit any of them. We're hearing from the defense minister saying this is a clear provocation of our airspace. Some of those, they do confirm went into North Korean airspace and filmed military installations there. Two main airports in and around Seoul had takeoffs postponed for an hour. That was dictated by the military as this was going on. Also, one of those South Korean jets that was scrambled to goal with this did crash. We understand from the defense ministry there were no casualties in that accident. This is not unprecedented but it is unusual. The last time it happened was 2017. At that point, the Defense Ministry said they found a crushed drone in airspace. It appeared it was gathering intelligence on a U.S. defense missile system in the country. Similarly, in 2014, there was a crashed drone found as well. Now they were fairly crude drones with, effectively, a camera strapped onto them. We don't know if the technology has improved. We haven't heard from the Ministry of Defense at this point exactly what these drones look like. But it comes at the end of an historic year for North Korea. Never in their history have they fired so many and tensions are fairly high between the two Koreas -- Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Instead, over the weekend, it announced that relevant outbreak information would be posted by a department that it manages, China's CDC. The CDC has been posting daily numbers so far on Sunday or Monday but whether that trend will continue that remains to be seen. But concern is rising about what really is the actual and true scope and scale of the COVID outbreak underway right now in China. Some data has been coming in from various cities and provinces. Like Zhejiang province, that's located just out of shanghai. It's home to 64 million people, is been reporting 1 million new COVID cases a day. And just quickly to contextualize that number, that -- this is our CNN's calculation of that. That equates to 1,583 new daily infections per 100,000 people but officials there say that that number could peak to 2 million new COVID infections by this weekend. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Those storm effects on the nation's transportation fact system has been profound as well. Thousands of flights canceled on Christmas Day. That is ongoing at this hour.

The area receiving more than 40 inches or 100 centimeters of snow. New York's governor calls it the worst storm in Buffalo's history. And I want to tell, you that is saying something.

And extraordinary, too.This is why this particular storm will go down in the history books as one of, if not the worst that has hit this area in recent times. An example is the wind that we experienced over the weekend. They surpassed that of a historic blizzard in 1977. And sadly, as we are getting the numbers coming in, it seems like the number of storm related deaths is likely to eve surpass the blizzards that we have seen in the past. But in terms of an improvement, we certainly have seen it. We are not getting whipped around in the winds. But as you can see the snow is still falling. And it is certainly going make clearing the streets and some of the highways leading in and out of what is considered ground zero of this massive storm, it is very difficult to clear those streets out when snow continues to fall. The forecast, showing that there will not, this snow, is going to continue to linger throughout the day. Into tomorrow, in terms of what we know. This is a storm that required the rescuers to be rescued. And that tells you everything you need to. Know, also some of the power substations that basically field electricity some of these neighborhoods in and around Buffalo, some of them literally froze, according to the Erie County executive, Mark Poloncarz. So that tells you everything you need to know. Especially if you know Buffalo, you know that it does that does not happen every winter. So in terms of what we expect in the hours ahead, authorities are going to be using some of those National Guard numbers that you mentioned earlier to perhaps take some dialysis patients or patients who require chemotherapy treatment to their appointments because, unless you're driving some of these big trucks, it is nearly impossible to head to your destination right now. That is why there is a ban in place for drivers. Paula.",

He referred to other members of the family. And we saw for instance, the Prince and Princess of Wales. There was no mention of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex or, indeed, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. But that was for other reasons, it wasn't a personal or family spat; it's because they are no longer working royals and therefore included in the Christmas message. The king's message was more personal right the way down to the end, where he talked about the everlasting light and wishing people a happy Christmas. It felt intimate it felt like this was his moment to connect on one of the most important times of the year. And then, of course, at Sandringham, we saw the family out after church again a strong message of those who were part of the inner circle who will be consistently put forward as working royals are members of the royal family for the future of King Charles' reign -- Richard Quest, CNN, London.
