An urgent manhunt is underway right now after officials say a gunman opened fire at two locations in Maine, killing at least a dozen people, according to a city counselor, dozens more were injured in two shootings last night at a restaurant and bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine. That is about 45 minutes north of Portland. Police are searching for this man, 40-year-old Robert Card, declaring him a person of interest in the shootings. The sheriff released these photos for identification. You see him there holding a high powered assault style rifle. Officials tell CNN that Card is in the U.S. Army Reserves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Hi, Kasie. Well, as you mentioned, Robert Card, 40 years old, the commissioner of Maine's department of public safety, calling him a person of interest and person of interest only on at this point in time. But it is also clear that authorities don't know where he is.We know that this shooting began unfolding last night around 7:00 p.m. at those two locations about ten minutes apart by car. Within a couple of hours, authorities had released this photo and several others, other angles, in order to get the public's help in identifying this man. They also released a photograph of his vehicle which was later found in the town of Lisbon nearby. And this is a relatively small area. Lewiston, neighboring town of Auburn which is also under shelter-in-place order, we're talking a population of about 60,000. So, the mayor of Auburn saying this tragedy will affect everyone in the community. We know there will be a press conference, at least one is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. We hope to get an update on a number of things including the number of dead and the number of wounded. And any updates on where authorities think that this man may be. As you mentioned, Robert Card, 40 years old, he is a member of the U.S. Army Reserves and certified firearms instructor. You can see him there. He clearly has a long gun, AR-15 style rifle and was able to do quite a bit of damage at those two locations. We also know from witnesses that we're talking about victims of all ages. The mayor of Auburn talking about the folks at the bowling alley, that was the location of the first shooting. We saw many people running from that location. And the mayor has said that there were children there. So he said the age ranges from 12 to 90 years old. And so still much to be discovered. We hope to learn more in about 5 1/2 hours at this press conference from police. We know that the ATF and FBI are helping local law enforcement. President Biden who was briefed last night, of course, directed federal help to the state. We are unclear about the connection Robert Card may have had to these two locations, to this restaurant and the bowling alley. So there is a lot of questions still to be answered. But, of course, this tragedy overwhelmed local hospitals. Again, we're talking about a community that is not very large. There are a number of trauma centers in neighboring towns, but we know that hospitals had to call in all off duty staff to deal with this tragedy and authorities set up a -- what they are calling a family reunification center at a middle school in Auburn to help serve the families who have questions or who are concerned about where their loved ones are -- Kasie.",

And we heard that from witnesses in those towns speaking to us on the air last night. Shelter in place still in effect for Lewiston and for Lisbon, that is where Card's vehicle was found, a white SUV. So, it's unclear at this point where he's found another vehicle, where he might be.We heard from law enforcement last night, you know, with the passage of time, he could be far from the location of those two shootings. It is just unclear. But because this hasn't been resolved, because the person of interest has not yet been located and captured, this is going to leave the community still already having to heal from these terrible wounds and deaths and tragedy, they are also having to live with this ongoing fear. And so, certainly a community on edge this morning -- Kasie.",

For more insight about what happens next, let's bring in Ken Gray. He's a professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven and a former FBI special agent. Ken, thank you very much for being with us this morning. I mean, as Athena was just telling us, Robert Card, this person of interest, is military trained, he is a certified firearms instructor and he has recently reported mental health issues. Can you help us understand how this would change the approach for law enforcement who are trying to find him?",

They have not definitely made the connection to Mr. Card and this event, but certainly looks like he may become a suspect in this case. Card is a firearms instructor, a member of the National Guard there. And so, he is a very dangerous person, a person that is very well- trained with this weapon. He entered into, first, the bowling alley where a children's event was going on, and shot up the bowling alley and then moved from there, several miles away, to the bar and grille where he also shot a number of people there. So, and then he moved from there, several miles away, to Lisbon, to a boat ramp there, and dumped his car. So, we don't know if he got into another vehicle there or if he got to a boat there, or if he went into the woods there. It's still a very, very fluid situation where this is still early on in the investigation. But I'm really amazed how much information is already known here with just less than 12 hours away.",

And that he had spent two weeks inside a mental hospital, or some type of hospital for the mental health issues here. And so again, this is very early on, very fluid.

The suspect has not been identified, but an intensive manhunt s now underway for a person of interest, 40-year-old Robert Card.Police say he is considered armed and dangerous and they are asking residents to shelter in place. CNN's Omar Jimenez joins us now by phone. Omar, of course, you rushed there overnight and you have made it to the scene. But can you tell us what you see now and walk us through what we know? OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Yeah, Kasie. So, we're about a block away from the bar, the restaurant bar and grille, which is one of the shooting locations. Police have it blocked off right now. But just to give people a time line of how this evening unfolded, it was around 7:00 p.m. local time last night where two shootings were reported in Lewiston which is just north of Portland, Maine. And, multiple casualties, and so, of course, law enforcement began to scramble. Local county sheriff put out photos of the armed suspect and then said that they were investigating two active shooter incidents. And then later on, police specifically named a person of interest, again, we don't know if it is the same person in the initial photos that were put out, but Robert Card was named as a person of interest by police on social media, someone that they are continuing to look for right now. And it has left people in this community in a shelter-in-place warning and many on edge. I can tell you when we got to our hotel, you know, after making the overnight journey here, we couldn't get in unless we showed our ID up against the glass of the door. Even still the attendant that came to check our ID was sort of hiding behind cover because he wasn't sure who we were. I mean, he told us how tense it was for him just being in an overnight position not knowing who may walk up to the doors of the hotel. And so that kind of gives you a sense of how some people are feeling here in the area as this manhunt continues. And, of course, as hospitals are dealing with this mass casualty event across two locations as we understand. So this is not a huge town. It is safe to say that the suddenness of the amount of people that need care would be very, very least potentially overwhelming for some of the crews. And so, this is going to be something that is going to be ongoing throughout the day. Obviously, we're in the very early stages just past 5:00 a.m. local time here. But obviously a situation that many people here in town are nervous about and are hoping can come to a safe conclusion soon.",
