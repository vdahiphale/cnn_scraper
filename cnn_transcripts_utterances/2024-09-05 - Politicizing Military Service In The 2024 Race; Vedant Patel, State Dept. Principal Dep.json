That's true.The number of eligible 18- to -24-year-olds, the group the military most often draws from, shrank from 2017 to 2022, largely because they were disqualified for obesity, drug use and poor performance on aptitude testing. And military recruiting has also taken a hit as the economy has done better, and people find job opportunities outside the armed forces. When we look specifically at the Army, which is the biggest service branch and has had the biggest problems meeting it's recruiting goals, the issue is not with female recruits. Male recruitment has fallen 35 percent since 2013, while women have held steady, meaning they now account for a larger percentage of enlistees, according to military.com. Vance's insinuation that women in the military are a problem is a talking point that some conservatives have been wearing out for years. Like Tucker Carlson, who memorably said this in 2021.

Without women, there would be a readiness issue.In the Army, women account for a steady supply of enlistees. And they're increasingly represented in the Officer Corps. West Point, the Army Service Academy, had four Rhodes Scholars in 2022, all women. The military is not a casual profession. It's a tough path, especially for women. They face the same challenges that men do, and then some. They're more likely to be sexually assaulted, for instance. And we've seen them experienced sexism even at the highest levels. When President Biden entered the White House, he promoted two women to elite four-star commands after their promotions have been delayed beyond the 2020 election by top Pentagon officials in the Trump administration out of fear that President Trump would scuttle their nominations simply because they were women, according to \"\"The New York Times.\" An actual case of gender exclusion, as Vance lambastes a candidate who he says focuses too much on gender inclusion, and who he rails against for hailing from a family that does not serve in the military.

And that is why the single best thing that can happen is a ceasefire deal. And that's what we're focused on. But beyond that, I'm just not going to negotiate in public. SANCHEZ: I totally understand it and I respect it. I am curious how you can approach this situation when you have accusations that neither side is really wanting to make a deal. Because, for Hamas, Barak Ravid recently reported that they also added last-minute demands, including increasing the release the number of certain prisoners that they want released. And we also had the recent execution of hostages. So does it seem from your view that a deal is still actually possible? And what happens if it doesn't come to fruition?",

But, look, you've heard colleagues of mine across the administration say that this process, it's negotiation, and it's not only going to require Hamas to get to yes, but it's also going to require some flexibility on behalf of the government of Israel.

And the best and single path forward to that is a ceasefire deal, one that is in the spirit of the contours laid out by President Biden earlier this year, that bridge bridging proposal that the government of Israel and the prime minister have agreed to. And one that we are continuing to work around the clock to get across the finish line with Hamas getting to a yes. But also working on some of the more specific implementing and technical pieces.

It's a way for him to avoid pleading guilty to these charges. Now, as a reminder, he's facing three felony counts for tax evasion. He's also facing 36 misdemeanor counts for failing to file and pay his taxes on time. And so we have about 120 jurors who showed up today for the beginning of jury selection. And what Hunter Biden's attorneys are doing is saying that instead of going through with this trial, of course, which is a very expensive thing given the fact that Hunter Biden has already gone through one trial in Delaware where he was found guilty on gun charges, what they're trying to do is resolve this case in a way whereby he maintains his innocence. But instead acknowledges that the government has more than enough evidence to likely convicted him. So the proceeding, the court hearing is continuing in the courthouse behind me. We will see whether we are going to get to jury selection. Section is still ongoing behind me.",

And so what they are pushing for the judge to do is instead to reject it. Now, what the judge has said right now is that he's not going to make a decision today on this. He's asking for the two sides to present their briefs, to make their arguments as to what he should do next. But really, it is a very exceedingly rare thing for this to happen in federal court.
