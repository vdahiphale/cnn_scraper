The CEO of the Chinese social media app Shou Chew will be testifying on Capitol Hill next hour. We'll hear from one of the lawmakers set to grill him. Plus, Macron versus the multitude the protests continue this time. It's the nation's biggest unions rebelling in the first nationwide demonstration. Since deeply unpopular pension reforms were made law. We are live in Paris for the latest on that and Central Bankers versus inflation and financial contagion, the U.K., Norway, Switzerland and the Philippines. All raising interest rates today following the Federal Reserve's quarter of a percent hike on Wednesday. Bankers betting it seem that they can do it all study the banking boats and also tackle their high pricing predicament inflation. I tell you what it does mean it means choppy waters. U.S. futures are heading higher after Wednesday's wave of weakness in stressed Regional Banks and bigger banks too. But as you can see, Europe at this moment is a touch lower. No surprises from Fed Chair Jay Powell meeting market expectations with that quarter of a percentage point hike, but he also changed the tone on what comes next. Powell very clear about what remains unclear and it's plenty. And that's to what extent the recent bank failures and turbulence will now weigh on future growth. He suggests banks may now be less willing to lend and we're talking all banks, let's be clear, not just the weakened ones. They all know that more regulation is likely coming. They have to be careful more careful with the deposits that they've got. And also because borrowing money if they don't use those deposits costs more for them too the result, they lend less, how much less could make the difference between perhaps one more hike from the Fed and no more hikes. Then came the Janet versus Jay moment when they were literally speaking at exactly the same time and on a critically important topic for current confidence in banks. Just listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, CHAIR OF U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: These actions demonstrate that all depositors' savings and the banking system are safe. JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: If not considered or discussed anything having to do with blanket insurance or guarantees of - assets. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Janet also said that the protections will be done on a case by case basis, as we've already seen, let's be clear, but I think the reaction to this across financial markets shows the fear of deposit outflows is still pretty palpable. We'll discuss all of this later on in the show. For now, we focus on TikTok and then the next hour the CEO of TikTok is expected to begin giving testimony on Capitol Hill in Washington. He'll tell lawmakers that the Chinese owned app which claims to have 150 million U.S. users is not a National Security threat and should not be banned. Vanessa Yurkevich has all the details.

You know, it was very politically advantageous, especially for Republicans to take a tough stanceon China but the difference being when you're taking stuff, a tough stance on companies like Huawei, that most consumers don't have a direct relationship with. It's very different than when you're taking a tough stance on an app like TikTok that's used by 150 million Americans monthly. I think what you're going to see today is they want to get to the bottom of reports that TikTok has been, you know, using its app to spy on Americans. Of course, there were reports out last week that the DOJ is investigating TikTok for spying on journalists. There have also been reports that TikTok has leveraged the algorithm from China in its U.S. App in ways that we wouldn't necessarily approve up here. For example, there was a 2019 report from the Guardian that TikTok was filtering out hash tag around Tiananmen Square. They're going to want to probe into some of those reports get an understanding of whether or not this app really does have the best interest of U.S. users. But to the point of the clip that we heard earlier, it's still an uphill battle. You know, this administration has not pointed to one single major National Security threat in trying to potentially ban this app. That's why I think we reported this in Axios this morning; their posture is more we don't necessarily want to ban the app. But we would like for it to be sold to a U.S. company.",

At a time when relations between the U.S. and China are already very turbulent, as we have seen in the past if China doesn't like something, it has this mentality, or this view that if you hurt us, will hurt you back, could this perhaps lead to retaliation by China. Will China say to the U.S., well, if you're going to ban TikTok, we're going to ban some of American apps on Chinese soil? That's one conversation I had from an analyst today but then again, Julia, as you were talking with Sara, and as we've discussed throughout the morning. Even if there is a company to buy TikTok, and even if that money is raised, and even if it's a deal that the CEO wants, the Chinese government could say, look, the parameters of all of this, this ability for us to control the data, the analytics for us to keep all of that it's far too valuable.

But there is also this tightening that we are likely to see from these banks, and the impact that, that will have the knock on impact. A Jay Powell essentially saying that credit tightening is expected. But here's the thing, Julia, it's unclear how long and it's unclear how much? And so a sense of we got it. We've done a lot.

And essentially, you know, this was an opportunity for the Governor to say, hey, the U.K. banking sector is resilient. But he had lots of pointed remarks about the fact that SVB, Silicon Valley Bank did have to have a completely separate U.K. subsidiary to operate here because of capital and liquidity requirements. And as you said, he pointed out that over the last 18 to 24 months, the Bank of England was aware, they say, of a concentration risk with loans and deposits from a concentrated client base in the innovation sector, and that the flag this not only to the bank, but also to the San Francisco Federal Reserve. Also a really interesting bit and I'm not sure whether we have it was just where Andrew Bailey also had some thoughts on the U.S. response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and the contagion impact, particularly in concern with a guarantee for deposits. And he has this to say, a blanket guarantee of all depositors is not costless. It reduces the risk sensitivity of a bank's funding, could result in moral hazard and any costs which ultimately need to be borne by the taxpayer. And I just saw, I wonder, is he also sending letters to the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, because of course, yesterday, she ruled out a sort of big extension of the deposit guarantee.

And really the key question is, how long lived are the stresses that we're seeing in the financial sector? If they abate relatively quickly as we'd be our baseline expectation, see over the next 6 or 8 weeks. Then I'd say yes, we'll probably see a few more rate hikes.

That said, was Janet Yellen saying that in certain instances, as institutions face stress, that there may not be some further interventions and support for liabilities and deposit holders beyond that 250,000 threshold? I think that that remains very much on the table. And that I also agree with your broader point, that at this stage, it really doesn't look like its necessary. That the stresses have been concentrated in a handful of medium sized banks, banks with assets of 100 billion to $250 billion. The large banks still strong and for all intents and purposes at this moment, the smaller banks, we haven't seen any stresses yet and even in those mid-size banks, it's only a handful.

And I know what it's like to do business in China, and an American company is not allowed to do business in China without having a Chinese partner. So your business isn't separate over there. That's just a reality when I'm answering that question. And it's been very interesting just the last couple of weeks while I was home, we were out for almost 12 days, asking young children I mean here's an anecdotal story. The first time I heard the words, what you think about Project Willow was from a second grader, now Project Willow is the drilling project in Alaska. But if you ask most adults, they talk about it as drilling in Alaska. But over the period of last 12 days, I probably have been asked by 10 or 12, young people aging from the second grader who first asked it to high schools, what I think of Project Willow, and it's from TikTok. They've heard about it from TikTok, and they very clearly have certain perspectives on it. Now, I'm very encouraged that such that young people are concerned about our environment or communicating it. But when you talk to them, you also see that they're getting other very interesting pieces of information, some of which could be called misinformation.

But you also have a situation where I think by a margin of two to one young people and teenagers are saying they want to keep this app. They think you're going down the wrong path with this, and they want to keep it.

And I'm talking specifically about potential greater restrictions on lending, and perhaps not giving the cash so willingly, that they were to individuals and businesses that want it? How worried are you?",

And I do believe that we've got to reassure consumers, worldwide customers that we have a strongbanking system, that sound, it's not in danger of collapse that does mean that they need to be better regulated. You know, my husband, actually, it was my father in law, that helped initially passed something called Glass - which was repealed. And a phrase that has become well known around the world is that you will create a bank too big to fail. Those were the words of my husband, when we repealed Glass --. I'm very concerned about the banks, the banks behaviors, the kinds of regulations that we are putting on them. We have got to assure customers and consumers that our banks are sound. Our financial system sound that's going to require tighter regulation, and making sure we're doing what we need to do to keep banks sound that is more important than people who can't afford credit, getting credit it shouldn't be getting aren't going to be able to meet. CHATTERELY (on camera): Would you be in favor of a rising of the FDIC insurance limit above $250,000, if necessary, simply to ensure the confidence in the system that you're talking about that every depositor of all shape and size is protected?",

We that - that cap were set sometime ago so it may require a rising of that cap but I am not someone that's against regulation of banks, because I think it's the backbone of our economy.

      "sentences": "That's part of the problem that we have right now is complex in some of the businesses the banks are doing. They want to get interest fromloaning money. So are we loaning money to people that we shouldn't be? How are we making sure that depositors who have money in their bank know that their money is going to be safe and the banks backed up the assets that they need to protect those deposits. CHATTERLEY (on camera): Yes, and they don't have to be an equity analyst to be able to understand what's going on at the bank. They should just be able to believe that those deposits are safe. I tell you what this conversation proves you're going to have a busy few months, certainly, if not more. Representative, thank you for your time, great to chat to you! (END VIDEOTAPE)",
