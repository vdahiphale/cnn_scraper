The placement is important. People magazine is a grocery aisle staple. Voters are far more likely to pick up than maybe Politico. Also notable, the venue for the President's first on camera acknowledgement of grandchild number seven was a podcast interview with British podcaster and life coach Jay Shetty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is not a political issue, it is a family matter.\"A couple things here. Number one, this is a very small child who should remain -- everything should remain private about her when it comes to images and so forth. But what we are seeing here is maybe something that was expected once this became a thing. The New York Times did a whole story after Hunter Biden acknowledged that this child was his settled a custody battle. And then Maureen Dowd wrote a very pointed and I think even poignant article op ed saying, it's seven grandkids, Mr. President. That sent ripples, maybe even waves through the political world.",

And look, it really cut at his image of a family man, someone who's had endured tragedies in his family and personal life and has become emerged to where he is today as the President of the United States. It's central to his character and that cut against it.And clearly, the White House had to realize that they had to address this issue and the way that they did that eventually the President was going to be asked about it. He has not been to this point or said this and rather than saying it in a -- as he's walking to, you know, being asked by reporters, as he's walking to an event, sitting down and having to talk about it. Because if he didn't address it now, it was going to come later in the campaign season potentially even at a debate. So he had to acknowledge it now. It's something that ultimately he was pressured to do. And there's a lot of, you know, conversation around this in particular. Everyone continues to say this is a private matter when you have people who are defending Joe Biden saying that you have people on the right saying that this is something that we should be talking about, generally, has a lot to do with Hunter. He's been, obviously, a target of the right. So that has something that is at play here, too. But as we talked about, I think just the day that that article came out on the show, you know, it was going to become an issue. It was going to -- it already was, but it was going to get bigger and bigger, especially as he maintained his silence. He cannot be the patriarch, the family man running on that in 2024 and not address this.",

Like my family is like yours, it's very complicated.This is a very complicated family matter. And people in and around the President say that families deal with stuff that is complicated all the time. The difference, obviously, is that his image is America's grandfather. And it is something that he has leaned into. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He's certainly leaned into it. I mean, during the 2020 campaign cycle, you know, something that voters I interacted with during the primary as they were picking him over other Democrats, was the fact that they felt that he was more relatable, the fact that they thought that he could better win a general election. And that all goes to that image, as you said, Dana, of him being the compassionate candidate, the compassionate president.",

The allegation is pay for play, right? Let's just see Zach talked about Republicans setting the bar very high on what this individual, Devon Archer, Hunter Biden's former business partner, will say in his closed door testimony. Let's play some of what Republicans have said before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: This is a person who was in business with Hunter Biden and Biden family members. He was the BFF of the President's son. He has a lot of information, I believe, that we'll be able to fact check and corroborate with other witnesses and other whistleblowers. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI: I gather this guy, Devon Archer or whatever, is going to testify that he saw then VP Biden talking about business dealings with Hunter. So it's really serious when you have credible allegations of foreign bribery of the sitting President of the United States. REP. JAMES COMER (R), CHAIRMAN, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: We are going to bring people in now for depositions and interviews who were a part of some of these transactions and say what exactly triggered this million dollar transaction.

Do you have direct evidence linking the President to Hunter Biden's business dealings and essentially corroborating what they're saying is a bribery scandal that occurred when Joe Biden was vice president in dealing with a foreign national?He essentially said, no. He said what they have is a pattern of behavior. They said they need to chase down the pattern of behavior to try to find that evidence. He said they're going to have a number of interviews. This one being one of them, to try to corroborate some of these claims. The question is, can they -- will that actually corroborate any of these claims? And the credibility of this witness, too. He's dealing with a conviction and unrelated fraud case. I'm sure Democrats are going to make a big point of that coming out of this, but nevertheless, that is what they're trying to do, all trying to lay the predicate for an impeachment inquiry in the fall.

They have her going out and doing it because they don't want Biden directly in the fray. But for Harris, there are a lot of advantages too. She's been looking at people like Gavin Newsom jumping out and taking advantage of the national spotlight by taking swings at Republicans and being a little jealous of that. And she's doing this. And not only does it benefit what the Biden campaign wants, but I talked to one woman, Jasmine Burney-Clark, an activist in Florida, who was at the Jacksonville speech, big fan of Kamala Harris.

Like, we saw her go and take on the African American curriculum, history curriculum, and that she's going to continue to do that. It allows the President also, as Isaac said, not to just get into the fray but to focus on the economy, which is what he wants to focus on. He wants to be talking about that and trying to make the argument of what the big bills that they passed are doing and really try to battle that public perception that is persistent despite these good economic markers that are piling up and make that entire argument.
