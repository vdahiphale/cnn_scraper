And it's very hard to just sit and wait. But when we seen what the Hamas did on that day -- what they made to (INAUDIBLE) -- I think that now it's your time. It's early in the morning and that was almost the morning on Saturday that they were taken in their pajamas from their beds. I don't want to -- it's very hard to think what happened to them because last week I was in the kibbutz in the house and the Hamas murderers threw a grenade into the house. I don't want to think -- I don't think anybody can imagine what happens if a grenade takes off in your house when your children is there. It's nothing here that you can realize that could happen.

This year's primary is very front-loaded. The most -- the best-case scenario for Haley is probably third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire. Beat Trump in South Carolina.

And that, I think, is what -- the best-case scenario for Haley is that she comes out of New Hampshire with a chance to beat Trump.
