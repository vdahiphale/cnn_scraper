We are seeing rotation from big tech stocks in particularly into smaller cap stocks that will benefit from interest rate cuts. Also, the global tech outage not helping. Those are the markets and these are the main events, as I mentioned, businesses and governments struggle to reboot after an IT glitch takes down critical systems, airlines are particularly impacted. And nine more congressional Democrats urging President Biden to drop out of the 2024 race for the White House. And Russia sentences \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich to 16 years in prison. Live from New York, it is Friday, July 19th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once more. Tonight, a tech glitch of historical scale is reverberating around the globe as businesses and public services struggle to get their computers back up and running. The meltdown stemming in part, at least from a software update from the security firm, CrowdStrike. It has affected computers running Microsoft Windows like the ones powering some of the billboards in Times Square. Yet banks, hospital, TV networks, and other businesses have also been disrupted, including the likes of Starbucks, FedEx, the Olympics, and the London Stock Exchange just to name a few. As I mentioned, too air travelers also been hit, especially hard as Fred Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Thousands of frustrated passengers grounded from Delhi to Berlin to Los Angeles. A global cyber outage, pressing pause on the world. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Nobody was around to tell us where we could check in when we arrived. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'm frustrated. People keep cutting in the queues. PLEITGEN (voice over): Airlines facing what is known as BSOD, Blue Screens of Death with supermarkets, banks, stock exchanges, TV networks, even some hospitals also at the mercy of the widespread IT malfunctions. The major disruption is said to stem at least partly from an antivirus software update issued by the cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike. The company assuring customers that it is not a cyber or security attack.",

PLEITGEN (voice over): Microsoft, among the clients impacted, says it is investigating the crash, which is preventing its clients from accessing its apps and services. The global scale of the outage became clear as the world began to wake up on Friday. Airports across Europe, Asia, and the US forced to a standstill, healthcare services from Israel to the UK facing admin glitches, while the Paris 2024 Olympic organizers also reported issues a week out from the Games. World leaders and businesses are now grappling with how to untangle the critical services from the outage.

Now, today, we are faced with the challenge that the software itself is what is falling apart. And so the CrowdStrike software that is having the issue is essentially the modern-day antivirus. And one of the important items of having that security software has been able to update it quickly, nimbly to respond to attacks that are happening in the wild to protect these systems. However, what went wrong here is that the update mechanism that CrowdStrike used actually ended up corrupting the software and further corrupting the Windows Operating System itself. And so, now, we are in the position where these Windows devices are in that blue screen of death, as you mentioned that are not actually booting up at all.

World leaders and journalism advocacy groups have denounced the verdict as a sham. Matthew Chance has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over) Ahead of the verdict, in the Russian courthouse, cameras jostled for a glimpse of the US journalist in his glass cage. After finding him guilty of espionage, the judge asked Evan Gershkovich if he had any questions about the 16-year prison sentence he had been handed. Looking thin and tired, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter answered no. Critics say his guilty verdict was inevitable, and other underlines how politicized Russia's judicial system has become. A strongly worded statement from Gershkovich's employers called it a disgraceful and sham conviction that comes after his 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained and away from his family. CHANCE (on camera): You can see, Evan Gershkovich is in there. Hi, Matthew from CNN. Are you holding up all right? CHANCE (voice over): it's been a saga which has seen Evan Gershkovich now 32 make several tightly controlled court appearances since being detained and accused of gathering secret information on a Russian tank factory for the CIA, allegations denied by Gershkovich and the US government. There are other US citizens held in Russia, like Paul Whelan, a former Marine sentenced in 2020 to 16 years for spying and also designated by Washington, as wrongly detained. Dual citizen, Ksenia Karelina, an amateur ballerina from LA and journalist, Alsu Kurmasheva are also in custody. Also, Gordon Black, a staff sergeant in the US Army, and US school teacher, Marc Fogel. Critics suspect the Kremlin has been collecting US citizens as bargaining chips for a future deal. But even now, that deal could still be months or perhaps years away. CHANCE (on camera): While the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken says the US government is working every day to bring home Evan Gershkovich and other wrongfully detained Americans held in Russia, it depends on what the other side wants in return, Blinken says, playing down concerns that Moscow could wait for a Trump presidency to make a deal.

And so, despite the calls from business leaders to ease up and give more flexibility on legal immigration and work visas, I'm not sensing that there's a big move in that direction among Republicans.

But to shorten it up, there's a realignment going on in the country, right?Working class voters have been moving to the Republican Party for the last 20 years, that has accelerated since Trump came to office, it continues today. And Republicans are looking to make inroads. They made inroads with non- union blue collar, now they're looking to peel off union workers, union members. And so, the J.D. Vance pick certainly leans into that. And it also then affects policy going forward. I mentioned the tax debate. This is why the tax debate is not going to be a clean debate of just simply extending all those tax cuts. Republicans who are now more populous representing poor districts are not going to spend a lot of political capital on keeping the top income tax rate where it is today, they could let it reset. As they look at the budget and trying to close the budget gap and offset the extension of those tax cuts, the corporate tax becomes much more interesting to them. And despite Mr. Trump calling for a 15 percent corporate tax rate and a further cut of the corporate rate, there are a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill who say 21 is probably too high or too low, excuse me, and they know that they're looking for money, a 24, 25 percent corporate tax rate might be employed.",

And that's because they're -- unlike previous shooters that we've seen leave behind a manifesto or some sort of evidence that clearly indicates what their reason for doing what they did was, this shooter really didn't leave behind anything. And there's no clear indication of political ideology or motive. So, that's why investigators are looking so closely at this digital and forensic evidence. And what they've been able to pick up from the cell phones in particular is the search history that the shooter had in the immediate -- leading up to the shooting -- in the immediate days leading up to the shooting. And that includes searches for both Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, as well as things that the date and location of the Democratic National Convention in a range of different political figures that he was looking for information on showing that he wasn't necessarily, you know, primarily or necessarily focused on Donald Trump specifically, but was looking at a variety of different political figures. We're also learning that he did do that research on a man named Ethan Crumbly, you might remember he was a shooter who killed four of his classmates in Michigan back in 2021. That is something that officials point out that we have seen from other mass shooters in the pas, sort of shooters researching other shooters is an indicator of a mass shooter mindset. And of course, there is the mass amount of ammunition and other weapons and explosives that were recovered from the scene. But look, this is just an early theory that's being -- that's emerging within the law enforcement community that the shooter was more focused on carrying out a mass casualty attack, rather than specifically targeting Donald Trump himself, more that the Trump rally was an event matter of convenience. But still others argued that, look, it was clear that the shooter was focused on Donald Trump. At the end of the day, Donald Trump was shot at by the shooter. And all this coming as the U.S. Secret Service is really facing new scrutiny in the wake of this attack, the ramping up security ahead of Donald Trump's rally in Michigan, but we're also going to see the Secret Service director testify on Capitol Hill next week too.
