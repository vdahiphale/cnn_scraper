A source says the U.S. government estimates at least another 150,000 people are waiting to cross. And a short time ago, the Homeland Security secretary explained once Title 42 ends at 11:59 pm Eastern, U.S. reverts back to using Title 8, which means people risk years of being barred from the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What are the facts? The numbers are just staggering and many challenges, we should note, have persisted for years through multiple administrations.According to a data collection service hosted by Syracuse University, there is a backlog now of more than 2 million, 2 million pending asylum cases. And there are only 600 immigration judges to hear those 2 million cases. So the wait time to get a case heard and processed, averages more than four years. The long wait could be one factor in the number of asylum seekers, who then never show up for their court appearance. According to the Justice Department in the first quarter of last year, that number was 18 percent, so just under one in five who do not show up for those court appearances. Beyond that backlog, there are other factors impacting a person's ability to properly apply for asylum, including trauma from the long journey, language barriers, of course, as well as the complexity of the legal system and what's required. We should note the Biden administration is making changes to the current rules to reduce the number of applicants who enter the country. It has raised the threshold for approval of asylum petitions, made it harder, and it has actually re-amped the Trump administration's Remain in Mexico plan, which sends applicants back to Mexico as they wait, including those from countries other than Mexico. So a lot of these questions they've endured for years, they've been difficult to change, Boris.",

If they can combine that with the ground attacks coming from infantry and armor and artillery, then I think the Ukrainians definitely would see themselves as having a fighting chance of driving the Russians out of their territory.
