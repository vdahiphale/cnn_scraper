      "sentences": "Today, we acknowledge Juneteenth as a global celebration for freedom.Now a national holiday, Juneteenth is the direct result of centuries of resistance and revolution by Black people leading a fight for their liberation. In 1861, tension between the North and the South reached its breaking point over slavery and statehood, and the Civil War began. On January 1, 1863, as the nation approached its third year of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation declaring that all people held as slaves within the Confederate-controlled states were now free. The Proclamation also granted Black men access into a struggling Union Army. By the end of the war, more than 200,000 Black soldiers known as the United States Colored Troops had enlisted, becoming instrumental to the union's victory. The Civil War officially ended in April of 1865, but it wasn't until June 19th of that year, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation that thousands of colored troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, alongside Major General Gordon Granger to read General Order Number 3, informing the last enslaved Black people that they were now free. That day would become the true marker of freedom in America. In 2021, Juneteenth, also called Emancipation Day, Freedom Day, Jubilee Day and Black Independence Day became an official federal holiday sparking a global celebration. On this day, we honor the resilience, ingenuity, and determination it took for Black people to take hold of the very essence of what it means to be in American. Freedom.",

And as vice president, it was my honor to stand beside our President, Joe Biden, as he signed the legislation that finally made that dream a reality. (APPLAUSE) Today, Americans from all walks of life come together to celebrate Juneteenth, to honor black excellence, culture and community, to remember our nation's full history, and to celebrate one of our founding principles, the principle of freedom. (APPLAUSE) America is a promise. A promise of freedom, liberty and justice. The story of Juneteenth as we celebrate it is the story of our ongoing fight to realize America's promise, not for some, but for all. (APPLAUSE) So, as we gather tonight, let us remember the words of the great Coretta Scott King. The fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation. She reminds us that our freedoms will not be permanent unless we, in each generation, are vigilant to protect them. So let us all stand together as Americans to teach and honor our history, to protect our liberty and to continue the fight for freedom. Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you.
