This is CNN News Central. This morning, the stage is set for the final Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses on Monday. CNN is hosting the primetime matchup between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. It's the first time that they're going to be face-to-face just one-on-one for this debate. Donald Trump also qualified for debate, but once again is choosing to skip it and hold his own town hall event also in Iowa. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Vivek Ramaswamy, did not qualify. The stakes could not be higher, really, for all involved. This is one of their final chances to make a statement, answer questions and prove that they are the best candidate, the best alternative to take on Donald Trump.

JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  -- about the violent attack on the Capitol, the Congress, and the vice president of the United States on January 6, 2021. In any event, for the last 11 months, the chairman has repeatedly refused offers from Hunter Biden and his attorney to meet with the chairman and his staff and with members of this committee on February 9th, just one day after the chairman's first letter to Hunter Biden. Mr. Biden's lawyer responded and offered Chairman Comer to, quote, sit with you and your staff, including the ranking member and his staff, to see whether Mr. Biden has information that may inform some legitimate legislative purpose and be helpful to the committee. The chairman never responded. On September 13, Mr. Biden's lawyer again wrote to Chairman Comer after a Newsmax interview, in which the chairman falsely claimed that he never got a response back to his original letter. Mr. Biden's attorney explained the chairman actually never responded to his offer to sit down and discuss the committee's request, but stated that he remained available to have the discussion, but the chairman again completely failed to respond. Two months later, on November 8th, Chairman Comer and Jordan issued subpoenas to Mr. Biden, requiring his appearance for a deposition on December 13th. In the cover letter, the chairman noted, given your client's willingness to address this investigation publicly up to this point, we would expect him to testify before Congress. Throughout the fall, the chairman urged Mr. Biden to come up here at a public committee hearing. On September 13th, on Newsmax, the chairman stated, Hunter Biden is more than welcome to come in front of the committee. If he wants to clear his good name, if he wants to come and say, you know, there weren't 20 show companies, he's invited today, we'll drop everything. On October 31, on a nationwide podcast, the chairman stated, we have mountains of evidence, now we're ready to bring them in. We're in the downhill phase now because we have so many documents and we can bring these people in for depositions or committee hearings, whichever they choose. For depositions or committee hearings, whichever they choose, and we can ask these questions with evidence. On November 6th, again on Newsmax, our good chairman stated, I will extend that invitation on your show right now, Rob, if the Biden family wants to join Tony Bobulinski in an official oversight committee hearing and answer questions that the American people have, then that invitation is open right now. They can come on in and do that. On November 28th, Hunter Biden, through his lawyer, agreed to Chairman Comer's multiple public requests. He agreed to appear precisely at a public hearing under oath to answer the committee's questions on December 13th, exactly what our good colleagues, the Republicans who had information about January 6th, never agreed to do. They never agreed to testify anywhere under oath about what they knew. The letter that came in from Mr. Biden embraced the importance of having a public proceeding that, quote, would prevent selective leaks, manipulated transcripts, doctored exhibits, or one-sided press statements, especially in light of the committee's past use of closed- door sessions to manipulate, even distort the facts and misinform the public. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  Mr. Chairman, I have an inquiry. REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  State your point.",

The question you have been asked multiple times, which is, do you have evidence to impeach the president of the United States? Before you said, I hope so. Today you said, I think so.
