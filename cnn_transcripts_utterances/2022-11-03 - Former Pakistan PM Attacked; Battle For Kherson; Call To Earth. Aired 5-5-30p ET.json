This is THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Ahead, Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan survives an apparent assassination attempt, triggering pro-Khan protests across the country. Then, Russia claims it will withdraw from Kherson, but Ukraine is calling that move a trap. And a planet worth protecting. We will take you to Australia, the U.S., and Mexico for this year's Call to Earth Day. Now, it's 2:00 a.m. in Pakistan, where former Prime Minister Imran Khan is now in stable condition after he was shot in the leg and thigh at a political rally. A spokesman for Khan is calling it an assassination contempt. Khan said in a statement that he believes senior Pakistani officials, including current prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, were behind the attack. They are denying that. In the wake of the shooting, pro-Khan protesters have broken up across Pakistan. Hundreds have gathered to block roads and chant slogans against the current government. Well, police say a suspect is in custody after a shooting which also killed one person and more than several others. Sophia Saifi is in Islamabad with more now on this highly charged act of violence. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In the chaotic moments after the shooting, Imran Khan had to be carried out and whisked away from the crowd. A gunman had opened fire at a rally intense of thousands of his supporters. His target? Khan's party says was a former prime minister himself. Shot in the lower leg, he was bundled to a bulletproof car and driven two hours to Lahore for surgery. A party senior leader released a statement from Khan, saying Pakistan's old cricketing hero blamed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, his interior minister and a senior intelligence official for an attempt on his life, calling for their removal from office. It was, the government said, a grievous accusation. Outside the hospital, people waited desperately for news. Protests broke out across the country, as news of the shooting spread. Six others were injured in the attack and one was killed, according to a senator from Khan's political party, the PTI. Please pray for Imran Khan, for our fellow workers who are injured, the senator says, and for a party member who has died. Khan had been on the campaign trail to demand snap elections in Pakistan, after he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in the parliament just six months ago, accused of bad governance and mismanaging the country's failing economy.

But they will be very aware of what that means for President Putin. Kherson, the capital of one of the provinces that is illegally annexed and taken into the fold of the Russian federation, it will be hugely embarrassing for him to lose it. Russia, it appears, is developing a sort of narrative here that might get the around that awful specter of a terrible disaster loss for President Putin, possibly by in trapping the Ukrainians and scoring some sort of victory, or at least being able to depict it as a withdrawal that they said, they were going to do. Again, it's not clear. This is warfare, psychological operations, or specialty and capability of both sides. But Putin, to lose Kherson, that would be big and he will not want that to seem like an outright loss.",

The U.S. and South Korea have extended their joint military exercises after North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday. Reports suggest that North Korea might have also launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that failed. Officials in Pyongyang called the drills' extension, a quote, dangerous and false choice. The British government says it is ready to support a peace process between the Ethiopian government and Tigray forces. It comes one day after the two parties agreed to a permanent cease-fire. It's a significant step towards the end of a two-year-long war that is left thousands of people dead and millions in need of humanitarian help. Police in Brazil are making progress clearing highways and roads amid protests against the result of Sunday's presidential election. Far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, let narrowly lost to leftist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro took to social media Thursday to ask his supporters to clear the streets. The U.N. says, as many as 14,000 people have been arrested in Iran in anti-government protests. It's a special Iran human rights envoy says thousands of students, journalists, and activists, are among those detained. Former U.S. secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, spoke about the protests here on CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I think that what we're seeing in Iran has been brewing for many years, and young people who are connected to the rest of the world, who get to travel to some extent, certainly online, if not in reality, are just not willing to live with the loss of freedom that is imposed upon them. So, we are speaking out. It is -- it is something that, again, has to be calculated carefully because the regime is most likely to be softened up and give into internal pressures. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The current prime minister, Yair Lapid, conceded defeat a few hours ago, calling to congratulate Netanyahu. The former prime minister will serve an unprecedented sixth term. A far-right alliance helped Netanyahu's coalition won a majority of seats in parliament. Now those extremist allies are pushing for key government rules. One of those allies, Itamar Ben-Gvir, wants to be put in charge of police. He supports relaxing open fire rules against Palestinian rioters and wants security forces to be immune from criminal prosecution. As Hadas Gold reports, Ben-Gvir has a long history of inciting anti- Palestinian hatred. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Until recently, this man, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was considered a fringe far right activist settler lawyer, his signature white kippah almost always askew on his head, now a leader of the projected third largest bloc in the Israeli parliament, set to be a key component of Benjamin Netanyahu's now likely comeback as prime minister. The 46-year-old has been a provocateur since his youth. Once a supporter of the Jewish nationalist party, deemed a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, and ultimately outlawed by Israel. He was once filmed holding a hood emblem he claimed was from a car of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an architect of Israeli-Palestinian peace process, vowing, we got to his car and we'll get to him, too. A Jewish extremist assassinated Rabin three weeks later. Exempted from the military draft, he says he was denied for his political views, Ben-Gvir became a lawyer, often representing Jewish extremist settlers and famously hung a portrait in his home of Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli doctor who massacred 29 Palestinians in 1994 before being killed himself. Ben-Gvir later tweeted he would take the portrait down. In 2007, he told CNN the holiest, most contested site in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, is for the Jews only. ITAMAR BEN-GVIR, JEWISH POWER PARTY LEADER:  Temple Mount is for the Israel, for the Jewish people, not for the Islamic people. They have Mecca, Medina. We have the Temple Mount.",

He has spent his time in parliament attracting the spotlight. From stunts like pulling a gun during clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in East Jerusalem, telling police to shoot Arabs who throw stones, to being forcibly removed from the floor of the Israeli parliament for calling a fellow member, the leader of the Arab movement party who's also an Israeli citizen, a terrorist, saying he didn't belong in Israel. Just last year, Netanyahu himself dismissed the idea of Ben-Gvir leading a government ministry, saying, \"A minister? No. Not in my government.\" But this year, his tune changed. Asked again if Ben-Gvir would be a minister, he answered, \"Of course, he can be.\" While vying to be put in charge of the police as a Minister Ben-Gvir, that could affect Israel's relationship with its most important ally, the United States.",

So, bringing as much awareness to these sharks as possible is just my mission. My name is Shalise Leesfield, I'm 16 years old. And I'm an ocean and shark conservationist. Fish Rock is actually home to one of the largest ocean cabins in the southern hemisphere, which is the 125 meter long cave that runs straight through the rock. And diving there is just such an adrenaline rush. I love to call Fish Rock a beacon of hope for these sharks because it's their home, it's where they aggregate, it's where they feed. And raise their young pups. It's such a crucial base for them and to not have protection for such an important habitat for them is just devastating.",

So if you killthem, you made the coastline safer, and you are a hero. So of course that cut their numbers right down and earned them that critically endangered title. But there are numbers still have not caught back up. They take, when they reach six to eight years old, that's when they reach sexual maternity and that's when they can re-breed and build their numbers back up. But unfortunately, they are very slow breeders, because they only have 1 to 2 pups or baby sharks every 2 years. Oh incredible. Insane. It's just bustling with life. A real aquarium. The way that Fish Rock is at the moment, it isn't ideal. So of course there is always room for more protection. We're thinking maybe 1,500-meter zone around the island where it's just no fishing and just for the sharks. Being really young, it most definitely was a challenge. But it's just the mentality of not caring about how old you are and where you come from. Just using your voice to speak up for just what you would love for me, which was the ocean. As the younger generations, we are the ones that will be inheriting the earth and the ocean as well. So just not caring about, you know, who you are and where you come from, and your age. And not letting that restrict you. Using your voice to speak up for what you love, and what you're going to inherit, just makes it all worth it when you're going to see that snag tooth of the shark.

So here, children get up close and personal and see whale sharks, zebra sharks, sting rays, manta rays, you name it. These little fellows, the zebra sharks, similar to the one I saw him earlier today, they are an endangered species because of the shark fin trade. So, right now, children can hear about the efforts to find genetically compatible zebra sharks, harvest their eggs and send them to the other side of the world to Indonesia where they are hoping to rebuild the wild population. They have already had some success. In September, two eggs hatched. After two months, they'll release them to a marine protected area, so this is a world first, a huge collaboration between aquariums, universities and conservation organizations. A lot of success with that program so far. We also got a chance to see the whale shark feedings. Now, you'll see sometime over the next 30 seconds or so, a whale shark passes over my head, there are two in this aquatic habitat, and they're also endangered because their hunted for their friends, meat, oil. They're also a victim of caught in fishing gear, sometimes hit by ships. So the aquarium stuff, the scientists are using their efforts to study their weight, their biology, their reproductive health.
