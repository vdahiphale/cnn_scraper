And right now, part of the concern on the part of the International Red Cross is that there were already severely, critically wounded people from the war who needed to get out of that region with limited success. Twenty-three out of sixty people critically wounded only had been able to be airlifted from that region. And now with this explosion, there are many, many more seriously wounded people in need of urgent healthcare. And that is a huge challenge right now, given the huge backlogs of people actually trying to get out of the country. It is important to remind our viewers, Zain, that of course, Nagorno- Karabakh is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan, of course, but because of this majority population in that small part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, 120,000 ethnic Armenians, it is essentially operated as a de facto part of Armenia for decades in this delicate sort of gray zone has maintained until 2020 when there was war three years ago and then again last week. And now, it seems that Azerbaijan has completely regained control of this region. And you heard Samantha Power there talking about Azerbaijani leadership living up to its promises to make sure that the minorities in those regions are treated the same as anyone else. And that is in fact what they have promised. In fact, they've also been considering amnesty, even for those local separatist fighters who took up arms, though of course there's still plenty to be discussed. The European Union right now is hosting representatives from both countries in Brussels to try to normalize relations. There's a lot of talk right now, there are some hopeful signs, but nothing concrete at this moment. But of course the much more urgent thing on the ground is that those who are trying to flee can actually get out of the country. You said 19,000 who have left for Armenia already and managed to cross the border. They are showing up shell shocked, tired, hungry and some have also resigned themselves to the fact that they may never in fact go back. And of course, many others are bringing, you know, all the belongings that they can bring with them and children, as well.

There are some other Democrats who are appearing on picket lines, as well, but it's notable specifically for the President because there's a specific reason why presidents do not often try to get involved in these debates. That is because President Biden, from the early days of his presidency, has tried to establish a contrast with his predecessor that he and his administration would not be seen as intervening in third-party independent negotiations, whether they are investigations by the Department of Justice or labor disputes like those between the United Auto Workers and car companies. And reporters have asked the White House repeatedly why, if the president supports both sides of this debate, he's not visiting with some of those auto executives when he's in Michigan, as well. Now, he's sending a very clear message, but he's trying to walk a very clear tightrope, as well, in standing with these workers and saying that he expresses solidarity for their position while refraining from offering a very clear endorsement of that specific negotiating position. But just yesterday, President Biden was asked directly whether he endorsed to the pay raises that those UAW workers are pushing for. He said that he supports those workers, but stopped short of saying that he supports their specific demands. Bianna, Zain.",

For too long, the Democratic Party has turned its back on working people, starting in the 1990s with their free trade agreements. And this really represents a reorientation of the Democratic Party toward its traditional working class base. So, this is a very big day not just for the workers but also for politics in America.",

And the argument from autoworkers is that will take away some of their jobs and that will depend on non-union workers, many of who work for companies like Tesla and other international companies. So, what does the President need to do here? He can't walk away from these subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles. Former President Trump has trounced on this issue.",

And I think for workers across the country, if you look at what's been accomplished by unions this year, you have the UAW fighting for folks, the screen actors. The writers  have just gotten a contract. Hopefully, the Screen Actors Guild will soon. You know, we've seen the successes at Amazon. We've seen successes across the country with unions. And I think what we're seeing here is the kind of labor activism we've had across the country. Now, the President is joining in, as well.

Unfortunately, Donald Trump himself is a creature of the establishment. He had companies that were making products overseas. His record of labor relations in his own companies is horrendous. His time as president, his tax plan was detrimental to working class people, benefited people at the top. So, you know, I understand why people are frustrated in this country and why they have deep distrust of political institutions. But Donald Trump is a fraud, frankly. And he is playing on people's justifiable frustration to try to advance himself. And so, I would encourage working class people to look for those folks who are legitimately trying to protect their economic interests. And Donald Trump is not one of those people.",
