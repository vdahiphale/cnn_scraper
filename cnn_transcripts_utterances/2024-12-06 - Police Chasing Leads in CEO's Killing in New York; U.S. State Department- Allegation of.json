If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy visited congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, along with Elon Musk's son, to discuss their plans for improving government efficiency. House Speaker Mike Johnson says the meeting focused mostly on what federal funds they can claw back to make the government run more smoothly. In Syria, rebel forces have swept through another strategic stronghold in their unexpected military advance. Hama, a symbolic and strategically important city, marks the second major gain for rebel forces following their grab of Aleppo last week. Syrian government forces have reportedly withdrawn from the city, although airstrikes continue. And there are new clues in the search for the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Investigators in New York say the suspect, who's still on the run, was seen on surveillance footage getting off a bus from Atlanta 10 days before the shooting. Meanwhile, investigators have got their first look into the -- or onto the face of the person of interest. In that case, Brian Todd has more now from New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There's surveillance video of the shooting itself with the alleged gunman wearing a mask. Newly released video of what appears to be the man fitting the description of the suspect walking in the area of the killing on Wednesday morning. Video of what could be the suspect on an e-bike on the west side of Manhattan. New photos of a so called person of interest wearing a hooded jacket but no mask which CNN has geolocated to a Manhattan hostel where police believe the suspect may have stayed. Crucial images which are among the many resources being used by the NYPD to catch the suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. KATHERINE SCHWEIT, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: NYPD and the FBI have a great ability to pull together video surveillance and piece it together moment by moment and follow somebody through any camera available. And that's what the goal is first is from the incident, every moment after that, every moment before that. Can we see this individual? TODD (voice-over): CNN is told there's facial recognition technology being used. The NYPD's Joint Operations Center is being utilized to deploy field teams and analyze the video coming in. Law enforcement experts tell us another resource police have will help them trace and possibly match the bullet shell casings left at the scene. A shell and a live round with the words delay and depose written on them, reflecting popular phrases in the insurance industry. To analyze the shells, experts say they'll use the ATF's NIBIN system, NIBIN standing for National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, which helps them match shell casings with other crime scenes. There are other physical resources to analyze DNA from a phone and a bottle of water which may have been dropped by the suspect.",

That could happen if Iran decides to enrich its stockpile of uranium, according to a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It says Tehran hasn't made the decision to create such a weapon but adds that the country's uranium stores far exceed its stated civilian needs, and it could quickly produce weapons-grade plutonium. The report also says Iran has the largest ballistic missile inventory in the region.The Israel military says it has launched airstrikes on positions inside Syria, marking a rare instance of Israel acknowledging attacks on its neighbor. Israel says the targets were routes used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons. The IDF also says it's killed one of the leaders of the siege on a kibbutz. And a military base during the October 7th terror attacks they say Majdi Aqilan, the deputy commander of the Hamas Shati Battalion, has been eliminated. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department says it continues to find, quote, that the allegations of genocide in Gaza are unfounded. Earlier this week, Amnesty International said it had gathered sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct during the war in Gaza amounts to genocide against Palestinians. The State Department spokesperson said it disagreed with the conclusions of Amnesty's report. Paula Hancock's following this for us, and an achievement, really, for the Israeli military who've been after anyone involved in those attacks.",
