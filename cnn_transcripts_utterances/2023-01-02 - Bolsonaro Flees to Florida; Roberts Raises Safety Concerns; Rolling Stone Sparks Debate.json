And even when he talked about safety, it was - it was not in a - in a big way. It was just a couple paragraphs toward the end after detailing threats to a judge back in the '50s during the era of school desegregation cases. So, in some ways, he side stepped the things that people were most thinking about relative to this Supreme Court, the major leak of the decision to reverse Roe v. Wade back in May when the chief said that he was going to launch an investigation of this betrayal of the Supreme Court. Didn't talk at all about that. Didn't talk at all about many of the ethical concerns that have come up in -- on multiple fronts. Remember the Supreme Court doesn't have any kind of formal ethics policy.

We will say who I love, Madonna, great performer, right, Janet Jackson, great performer. Do they have the strongest voices? No, but they're great entertainers.Same thing with a Cher or - you can go on and on and on, great entertainers, legends. You cannot. But can they sing like a Whitney Houston or a Luther Vandross or a Mahalia Jackson, who can just open their mouths and music comes out with just by going aahh. No. And I think a lot of those people were left off the list. And you should - that \"Rolling Stone,\" is great cultural influence.
