More than 400 targets, the IDF says, were hit in the past 24 hours. Israel has been directing much of its firepower toward targets in southern Gaza. It released a new evacuation map, showing Palestinians where they should go, even though much of the region is without internet. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 178 people have been killed since the truce ended early Friday. Meanwhile, this was the desperate scene in Khan Younis as aid trucks delivering drinking water outside the Red Crescent Hospital in the midst of a dire humanitarian crisis, southern Gaza hospitals have been overwhelmed by casualties since the fighting resumed. Here's what a U.N. spokesperson said about the situation on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANE DUJARRIC, U.N. SPOKESPERSON (through translator): You will need to recall that, before the pause started, while the conflict was on, we were delivering humanitarian aid. So in an extremely challenging situation. So we do hope we will be able to continue to do that, while at the same time advocating for a resumption of the halt of the fight. As we've been saying, as everyone has been saying, no place in Gaza is safe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They could not have asked for a better final football game.This would feature two of the top five teams in college football. Two of the best quarterbacks facing off. He started off on fire. The Huskies would jump out to a 20-3 lead in this game. But the Ducks would rally. He's going to hit Terrence Ferguson for the score. Scored 21 unanswered points to take the lead but then it was the Huskies with back to back touchdowns answering. Washington goes up by 10. But the Ducks would not go away in this game. Back to pass, he'll find Rayshawn Holden and what a play he makes. He's going to weave his way through the defenders, breaks some tackles for a 63-yard touchdown. That was his only catch of the game. Certainly made it count. That made it 34-31. But the Huskies after that were able to run out the clock. Dylan Johnson rushed for 152 yards and two scores. Washington finishes a perfect 13-0, securing a playoff berth for the first time since 2017. All right. A major milestone in the NBA. Kevin Durant moving into 10th place in the league's all-time scoring list, passing the great big man Moses Malone with this bucket here in the second quarter. The Suns would lose to the Nuggets in this one. KD finished with 30 points on the night. He now has 27,423 for his career. At his current pace, he could pass Shaq by the end of this season. We had some stunning news in women's soccer. Sweden lost 1-0 to Switzerland in group play on Friday, which means they will had not be playing in the Paris Olympics next year. It's going to be their first time ever missing the Olympics. A powerhouse in women's football. Finally Tiger Woods out there for the second round of the Hero's World Challenge. He started off hot. He was 4 under through the first seven holes on Friday. He did have some rough holes on the back nine but rallied. Great birdie putt here on 17. Was 2 under on the day. He finished 1 over for the tournament. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
