The Palestinian Authority prime minister and government resign. Saying, the challenges facing Gaza and the West Bank require new political arrangements. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is in during its most difficult moments. He warns millions of lives could be lost without more aid. On the campaign trail, in the United States, all eyes are in Michigan. Could a protest vote by Democrats against President Biden spell trouble for his reelection bid? Well, nearly five months into the war between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian Authority is regrouping. The prime minister handed in government's resignation today and opened the door to a unity government. The authority governs parts of the West Bank, although it's not clear what role it could play down the road. This comes as more ceasefire talks are held in Doha, while Israel prepares for it offensive in the southern Gaza City of Rafah. I want now to get some insights. Nic Robertson is following developments from Tel Aviv. We've got Alex Marquardt in Washington for us, as well. Nic, I want to start off with you. I mean, looking at this resignation, it is significant. There's a lot of talk about a technocratic government being put in place. Who will appoint this new government? What will the makeup be? And what does it mean in terms of unifying the Palestinian cause essentially?",

      "sentences": "I think if you take a big picture, look at this. So, the pressure of the United States has beenputting on the Palestinian Authority to reform Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, when he visited the region in January. He said that he needed to see and wanted to see and would be pushing for the Palestinian Authority to reform, and he got that. When he left, he said he did have a commitment. That was the 11th of January. A commitment for that reform is taken a long time and nothing moves quickly here to see that reform. But it is in the United States' view a necessary part of the post Gaza war scenario where there is a Palestinian body that has enough credibility that it's -- that is free from the taint of corruption. That is supported by enough people in the West Bank and in Gaza to be an administrative authority for those areas. Indeed, that is on the path to what the United States says needs to be part of the go -- part of the way forward, is a guaranteed pathway to an independent Palestinian state. So, I think when you look at it in that context, that's where this is headed. But it's slow. I don't think we're going to expect to see any immediate change the Palestinian Authority, prime minister -- Prime Minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said, look, because -- as you said, because of what we've seen in Gaza, we're not suitable for the moment. So, let's reform or reshape. And he is sort of talking about a government or players that would bring about a government of national unity. Said, that this isn't going to be about parties, this is going to be about competencies, who is actually competent, does he mean technocrats here, it isn't clear at the moment. But I think what it signals is that in the -- in the big arc of the changes that need to happen for there to be a post Gaza conflict scenario that has a possible, however, remote pathway to enduring peace. This is one of the pieces of the puzzle. And it's interesting that just this week, many of the different Palestinian groups will be going to Moscow for meetings there, not all of them as far as we know so far, but some of them that will be a forum for discussion. But this is really part of the United States push and a reality on the ground that the Palestinian Authority really lacks legitimacy now in in the West Bank. They would not -- probably not taken a vote now. Certainly, the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas, his approval ratings, negative 92 percent, is not -- is not brought support for him.",

You can't have a day after the war until the war ends. Those questions of Palestinian governance, of Palestinian security, of rebuilding Gaza, those essentially cannot be addressed until the war ends. And the U.S. does not believe the war can end until they crack open this door to a hostage deal, and to a pause in the fighting. The only way the U.S. believes to get Israel to agree to a pause in the fighting is to come up with a plan to get these hostages released. And during that pause, the U.S. believes you can then start to talk about the end of the war, you can start to talk about the day after. So, it is very important what happened in Paris and a meeting on Friday. And what is happening, Eleni, today in Doha. We understand that the talks have progressed, that there are technical teams that are meeting in Doha today. That is to put finer points on the major parts of a would-be agreement.

Now, the prospects of Saudi Arabia seen as the leader of the Muslim world, normalizing relations with Israel has grown distant since Israel began its relentless bombardment of Gaza. But Israel seems determined to make it happen. That's Israel's economy minister, Nir Barkat, shaking hands with his Saudi counterpart right here in Abu Dhabi. Telling him, \"We can make history together.\" Now, there was no immediate reports about the meeting in Saudi state media, and the climate between the two countries has certainly been icy of late. The Kingdom has made it very clear there will be no normalization without a ceasefire in Gaza and progress towards an independent Palestinian state. The Russian war on Ukraine entered its third year this weekend. U.S. President Biden has repeatedly framed the need to support Ukraine as a matter of national security both abroad and at home.

At the same time, however, the idea that all of those Republican voters who voted for Haley are simply going to go and vote for Joe Biden, in the general election, seems a little farfetched. From my own reporting. There are a number of Republican officials who believe that a lot of those disaffected Republicans who voted for Joe Biden in 2020, are going to come back to Donald Trump in 2024. So, I think the jury is really out on how serious a problem for Trump these primaries show. Of course, you know, if Trump is convicted in one of his criminal trials, if he continues the wild behavior that we've seen from him, and that reminds people of how fraught his first term was, that could change things.

It was interesting that the Governor Gretchen Whitmer was quite honest in saying she didn't know exactly how this was going to come about, if large numbers of uncommitted votes start showing up. I think that's going to cause real alarm bells among Democrats. The reason is because there are, say 70,000 odd Arab American voters in Michigan, many progressive voters who are also angry about his handling of the war. And this is going to be a very tight state in November. In 2016, for example, Donald Trump won Michigan over Hillary Clinton by about 11,000 votes. Biden won by a much bigger margin in 2020.

This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal. We then see Bushnell pour what appears to be some sort of accelerant out of a water bottle onto his own head. And then he sparks a lighter and sets himself on fire yelling free Palestine again and again, as he's burning until finally he collapses. And police officers eventually rush in one of them with a fire extinguisher trying to put out those flames. But as you mentioned, we have learned that in the hours after Bushnell did die in a hospital. But look, Eleni, this speaks to be a tensions that continue to rise over the war in Gaza. Now more than four months into this conflict, the death toll in Gaza now nearing 30,000 people.
