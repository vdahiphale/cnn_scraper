As President-Elect Trump's staff takes shape, Stephen Chung is joining the White House as communications director.He served as the spokesperson for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. And during Trump's first term. He served as director of the Strategic Response. We're going to have more on this and Trump's other cabinet picks at the top of the hour. But wanted to bring you that update. We are following a lot of other news as well, including, out of Georgia, where we're really following gruesome new details as the trial gets underway for the man accused of killing Laken Riley. She's the 22-year-old nursing student that was brutally attacked while jogging at the University of Georgia back in February. Prosecutors say the Smart Watch she was wearing captured her 17-minute struggle for her life against her killer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just before noon, we witnessed what has been by far the most shocking and emotional moment of the trial against Jose Ibarra, the suspect in the death of nursing student, Laken Riley.The prosecution called Sergeant Kenneth Maxwell, with the University of Georgia Police Department, to the stand. He was the one who discovered Laken Riley's body, Omar, the day of her murder. And body camera video he recorded was played in the courtroom. Judge Patrick Haggard paused the proceedings to allow anyone who didn't want to see Laken Riley's body shown to have an opportunity to get out of the courtroom. We saw about half a dozen people leave, some of them in tears. As you can imagine, a very emotional moment. The video showed the moment Sergeant Maxwell found the body in a wooded area with the midsection and breast area partially exposed. This is what Sergeant Maxwell had to say in court about finding the body. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SGT. KENNETH MAXWELL, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE DEPARTMENT: It was more intentional. Somebody had attempted to remove her top or maybe had used it to drag her. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Investigators also found the victim's blood on the defendants hat, as well as the victims location, heart rate matching the time of the attack and video of Ibarra disposing the evidence.

That is sharply higher from about 209 million in 2021.And as America faces a growing obesity epidemic, there is a surge in popularity of so-called miracle drugs, GLP-1-like medications, including Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound. And there are questions about their long-term effects. We have CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who has just wrapped a yearlong investigation into these revolutionary medications.

I think with obesity, as you just sort of heard there, this idea that there's a center in the brain that's responsible called the satiation center, it's responsible for you feeling full after you eat. OK? When you eat, those hormones send a signal to your brain, OK, you've eaten, you don't need to eat anymore. Some people just don't seem to generate that signal as well. So even as they're eating, they're already thinking about their next meal. They develop anxiety if their pantry doesn't have enough food in it. That's, I think, where these medications are probably the most useful here, sending that signal to the brain that, OK, you can quiet the food chatter, literally quieting the noise inside your head. I think it's given us -- these medications have given us that insight about obesity.",

One is that, first of all, the medications have been around a lot longer than people realize. They sort of really came on to the scene a few years ago. But I traveled in Europe. I was in Denmark, for example. They have been there for a couple of decades now. Point being that there is some long-term data on these medications. Obviously, a lot more people taking it now so that data needs to be collected. What we don't know as much about is people who are taking this for medically not necessary reasons, so they're taking it off label, so to speak. There's not a lot of data in terms of long-term exact impact for those folks. So that's something to be aware of. The third thing that really jumped out from every researcher we talked to is, you know, when you lose weight on these meds, you can lose fat. But you can also lose muscle, and losing lean muscle mass, that's a real concern, especially for older patients. It predisposes them to falls. Predisposes them to a shorter life span. So how do you make sure that people don't lose muscle at the same time they're taking these medications? That's one of the big concerns in terms of longer-term side effects -- Brianna?",

One analogy was like hold a cancer convention at a tobacco plantation.And the president of Azerbaijan didn't do himself any favors by scolding the world upon their arrival, saying that their gas reserves are a gift from the God and they shouldn't be told it's evil and try to transition away. There's been sort of theatrical standoffs. A minister from France canceling a trip, tension with the Netherlands, and the host country here as well. This has led to this open letter from a bunch of high- profile activists who are earnestly trying to get countries to agree on action. They're calling for stricter rules for host countries, limiting fossil fuel influence, pointing out there 2,000 fossil fuel lobbyists in Baku, Azerbaijan, fight for their interests to keep drilling as long as possible, shifting the folks to action over negotiation. I guess there's hope with these folks that they have a week left, a half and a half left of the conference and they can pull it together. But it does not seem to be going well. And of course, Omar, the Trump specter of that presidency coming and pulling out of the Paris Accords, undermine so much for many. And we saw even the new president of Argentina pulling out dramatically on his way to Mar-a-Lago.",

And he's a big fan of wind energy, which President Trump is not. So who influences who going forward here? But it is an interesting pick since he does address a lot of the concerns of environmentalists and climate folks, but also those from energy as well.",
