It's been illegal to swim in the Seine for 100 years, but the river was being cleaned up for these Games to then leave for the people of Paris in years to come.There were the concerns last week after the practice sessions ahead of the men's triathlon were delayed. The race was delayed, but then ultimately did go ahead. I spoke to a couple of the athletes who took part in it. They said they felt the organizers had done the right thing. But then it emerged on Sunday that not one, but two female triathletes have fallen sick. There have been no direct links as things stand, but it's caused the Belgian team to withdraw from the mixed triathlon, which has taken place this morning. We wait and see, really, very much. We understand that there's a Swiss athlete and a Belgian athlete who have become poorly. But the race has taken place and it's Germany who have taken home the gold medal.",

The economy has taken a huge hit, inflation is at a record high, and Nigerians are buckling under the weight of extreme cost of living. And this all started with the fuel subsidy being taken away last year when the president was inaugurated. Nigerians were used to buying fuel at a very low price, and that spike increased the cost of everything almost immediately. And since that time, people have been groaning under the weight of this cost of living. And now it's rich boiling point, and they are planning to protest for the next five days, so in total for 10 days.
