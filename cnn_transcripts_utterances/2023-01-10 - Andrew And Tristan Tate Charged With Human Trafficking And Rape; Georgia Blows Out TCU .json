That is while prosecutors pursued these claims of sexual trafficking and rape.The accusation is here that these two brothers, along with two other suspects that were arrested at the same time -- these four formed an organized criminal ring that trafficked and exploited women across the United States, the U.K., and Romania. There is even an accusation of rape -- multiple accusations of rape against one of their victims. Now, again, this Romanian court holding them for 30 days while pursuing these claims. Today in court -- and I know you rolled those pictures of them going in -- the Tate brothers' attorneys are going to argue that detention is unnecessary. That they can be released. It's hard to imagine that a court in Bucharest would agree with that. These men are absolutely considered a flight risk. They have multiple nationalities. But again, this story that's absolutely captured people's attention and went viral on social media over the holiday period, and that is because these figures of male power, of male toxicity were taken down by none other than a young woman, Greta Thunberg, who with one clever tweet that went on to be one of the most popular tweets --",

And that's exactly what happened with Georgia just dominating TCU to become the first-ever to win back-to-back titles in the playoff era. TCU -- so they scored to make this game 10-7 but from that point on it was all Dawgs. They scored 55 straight points. Quarterback Stetson Bennett throwing for four touchdowns. He ran for two more. A storybook ending to his career. After being a walk-on at Georgia, he left to go to Jones County Junior College so that he could play. But after one year, he returned to Georgia, this time on a scholarship, as the third-string quarterback. Last year, he won the job and the rest is history, leading Georgia to back-to-back titles. Coach Kirby Smart calling Bennett the greatest Dawg of all time. He paused the game in the fourth quarter so that Bennett could get a standing ovation as he came out. Georgia wins by the biggest margin in playoff history, 65-7. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And SoFi Stadium has a roof but is open on the sides, and rain was actually pouring into the stadium and that caused the concourse to really just get soaked. And some fans were apparently slipping and getting injured. This video is from Arash Markazi that he posted on Twitter. It shows stadium security and paramedics having to go help many of the fans there. All right. And finally, we've got some great news from Bills safety Damar Hamlin. Just one week after his terrifying collapse on the field, Hamlin is back in Buffalo after being discharged from the hospital in Cincinnati. Doctors say the 24-year-old's recovery is remarkable and his neurological function is excellent. Bills coach Sean McDermott told reporters yesterday he went to see Hamlin in the hospital.

This weather whiplash is forcing California to face the dilemma of how to manage floodwaters as the state experiences dramatic shifts from drought to downpours.

We have to design flood insurance policies to encourage people to move away from floodplains so that we can open up the floodplains and when we get those floods they'll be less damaging.MARSH (on camera):  The idea of relocating whole towns and communities to allow rivers more room to flood is incredibly challenging for a number of reasons. It means local governments would give up short-term economic gain tied to building and development in these areas and, in some cases, could lose property tax revenue.

And that's fairly strict for a big company at this point.Iger told employees in a memo that working physically together is good for creativity. It's good for company culture. Four days a week by March first. We'll talk more about this in just a moment. But looking at markets around the world right now to start your Tuesday morning, on Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour -- you can see a mixed performance. In Asia, Europe leaning down. And on Wall Street, a mixed performance there was well. As stocks in the U.S. closed mostly lower on Monday, two Federal Reserve officials say they expect benchmark interest rates to rise above five percent. But Wall Street is still optimistic overall because of signs inflation may be slowing. Investors hope it means the central bank can raise rates more slowly in the months ahead. Gas prices, by the way, are also falling again. Travel is winding down after the holidays and gasoline demand is dropping a little bit. OK, so let's talk more about Disney's push to get those workers back in the office with Jessica Kriegel, chief scientist of workplace culture at Culture Partners. Good morning, Jessica.

We have tasted the fruit of working from home and we love it. Not only that, the studies show that people are happier, they are healthier. They are more productive when they're able to work from home. So forcing people back into the office for this idea that it might make people more creative -- well, frankly, it's not very creative in and of itself.

So clearly, it's an acknowledgment that things have changed and a recognition that people need a little bit of flexibility. There was a great piece in The Wall Street Journal that had this sort of anecdote about how some Vanguard employees say they were told that if they didn't comply they would be fired. What do you think is going to happen if bosses run against this wall? They're facing trouble retaining workers.

Well, culture is the experiences that we have that shape our beliefs about the work that we're doing, and that leads to the actions that we take -- whether we're creative or not -- and that's going to get us results.People at Disney are having an experience right now that what they want is not necessary. What they want is not important. We need you to be creative, so that means coming into the office. And this comes after, remember, the drama of the last couple of years of the Imagineering department needed to move to Florida. People being told that they had to relocate and then going back on that policy. And so, if I were working at Disney right now as an employee, the experience I would have had is that they don't see me, they don't value me. They don't care about what will make me happy, productive, and healthy. And I would probably want to leave. That would be the result they'd get. ROMANS:  All right, Jessica Kriegel, Culture Partners.
