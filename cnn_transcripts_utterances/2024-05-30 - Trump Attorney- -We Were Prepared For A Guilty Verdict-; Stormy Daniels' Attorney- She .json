And this is THE SOURCE. It's one of those where-were-you kind of moments in American history. When the verdict came down, on Donald Trump today, guilty, guilty, guilty, reverberating 34 times over, as the former President sat stone-faced in that New York courtroom. No matter how you feel about this case, or about Donald Trump, the man, it's an extraordinary stain, on the Office of the Presidency, and on Donald Trump's already-tarnished legacy. He'll be back in that very same courtroom for sentencing in this case on July 11th. That happens just days before he takes the stage, at the Republican National Convention, accepting his party's nomination for president. But this time, as a convicted felon. We saw Donald Trump earlier, raising his fist in defiance to the crowd that had gathered outside Trump Tower, late this evening. My lead source tonight is the lead attorney, who represented Donald Trump, in this case, Todd Blanche. And Todd, thank you for being here. Why do you think the jury found Donald Trump guilty on all counts? TODD BLANCHE, DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I mean, well, I don't know. I mean, it's a good question. I think understanding why a jury reached this verdict is something that every single trial lawyer in the country would love to be able to answer, honestly. Look, a lot goes into a jury verdict, that doesn't even include what happened at the trial, you know? The decisions that are made before the trial. The decisions that the court makes, and that the parties decide about what witnesses to call, what evidence to put in, you know? So, I think that at the end of the day, it remains true that if the word of Michael Cohen was not accepted at all, then you could not have convicted President Trump. And the jury convicted. So at the end of the day, they looked past what we thought were fatal flaws, in Mr. Cohen's story, and his past, and they reached a guilty verdict.",

And there was a lot.But look, at the end of the day, they -- it was still a case, in our view, as we've been saying for a year that relied on testimony of conversations and interactions that took place eight -- seven, eight, nine years ago. And certainly, documents were part of the case. But the documents that -- the 34 counts were documents that really had very little connection to President Trump, but for the checks that the few checks that he signed. Look, we -- I very much believed that the jury -- that the jury should have found President Trump not guilty. I mean, very, in my soul, I believe that, and I believed it for a year. I mean, I left a -- I left my job, to do what I did the past six weeks. And my conviction around what happened today, and what I believe the facts show remains the same.",

How many times throughout his life, have we seen him get away with things that mere mortals would not get away with? So, this idea that he finally had to be accountable is just like perplexing that this could actually happen. I have such admiration for the judge, for the jury. I mean, their lives are upended, and in danger. Their lives are at risk. We all know that. We all know their security is at risk. And they did what they had to do.

No. This was a state case. They -- he was indicted by a grand jury of regular New Yorkers. He was convicted by a jury of regular New Yorkers. Joe Biden cannot pardon him, because this is a state case. These are all things that I've heard from Trump supporters, and read from Trump supporters today. And that's the drumbeat they're going to be playing. Oh, this was all Joe Biden, this is a political persecution. No. He is there because it was not a persecution.

He had sex scandals. He was in the middle of, he -- the Bunga Bunga. He had all the things that kind of make up the Donald Trump moment. But what he did though that we all have to wrestle with is that he ushered in the far-right wing, into the mainstream of Italian life.
