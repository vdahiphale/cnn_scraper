The Trump immunity battle at the U.S. Supreme Court.About an hour from now, oral arguments will begin in Donald Trump petitioner versus the United States, and the nation's highest court will confront landmark questions. At issue Trump's claim that he has blanket immunity from criminal prosecution for his conduct on January 6th and other efforts to stay in power because, he contends, those were official acts as president. Those are arguments the lower courts have rejected. The stakes of this case are enormous, not only for Mr. Trump and the current presidential race, but for American democracy moving forward. The nine justices, including three justices appointed by Mr. Trump, have the power to set constitutional precedent, but could have a lasting impact on the ability to hold sitting and former presidents accountable to the rule of law, or in Donald Trump's view, the court's ruling could potentially clear the way for presidents to conduct official business without the fear of frivolous prosecution. Let's check in with CNN's senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, outside the high court right now. And Joan, your thoughts on the history-making arguments the justices are about to hear.",

I'll be both watching and listening for particular things.First of all, once I get into that courtroom, I'm going to be looking for who's in the justices' special guest. Who's come to watch this. You know, occasionally their spouses come in. Jane Roberts, the wife of the chief justice, often slips in just before arguments are going to be heard. I'll also be looking at the two lawyers who will be arguing this case, whose voices you're about to hear, Jake. John Sauer on behalf of former president Donald Trump, who argued the case in lower courts, and Michael Driven on behalf of Special Counsel Jack Smith defending the Justice Department, the United States government here, before the justices. And then I'll really be listening for what the justices themselves act asked, who dominates this, what will the chief be asking about. The chief who is very protective of executive authority, but also has had quite fraught experience with Donald Trump and will be very cautious about what sort of messages projected at this point. You know, they'll be going back to precedent from the time of the framing of the Constitution all the way up to Richard Nixon era and cases that involved him, and a precedent that was set when Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon after Watergate, and Jack Smith's side is arguing that that shows that a president could have been subject to criminal prosecution -- Jake.",

And so rejected the idea that what he was doing, you know, pressuring the Justice Department to investigate the election results, pressuring state officials engaging in this effort to put forth fake electors, rejecting the idea that any of those were official acts. Completely rejected at the lower-court level. So when the Supreme Court took this up, the two questions are, OK. Does the Supreme Court want to be the final word also rejecting this idea of absolute criminal immunity for presidents, or did they think there is a little bit of nuance here? And they'll send it back down to the lower courts to litigate that. Either way, the Trump team really walks into court today winning because just taking this up now so late in the game has made it difficult, though not impossible, for Jack Smith to bring this case before the election, even if he wins here today.",

And it really inserts the Supreme Court into a central role in deciding whether or not that same person is going to become president in the United States again.And I mean, to your point, Paula the delays here and this -- their decision, how they decide this could generate another set of potential delays. If their decision ultimately is what means that there's no answer to whether or not Trump is accountable for that day before the election, that means that millions of Americans are going to have to go and decide whether they want to put Donald Trump back in office without having a chance to see whether or not he was convicted here. And we know from talking to voters that they do care whether or not he is going to be convicted here. So there is a very -- there's an argument that the Trump people have made that pushing it this late close to the election is going to influence it.

      "sentences": "Jake, it's a split-screen day. This Supreme Court argument comes out of Jack Smith's federal 2020 election interference case here in Washington, D.C. Now, as you said, we've had to go through several steps of the legal process to reach the Supreme Court. It started in the federal district court, the trial court, Donald Trump claimed he was immune based on his status as a former president.The District Court judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, she quickly and swiftly rejected that. She ruled that there is no divine right of kings in this country. Donald Trump, you are not immune. Now at that point Jack Smith's team actually made an unusual move. They said Supreme Court, we want to skip this middle level. We want you to take this case directly. It's too important, it's too urgent. Supreme court said, no, you got to go through the normal channel so that brought us to the mid-level court of appeals. Donald Trump again claimed he was immune and again, the appeals court, they rejected that argument, too. [09:10:05] They said the same thing essentially, presidents are not covered by their status as former presidents. Now, a couple of things that we need to know and a couple of things we don't know about immunity. First of all, there is such thing as civil immunity. You cannot sue a president or other federal officials for things they did within the scope of their job. We know that from a 1982 Supreme Court case involving Richard Nixon. You will hear reference to that case today. What we don't know and what we will learn today is, first of all, is there such thing as criminal immunity for federal officials at all? And if so, what are the scope of those protections? Now we are going to hear I think three key arguments and some variation today from Trump's team. First of all, they argued in those lower court cases that Donald Trump has complete immunity for everything he did, from the moment he took the oath of office as president until the moment he left office four years later. That argument, though, has essentially been dropped out. I don't think Donald Trump's team is going to rely on that today in this Supreme Court. It's been firmly rejected by the courts below. I think the argument we're going to hear much more about is Donald Trump's claim that he has limited immunity for whatever he did within the scope of the job. There'll be a separate question about, was he within the scope of the job relating to January 6th and what led up to it. But I think that's going to be the main argument. The third argument you'll hear from Donald Trump is something called the impeachment judgment clause. His lawyers are going to argue that the only way you can indict a president or former president is if he has first been impeached by the House and then convicted by the Senate. The prior judges who heard this were very skeptical of that argument. And Jake, just one last thing, as Kasie Hunt was just talking about, the calendar is all important. And of course, the election is in November. We expect to get a ruling on this case towards the end of the Supreme Court's term. You're really looking here at late June, early July. And as you can see, that leaves us with only a very limited window where this case could possibly be tried if the Supreme Court sends it back down. So timing is of the essence here, Jake. This is going to be a history-making day in the Supreme Court.",

Laura Coates, let me start with you because when one is preparing for a U.S. Supreme Court argument, I assume they are studying where these justices have been, or at least five out of the nine, in order to win on the issue of presidential power. And this is, we need to remind our viewers. This is a conservative court. There are a lot of people on this court who believe that the executive branch, the presidential branch, has been too weakened in recent years, and so they're going to, I assume, the Trump lawyers, tailor their arguments accordingly. And the other lawyers, too, the defense lawyers, the U.S. lawyers, will also tailor their arguments that way.",

      "sentences": "Well, they need not go back quite so far. Remember, before the 2020 election, the Supreme Court was considering the issue of immunity for Donald Trump as related to his taxes. And Justice Roberts wrote an opinion, where he talked about that a president does not enjoy immunity for a criminal subpoena. They could -- and they sent it back to the lower courts.It kicked around for about six months until after the election. And so they could go back to that and try to play to that very side and say, you know, we've been here before and last time we kicked it down to think about the contours of this and so, on a precedent-making day, they're aware that these judges do not necessarily want to rewrite history. They want to rely on their past precedent and they could maybe do a light edit on that very ruling. But they also know they have to think about the larger audience here, including those members who did not sign onto that unanimously and said, well, hold on a second. Are we really going to say that a president would essentially have no checks and balances when we ourselves are the head of judicial branch who knows we have to check and balance the other branches.",

It's about what will come out in the course of the trial.Our sources have told us that there is critical grand jury testimony, evidence that Special Counsel Jack Smith has, that while the January 6th Committee learned a lot, he has much more and that the American public should hear this evidence, should hear this testimony before they vote.",

And Donald Trump has been that as a political figure since he became a political actor in, you know, the most recent case in 2015.I think that -- I've been thinking about the choice that the court made to decide to even hear this case in the first place. They very well could have let the lower court ruling stand. They could have just stayed out of it. I think some people worry that the court might be wanting to outline the contours of what immunity could look like for a former president in a way that might give a former more leeway. But I do think we have to seriously contemplate that Donald Trump is a major party candidate for the presidency again. He could very well win and we may very well need to know the answer about what are the contours here of what is acceptable and what is not? Because Trump has this way of just pushing the boundaries all the way to the very edges. I mean, his lawyers brought up this possibility or essentially that he could order an assassination of a political rival and essentially be immune from it. Those things have to be taken seriously and maybe we do need to hear what the court has to say about that. You know, I think right now at the lower levels, also, there's just an attempt to on all the things that happened between, you know, the 2020 election and, you know, January 6th is to say we need a full accounting of all of that, and the system now has to decide if it's possible for there to be accountability.

The Supreme Court, we're going to get clarity. Forget about it. Forget about it because there's not just this case and the Supreme Court case. In Michigan the other day, the state case there, a witness testified that Donald Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in the effort to overturn the Michigan election results.Just yesterday all of the Trump inner circle indicted in Arizona in another new case that they tried to overturn the election results in Arizona. So the Supreme Court will answer the immunity question eventually. And Donald Trump wants to delay. Everything he does is delay, delay, delay. Let me give you two numbers why. The recent AP poll, 22 percent of Republicans said he would be unfit for office if he is convicted in any of these cases, 22 percent of Republicans. You don't lose them all, some of them say, I can't vote for Biden in the end. But if you lose a chunk of them you lose the election. And just the other day, in your home state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Nikki Haley, who's been out of the race for how long? Got 17 percent of the vote. She got more than 150,000 votes in the Republican primary and she's long gone from the race. What does that tell you? And this is a closed primary. There are only Republicans. Trump always says there are Democrats voting here. The Democrats voting there. These are Republicans. A significant slice of Republicans have severe doubts about Donald Trump. Some of it is character, some of it is COVID, but some of it is this. Some of it is the legal issues against him. So he wants to delay this as long as possible. He wants to make it all a witch-hunt, make it against if his Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court says he does not have immunity, takes a lot of air out of the Trump balloon.",

You're going to become a ceremonial president.You're just going to be doing nothing. You're not going to take any of the risks both good and bad, if you're going to make some great decisions and save the country, you're going to make some decisions which are unfortunate, but that's the way it is. But you're not going to do anything if you don't have immunity because otherwise you're going to be processed after you leave office for doing something like going into an area, going into a country, doing lots of things that you would be doing. And we don't want a ceremonial president. We have to have a real president. And assuming you have the right person that can make a big difference. You saw that for four years when I was president. We're respected all over the world. We had the best economy we've ever had. Everything was good. We had no wars. We defeated ISIS. We had no wars. We had no nothing. But we're respected all over the world and now it's a disgrace. We also, by the way, had the single best border ever in recorded history of our country. We have the best border ever.

They don't want MAGA here. They don't want anybody. This thing is locked down like a buttoned-up vest and it shouldn't be. If they did the same lockdown in Columbia, NYU, and the colleges and universities, you'd have no problem whatsoever, but there you could put tents up. You can stay as long as you want. But this courthouse is locked down. There's not a person within five blocks. They have more police here than -- and I call them New York's finest because that's what they are. And they don't want to be doing this either. They'd like to be straightening out conditions and they'd like to be at the colleges and making sure that they don't have what's happening, because what's happening at the colleges is a disgrace. All over the world, people are laughing at us. This is the worst run country right now, probably anywhere, just about. You don't get much worse. We have a president who's a disaster. We have a president who's the worst president in the history of our country. All you have to do is look at the millions of people coming in from prisons, from mental institutions, and terrorists coming in at levels we've never seen before.
