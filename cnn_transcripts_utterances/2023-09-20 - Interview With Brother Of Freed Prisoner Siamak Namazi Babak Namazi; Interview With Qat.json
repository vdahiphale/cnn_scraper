Invading country, occupying territoryis something not acceptable for us, for the International Community. It's violating the international law, and this is something all of us, we need to be clear with. What's happening right now, unfortunately, we always see talks about continuation of war but not really how to seek peace and how to end this war. And this is something very frustrating for us and for a lot of the countries, which are considered or called today the Global South, because they are suffering from the results of this war with (INAUDIBLE), the grain supply, with their -- the energy supply. And we have seen this even throughout the debate here at the U.N. this year. We have seen a very strong momentum from the European countries, from the U.S. to support Ukraine, and this is something we totally understand. We totally want to stand with any country that's been subject to attack. But also, this is raising the bottom, the expectation for other smaller countries which believe they are neglected in that. And they became more and more excited that these rules which was applied and advocated for Ukraine would be advocated for them with -- and the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The world cannot be held in double standards. I mean, that's what's now the bottom line for most of the developing countries. And they want to see the same commitment towards them as well. And this is, I think -- this is the key. And the key now is how to find peace in that war and end it and any occupation.
