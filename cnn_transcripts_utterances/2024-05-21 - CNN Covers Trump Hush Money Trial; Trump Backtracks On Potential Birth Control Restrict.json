      "sentences": "Thank you for having me on. The jurors have two jobs. One is to be the finders of fact. And once they determine what the facts are, then they must apply the law. And the law is given to them in these jury instructions. And it is really interesting to note that when guilty verdicts are reversed by the appellate courts, the most frequent reason is faulty jury instructions. So, the judge is determined, most judges are, to get it right.And you saw today where the lawyers were going back and forth primarily about the instructions of what the law says about these crimes. There are going to be standard instructions about the credibility of witnesses and all of that. That's kind of standard stuff, but the key to this is what instruction the judge is going to give about the crime, the elements of the crime. What intent? Will there be an instruction about misdemeanors? So, this is absolutely important. And the concern I have, Laura, is that jury instructions, my understanding, and I hope I'm wrong, that in New York, the jury instructions on paper do not go in with the jurors when they deliberate. How in the world can 12 people, even if two of them are lawyers, they were civil lawyers, they didn't do criminal work, how can they possibly have the ability to remember all the verbal instructions, pages and pages, that the judge will give them? When I was a trial judge, I always provided the jurors with printed copies.",

It also goes to reasons in part why Judge Merchan wants to have this not a start and stop deliberation because jury notes and beyond are going to be impactful in all of this.Let me bring you in here, Devlin, because based on what you heard today, do you have an idea of what the key instruction the jury will be tasked with next week?

And so, I think intent is a big part. There's a lot of different fights about that in different pieces of language. But again, this stuff is very complicated.

Your Honor, let me turn back to you, though, because you mentioned something about there could be a misdemeanor instruction. This has been a very important point of reference because, obviously, there is the falsified business records. In New York law, that is a misdemeanor. It becomes a felony when it's done to try to hide another crime.It appears that the theory they're using is either a conspiracy base or a campaign finance violation or contribution or maybe even tax fraud. That has to come out in summation, in full. But what would be the instruction for the jurors? Are you saying they could possibly be spying for a misdemeanor nonetheless?",

So, it's really interesting because on the defense side, they may say, yeah, we want judge included instruction that says you could just convict him of the misdemeanor or misdemeanors. The prosecution, however, may say, oh, no, no, no, we don't want this lesser included. We're going with the felony. It's all or nothing.So, sometimes these lesser-included end up being a compromise by jurors if they just want to get unanimous on something. So, the prosecution may say, nope, we don't want it. The defense may say, yes, we do. And then it's left to the judge to decide. And sometimes, for example, in California, there are mandatory instructions that say if there is a lesser included, it has to be given. So, I don't know what the procedure is in New York, but it's certainly an issue of importance to both sides.",

So that's why I think you kind of saw him try to push this off in answering because he doesn't maybe know where his base lands on contraceptives.
