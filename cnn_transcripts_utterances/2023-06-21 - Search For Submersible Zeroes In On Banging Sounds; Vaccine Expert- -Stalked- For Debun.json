They are desperately trying to rescue the five human beings on board before they ran out of oxygen. I'm going to speak to someone who has been on the very submersible that is missing tonight.Plus, he knows all too well the horrors of being trapped in the ocean hundreds of feet down, no light, no heat, no oxygen. I will speak to a man with a miraculous story of survival, and why he is saying that there is hope tonight. And, under attack -- anti-vaxxers stalking and harassing one of America's top vaccine experts, Dr. Peter Hotez, after he criticized RFK Jr.'s anti-vaccine crusade. Dr. Hotez is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, holding out hope. Underwater noises detected in the search area for the missing Titanic bound sub is raising the possibility that the five passengers are still alive inside that vessel. The time is running out. It could be hours here of air left. The Coast Guard estimated that this time last night that the sub had about 34 hours of breathable air left.

Now those buoys first detected those underwater noises I reference. They have been described as, quote, banging noises. And it's that description -- banging noises -- that makes people think, well, human beings, perhaps in that submersible, are making them, desperately trying to signal where they are.Also tonight, the state of the art robot I am showing here, which is capable of operating more than 12,000 feet below sea level, is also expected to arrive at the search site. It is called the Victor 6000. Now, obviously, if you rescue the sub at this point to find it, getting it out is minute by minute, what matters for oxygen. And while this robot can't lift the sub on its own, it does have the ability to hook the 23,000-pound submersible to a ship and get to the surface. But, of course, they have to find the sub first. And originally, the search area with the size of Connecticut. Now, we understand it is about twice the size of that state. And, of course, the sub is about the size of a minivan. Now, in a moment, we are re going to hear from someone who is on the very sub that is now missing, and you will hear what he experience to his trip to the Titanic.

And then it was shifted to thimerosal preservative. And he was a big proponent of it in the 2000s. Then, when that got debunked, it was spacing vaccines too close together.

Obviously, they are stuck somewhere in near freezing waters, if they have gotten anywhere close to the titanic records or if they continue to drift after they lost communications. OUTFRONT now, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, our medical analyst and, of course, a cardiologist as well. So, Dr. Reiner, we're looking at nearly 90 hours, nearly four days since the submersible went missing. The oxygen supply is running low. We don't know exactly how low. We don't know what they could do to extend it. What are the top concerns right now for the passengers if they are alive? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, obviously, the top concern is the oxygen supply. Once the oxygen runs out, a human being will lose consciousness within several seconds. And then will die within a few minutes deprived of oxygen. There are other concerns as well. As you mentioned, the temperature of the water, 13,000 feet, is about zero to three degrees centigrade. That's 32 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. It will become as cold as a refrigerator. Your refrigerator at home is probably around 40 degrees. That will become basically, 32 to 35 degrees. Hypothermia ensues with body temperatures below 95 degrees. Unless they are equipped with cold weather gear, which seems unlikely, that they brought along with them, that will be a major risk. And then, finally, carbon dioxide. CO2, which we all exhale, is normally in very low concentrations in the air. But in confined spaces, like that small mini-van sized sub, if the CO2 is not actively removed from the air that the crew and passengers are breathing, it will become toxic and eventually can even asphyxiate them. And there are scrabbers on these submersibles, but it is possible that there is a limit to how much CO2 that device can remove. So, that becomes a concern as well.",

But I do think they are very confident they are going to make this counteroffensive a success.It is one of the things we heard also today from the main commander on the southern front, who is saying that there's fierce battles, that they are hitting the Russians extremely.

Also, the deputy defense minister came out today, and said the Ukrainians are entrenching positions they have taken and moving forward. Now, of course, those movements are difficult and slow because of those really tough Russian positions and, quite frankly, because of the Russian air power as well. But soldiers that we have been speaking to on the ground say that they are absolutely confident they are going really deep into Russian held territory -- Erin.",
