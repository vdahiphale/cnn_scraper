Hong Kong battered by high winds and rain from a super typhoon. The Spanish men's coach apologizes for supporting the country's embattled soccer chief. And the U.S. continues to add jobs despite the Feds' rate campaign to cool the economy. Russia reporting new Ukrainian drone attacks inside its borders for the fourth straight day. Now, officials say air defenses intercepted one drone headed towards Moscow overnight. As you can see from this map, showing some recent targets, this part of an apparent new effort by Ukraine beyond its borders. Now Ukrainian intelligence says a drone strike on an air base deep inside Russia earlier this week was launched from inside that country. The Kremlin isn't commenting on that claim. We're learning a lot from the skies over the two countries today, including the damage that strike did to the planes you see at this Russian air base. And new perspective on the battlefield. This Ukrainian Security Service video shared exclusively with CNN, shows just how entrenched Russia is on the front lines south of Zaporizhzhia. Fighters refer to these defenses as, quote, \"dragon teeth.\" Kyiv says its troops, though, are making some progress. Well, A short time ago Ukraine's foreign minister sat down with my colleague, Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, where he addressed criticism of Ukraine's counteroffensive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, you know, it may surprise you to learn that the person who filed this initial complaint the night of the World Cup wasn't Jenni Hermoso. It was a man, a man who has been following the federation for some time and monitoring it for abuses of power. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (voice-over): At the moment of Spain's triumph an unwanted kiss now threatens to bring down Luis Rubiales, the powerful president of the Spanish Football Federation. Rubiales apologized but it was not enough, and he became the target of national anger, a wave against sexism in sport, triggered in part by Miguel Angel Galan and his unassuming office in Madrid, officially the head of the National Training Center for Football Coaches, unofficially, the longtime nemesis of Rubiales and the football federation. He says he has filed more than 50 complaints against the federation, one of which landed the previous president in prison. Now he hopes to take down another with this case. It was a sexist and intolerable act, a chauvinistic act, he said to CNN, by a president who is already plagued by corruption scandals and sexism. Steeped in tradition, Spain's Royal Football Federation has long ruled over the nation's lucrative football fortunes. When this furor broke, Spain's prosecutor was already investigating Rubiales for trafficking in influence and bribery, allegations Rubiales has consistently denied. CNN has reached out to both the federation and Rubiales, neither have responded. And now, women footballers have entered the professional ranks. They are demanding equal pay, rights and structural change, says the president of Spain's women's league, La Liga F, Beatrice Alvarez, who's had her own disagreements with Rubiales. In that federation meeting, that totally delirious speech he made, she says, look at how they applauded him. It is unacceptable. It shows that more than the president has to change, the entire model has to change. As the scandal grows at the Rubiales hometown church, his mother went on hunger strike to support her embattled son. Briefly hospitalized, she continues to defend his innocence, even as others close to him are speaking out. His own uncle, Juan Rubiales, told Spanish news, \"El Mundo,\" that the kiss was just the tip of the iceberg. I was not surprised by that at all, he said. He is an extremely arrogant man, who has not acted as a president should. Instead of being a political leader, he wanted to be a warrior, who sees ghosts and enemies everywhere. He said, in the end, his own worst enemy was himself. Spain's historic win at the Women's World Cup it seems is forging a path for change in more ways than one. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So there have been wind gusts of up to 150 kilometers per hour sensed here detected by the Hong Kong Observatory. I'm at the Hong Kong Causeway Bay, a typhoon shelter. So this is a little bit sheltered for some of the boats here. And still, the wind comes pounding through here. The high tide is not supposed to take place for a little bit more than an hour now. And the meteorologists are predicting that there will be storm surges of up to 3 to 6 meters higher than usual depending on what part of Hong Kong you're at right now. The city takes these storms very, very seriously. This is only the fourth time according to CNN's weather team that Hong Kong has issued a T-10 warning in 23 years. And nearby southern mainland China has also issued its highest storm warning. And recall that this is a very densely populated part of China, all around the Pearl River Delta. And so you've had the nearby city of Shenzhen, with a population of more than 13 million people, its airport has been shut down since the middle of the day on Friday. The schools have been closed in Shenzhen. Here in Hong Kong as well. And just to get a sense of what this sounds like, I'm going to pause for a second and just listen to this storm for a few seconds. So we are seeing downed trees, some uprooted trees. I personally can report I've got rain coming in, leaking into through my bedroom windows right now. My poor wife is trying to dry up with all the towels. We're hearing anecdotally reports of some people who've had windows shattered. So this is a very serious storm. The authorities are urging people to stay in shelter, to stay away from windows as well. They've opened shelters for people who need them.

And quite frankly, after all these rate hikes, so we should. To your point, 187,000 jobs added. But the devil in the detail, there were some revisions to that months of July and June. They came down by more than 100,000 jobs. There's another couple of elements in this that are important, we've got the Hollywood writers' strike, we saw the film industry shed some jobs. We also saw the trucking industry, a big bankruptcy there. And that was another 30,000 jobs lost. So some of these things will fall out next month. Your point about the rise in unemployment rate is important. And that's sort of causing what some degree of alarm. Remember we're at an incredibly low level, even if they stage. And we actually saw more workers coming into the U.S. labor force. So the participation rate rose. And if you want to see a little bit more slack and find it easier for employers to find workers, and that's kind of good news. Remember the other thing that we care about with the labor market is the impact on inflation via wages. That was a little bit softer than expected. Overall, how is the Federal Reserve going to look at this? There is a lot of people looking at this now and saying, look, we think this probably, as far as the labor market is concerned, suggest the Federal Reserve is now done and probably won't need to do that final, final rate hike in the month of November. Nothing is priced at this stage for September. And I don't think anything changes this month at all. So arguably that should be good for stocks and for investors, because it means we're not going to have to suffer any more rate hikes, but there's a lot of other data out there, and ultimately, Becky, the wild card here is the strength of the consumer. And we had a really great data point from the consumer again, so shopaholics not-so- anonymous, one here perhaps, continues to help support the U.S. economy. And if you put me on the spot, I'd say I think the Federal Reserve is done, but we'll see. For now solid report.",

This is the seventh coup in three years in this part of Africa across the region, and many of the countries where they have suffered the coups have been in fact French ex-colonies, and especially places where the French believe that they had some kind of influence in maintaining democracy. And obviously that is not the case. President Macron was just speaking to ambassadors here earlier this week. And he basically told them, this was after the coup in Niger, and he said that he wanted to stop the epidemic of coup detats across Africa. And then less than 48 hours later, there is the coup in Gabon. So it's really something that the French are wondering about, how they are going to go ahead and either participate with the military leaders, or ignore them like they're doing in Niger. Now there are other people as well who are appalled at sort of what's going on. The head or the president of Nigeria, who's also the head of ECOWAS, says there's got to be something to stop this epidemic of coup detats. And the U.N. secretary general, Antonio Guterres, also said that military is not the solution to Africa's problems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N.

In Niger, in fact, they had somewhat outside observers believed were democratic elections. And just a couple of days after the elections took place, the elected president was thrown out by the military. So there are differences there but there is this whole idea of it being a military takeovers. France has told its ambassador to stay in the embassy and to stay there even though the Nigerian authorities have given him 48 hours to leave the country. Sylvain Itte has been told that he will have all of his credentials withdrawn and that military police will take action to throw him out. So it's a standoff at this moment. The French have said don't go, and the ambassador seems like he's staying. They have 1500 troops in the capital Niamey, which could be pressed into service. But that would be a real dramatic move on the part of the French if they were trying to do that because it would be an obvious sign of military action that the Nigerians would not like at all -- Becky.",
