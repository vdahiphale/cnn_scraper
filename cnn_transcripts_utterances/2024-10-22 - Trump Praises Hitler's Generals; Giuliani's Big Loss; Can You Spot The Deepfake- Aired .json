Plus, Giuliani losing big time tonight. A judge ruling he must turn over his most prized possessions, including his New York City apartment, to the two Georgia election workers he defamed. Their attorney is with us live. So what are they going to do with Giuliani's possessions? And can you spot the deepfake here? New warnings about the lengths that some are going to trick voters and why its becoming nearly possible to tell what's fake or what's real without using A.I. yourself. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, the kind of generals Hitler had, an 11th hour bombshell report from \"The Atlantic's\" Jeffrey Goldberg, quoting Trump, touting the loyalty of Hitler's generals and reporting that Trump complained about picking up the tab for a fallen U.S. soldier's funeral, calling her an F-ing Mexican. Let's start with Hitler's generals. Goldberg reporting that Trump asked former or that he asked Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, about claims that Trump once asked him, quote, why can't you be like the German generals? So, Goldberg, then rights, well, he told me that when Trump raised the subject of German generals, Kelly responded by asking, do you mean Bismarck's generals? He went on, I mean, I knew he didn't know Bismarck was or about the Franco-Prussian War. I said, do you mean the kaiser's generals? Surely, you cannot mean Hitler's generals. And he said, yeah, yeah, Hitler's generals. And \"The Atlantic\" goes on to cite than two more sources who were at the Trump White House, they claimed that they heard Trump say, quote, I need the kind of generals that Hitler had, people who were totally loyal to him that follow orders. Now, tonight, a Trump's spokesman shutting down that reporting, telling us -- insisting that Trump never said this, but there's more in this \"Atlantic\" reporting from Jeffrey Goldberg, who also says tonight the Trump was outraged after learning the cost of a fallen U.S. soldiers funeral, which he had offered to pay for personally. Army Private Vanessa Guillen was murdered by a fellow soldier at Fort Hood in April 2020. Now, according to \"The Atlantic\", months later, in December, Trump reportedly asked his advisers in a meeting, quote, did they bill us for the funeral? Because he had offered to pay for it. And then he continues according to the reporting saying, what did it cost? Now according to attendees and to contemporaneous notes of a meeting taken by a participant, an aide answered, yes, we received a bill. The funeral costs $60,000. Trump became angry. It doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury an F-ing Mexican. Now again, I'm reading here, the entire part from \"The Atlantic\". The Trump campaign denies Trump said this entire exchange and it is important to note that the sister of Vanessa Guillen tonight fighting back against \"The Atlantic's\" reporting. She said to the publication, wow, I don't appreciate how you're exploiting my sister's death for politics, hurtful and disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members. President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family and Vanessa, in fact, I voted for President Trump today. Jeff Zeleny is OUTFRONT live in Detroit where President Obama is set to take the stage at a Harris rally shortly. But, Jeff, you know, obviously a report like this, you know, it's coming out now. It is coming out right before the election. That is what those involved to share during the information clearly wanted, is the Trump campaign worried about this new reporting from \"The Atlantic\" coming at this 11th hour.",

So, Fred, let me ask you because, you know, look, Hitler's in the headline that \"The Atlantic\" tried to put their, but, I know we're living in sort of an odd world, but we've heard Trump talk about Hitler before. Jim Sciutto's reporting, right? We haven't heard anything for is what he said allegedly in this reporting about this soldier.So let me just give the background here. This is a 20-year-old army private, Fred. She was bludgeoned to death by a fellow soldier. She was the daughter of Mexican immigrants. She grew up in Houston, Texas. Trump had told the family that the military would be paying for the funeral and then he said if you need help, I'll help you out. So, a few months later when he's in this meeting with staff, this is where the reporting comes in, according to Goldberg, Trump asked, did they bill us for the funeral? What did it cost? According to attendees and contemporaneous notes of the meeting taken by a participant in aide answers, yes, we received a bill, the funeral costs $60,000. Trump became angry. It doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury a fucking Mexican, excuse my language there. I just read it. But that's what he said. So, Fred, let me ask you in the family comes to Trump's defense, which they are her sister, and said she voted for Trump and that this is not true, Trump denies it. Do you think something like this matters, Fred? FRED HICKS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think both the previous report and this report matters, and here's why. The one place where we agree is that if someone's undecided at this point, it is because they know what they think about Donald Trump and they're looking for a reason to vote for Kamala Harris or just a vote at all. And so, when you have reporters like Hitler and you have this report about, about the soldier, these are things that just solidify people who are undecided because they don't like Donald Trump. And it creates an opening for Kamala Harris to over the next week, at seven, 10 days to move them into her column, and a race can be won or lost on the margins, something like this can make a big difference. And listen, when you think about the story, about the private, it reminds me of what happened just a few weeks ago at Arlington National Cemetery, and all the other things where you have so many generals who served under Trump, who is supporting Kamala Harris -- all of this thing, all of this goes to a very strong closing argument for -- for the vice president and buttress our argument that in many ways is the enemy from within.",

It's also important to say that obviously the private sister is coming to Trump's defense, but to Fred's point, Trump has said comments that are not inconsistent with this, right? He's been very open. Maybe it doesn't drop F-bombs in public all the time. But his point of view has been said before.Here's just some examples. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's never been anything like this happening to our country. They're changing the fabric of our country. They're destroying our country. Nevada is being turned into a dumping ground and you are the whole country is being turned into an absolute dumping ground.

Listen, he complained that she wasn't doing interviews, she's doing that. He complained that she wasn't doing enough rallies, she did that. She was here in Atlanta all weekend long, going across the metropolitan area, going to church services, attending rally. She's back again this week. The fact that she paused today to do two interviews and reach millions of Americans I think is smart and I appreciate the fact that she, unlike Donald Trump, didn't cancel them or stage an event at a closed McDonald's to try to get a little attention.",

He's pleaded not guilty.But not all deepfakes are as targeted manipulated images are all over the Internet. Some showing celebrity endorsements that aren't always true, like these images former President Donald Trump shared on Truth Social, making it appear he has the support of pop superstar Taylor Swift, despite a clear marking on one photo labeling it as satire. Swift actually endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in an Instagram post after the Democratic National Convention. Many experts aren't as concerned about fake celebrity endorsements. They're worried that manipulated content online will confuse voters or in some way keep them from going to their polling stations and it's incredibly easy to make manipulated images. I'm going to use a program called Adobe Access to manipulate a real photo into showing something that didn't actually happen. So I'll take this photo I'm going to say, show me a car crash. And here we go what could be taken several options of what could be a real car crash between two vehicles. Now experts are worried that somebody might take an image like this and share it online and say something along the lines of the polling station is closed because of this severe car crash that took place and that might not actually be true, but that could keep people home. So this election be aware, and always double check what you see online with your state's election officials. (END VIDEOTAPE0 GOLD (on camera): So if we pull up the image the original image and then the one I created you can see the fake car crash. And if you look closely, Erin, you might be able to see some of those visual distortions that are a marker of A.I. But a real important tip, if you're worried that something was manipulated by artificial intelligence and you're looking at it and it's related especially to your polling place, the number one tip is get off the site that you're seeing this on and go directly to a reliable source like your state official election website.",
