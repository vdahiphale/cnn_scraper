I know that trip very well, having done the same trip, one of the first members of Congress with then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to travel, to make that same trip that he did.

He has not led by America going alone. He has led by making sure he kept all of our allies together, and that Ukraine is getting the resources that it needs, and we continue to intensify and in. You know, we are making sure, like, for example, I'm proud that -- and applaud the additional artillery and ammunition that the president has pledged, and the anti-armor systems that they're using so effectively in the battlefield, and the air civilian radar, which is extremely important. So we continue to move collectively, together. That is key, that we're doing it together, with our allies. It's not the United States, I'm tired of hearing people, that the United States should do this by themselves.

And it would seem to me that what we would do is to make sure that the way we continue to punish China, is to make sure that the rest of the world is together, so that China has no other place to go -- nowhere else to go. And so, there is another trip that I made along with former Speaker Pelosi to that region, where we met with the South Koreans, and the Japanese, and the Malaysians, and those in Singapore, all of who are next door to China. And if we are all working together in the same way that we are doing in Europe, then I think that China and their economy would have extreme consequences. And that is the appropriate way for us to operate multilateral scenarios, working and meeting a real delegation of nations, together, so that those oppressive nations, those authoritarian countries will not prevail.

Just to have you hundred folks living here. As many folks know, the former president was also a former peanut farmer. And all day long, we have seen peanut trucks coming by here. The factory just off of Main Street here. Pretty much peanuts and lumber, all we have seen come back and forth down this road. And then here is main street. On the other end of main street, you have a train depot. That depot also served as former President Carter's campaign headquarters in the 1970s on main street is just peppered with different cute little stores and shops. In those shops are plenty of Carter memorabilia. Just to give you a sense of how central he is to this community. We also met a shop owner, I won by the name of Bonita who owns a sell food restaurant. She's had the opportunity to feed the Carters over the years. Take a listen to what she told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BONITA HIGHTOWER, OWNER , BONITA'S RESTAURANT:  You see this restaurant, its plopped rate in the midst of where the former president grew up at. For him to come from these humble means to being the 39th president of our United States is just phenomenal, you know? So, it just goes to show that it doesn't matter where you come from, it's all about what you desire and where you can go with that desire. So he is a living example to me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Basically, what it found is that a lot of parents are thinking kind of by definition, or maybe thinking, by definition, if my child has a fever, even if it's low, great I need to give them medication. And that is not the case.Let's take a look at advice from the American Academy of Pediatrics. What they say, this is for children over six months old, there are different rules for the little ones. They say you probably do not need to be treating the fever unless the child is uncomfortable. So, if your child has a fever, especially a low grade fever, but they seem okay, which sometimes happens, then you don't need to treat them. So, for example, if they're playing, eating, drinking, sleeping normally, then you don't need to treat them. That's what the American Academy of Pediatrics says.

You don't want to be dousing them with cold water or rubbing alcohol, those are all bad ideas. You do want to make sure they stay hydrated. For example, pediatricians will tell parents a babies, count the diapers. You want to have a certain number of wet diapers. Hydration is, so important with a feverish child. If you are going to use ibuprofen or acetaminophen, like Advil, Tylenol, different words for that, then you want to make sure that you're giving the proper dosage.
