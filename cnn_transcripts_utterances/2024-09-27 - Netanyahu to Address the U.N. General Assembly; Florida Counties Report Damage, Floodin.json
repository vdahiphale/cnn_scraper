      "sentences": "All right, you are seeing pictures of Prime Minister Netanyahu arriving here from yesterday. But any moment now the prime minister will address the United Nations General Assembly as the conflict's intensifying between Israel and Hezbollah this morning, with everyone worried about a huge war escalating, a regional war potentially. Israel placed tanks and other armored vehicles near the border with Lebanon, signaling that they could potentially, at some point if they decide, go in on the ground.Plus, we have seen overnight airstrikes. And this is in the middle of all the confusion surrounding Netanyahu's response to a potential ceasefire plan. CNN's chief national correspondent Alex Marquardt is outside of the U.N. You have had some really excellent reporting on this. What can you tell us about what - what I think the us thought was going to be a ceasefire announcement shortly?",

      "sentences": "Yes, at best, Sara, it appears to be a huge misunderstanding, which is really hard to believe because there were several days of discussions of negotiations earlier this week over what the White House then put out on Wednesday night, almost triumphantly, as this proposal for a 21-day ceasefire, a truce, a pause in the fighting to work on a diplomatic solution for the border between Israel and Lebanon, where tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have been displaced because of the last 11 months of the fighting.Now, White House officials assembled a call on Wednesday night. They said that it was an important breakthrough. And then just hours later, Netanyahu essentially dismissed it. He rejected it. He said that the IDF will continue fighting with full force, using all of their might against Hezbollah. And so we've been trying to make sense of this contradiction by the Israelis that has certainly frustrated and disappointed U.S. officials. And frankly, Sara, the White House has not come up with a good explanation because Israeli officials were very much involved in those discussions earlier in the week. So, what was put on the table on Wednesday was no surprise to them. And yet here we have Netanyahu appearing to not be on board with this plan. The White House's John Kirby told reporters just yesterday that they would not have put this plan on the table, they would not have made it public if the Israelis were not on board. And he said that he believed that all parties were negotiating in a sincere way. And yet here we have these conflicting attitudes towards this proposal. The Israelis do appear to be trying to smooth it over. They put out a statement saying that they - they support this U.S.-led initiative. They thanked the U.S. for their involvement. And they will continue the discussions in the coming days. So, it's clear that this is not yet a done deal. Certainly it does not appear to be imminent. These discussions are going to continue. So, we will be on the lookout for anything that Netanyahu says on this in the coming moments. He's the next speaker up here at the United Nations. And then later on this afternoon we're going to be hearing also from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will certainly be pushed on this. So, lots more to come today. Sara.",

      "sentences": "No, it's a very significant concern on the U.S. side and countless other countries here. That is the main concern right now that not only will that conflict in Lebanon escalate to include an Israeli ground incursion, but that could lead to a much broader regional war. That is what the U.S. and France and all these other countries that signed on to the statement on Wednesday night are trying to explicitly avoid.Now, we could see a scenario in which perhaps the Israelis would pound Hezbollah for the next few days from the air and then - and then turn their focus to this potential pause in the fighting. That - that, right now, appears to be the best-case scenario. But Israel has made clear that they are willing to go into Lebanon on the ground. This is no longer a hypothetical. They have called up brigades. Their top generals have said that they are planning for a ground incursion should they get that order. And the U.S. is now working as hard as it can to try to avoid that scenario. The secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, spoke with our colleague, Wolf Blitzer, earlier today in an interview that's going to be airing today on CNN, saying that they want to avoid that ground incursion because of that possibility of escalation. That is - it is a major, major concern that this conflict, not just in Gaza, not just in Lebanon, but it could expand in a much broader way, Sara.",

We're getting reports of hundreds and hundreds of water rescues overnight. That's what the FEMA administrator told us. Unprecedented flooding in Clearwater, Florida. Record storm surges in so many coastal communities.Let's get to CNN's Carlos Suarez, who is in Gulfport, Florida, this morning. Carlos, you had a remarkable day and night yesterday as the storm surge pushed inland in ways that I don't think a lot of people were expecting even where you were. What are you seeing this morning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John, so that storm surge yesterday at its peak was at about six feet. And, in fact, we were at this very location yesterday afternoon when it just became unsafe for us to stay here, and so we had to evacuate. We made our way inland.We are back out at the same location where we were yesterday. And to give you a sense of just how high the water was, yesterday, for our live location, my photographer, George, was perched up just atop that top - the top of the stairs there. By the time we left yesterday, and nightfall had fallen here, the water was well above that line. And so that's why all of this area here has been damaged. The National Guard is already here on the scene in Gulfport. You can see there's at least one, two, three boats that were pushed out from the bay that now sit kind of right near where a volleyball court used to be. And then here to my right, there is another boat that was pushed right into this casino. And then if you go over a little bit to your left, you'll see all of the pier that's missing, the dock that's missing. You can see where it came to a stop out here. And you can see at the far end yet another sailboat that sits there. And then at the very, very end there, there is another member of the National Guard. The teams there, we're told, are trying to take a look at all of this damage to get a better sense of exactly how much effort it's going to take to try to start removing a lot of this debris. John, I can tell you that over in the St. Petersburg area, in a really low-lying part of the city, we're told that some water rescues have been taking place overnight and into the morning hours because officials were having a really the hard time getting some first responders out there. And then over in Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, and the Tampa Bay area, around there, the mayor was up in a Tampa police helicopter and she got a look at some of the damage. And you can see that the flooding there is pretty widespread. And it's important to note, guys, that this storm stayed to the west of us. It was about 100 miles, if not more, to the west of Pinellas County. This was not a direct hit. And yet all of this damage was the result of the strong winds, the storm surge, the rain that fell and just gives you a sense of how big this storm was considering that it wasn't really in the direct impact where we are right now.
