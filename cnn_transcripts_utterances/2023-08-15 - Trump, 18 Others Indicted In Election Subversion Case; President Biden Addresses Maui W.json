      "sentences": "We are expecting to hear from President Joe Biden in just a few moments in Milwaukee. But first, Donald Trump's fourth indictment arrived last night. And it's the case many in his orbit have been the most worried about in no small part because several members of his team are also charged.The former president now ensnared in what's known as a RICO case in Georgia alongside some of his closest advisors like Mark Meadows and Rudy Giuliani over efforts to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 win in Georgia. The 98-page indictment includes conspiracy and racketeering charges. Trump and the 18 other defendants have 10 days to surrender to Georgia authorities. And the DA wants the trial to start within six months and she wants to try all 19 of them in one go. CNN's Sara Murray is outside the courthouse in Atlanta. Sara, this is a RICO case. This is something that's usually against the mob -- against gangs. Tell us more.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has made it very clear that she likes this RICO statute because she thinks it allows her to tell a more complete story when she brings her case. And I think we saw that again in this 98- page indictment that brings charges against not only Donald Trump but also 18 other co-defendants.And she's used this statute in unorthodox ways in the past. She brought a case against Atlanta public school teachers and other educators. Again, not what you would normally consider the RICO statute for as you said, it's often used to prosecute gang members. But again, in this case, she used it to lay out a sort of narrative about not just the efforts by Donald Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, but efforts by many of his allies in what she describes as this criminal conspiracy. People including Rudy Giuliani, including Mark Meadows, and including a number of local officials here in Georgia like David Shafer, the chairman of the Republican Party here. So, that's how she's presenting this case going ahead. And again, there's going to be a number of more challenges to this. When you have 19 defendants, that also means you have a lot of legal teams looking to punch holes in the case the district attorney is trying to make so we're going to see how that plays out, Jessica.",

We've heard from the local sheriff here previously who says he wants to keep this process as similar as it is for other defendants where you would get a mug shot or you would get fingerprinted. Normally, defendants here turn themselves into the Fulton County Jail.But again, now that we are in this position where Donald Trump has officially been indicted, the sheriff's office is going to have to start negotiating with the Secret Service as well as with Trump's attorneys about the logistics of how this is going to play out. So, it could look different for Trump than it does for typical defendants. And when Donald Trump has been charged federally, normally we see him walk into the courthouse. He gets processed there and he immediately shows up in court. Here, it could still take a little while for him to make that initial court appearance.",

He says he is sending not just our prayers, but every asset to help the people there. Noting that the death toll now stands at 99.But he acknowledged, and I'm quoting him here. \"We don't know how many bodies because the search of the burned area is just beginning.\" He also said in explaining his failure to visit Maui today he says he does not want to get in the way of recovery efforts. We'll continue to follow the tragedy in Maui, as well as the administration's response. Meanwhile, we're also of course covering news from Georgia last night, former President Trump in total now facing some 91 charges across four criminal cases, including Georgia's two cases. Federal, brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Two state cases. One in New York. The latest in Fulton County, Georgia. Can be hard to keep it all straight. That's before we even get into the issue of coordinating the upcoming court appearances and trial dates. Case in point, while Trump and his allies were focused on responding to the Georgia charges today, one of his co-defendants in the separate classified documents case was arraigned in Florida. CNN's Zachary Cohen has been covering this from outside the courthouse in Fulton County. Zach, make sense of us for -- of the latest -- for us, the latest charges coming out of that courthouse there behind you.",

We know that the DA, Fani Willis in Georgia in Fulton County here has given the former president 10 days to voluntarily surrender. She also issued what is effectively an arrest warrant if he does not choose to do so.We do expect Trump to in-person turn -- surrender to authorities here in Georgia. The logistics and the details of that are still being worked out. But you got to keep in mind as well that there are 18 other co-defendants that were named in this indictment, who will also have to turn themselves into authorities here in Fulton County. So you know, if we're going to really see how that plays out in terms of -- you know because Fani Willis herself has said that she expects and wants to try all 19 individuals, including Trump together. And it really does sort of underscore what the message of this indictment was. The sprawling alleged conspiracy case that Fani Willis laid out in these charging documents with everything from organizing fake electors to pressuring state officials to breaching voting machines in Coffee County. It does paint this narrative of a really broad -- a broad conspiracy case that she now is going to try to charge and charge in the near term.",

And his team tells me that they think it's working and so they're going to keep using it. And you've seen Donald Trump kind of reiterate the same rhetoric he has used when talking about the past indictments.He has called this election interference. He has argued that he is a victim of political persecution. And he's directly going after the person filing the charges. And in this case, it's the District Attorney in Fulton County, Fani Willis. Of course, in past cases, it's been the District Attorney in Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, or Special Counsel Jack Smith. Another thing I just want to point your attention to, Jessica, is the timing around some of these charges. We know that Fani Willis gave him a deadline as well as the other 18 co-defendants of next Friday, August 25 at noon to appear and surrender before the court. I'm told from my conversations with Donald Trump's team that they do expect he's going to end up going in person but the question is when. And there's not a lot of time. On Monday, he's going to be giving a \"major news conference.\" That's something he put out on Truth Social today. He'll be doing that in his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. And then next Wednesday is also the debate that's still up in the air whether or not Donald Trump is appearing. I'm -- all indications from his team I'm getting is that he probably won't appear.
