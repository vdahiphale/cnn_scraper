One of the things we have been discussing is Donald Trump naming these various people for Cabinet positions, setting up the administration. But this really sets up the next presidency. And you can see in the way that Donald Trump is handling it, how he wants to set the tone. Obviously, to be clear, Donald Trump can very quickly go back on anything that he has done. But as we have seen so far, he has really tried to keep the tone about this transfer of power. He showed up today. There was press waiting for him outside of the plane. He did not stop and give remarks. He only spoke briefly at the House conference, when he spoke there with Mike Johnson. And then he came here. We heard press shouting questions at him and Joe Biden. He really deferred to President Joe Biden. Joe Biden didn't take questions. Donald Trump didn't take questions. We obviously know Donald Trump likes to talk to the press, but it was clear, again, setting the tone here. And then he did not come out to the stakeout position. He did not speak to the cameras. There was an enormous amount of press here. So we will see what he does when he gets back on his plane to go back down to Palm Beach. But this is really the first time we're seeing Donald Trump in public since he won the election. He has been meeting with his advisers. He has been planning for the transition. He has been going over various policy decisions. And he also has been playing golf, as we know. But this is the first time we are seeing the president-elect here. And it's on this trip to Washington. And just one thing to point out, Donald Trump is visiting a Washington today that is fundamentally completely different than what we saw in 2020 and 2016. In 2016, he showed up to a Washington that he did not understand completely. He did not understand the government. And while he had control, he being Republicans, had control of the House and Senate. Donald Trump is walking into a Washington this time around in which the Republican Party is the party of Donald Trump. So this is a kind of defining homecoming moment for the former president and now president-elect.",

And while it is not mandated by law or written in the Constitution, it is a demonstration of the importance of peaceful transfer of power to our republic and to our democratic institutions. It made me sad that we didn't see it four years ago, because it is so essential to the character of our nation. And I know that it's really hard sometimes when you or your party loses. And so I felt for President Biden, and yet was really glad, as a historian, that he did extend the invitation.",

Kennedy had one of these meetings, and Eisenhower really laid out the stakes of everything that was happening around the globe. And Kennedy later wrote how impressed he was by Eisenhower's grasp of everything that was happening. Because Trump is sometimes a disrupter of those norms, I think, in this particular instance, he doesn't have a whole lot of ability to disrupt what President Biden is doing, because he's still in office. But he certainly can encourage his new appointments to work with the people that are currently in power to try and have that smooth transition. His ability to disrupt really came more when he was in office, when he really either commanded that his subordinates didn't participate or he dissuaded them from doing so, and that did have much more of an obstructionary effect. This time, it seems like he's playing nice with the peaceful transition, but, as they said, this could change in the coming weeks.",

That is the number two job under Mitch McConnell in the United States Senate Republican Conference.But it is also a big moment because it shows that there is a streak of independent senators in the Republican Conference who want to have an elected leader who knows the way that the Senate works, but also hasn't always had the closest or coziest relationship with Donald Trump. Now, he's done a lot of work over the last several months to repair that relationship. He went down to Mar-a-Lago in the spring. He also, according to people close to him, has had several conversations with the president in recent months and weeks as he was campaigning and crisscrossing the country, trying to get the Republicans elected to take back control of the Senate. But there was a time where he called for Donald Trump to pull out of the race in 2016 after controversial comments. He also said that Trump's plan after he lost to Joe Biden to contest the election was going to go down like a shot dog. That led Donald Trump to try and get Kristi Noem, another South Dakotan, into a race to try to fight him for his Senate spot. And she, of course, did not go through with that. But that just shows you that these two men have not always been close. And, obviously, that is going to be a big factor in the months ahead. But Thune has been telling his colleagues in recent days that he is committed to moving forward with Donald Trump's agenda. He was instrumental in passing the 2017 tax bill. They are going to be having to do a lot of new work on that legislation because many of those proposals are going to expire at the end of this year.",
