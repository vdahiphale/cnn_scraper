The other thing is, it's not quite correct. I know it's become a little bit of a slogan. Its not quite correct to say, Michael Cohen already went to prison for this. It's not quite for this.Michael Cohen, as he agrees -- Michael Cohen pled guilty to the federal campaign finance violation. That's a part of the state crime charged here. The prosecutors do have to show a campaign finance violation, but they also have to show falsification of business records. That was actually not part of the charge against Cohen. So, it's a distinction but an important distinction. JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST &amp; CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: So, they used when Cohen and somebody else at AMI, the tabloid empire, are texting and discussing possible names for Trump -- for -- from Michael Cohen's shell corporations in Delaware. They're using the signal app to communicate, Cohen says. Prosecutors are showing a screenshot of possible names and calls made on signal. This is again, as we've been told by our attorneys, our panel here, our law firm to my left. The idea that everything Michael Cohen says whenever and wherever possible, prosecution attorneys are coming forward and saying, and here's evidence of this that you just said, and here's evidence of that that you just said. Here is evidence of the phone call. Even if they don't actually have the substance of the phone call. They're just trying to make it clear that he's not making the story up. Here's all the evidence behind it. September 30, 2016, record shows an AMI employee messaged Colin, I will be at your office in a few minutes. Again, just trying to boost Cohen story to say, like everything he's saying has been adhered to the contours of the evidence and the facts in this case. Because they know, Kasie Hunt, and Daniel Rothstein and Cohen signed the agreement to transfer the rights of the McDougal story, but the agreement was ultimately never executed. We know that they know Cohen formed the company Resolution Consultants LLC to handle the payment that's the shell corporation resolution consultants. It's one of the two he sets up. We know that they know that the defense is going to come at Michael Cohen, like a hippo, like a rhino. Like a giant feast. Have you ever seen a hippo? Have you ever seen what they do? It's not a small thing. They are cool animals. They are -- they are vicious. Who don't even know this? That is, yes. Hippos are one of the nastiest creatures in the world. Anyway, they're going to come at him like a battering ram -- they're going to come at him like a battering ram that has credibility. They're about to introduce to them whenever they get their shot. They're going to have like, an hour's worth of lies, Michael Cohen told.",

I mean, one thing I'm curious, and I'm really watching for here too, is there are the technical issues of this, right? Did he actually lie? Is he telling the truth? There's also this kind of broader picture about Michael Cohen as someone who has a vendetta against Donald Trump and whether that undermines his credibility with the jury.

Cohen explains that the agreement with AMI was $125,000, not 150 because AMI agreed the compensation to McDougal for articles and covers was worth $25,000. So here they're going through the details of the payment to Karen McDougal, who actually received ultimately more than Stormy Daniels. She did not receive all of the $150,000.

But it was -- it was in essence, it's unclear what the intention was, but it protected him innocence in this because he said that Trump was the one instructing him to defy a subpoena.

Obviously, you know, they could have subpoenaed him here. The expectation when you talk to people familiar with the prosecutors thinking here is that, essentially, he would have gotten on the stand and just pleaded the fifth the whole time.

And this is significant because Cohen appears much more relaxed on the stand. He's looking at the jury while answering questions about the McDougal deal.I think we said earlier. Let's see how he does after the break because that was an opportunity for the prosecutors to really just pointed out to him that maybe he's not looking at the jury enough. And that is likely something he should start to do as they try to build trust, particularly as we get to a part of the story that has not been corroborated by other witnesses.

You can question them up, down and sideways. But in the state of New York, if you do that, you give immunity to the witness -- complete immunity. They can't be prosecuted for whatever the conduct is.

And as Michael Cohen is saying, it was going to be significantly impactful especially with women voters. You know whether the Stormy Daniels deal ever happened, because it was the Access Hollywood tape and the uproar over that. That is what fueled them ultimately to pay Stormy Daniels the money because before they had balked at the idea of giving her a six-figure deal, the Access Hollywood tape change that.",

He's also a Republican candidate in the Missouri attorney general's race. Good to see, Will.So, Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump knew about the Karen McDougal reimbursement. She's paid $150,000 by American media, incorporated, and then there is discussion of Donald Trump reimbursing them. According to Cohen, Trump said, don't worry, I'll take care of it. Do you think that's damaging for Mr. Trump?",

I think it's relatively easy for a witness to present a compelling case on direct after months and months and months of prep. The real test of all of this testimony will be under cross examination.And what we have as we've said repeatedly in court pleadings is a witness here who has -- is a serial perjure, who has been found liable for perjury on numerous previous occasions. That's all going to come out. The solidity of this story will continue to weaken over time. And I think we'll see that play out in court in the coming days.",

Cohen is reviewing an email from Dylan Howard saying, he deleted a 2008 story, Donald Trump playboy man. I guess that that had been up on the whatever National Enquirer website or whatever.

And we barely have one iota of evidence introduced over the last two weeks, including today, that President Trump committed any business records fraud, much less proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the evidentiary quantum that the prosecution is obviously required to meet here.So, to me all of the smacks of the distraction, the smoke and mirrors campaign, we've been seeing since the start of this trial. We're talking about a very simple, alleged offense here at the heart of the matter, which is business records fraud. And nobody seems to have any evidence whatsoever that President Trump committed business records fraud, I believe, because he didn't -- that he actually did nothing wrong here.",
