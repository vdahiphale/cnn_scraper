U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken says, what happens next rests on Hamas. at a news conference in Doha alongside the Qatari prime minister, Blinken said, some of the changes proposed by Hamas to the latest ceasefire plan are workable. Others he said are not. Despite the seemingly daunting obstacles, Blinken says he's not giving up on diplomacy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  You know, at some point in a negotiation -- and this has gone back-and-forth for a long time -- you get to a point where, if one side continues to change its demands. Including making demands and insisting on changes for things it had already accepted, you have to question whether they're proceeding in good faith or not. But based on what we've seen and what I've discussed with the prime minister and what we discussed with our Egyptian colleagues, we're determined to try to bridge the gaps. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have seen an uptick in the intensity of Hezbollah rocket fire and Hezbollah launches, including drones and other types of more advanced weaponry. And then we have seen an uptick in the Israeli responses, going after, as we just saw last night, a senior Hezbollah commander in the target of the assassination as well as several other Hezbollah militants that were killed. Now the question is, where does this go from here? It has been a constant fear that even a slight miscalculation could lead to the opening of another front in the war. And that's what everybody's worried about. You clearly heard it there from secretary of state Antony Blinken. And that's the concern once again, approximately 200 rockets launched from southern Lebanon into northern Israel at an area that has already seen tens of thousands of evacuations a week ago. We saw fires raging across northern Israel. And that's what we're seeing again, forcing some evacuations. Now, on one side, what happens in northern Israel between Israel and Hezbollah does not affect the ceasefire negotiations. And feel like Blinken made it quite clear there that a ceasefire will lead to and has led to back in November, the first pause in hostilities that we saw, at least a restoration of calm on the northern border there. And then the firing started again from Hezbollah once that cease-fire ended. That's what Blinken is trying to get at now. And the current fighting, the conflict along that border doesn't affect ceasefire negotiations. At the same time, if the fighting doesn't stop, there is the real risk that Israel will carry out the threat that it has put forward, not only from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu but from the defense minister and others as well, that, if Hezbollah doesn't stop firing, Israel will carry out a much wider campaign. And that could very well lead to the opening of a second front in this war and a very dangerous one, simply given the level of strength that Hezbollah has.",

You have more than 50,000 people being arbitrarily and indefinitely detained, with no access to lawyers, with no sense of due process. Many of the people who are being held may not even be ISIS fighters. They may have been victims of trafficking. They may have been people who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the longer this situation goes on for, Becky, you're also taking away the possibility of justice for people who were victims of ISIS' crimes. Because the longer it takes to try to put together the evidence to build the case, the harder it becomes to do that. Now we spent a lot of time on the ground. We talked with the head of the SDF, the Syrian Democratic Forces, General Mazloum Abdi. And we brought him some of these troubling stories that we had encountered or witnessed ourselves. Understandably, the SDF, Becky, feels a little bit defensive about this because their attitude is, we're doing everything we can. We fought and died trying to defeat ISIS. And we need more help and support in the management of these camps and prisons. We talked to him about how they need more funding. They need more training for the guards. They need, if countries are refusing to repatriate their citizens, to find other mechanisms to establish some kind of legal process. So they feel a little bit alone in all of this. And general Mazloum told us, currently 42,000 people living in that largest camp, Al-Hol. They need to reduce that number by 50 percent in order to make it sustainable and safe, he said, at the current rate of repatriation, that could take seven years. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GENERAL MAZLOUM KOBANI ABDI, SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES (through translator):  This is not something that can be solved quickly whether it's about ISIS families in the camps or imprisoned ISIS fighters. It will require more time. The level of aid we're getting is insufficient, which puts more responsibility on us. We need additional assistance to ensure prison safety. Our prison staff must receive thorough training and we must also address health issues in the prisons. And we need to continue to repatriate families from inside the camps.",

We have sensed reluctance from their side. We understand that some countries are willing to repatriate their citizens. Often, it's the U.S. that pressures these countries. But reluctance poses a real problem. Considering these individuals have been detained here for over seven years so far, only half of them have been repatriated. There must be a different policy. We tell them, either repatriate your citizens promptly or improve the conditions at the Al-Hol camp and the prisons so that the detainees do not pose threats. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The SDFhas been coming under frequent attacks from Turkiye, their Infrastructure specifically has been targeted. U.S. forces in the region have really been focused on increased hostilities from Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. And more broadly, you're also seeing ISIS starting to reconstitute, starting to gain strength again, starting to reestablish training camps, particularly in certain regime-held parts of Syria. And the broader message that Mazloum had was that this is a very important moment. This situation could get a lot worse if there's a convulsion of violence and instability.

You don't get much more potent symbolism than that. This is the largest convoy of Russian warships that has come here in many years. And certainly some of the most sophisticated weaponry that Vladimir Putin has deployed to Cuba in many, many years. We should point out Cuban officials say there are no nuclear warheads aboard these ships, that they are coming here for peaceful means. U.S. officials have said they do not pose a direct threat to the United States but they're keeping a very close eye of them. As you would expect, they were shadowed along the coast of Florida over the last several days, as they approached the port of Havana. We already saw one of the most sophisticated frigates in the Russian Navy enter this morning. Now this nuclear powered submarine coming in, sailors aboard the sub as it comes in. I've never seen this before. There are subs that have come here throughout the years. But they do it secretly and they do it quietly. They do not do it as high-profile as this. I can't imagine anything more high- profile. This is for the world to see, for the West to see. And again, while Cuban officials say that many ships come and visit Cuban waters and come make port of calls (sic), certainly to see a nuclear-powered submarine coming in is a sight to behold.

And you've got these two reports, one on the attack on Israel on October the 7th and then you've got a report on the Israeli military operations in Gaza. And they go into these different war crimes that are being committed. And it's very important to mention here, Becky, that the commission was not granted access to Israel. They say that Israel obstructed its investigation and they had to conduct remote interviews. They had to travel to Egypt and Turkiye to meet with witnesses and survivors and collect this testimony. They went through thousands, Becky, they say, of open source items using advanced forensic analysis to verify the content. They went through hundreds of submissions. I mean, this is months and months of work that went into this. And again, these findings damning especially here are for Israel, that, as you mentioned, has come out rejecting these accusations as well as accusing the U.N. body, as it has in the past, saying that it has an anti-Israel bias, accusing it of anti- Semitism.
