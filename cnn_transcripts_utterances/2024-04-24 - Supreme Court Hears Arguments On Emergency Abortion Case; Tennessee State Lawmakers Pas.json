Only moments ago, the justices pressed an attorney for the Idaho state's very controversial and near-total ban position now. That law prevents doctors from performing abortions for pregnant women having a non- life-threatening medical emergency like organ failure or infertility.Right now, the government is presenting its case. The crux of its argument, this law harms women and the nation's public health. Let's listen in right now the U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson are going back and forth. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL: Criminal prosecution. The doctors can't provide the care, because until they conclude -- can conclude that a prosecutor looking over their shoulder won't second guess that maybe it wasn't really necessary to prevent death.",

Even consistent with their subjective medical judgment because as a matter of -- matter of medical reality, for many of these conditions, it's not yet putting a woman at the brink of death or necessary to prevent her death. Yet, they know that the standard of care is to provide her with termination because she is just going to get worse and worse and worse if they wait it out.And the other important point about this, and I think it goes back to this dual stabilization idea is that tragically, in many of these cases, the pregnancy is lost. There's not going to be any way to save that fetus. Because a woman who has PPROM at 17 weeks, there is no medical way to sustain the pregnancy to give the fetus a chance. So, in that situation, what Idaho is doing is waiting for women to wait and deteriorate and suffer that lifelong health consequences with no possible upside for the fetus.

But the Biden administration has come in and filed a lawsuit and said, actually, under federal law, you shouldn't have to wait until a life is at risk.

Just in the first few months of this year while that ban was lifted, and Idaho's full ban could go into effect, six patients were transferred. That would annualize to 24 this year.

He's called her a weak leader, and expanding more to the protests that we've seen across the country on similar college campuses saying that it is maddening what we're seeing on these college campuses across the country, calling it disgusting and unacceptable.Now, as for those that are camping out, they say they are not going anywhere until their demands are met. And those demands, at least some of them, the main focal point that they have told me is that they want Columbia University to divest from corporations that support Israel here. And that is sort of the core of why this camping out began. And it started to line up when -- with when their university president was testifying on Capitol Hill last week about antisemitism on college campuses. Now, we have seen protests span from that. Some of them on campus as part of the encampment but also some outside of campus, essentially where I am right now at the gates of Columbia University. And we've seen a range of forms of protest. We've seen some that had been very peaceful, calling for solidarity with Gaza, some that have just tried to call for unity. Others, though much more violent and rhetoric, much more antisemitic and rhetoric, a good portion of which have come from those protests that have been outside campus. So, much so to the point that students have tried to distance themselves from those coming on the outside.
