We have new reporting, on the final phase of President Biden's preparations, as Trump-world is doubling down on a ridiculous accusation. 48 hours away from the historic debate, right here on CNN, House Speaker, Mike Johnson, will join me live. Plus, the polls have just closed, in the most expensive House primary ever. A member of the so-called Squad is fighting for his political life. And it's also judgment time, for Republican, Lauren Boebert, who remember, switched districts, when it looked like her congressional career was about to go up in smoke. And I have brand-new reporting, breaking here at 9, on Steve Bannon, and a notable change in the judge, for his upcoming fraud trial. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. The polls are in a dead heat, and the insults are flying, expectations are being gamed. And the accusations, about getting juiced up, on drugs, are frankly ridiculous and getting out of hand. That all means that one of the most highly-anticipated live events, in modern American history, is set to begin 48 hours from right now. The mission for both candidates in the CNN Presidential Debate is a contrast. And before you start yelling at your screen, yes, these two could not be any more different from one another. But what happens, on Thursday night, and both style and substance has the potential to alter the trajectory of this race. President Biden has spent days, locked in intense preparation, surrounded by his closest advisers at Camp David. And our sources are telling us, tonight, that full mock debates are underway at the podium, under the lights. He's even watching tape, to know exactly what he's going, to see when he steps up to that lectern. His team shot a video, during a walkthrough, of the CNN studio. And as I reported, while covering him at the White House, when Biden prepares, he does so incredibly, intensively. The former President on the other hand, who is not known for his attention to detail, is talking about how very hard it is to prepare, while at the same time insisting he doesn't need it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I think I've been preparing for it for my whole life if you want to know the truth. And I'm not sure you can lock yourself into a room for two weeks or one week or two days and really learn what you have to know. I think we'll do very well. We've -- we've done well in the past and I think we'll do very well. I know the subject matter. But I don't think, Corey, you could just lock yourself in a room like some people do and think you're going to come out OK. It doesn't seem to work that way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we passed that, without much help from the Republicans. But the Democrats unanimously supported a $1.2 trillion investment in the roads, the highways, the bridges, the ports, the airports, rural broadband. We did that. And look at the Inflation Reduction Act. Dramatic reductions in the cost of prescription drugs. I have constituents who were spending $500 or $600 a month on insulin as diabetics. That's capped at $35 a month, within the Medicare program, and a $2,000 a year out-of-pocket cap. The Democrats did that. The Republicans are trying to overturn that. They're campaigning against inflation reduction act right now. So, President Biden just needs to remind people that the Democrats are in the business of delivering the goods to the people.

I was surprised to hear that he said it publicly, about their first debate, where Biden was widely seen as beating him, pretty handily, just by standing there and smiling. I don't know what that translates to, once he gets to the debate stage. Donald Trump, as you said, does not prepare conventionally, the way we are used to presidents doing it. He tends to think that people can't inform him of things. His term in office was actually a bit ago. And so, they've been doing some policy refreshers. The question is going to be -- I mean, a couple of things. These two men really don't like each other, Biden and Trump. And so, to my mind, that creates a huge X factor, when they get on stage. Because, you just don't know. You can do all the preparations in the world, as candidates. And then, when you get into the arena, it can be very different. Number one. Number two. I don't -- you know, you saw Trump at a rally, the other night, saying, should I be nice? Or should I be very mean? And I suspect he will interrupt less.

And I don't think they would see it as a hands-off moment.Now, Trump is aware that his own attacks, on Hunter Biden, in that first debate in 2020, humanized President Biden. It basically gave President Biden, an opportunity, to say, my son is an addict, and he has a struggle that a lot of Americans have. And Trump came off looking incredibly mean, and belittling, to an issue that a lot of people struggle with. I don't know that we're there now. This is just a very different moment in time.",

He cares about the people we are talking to. We will be doing a table of labor workers, and he would want to know their birthday, how many kids they had, how many jobs they've had, were they originally from this town, were they not? Because that is what you want in your leader. You want them to be committed. You want them to be locked in. Whereas Trump is so careless, so frivolous, he thinks he can throw these jabs, he thinks he can be reckless, and that it'll make him look like this strong, tough man. But if he goes, if he thinks he takes that approach, and goes after Hunter Biden? I have to tell you, that is not -- that doesn't work in the polling. It didn't work in 2020. And it still won't work now. Whether you were an addict in 2020, you're still at a recovering addict in 2024. And families understand that, and families have compassion.

And I think he understands that there are a sliver of voters in the middle, who may be on the fence about President Biden, who voted for him, thought things were going to look differently, over the past four years. And have made up their minds: I don't know if I want to give him another four years. I am potentially interested in Trump. But can Trump showcase that he's a statesman? Can he showcase tone, the proper tone that is? And I would say, to the point of addiction. I don't think the former President is going to throw that out there, unless he feels personally attacked. But I think the American people should also remember. The former President lost a brother, who also suffered from alcoholism in the past.

In my walk here, I was saying to some of your staff, be very careful who you predict as the winner, because voters see it very differently. They're not trying to score points. They don't care if you trip up on something. And they're actually not focused precisely on every detail, to looking at the personality, to looking at the presentation. Do I trust them? Do I like them? Can I see them as president? Is this someone I want to have in my living room, every night, for the next four years?

They were scheduled to happen in the same courthouse, with the same judge. But tonight, that's changed. Merchan was not removed from the case. But has another case that conflicts with the scheduling of Bannon's trial, I'm told. Now, another judge has been assigned to take that case. Of course, all as he is on the verge of reporting to prison in another case. Joining me here tonight, CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, and former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig.

I will say, though, usually the judge, who's losing the case, does at least get consulted. Hey, are you OK with giving up this case?

Her primary experience, before this, was she worked at the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal services to indigent poor people. Here's a couple of things that people told me that have appeared in front of her. Quote, she's a very, very hard worker, always on trial, no slacking. Someone said she is, quote, a very, very left liberal. And I said, how do you think that plays? And this person said, well, on the one hand, defense lawyers usually like liberal judges. On the other hand, liberals don't love Steve Bannon. So, who knows? And then another person said, I found this really interesting, from a defense attorney's perspective, she's the best judge in the courthouse. Smart, friendly, polite, thoughtful, and does not automatically rule for the prosecutor, every time. So, generally positive reviews. It's interesting, there seems to be a consensus, she's very liberal. I don't know which way that's going to play here.",
