I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we begin this hour with just 100 days until the election and a presidential race that's been completely upended since President Biden exited the race just one week ago.In these past seven days, Vice President Kamala Harris has moved to quickly consolidate support from the Democratic Party, raised historic amounts of money, and she has effectively erased former President Donald Trump's lead in the polls. CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten is here to run the numbers for us. So let's look at some of this polling, Harry. There's some new polling out today. What's it showing you?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's quite a shift from where we were just a week ago. These are net favorability ratings. That's favorable minus unfavorable. Why don't you look where we were a week ago? Look at this. Both Harris and Trump, not particularly well- liked, certainly better like than former President Joe Biden. But look at this, a minus 11 net point favorability rating, a minus 11-point net favorability rating.But look at where we stand right now since Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Her net favorability is now actually in the positive territory at plus one point. And look at Donald Trump. His net favorability has actually dropped from minus 11 points to minus 16 points. So the last week has been one in which Kamala Harris has received a load of good press while Donald Trump, coming off of his Republican National Convention, perhaps not some necessarily good news for his vice-presidential choice, J.D. Vance. And what we've seen is clear movement on this particular metric towards Kamala Harris. I think the question ultimately will be, as we get more of that horse race polling, does it translate to the ballot test? But certainly, I think Democrats would argue that this is one of Kamala Harris's best polls so far, showing her much more popular than a week ago, while Trump has fallen back a little bit. DEAN: Yeah, and it is wild that that's just a week in between those numbers. We know that this race is going to be so focused on these battleground states. Show us the latest data that we're getting from there, how Trump and Harris are both faring in some of those battleground states.",

Look at Wisconsin, a point race well within the margin of error. No clear leader. Michigan, tied. Pennsylvania, tied. And of course, these were states that post the first debate, in fact, the only debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. We saw that Trump was picking up ground in these states and holding advantage over Joe Biden. Not the case against Kamala Harris.Why is that so important? Well, it's so important, Jessica, because if, if Kamala Harris can win up in these Great Lake battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, even if she were to lose in Nevada Arizona and Georgia, of course, those Sunbelt battleground states that Joe Biden won four years ago -- look at that -- she would get to exactly 270 electoral votes. She would win the election. So the fact that she's holding her own there definitely suggests that the Great Lake battleground states are a potential pathway for her to allow Democrats to hold on to the White House.",

Several dozen volunteers were here getting their information, getting their clipboards and their walking papers to go door to door.But quite literally, the signs on the office wall have changed. A week ago, this, of course, would have said Biden for president. Now it says Harris for president. But come on inside and take a look at -- this is just one storefront office. But if you look here on the wall, Days Until Victory 100, this will count down every single day. This is an organizing office, a local organizing office. Oakland County, Michigan, is where we are right now, just north of Detroit. This is Democratic leaning without question. About four years ago, Joe Biden carried this by more than a dozen points. So this is where Kamala Harris is looking to have a strong showing, of course, the rest of Michigan. Much of it is blue. So Gabby Giffords was here speaking just a short time ago. Other Democrats were rallying around this. And what this is was a volunteer stop for people to come and get their precinct papers to go door to door. And we've been talking to many of those volunteers. And they say there's excitement at the doors. There's energy. There are also some questions about the vice president's position on issues. So Jessica, we have never seen at the 100-day mark, of course, a new candidate in the race. So everything is reset anew. And you can see just all of these campaign offices. You know these well, being on the road all these years on campaigns as well. This is where the organizing happens. There's new energy and also perhaps some new anticipation.",

But she's been here and traveling across the country rallying voters. But we also know that several governors are on the list. You saw them on the Sunday shows. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, of course, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Those six, we believe, are in the top contenders. We know that Democratic lawyers are spending this weekend vetting these candidates. We also know that Vice President Harris will close out this with one-on-one interviews. We don't know if she already has someone in mind. But we do know that she is going to make her decision before August 7th. So this week marks the August 1st, is later this week. So the 7th is just around the corner. So the point is, she will have her running mate before that Chicago convention on August 19th. And then, of course, the race will be fully joined.

The expectation was that the vice president or someone else other than Joe Biden would always perform better in terms of their competitiveness. This has certainly caught some people off guard --$200 million in a week, 170,000 new volunteers. But what you have seen from the Trump campaign is sort of a realignment of their focus and their efforts.One PAC just announced a couple of days ago, a $100 million ad campaign between now and November to sort of reframe the conversation around Vice President Harris's positions on the economy, on crime, on immigrations, on foreign policy. And I think as you look at some of these battleground states as a strategist, I'm looking at one particular group here, Jessica, that I don't think we've covered a lot. That's men. And not just white men, but men across the board. Donald Trump from 2016 to 2020 improved his numbers with all men, particularly those without a college degree. And so I want to see how does the vice president perform? Does she perform as well as Biden in 2020? Or does Donald Trump maintain an 11-point lead as he did in 2016 with men over Hillary Clinton? That can make a key advantage and difference in some of those swing states.",

Because it's -- she's come out and wowed everyone and then they're going to have to sustain that. How do they do that?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, it's not going to be easy. I will say, though, Jessica, it's been night and day for Democrats. I mean, when I've been talking to Democratic organizers in battleground states, Latino organizers that organize Latino voters, black voters in states like Arizona and Wisconsin, and they say that it's totally different for them on the ground when they're talking to voters at their doors. That voters went from asking if President Biden was going to drop out, saying that they were reluctant to vote, to voters now being more energized and asking questions about Harris and young voters in those states, the organizers said, are starting to come back to get Democrats. And that's another key demographic that Kamala Harris is going to have to try to win back because President Biden was struggling with young voters and they were a key part of his 2020 win. I mean, it's not going to be easy for them to sustain this momentum, but there are a lot of Democrats now that tell me that, you know, they weren't necessarily going to be as involved in organizing, and now they are. They weren't necessarily going to be volunteering, and now they are. So they have a new army of folks, people that weren't necessarily even volunteering before.

What volunteers, what members of the Democratic Party and others may want to see in somebody that she chooses?BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, from what I've heard from sources in and outside of the campaign is that they're vetting about 10 to 12 potential contenders, those ones that Jeff mentioned, plus a few more. They haven't said that they've necessarily narrowed it down yet, but that -- that VP pick is going to come on or before August 7th because they have to be voted on as well during that virtual nominating process. And Democrats, a lot of the Democrats that I've talked to in Congress say that, you know, they've named Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania governor, have named Roy Cooper, North Carolina governor. And they've also named Andy Beshear, Kentucky governor. Those were the names I was hearing a lot of. But there are a number of others on the list. And Mark Kelly from Arizona seems like he could very well be a dark horse here because of the fact that he also has a relationship with the vice president. Roy Cooper goes back with her to her attorney general days. And so when she's thinking about this, it depends on if she wants a more person -- someone that she has a more personal relationship with, someone that could -- has credibility in a battleground state.

But in terms of effectiveness, would it be better to keep him there and pull someone like a Senator Mark Kelly? But then with Kelly, then you raise the question of what happens withthat Senate seat and can Republicans potentially grab that seat? So there are a lot of dynamics from my perspective as a strategist that I'm going to be looking at. But even as you have seen, Jessica, these numbers increase with Vice President Harris, it cannot be underscored the fact that Donald Trump is performing a heck of a lot better than he did in 2020. This race is incredibly close. When you look at where the race was at this point in 2020, it was not close. The poll numbers were pretty decisive that Joe Biden was going to win that election. We have no clue which direction this thing is going to go this this way around. And that's why I'm looking at, again, men voters. I'm looking at white suburban voters and I'm also looking at white blue-collar workers. I looked at President Obama's two races and I was trying to do a comparative analysis from Obama to Hillary Clinton to Biden just to sort of see what Vice President Harris being a woman, but also a woman of color, where could she potentially fall? She would need to, at a minimum, have some of the Obama era-esque coalition on at least maintaining Joe Biden's 2020 numbers. That is a heck of a lot to do going into November.

So, remains to be seen how quickly that will actually come together. But right now, this is a community that not only is anticipating the possibility of that Israeli response, waiting to see what will unfold from the events that have happened here, but it is also very much still a community in mourning.

So, with the lower temperatures, that means higher humidity. So that has helped a ton when it comes to the efforts of these firefighters and more resources. What you're seeing is more boots on the ground. About 4,000 firefighters are now here working this fire. And one of the things they can do is come to areas like this and assess the damage. So good news in terms of structures. They said now that it's 66. So that number has gone down after you've had firefighters here assessing the damage. The other thing that they're saying is that they're keeping the priority to be getting people safe and back into their homes. They say they're very sensitive when it comes to the people of this county because they have lived through the deadliest fire in California history. You know, a lot of the people in Paradise, California, at least anecdotally, taking evacuation warnings and orders very seriously this time around. People who have said, I will evacuate this time around. And so, officials really trying to get them back into their homes and trying to keep these flames away from home.
