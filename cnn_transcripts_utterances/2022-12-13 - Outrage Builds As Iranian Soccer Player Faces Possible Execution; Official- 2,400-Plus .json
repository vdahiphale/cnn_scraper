He is facing a sham trial And they are concerned he could be executed in a matter of days.We've already seen two protesters who were executed, death by hanging, just in the last few days, So people are ringing the alarm here. And I have a statement for you from the global soccer union that just expresses that concern. \"Fifth Pro is shocked and sickened by reports that professional footballer, Amir Nasr-Azadani, faces execution in Iran after campaigning for women's rights and basic freedoms in his country. We stand in solidarity with Amir and call for the immediate removal of his punishment.\" Activists, rights groups, Ana, say this is the Iran government's latest tool of repression, the threat of execution. And the fear is that he's not the only one. There are many more victims potentially coming -- Ana",

Many on social media were discussing as to how many of those players were able to speak out about another fellow soccer player, now that they've been silenced, activists say, by the government. So, no, it wasn't a part of that. It's a part of the continuation of this crackdown that really reaches all parts of society.

Grant Wahl died Friday while covering the Netherlands-Argentina game in Qatar. It sparked some unfounded speculation that it was connected to his reporting on Qatar's human rights abuses. Those looking at this suspiciously included his brother, Eric Wahl. But now, Eric apologized for that on Twitter, adding the family will release a statement on the cause of death very soon. Grant Wahl's manager confirmed to CNN that his body was returned to the U.S. on Monday and an autopsy should be completed soon. The State Department has also said it, quote, \"Has seen no indication of foul play or anything nefarious regarding Wahl's death.\" At the U.S. southern border, officials in El Paso, Texas, are sounding the alarm after a, quote, \"major surge\" in illegal crossings this past weekend. Border officials report more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the day each day, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and shelters are beyond bursting at the seams. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That has allowed authorities to expel migrants back to Mexico since March of 2020.And with its anticipated end, they have seen many migrants come up to the northern border. Some of them, who were already there, and start to trickle into the United States and turn themselves in, Ana. They are often seeking asylum, which is why you see images of them lining up along the U.S./Mexico border wall. These are scenes that the administration has been concerned about. I have been talking to officials for weeks who are trying to prepare and shore up resources along the U.S. southern border to basically try to process as many people as they can, especially after Title 42, under immigration law. Now, the administration is also asking Congress for more than $3 billion in funding. Now, a source tells me that's part of broader funding discussions. And it's not specifically tied to the end of Title 42. But it really comes at a critical time as the administration tries to prepare for migrants arriving and crossing the U.S./Mexico border. Again, with El Paso, some key numbers to show you how strained resources are. Last October to this October, there has been a 280 percent increase in crossings. That's just one section of the border that right now is seeing hundreds of people on a daily basis. That really speaks to the challenge across the border, which is people crossing at a higher clip and creating a strain for the officials who are there.",

So in theory, it should fix that impersonation issue. We'll see how good that verification is and also how long it takes to be verified now. This is the big issue.

It's an undersea volcano in the Pacific. When it erupted last January, water vapor shot 93 miles above the earth. Scientists say, beyond several tsunamis, it created a sonic boom. Hunga Tonga is also a pretty epic name, don't you think, for this epic corruption. To South Korea now where a mega star is now in boot camp.

BTS, which has been hailed as the world's biggest boy band, says they plan to reconvene as a group in 2025, after they all complete their service. Back in the U.S., we're just moments away from history being made at the White House. President Biden will sign a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that protects same-sex marriage should the Supreme Court ever reverse its 2015 ruling on the issue. And it is fitting. A decade ago, as vice president, Biden came out in support of marriage equality. It was controversial at that time. He did it even before his boss at the time, President Obama.
