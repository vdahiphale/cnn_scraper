Though, as you noted, it is an uphill battle for it to even get through Congress, and the reason being that it is including codifying some of those Trump- era policies that the Biden administration has had issues with to begin with.But, look, what's clear here is that this is an issue for the White House, one they are going to have to navigate now and in the coming days, and an administration tells me that the White House officials and Department Homeland Security officials have been ramping up their calls to lawmakers, stakeholders and cities in anticipation of this COVID era border restriction lifting, because they know that all of these cities are going to have to deal with an influx of migrants arriving. Now, the numbers are already creeping up. We saw this week that encounters along the border reached over 8,000. There's more than 25,000 migrants in custody, as you saw those pictures from David Culver, people are desperate and they are crossing now as they are expected to cross in the coming days. But this is not just about straining federal resources, it's also about the cities. And we are seeing the Biden administration ramping up their efforts on the ground there in El Paso too, where, today, they are starting an enforcement operation to take into custody those migrants who have not been processed by officials and have been sleeping on the streets. So, the White House really navigating political and logistical challenges here.",

But then on the Republican side, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is still pushing for his plan, which passed the House, which would increase the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion, but comes with spending cuts attached to it. He also has the support of the majority of Republicans over in the Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Now, the White House and the president have said that they are willing to have discussions on two separate tracks, increasing the debt ceiling without any conditions, but then also starting a separate negotiations and discussions process when it comes to spending cuts. But one of the president's top economic advisers here at the White House yesterday told CNN that they only see one way out of this impasse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Looking at this Russian social media website that the suspect had an account on is replete with this vile post about Nazis, his obsession with weapons, his obsession with past mass shooters. The suspect actually describes himself as an incel, which is described a man who is angry at women in society for his lack of romantic success. This is so chilling. John. We're also seeing in these posts, it appears the suspect engaged in pre-attack reconnaissance. We'll show you some of those posts. It appears he was researching online what the busiest times of day were at this mall before he went and conducted that attack. Finally, I'm getting new information about the weapons that were used here. A law enforcement source tells me that multiple weapons were recovered by law enforcement belonging to the shooter. All of them were purchased legally, most of them from private sellers. The reason that is so important is we continue to hear from gun safety advocates ridiculing this so-called private seller loophole. Because in the state of Texas John, and in several other states, if you buy a gun via a private seller, you don't have to go through a federal background check. John?",

And sometimes when someone is failing out, they keep them through the end of basic training and then discharge them. So, that's from June 26th to October 7th. That is the entirety of his military career in 2008.But that's a group dynamic. I mean, basic training is all about -- is learning your skills and working within the team. Security guard work is much more you're on your own. It's an industry that has a tremendous demand for people. If you're not convicted of a felony and you can pass the background check, you're probably going to get that job. Getting to that second level with firearms training and proficiency is interesting. Although having pored through his writings and talked to Paul Murphy, who did our research yesterday, he laments quite often that he is a terrible shot, he's not very good at it, but yet he's a gun enthusiast, a gun collector, gun-obsessed.",

But it became his outlet.And you can tell something is going on. Because in early April, you start to see the pictures of the mall, but he also does what's almost a data dump. He starts to post pages and pages and pages of handwritten journals by PDFing them and putting them up on the site. And reading through them, they don't mean much to you and me, but you can tell what he's doing is, here's my story, here's my legacy. And he writes things like, they've been laughing at me for as long as I can remember, but they're not going to be laughing anymore. We know how this is going to end. So, this is building inside him, the Nazi ideology, the swastika tattoo on the chest, the Nazi ideology, the S.S. lightning bolt tattoos on the arm. He's drifting further and further from the incel piece to the Nazi piece, to the anti-immigrant piece into these rejectionist theories. And when you look at the victimology, you have the Mendoza family, you have a family from South Korea. You have an Indian young woman of Indian origin who's an engineer.
