That's what some Republicans in the House are now saying about their own party's push to impeach President Biden. Skepticism is growing within the ranks as their months long investigation into President Biden seems to be, at least for now, heading down a road to nowhere.CNN's Melanie Zanona joins us live from Capitol Hill with this new reporting. Melanie, you and the rest of our fantastic Hill team, you've interviewed over a dozen Republican lawmakers and aides. What did they tell you?",

      "sentences": "Well, there are serious doubts growing inside the GOP that their months long investigation into Biden is going to culminate in impeachment. My colleague Annie Greer and I interviewed over a dozen Republicans for the story, including some who are close to the investigation.And what we found is that many Republicans believe, at this point, they have just not seen the evidence to prove that Biden profited off of his son's foreign business deals. There's also some reluctance to impeach Biden as we get closer to the November election. Their attention has really more shifted to focus on the southern border and impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And, of course, there's also the perennial problem, it seems, of their razor-thin majority. Just listen to what some of these Republicans told us. Mike Kelly said, \"I have seen nothing.\" Dan Newhouse, \"Nobody is talking about that.\" David Valadao, \"I spend zero time on this.\" And Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis said, \"Let the American people decide in November if they want to take this country in a different direction. I think that's probably most likely considering the politics of the Senate.\" Now, these dynamics could change. There are a high pair -- a high stakes pair of depositions later this month with Hunter and James Biden. That's the president's son and the president's brother. And so committee chairmen say it's just really too early to determine the outcome. They are still committed to pressing ahead and are going to try to really formulate a better communication strategy to the rest of the conference. But as of right now, Dana, Republicans telling us the votes just aren't there yet.",
