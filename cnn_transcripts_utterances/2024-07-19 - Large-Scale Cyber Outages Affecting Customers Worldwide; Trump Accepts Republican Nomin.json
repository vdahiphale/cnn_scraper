It is Friday, July the 19th.It's 9 a.m. in London, where we are currently following breaking news affecting a growing list of airlines all around the world. This is still very much a developing story. And according to the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, all Delta, United, Allegiant and American Airlines flights are grounded due to communications issues, as they put it. It's unclear how long the ground stop will last, but the FAA suggests there will be an update by 5 a.m. Eastern Time, which, of course, we are going to bring to you when it comes in. And all this comes after significant Microsoft outage brought Frontier Airlines and some competitors to a standstill for hours on Thursday. That ground stop has since been lifted. However, all of this is a global issue. It's not just in the United States. Cyber outages are affecting Australia, New Zealand and China as well. Australian Airlines, Virgin Australia and Qantas Airways have been impacted by massive tech disruptions. And I want to go straight to our own Marc Stewart, who's live for us in Beijing. Marc, what effects is all this happening in your part of the world?",

      "sentences": "Fred, this is significant and it's going to continue to be significant in the hours ahead. It is just after four in the afternoon here in China, well into the business day across Asia. So this is definitely having an impact on people's lives.As you mentioned, airlines and air travel is being impacted severely. Let me go through some of what we have been able to discover over the last few hours. As you mentioned, Virgin Australia and Qantas Airlines are having some issues. You can also add Turkish Airlines to the list. We are also hearing from airports across the region that some of the kiosks that people use, the automated check-in services at Hong Kong, for example, are having some issues. The list keeps growing. That's what we know thus far. But this is really having an impact on people's everyday lives. For example, some grocery stores in Australia are having operational issues. It's also impacting finance and banking. The Malaysian Stock Exchange is having issues. There are also bank issues in New Zealand. Now, all of this really caught our attention at around 2 o'clock in the afternoon when there were reports, especially on Chinese social media, of people encountering what's called a blue screen. That's kind of the warning picture that Microsoft posted when people tried to access some of the different tools that they use. This may perhaps be an issue with the cloud, but we're still waiting for some clarity from Microsoft. In addition, we have heard from some government officials across Asia. At this point, there are no indications that this was any kind of cyber attack, but this is still very early on into this investigation. But, Fred, as you rightly mentioned, the impact to airlines is going to be tremendous. You know, a lot of airlines, such as the Asian carriers like Qantas and Virgin Australia, they're going to be flying their planes, or they had hoped to fly their planes, across the Pacific to pick up passengers in the States to make this return trip. Well, now all of that is significantly off schedule in many cases. So, what is a problem here in Asia is obviously going to be a problem likely in Europe and, of course, North America. Fred, we are literally compiling a list of problems. As soon as we get more to share, we'll certainly pass that along to you.",

And Leslie, I was I was listening to speech, first of all, extremely long speech. And Donald Trump seemed to start out almost emotional when he spoke about the assassination attempt, but then went back into classic Trump ranting at his political opponents and basically saying he's going to do everything better, right.LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: Yes, exactly. People were really watching the speech to see whether he would stick to that unity agenda. There were there were reasons certainly to believe after the assassination attempt that he might. And what we really instead saw after that first sort of 15 or 20 minutes in an extremely long speech was, as you said, painting two pictures, one of a very dark America in a very difficult state on the brink of World War III, facing an invasion from across the world, an invasion of its southern border with record inflation. And again, so many of these claims are false when it comes to, you know, real data. But using that depiction to then portray in America a restoration of the American dream that he would like to deliver, claims he can deliver and really write back to a very divisive speech, doubling down on that allegation of, you know, implicitly of a stolen election. And the old Donald Trump for many, but really an undisciplined Donald Trump. Many people in the audience looked bored. Some left. It's hard to imagine people sitting through this kind of speech. And he was, you know, as we know, speaking to his most loyal of audiences. And at a time when the world is on tenterhooks waiting to see what America is going to do in November, I'm very worried. And there was nothing reassuring for America's partners and allies in the speech that the president made it clear that he feels that America's allies are taking advantage of it. And that he would have a very different foreign policy. And the single most important fact that really emerged from this convention was the announcement of J.D. -- Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio as the vice presidential candidate, who really does make it very clear that the president has no intention of moving beyond that MAGA agenda. Instead, he is planning to double down on it if reelected.",

Stay with us as we follow the updates on this developing story. Meanwhile, the espionage trial of \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich has resumed in Russia. The closed-door hearing was moved up by more than a month, and it's going at an unusually fast pace, with lawyers expected to give closing arguments today. Moscow accuses Gershkovich of working for the CIA to gather information about a Russian tank company. Gershkovich, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and the U.S. government all vehemently deny those allegations. Let's bring in Salma Abdelaziz. You've been following this trial and the story for us.

State media reports they discussed the, quote, importance and necessity of military cooperation between the two countries. Kim also expressed his firm solidarity for Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting comes one month after the signing of a landmark defense pact that permits all available means to assist each other if either nation is attacked. Now that he's accepted the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump is expected to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And that is according to two sources familiar with the plans who say the phone call is scheduled for later today. Meanwhile, Mr. Zelenskyy is in London, where he met Prime Minister Keir Starmer a little over half an hour ago. You can see some pictures of them shaking hands there. Zelenskyy will be the first foreign leader to address a British cabinet meeting since 1997. Turning now to Bangladesh, where dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds more injured amid widespread unrest. Police in the capital say protesters carried out, quote, destructive activities on several government and telecommunications offices Thursday. The country imposed a nationwide blackout in response, leaving more than 170 million people without Internet.
