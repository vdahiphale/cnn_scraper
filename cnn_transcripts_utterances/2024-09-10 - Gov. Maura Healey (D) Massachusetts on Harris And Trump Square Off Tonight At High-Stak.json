      "sentences": "Well, John, we better hear about the economy tonight. It's the number one issue on the minds of the voters. And one of the big questions here is what do these two candidate's proposals mean for inflation? Are they going to build on the recent progress or perhaps unwind some of it?Let's start with former President Trump. His agenda includes energy dominance. He wants to drill for a lot more oil. Now, obviously that's the exact opposite of what climate scientists say we need and there's some debate over how much more oil we could be drilling. But directionally, still, all else equal, more supply would, of course, help with prices. We've talked a lot John, you and I, about tariffs. Trump is calling for massive tariffs. That is really alarming economists because it could actually raise prices on all of us consumers. What hasn't got enough attention though is the impact of his immigration crackdown. He wants to deport 10 to 15 -- actually, perhaps up to 20 million immigrants. There's a lot of debate over how many undocumented people there are here and how any of this would withstand legal challenges. But still, there is some research that warns if he's able to do mass deportations it would make inflation go up and it would cause GDP to go down. That is all very concerning here because obviously businesses -- they need more workers, not fewer. Now, let's take a look at the Harris agenda. Vice President Harris has tried to show that she is very concerned about the affordability crisis. She has called for investing in affordable child care. She also wants a $6,000 tax credit for newborns. Now, that's something that would be politically popular although you've got to remember that would actually stimulate demand. So that's something that could actually be inflationary. On the supply side of things Harris has called for three million new housing units. That would be designed to address this massive housing shortage. But Harris is also calling for $25,000 downpayment assistance. That is something that has concerned some of the economists that I've talked to. Justin Wolfers told me that the problem right now is too many people chasing too few houses. The solution is not to give people more money to buy houses. So the key here would be, of course, John, that the supply of houses comes before the demand stimulus.",

And actually, I was talking to my mother the other day and she said I don't know much about Kamala Harris but I'm going to vote for her just because I don't like Donald Trump, right? So that's the kind of voter that Harris needs to appeal to in the sense that people don't know much about her despite the fact that she's been an elected official for many years. So, for her, this is an introduction to America in a way that it's not for Trump, and so the stakes are a little higher for her.",

Look, the strongest economy, strongest job creation, strongest stock market. On the economy alone she's got a good story to tell. She can talk about how she can improve it more, but the reality is if that's the way Jason Miller wants to portray her, she should own that and lean into it. In terms of the way she's been portraying Trump -- look, you know, they are taking a different tact. They're not saying that he's a threat, he's the anti-Christ, but they're basically saying he's old, he's tired, he's old news. Same old, same old. Let's move on from him because we know Donald Trump and we're kind of tired of Donald Trump. It's an interesting tactic and I think it's one that's designed to annoy him. Because, of course, all Donald Trump wants to be is the center of attention. And if you're relegating him kind of to the dustbin of history, nothing drives him more crazy. I mean, he had a press conference where he talked about what a celebrity he is and has been for so many years. That's what's important to him. They're trying to get to him by using kind of this old, tired playbook with him to make him seem not as viable and not as important as he wants to be.",

But I do think it would probably be a wasted opportunity for Kamala Harris to sort of try to bait President Trump.She still has to fill in her record in the eyes of the voters. She was the co-pilot to this inflation express that the -- that the American people have felt. She has to address that -- and she doesn't have a good answer. Her only answer is let's give the people more money. Let's give them -- let's cancel student debt. Let's give them more -- you know, these tax credits. And, sort of, let's add more inflationary to the -- to the pot. And I think that's going to be her challenge. And so her threat necessarily isn't trying to bait President Trump. Her threat is her Joe Biden record. And she was a co-pilot to his administration, so whether it's immigration, inflation, or these wars abroad, she was there. Afghanistan -- she was the last one in the room when President Biden made the disastrous exit in Afghanistan. She owns a lot of bad things. And when you try to talk about the economy, the problem that Harris has about talking the economy and talking about record job growth is nobody believes it. You know, turning on the switch during COVID and letting people go back to their original jobs is not job growth. And the fact that they're still trying to sell that just shows how disingenuous they are to the American people.",

As you can imagine, everyone's coming out with their advice this morning for both candidates. But for Kamala Harris, columnist Thomas Friedman, who was one of the first people to call on President Biden to leave the race, says that this is what Harris should say. She should say, \"Joe and I got a lot of things right, but we got something wrong, too -- and here is what I have learned. For my money,\" Friedman says, \"uttering those 23 words, or something like them, is the key for Kamala Harris to win Tuesday's debate against Donald Trump -- and the election.\" Separate herself from Biden. What do you think about that? GOV. MAURA HEALEY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS, HARRIS CAMPAIGN SURROGATE:  Well look, I think Kamala Harris knows exactly what she needs to do tonight, and that's to spell out the very different vision that she and Donald Trump have for this country. Kamala Harris, as people will see tonight, is for you. She's for the American people. Donald Trump is only for himself. I also think on policy -- you know, she's really going to get into it because first of all, Donald Trump hasn't said much about policy. There are two things we know about Donald Trump. He wants to make permanent the tax cuts for the ultrawealthy, and he wants to ban abortion in all the states. Kamala Harris, in contrast, wants to cut taxes for the middle class. She wants to make things more affordable -- things that Americans are really focused on like housing costs, like child care costs, right? And the differences are going to become really, really clear, including her really strong defense of reproductive justice and women's access to abortion, something that Americans -- Democrat and Republican, by the way -- all across this country are behind.",

      "sentences": "Well look, here's what's important. And you're right, I was a prosecutor and an attorney general. I actually served alongside Kamala Harris.What's important when you're a lawyer in the courtroom is your client. And for Kamala Harris, her client is the American people. She is going to be the only one on the stage tonight who is talking to directly to the American people -- talking to you, right? Speaking to real concerns about the high cost of housing and inflation right now, and protection of the middle class and growth of the middle class. Continued job growth, for example. Donald Trump, we know, is just going to ramble on and say a number of incoherent things. Maybe say some really crazy and outlandish things, dangerous things. But Kamala Harris, I think using her courtroom skills, will stay focused on the case. And the case is making the case to the American people about why she is going to be and should be the next commander in chief and President of the United States. I have every confidence in her ability to do that tonight regardless of the format. I know there's also been a lot of talk about format and obviously, I think Donald Trump was looking for any number of reasons to duck this debate and the deal with the microphones and whether or not they should be muted. His campaign wanted the microphones muted, of course. And so, Kamala Harris wanted everybody to be able to hear everything, of course, as I think the American people are entitled to hear. But she's going to play with whatever format she's given. Because for her, her focus is on us. It's on the American people and speaking directly to them. That's what we're going to see tonight. A clear contrast in this race.",

The New York Times has a story -- I'm sorry I'm giving you so many quotes this morning but there was a lot in the papers.Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Swan, and others write about some of the things that Donald Trump has been speaking about lately. And they write, \"He's been laying the groundwork to claim that there was large-scale voter fraud if he loses, a family tactic from his 2016 and 2020 playbooks, but this time coupled with threats of prosecution. Those who may face criminal scrutiny for purported efforts at election fraud, Mr. Trump has declared, will include election workers, a tech giant, political operatives, lawyers and donors working for his opponent.\" Laying the predicate to basically argue the election, if he loses, is not valid. How dangerous do you think that is? HEALEY:  Yeah. Oh, very dangerous. And I served as attorney general during the Trump presidency, so I know firsthand about this and how dangerous he is to our democracy. And, you know, John, speaking to the Independents -- to the swing voters out there this morning, speaking to those who maybe haven't made up their minds, I'm with Dick Cheney, OK? When Dick Cheney says he is going to vote for Kamala Harris, he's doing that because he knows what a threat Donald Trump is to our democracy. So everything that Donald Trump has promised, make no mistake about it, he would do. He will weaponize the Department of Justice. He will attack and undermine those who stood against him. He doesn't play by the rules whatsoever. And that's why you see people, including many prominent Republicans, coming out and joining with folks like me and saying Kamala Harris needs to be -- must be our next President of the United States. Donald Trump can't be anywhere near the Oval Office.",

There's no obstetric providers.And these counties are home to more than two million women of reproductive age, and many of them are concentrated in rural areas in the south, as you see on your screen here. Women living in maternity care deserts -- they're less likely to receive prenatal care and they experience higher rates of preterm birth, Kate.
