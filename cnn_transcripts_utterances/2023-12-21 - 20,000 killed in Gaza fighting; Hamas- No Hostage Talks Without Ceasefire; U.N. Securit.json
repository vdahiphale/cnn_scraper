Also, Israel wants to broker yet another deal to release its hostages from Gaza, but Hamas says no negotiations will go ahead without a \"full cessation\" of aggression. And the U.S. Supreme Court could decide the fate of Donald Trump and the 2024 election, but the former president is asking it to stay out of the dispute over whether or not he is immune from prosecution. All right. I want to start with a look at the human toll of the war in the Middle East, and let me tell you, it is chilling. The Palestinian Health Ministry says that around 20,000 people, 20,000 people have been killed in Israel's two-and-a-half-month war on Hamas, most of them women and children. Worth pointing out that CNN cannot yet independently verify those numbers. In the meantime, though, a poll finds that 72 percent of more than 1,200 people interviewed in Gaza during last month's truce and also in the West Bank as well, so that they actually thought that Hamas' decision to launch the October 7th attack on Israel was the correct decision. The poll was taken by a Palestinian research group. However, the head of the group said, \"No one should see this as support for any of the atrocities that might have been committed by Hamas on that day. Meantime, Hamas now says it will not discuss exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners while the war is going on. Let's bring in Jeremy Diamond, who's standing by for us in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what is the latest in terms of what's happening with negotiations?",

So, once again, see the release of dozens of hostages, a week-long pause in the fighting and the entry of desperately needed aid into the Gaza Strip. But it appears that, at least for now, that hope has been dashed. Hamas this morning putting out a statement saying that they will not engage in negotiations over the release of hostages and the release of Palestinian prisoners unless Israel first agrees to a pause in the fighting to give space to those negotiations. That is antithetical to the position of Israel, which has vowed to press on with its military campaign in Gaza up until there is some kind of a deal to allow for a humanitarian pause in the fighting. And this comes despite the fact that in recent days, Israel has put a new proposal on the table for the release of hostages and a pause in the fighting. There have been a lot of activity, including the CIA director, the director of the Mossad, and Qatar's prime minister meeting in Warsaw just a couple of days ago. Yesterday, also, Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' -- the head of Hamas, traveled to Cairo to meet with Egyptian officials who have been key mediators, but it appears that, at least for now, there is no actual movement towards real negotiations beyond the proposals that have been put forward amid Hamas' rejection of those.",

I want to talk about what's happening in Gaza right now, because as this war stretches on, it's going on past the two and a half month -- the month mark rather, the daily struggle for survival is getting more and more difficult for civilians. The World Food Programme says that half of the enclave's population, that's really 1 million people, is now starving. Millions finding enough food to get through today -- the day is simply an impossible task. We know that aid is coming in very slowly, but there is not enough for desperate families. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For weeks, this is what we've seen of the war in Gaza. Israel's brutal military might pounding neighborhoods into dust. In central Gaza and Sderot, whole blocks reduced to rubble, seemingly deserted, unlivable. But there's also this, the near surreal scenes this week in Sderot. The hustle and bustle of the street market. It's the story of every war, where life doesn't stop, it goes on for those trying to survive. But Gaza is like no other place. It's where more than 2 million are crammed into this tiny strip of land that now looks like it's been bombed back into ages past, where those who've lost everything have nowhere left but the streets. That's where Mutnas (ph) is building a clay oven, hoping people would pay him a shekel or two to use it, he says. Maybe then he'll have enough to buy his children cheese or tomatoes. Our lives are a million years behind. We live in sewage, Mutnas (ph) says. Every time it rains, the sewage overflows. It's cold, there's no food, no water, no warm clothes. Most here have escaped the bombs only to be trapped in this misery. Diseases and starvation, the U.N.'s warned, may soon kill more than those bombs. Half the population it says are now starving. People going entire days without eating. Om Ahmed (ph) says she collects a bit of flour from here and there to bake bread for her children. We're all thrown into the streets, she says. They said go to the south. We came to the south to die slowly. Human Rights Watch says Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. It's a war crime Israel denies and calls it a lie. It accuses Hamas of stealing aid. In the wake of October 7th, Israel's defense minister announced a siege of Gaza, \"No electricity, no fuel, everything closed until all hostages were returned.\" Some aid and water delivery resumed, but nowhere near enough. Much of the blockade remains in place, what rights groups call collective punishment. Sometimes the lucky ones find more than lentils and bread for the hungry mouths they have to feed. This mother uses a pair of jeans for her fire to boil some chicken wings and bones. I'm using clothes and cardboard to make fire and cook, she says. The situation is disastrous, but I need to find a way for my children. We're in the street because we have nowhere to shelter. Fleeing the bombs scrounging for food, now the people of Gaza desperately wait for the moment they can try once again to live. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, the -- you're speaking about hunger of catastrophic levels in Gaza. We're waiting right now, as we speak, for an imminent report on the food security situation in Gaza, and that was done during the seven days pause. So, it's not even reflecting the horrible and horrific situation of the last few days. The this is -- it's coming at the time in which, you know, our senior leaders have just been in Gaza, they've described to us a situation in which fear was in the air everywhere. You see it in people's eyes. People have lost faith that the aid -- any aid will reach them. And it's a very difficult environment. You cannot deliver assistance under a sky full of air strikes. The humanitarian operation is on the brink of collapse. It's impossible to get food in the condition or any -- not just food, any supplies in these conditions to meet some of the basic needs. And because of the lack of confidence of people that aid is coming their way, we're experiencing also a breakdown in law and order. So, the situation in general is a very difficult one. People are being forced into just one of five -- of the five governorates of Gaza, so it's extremely overcrowded. Shortage of water, a widespread of disease, the operating space and the areas where we can deliver is shrinking by the minute. So, we are looking at situation in which, you know, there is always going to be a risk of famine in Gaza if we don't and are unable to deliver quickly and open all supply routes, and we did have a breakthrough yesterday with the first convoy crossing through Kerem Shalom, coming from Jordan and getting into Gaza. So, there is a ray of hope. We hope it continues, and we hope the situation allows us to avert this humanitarian crisis.",

In many ways, they're feeling forced to respond to this, something that they really don't want to be doing. They're crisscrossing the early voting states, trying to distinguish themselves from the former president. But at the same time, they're having to weigh in on an issue that they recognize they need to defend him on because so many people in the Republican Party view what the courts are doing to Donald Trump really as political persecution.",

Nearly three days after a volcano erupted in Iceland, officials in the town of Grindavik are still assessing possible dangers.Roads are closed to everyone except emergency services. Police are asking people approach, not to go near the eruption are and, of course, to be cautious and to be aware of the gas, the sort of toxic fumes being emitted from this. The government says it's supporting around 4,000 people who had to evacuate in November, helping them find housing and buying apartments for those who are in the most dire of needs. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has been on the ground the past few days, seeing the impact of this eruption from both the land air. Fred, just walk us through what you've seen. I mean, these images are incredible.",

      "sentences": "Yes. It certainly was incredible. We took a nighttime flight actually with theIcelandic coast guard over this quake zone. It was a survey flight that they did and actually also practice evacuating people from that quake zone in -- or from that eruption zone if that would be necessary. There are, of course, still first responders working in there. One of the things, Zain, that we did see is that the activity of this volcanic eruption does seem to have subsided a great deal. There's no more active events that we saw, but we still definitely saw a lot of magma beneath us. And what was really remarkable is that were actually able to smell those gases that we've been talking about, that the authorities are so concerned about and actually feel the heat from that magma as well, that's how low we were flying underneath there. Now, the authorities are saying, despite the fact that the activity has decreased considerably people in the town of Grindavik, which is about -- I think, say about four or five miles behind where I am right now, I'm actually just coming from there right now, they are able to go back into that town for a couple of hours, but they're not able to go back to their homes, and they're not able to stay there because the magma tunnel that led to that massive eruption that we saw almost three days ago, that is also under the town of Grindavik, And it has caused some massive cracks in the ground in Grindavik as well. So, certainly, the danger has not passed. There was a seismologist that I was talking to earlier today, and she told me that they expect that in this part of Iceland, there is going to be increased volcanic activity for the coming years and they certainly say that the danger for Grindavik has not passed. But for now, they say that this eruption seems to be dying down. They say it was a very furious one in the initial stages. We saw those massive fountains of magma being spewed into the air, sometimes hundreds of feet into the air, but they do say it's also dying down fairly quickly. But, again, the danger for the residents here and certainly for the town of Grindavik is not over yet, and they do fear that there could be further eruptions in the not-too-distant future, Zain.",

Not clear how toxic they were, but you don't want to be exposed to that for an extended period of time. There was the fear in the sort of early stages of that eruption that, for instance, Reykjavik could be influenced by those toxic fumes or could get some of those toxic fumes as well. So far, it doesn't appear that that happened. One of the things that we heard from the meteorological office here in Iceland late yesterday and early today is they say that the wind is shifting in a way that is actually good for Reykjavik and good for the main airport in Keflavik as well so that any sort of toxic fumes and ash or anything else seems to be blown out to sea at the moment. So, that, right now, is some good news certainly for the residents of the Icelandic capital, which once again is very close to this eruption zone. And they say, right now, the main concern that they have is there could be new eruptions because they do still see the magma bubbling in that magma tunnel, and certainly, this town of Grindavik definitely still right in the crosshairs, if you will, of that magma tunnel as well, Zain.",

They say that the shooter has been eliminated. The incident took place in the university's philosophy building. So far, there's no word yet on who the shooter was, the identity of the shooter, or even a possible motive here. We are awaiting update from Czech police. CNN are watching this story throughout the day. We'll bringing you much more information as and when we get it. Once again, a mass shooting at Charles University in Central Prague, happening about an hour or so ago. We know that many people have been killed. We don't exactly know how many? We also know that many people were injured as well. All right. We have developing news about the high-speed train service. Eurostar departures on the undersea rail link between England and France are canceled right now because of an unscheduled strike. Eurostar's own staff not striking, but workers at the Eurotunnel are, that's the tunnel used by Eurostar train. Staff there have walked out in protest at the size of that yearend bonuses. I want to talk about us now. Sources tell us that CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery, may be looking at a merger with Paramount Global, whose holdings include CBS. They say the CEO of the two companies met this week and talked about possibly joining forces. Here's how the two company shares are trading today. See, neither company worth noting is commenting. If a merger does happen, it could have huge implications across the media landscape. Let's bring in Anna Stewart to break this down for us. So, Anna, just talk us through what both sides have to gain, why these two mega legacy companies are flirting with the possibility of a merger.",

Ofcourse, we're actually seeing quite an antitrust area with the Biden administration at the moment, but also debt because I think the key issue here is both of these companies have huge amounts of debt. $45 billion dollars for Warner Brothers Discovery. Over $16 billion for Paramount Global, and they're much smaller as a company combined. That's a lot of debt to take on. Also, tax law. Of course, Warner Brothers Discovery had its own big merger last year. As a result of that, it couldn't actually make an acquisition until April of next year. So, a few little issues to look through there.",
