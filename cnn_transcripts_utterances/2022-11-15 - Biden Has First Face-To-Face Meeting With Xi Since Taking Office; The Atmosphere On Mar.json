But amid the shiftingpolitical relations at the height of the Cold War, that changed in the 1970s. The PRC replaced the ROC at the U.N. and the United States changed diplomatic relations. It moved its embassy from Taipei to here in Beijing. While the U.S. has adopted a so-called one China policy, it has never recognized the communist party sovereign claim over Taiwan. Washington continues to sell weapons to Taipei, but it has remained deliberately unclear about whether it would come to Taiwan`s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion. It keeps Beijing guessing.",

Decades of diplomatic pressure by Beijing meansthis island has very few formal diplomatic allies, because any nation that wants to normalize relations with China has to sever formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. The island`s Olympic team can`t even carry the Taiwanese flag. They have to compete under the name Chinese Taipei.

China sees the self-ruled islandas a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force if necessary. Reunification is also rooted in the communist party`s goal to reverse China`s century of humiliation by colonial powers. That means returning China`s borders to something more like that of the Qing Empire. It`s the basis of modern China`s claims to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan.",

Taiwan`s 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, the island`s first female president, leading a longtime pro-independence party. Tensions rising ever since, something Taiwan blames on China`s plan to push its power across the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan`s young democracy divided on the issue of unification with the mainland. The tide is turning. In 2020, Tsai won a landslide re-election, vowing to defend Taiwan`s democracy from she`s increasingly powerful and authoritarian China. Cross strait ties plunging to their lowest level in decades. TSAI ING-WEN, PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN (translated):  The broadest consensus among the Taiwanese people and our various political parties is that we must defend our national sovereignty, our free and democratic way of life. On this point, we have no room for compromise.",
