That's not only including her in the campaign.I think you saw folks mentioning that yesterday kind of framing her as underestimated of a former chief of staff claimed made that argument this week. This is something they're going to speak directly about and this is going to be a runway for the vice president to try to flip that narrative as you see her calling out more on the campaign trail. [11:10:05] I do think Republicans are going to try to make the argument, maybe more suddenly than Nikki Haley did but that would have tried to make the vice president a larger issue on the campaign trail. The onus will be on the vice president to really answer some of those questions that swirled around her during the presidential campaign. So she can be a leader and then galvanized her for the Democratic Party. I remember when she was chosen, the Joe Biden campaign was saying that she would be someone who would boost them with young people, would boost them with women, would boost them with all these types of groups. We haven't really seen that come to fruition, but I think it's kind of a time in the window this summer, as they move into the campaign where the spotlight will be on her, to see if she can turn some of that narrative around.",

This is the -- these kinds of legal questions have caused him to be more open about having a platform about weaponization against the federal government about retribution. That language is so ingrained now in the Republican primary, they've kind of flipped and reversed the argument. We're not seeing a breakthrough in terms of Republican voters hold Donald Trump, quote- unquote, accountable or maybe flee him in polling because of that, but we are seeing a Republican base that becomes more hardened against the legal system, against the federal government. And it's now using that language as a means to round up their voting base. So it's having an effect politically on the messaging. I don't think it's just having a support effect on Donald Trump.

And here's the other thing that I will note, you know, we're talking about that general election, right? Look at the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

But as he has tried to, it's actually funny reminds me of the Roy Wood joke, he made about this yesterday. As he tried to put meat to that bone, it's really created more problems for him. And as Donald Trump has attacked him more, he has not found a way to really reflect that back. Because the question here is, even if Republican voters do agree with him on something like Disney, does that make him more of a cultural warrior than Donald Trump already is? Is that a reason that they're going to prioritize this over all of the other concerns that Donald Trump and grievances that he speaks to also? And so it's already something that has a general election complication, but it's not even clear that he's actually helping his short-term gain. And I think that's one reason why you see them pushing back against folks like Haley, because the alternatives, the anti-Trump alternatives, the Haley's of the world, the Scots, they're increasingly looking at DeSantis as vulnerable.",
