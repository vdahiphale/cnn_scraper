Just ahead, explosions in Sudan's capital as an escalating fight between two generals turn deadly for civilians there. A Putin critic is sentenced to 25 years in prison after he spoke out against the war in Ukraine, details in just a moment and a mass shooting at a 16th birthday party in Alabama has left a small community stumped, the latest on what we know.We begin with Sudan where fighting between rival military factions is intensifying. The death toll is climbing and the international community is calling for an immediate ceasefire. Violence broke out in Khartoum on Saturday between the Sudanese Army and a powerful paramilitary group and has since spread to other parts of the country is unclear who's in control. Maybe 100 people have been killed so far with hundreds more injured. CNN's Nima Elbagir joining us with the very latest we're getting very general guidance here because we're getting different messages, aren't we from the different factions?",

Really, the reality on the ground continues to shift and that makes verifying so much of this so difficult. But here's what we have been able to understand from civilians.Many people, in fact, most of the capital is sheltering in place. People say that they are losing access to fresh water. Many districts have lost access to electricity and medical personnel that we're speaking to on the ground, Max, tell us that they are unable to reach the injured and in many cases are able to bury the dead. It is just too unsafe. Eyewitnesses who CNN has been speaking to in and one of the leading doctor's associations in the country also tell us that hospitals are being deliberately targeted by the warring parties, which of course are in direct violation of international humanitarian law and would constitute a war crime. The situation is intensifying the conflict is escalating. And it's important to remember that these two men were partners in the counter coup that subverted the Sudanese people's journey to democracy around 18 months ago. The fact that they are now allowing their rivalry to spill out into the streets and impact the lives of so many Sudanese and an untold number of dead and injured. Everyone I'm speaking to in Sudan today, Max, is just absolutely terrified and absolutely heartbroken at what's happening.",

And I just want to give you a little bit more from Amnesty the Russia Director for Amnesty International, saying this verdict wrongly conflates human rights activism with high treason and is reminiscent of Stalin-era repression.

They say because, as you say, there's a go out of grain in their countries, and that is really affecting prices, and therefore the livelihoods of their farmers.This all stems, Max, from a decision by the EU at the beginning of this conflict to remove duties from exports of Ukrainian grain into Europe. That was because of the blockade of those black sea ports. It was designed to let Ukrainian grain flow more freely onto global markets. What has actually happened is a lot of that grain has stayed in Europe, as I said, pushing down prices. Now the EU has called this what it says unilateral action on trade unacceptable. It says it's asking for more information on those countries. But clearly this is an example of a sort of a byproduct of a policy put in at the beginning of this war.

There are reliable reports that the Russians have deployed T-90 tanks, some of their most advanced tanks in that area. They've deployed them with units of the Wagner private military company.

Or the election technology company has sued Fox News for defamation seeking damages of $1.6 billion and accuses the American TV network of damaging his reputation by airing false claims that its voting machines illegally rigged the 2020 election against Donald Trump.Fox News has denied any wrongdoing saying the lawsuit is a threat to the First Amendment. The trial was supposed to begin today in Delaware, but on Sunday, the Superior Court made a surprise announcement saying the trial would be delayed until Tuesday. The judges' statement didn't explain why though. But the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Fox is trying to settle the dispute out of court. The newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch, the Chairman of Fox Corporation. Defamation cases are very challenging to win in the United States.

The super heavy booster is packed with 33 engines, and it will attempt to push the un-crewed starship spacecraft which sits on top of the rocket booster into space. If the rocket launches properly, the spacecraft will separate less than three minutes into the flight and travel east from South Texas and go much of the way around the earth before splashing into the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. But hours before this scheduled launch SpaceX Founder Elon Musk worked to lower expectations to the point that he seemed to be bracing for catastrophic failure.

There's a million ways as rocket could fail. LAVANDERA (voice over): SpaceX has waited more than a year for the final government clearance to launch this rocket. The starship rocket system is the centerpiece of Musk goal of commercial space travel to the moon and beyond to Mars. It comes two weeks after NASA unveiled the four astronauts who will fly around the moon next year as part of the Space Agency's Artemis mission.
