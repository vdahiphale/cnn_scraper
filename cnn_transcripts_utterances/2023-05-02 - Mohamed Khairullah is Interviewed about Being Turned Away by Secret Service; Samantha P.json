As countries become more oppressive, as corrupt actors want to hide what they're doing, they lash out at journalists.And one of the things we realized is that lately the tactic is to actually bankrupt journalists as well as to detain them. And so what we're launching today is called Reporter Shield. It's an insurance fund that will allow journalists who may not have the means to compete with a repressive government or an oligarch, to actually have the insurance and the legal protection that they need in order to fight back and stay in business, stay in the business of holding accountable those actors who are trying to steal and repress their people.",

We, at USAID, helped Ukraine, as did so many partners around the world, get through the winter because Putin tried to weaponize winter and actually sort of freeze them into surrender. It didn't work.
