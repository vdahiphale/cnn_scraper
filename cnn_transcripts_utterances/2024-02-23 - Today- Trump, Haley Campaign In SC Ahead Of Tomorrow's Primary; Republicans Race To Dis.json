      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, political gravity catches up to Republicans. Two years after Dobbs and Alabama court decision careens into the campaign trail and makes a congressional flame thrower look like the voice of reason. Why IVF rolling has Republicans searching for a response.Plus, Ukraine's fight for survival turns too. It enters year three of trying to beat back Vladimir Putin's invasion with a significant battlefield loss, coupled with fears of losing the financial support of its American allies. And Senator Elizabeth Warren joins me live to talk about that IVF decision and why she disagrees with some of her fellow progressives who are fed up with the Biden presidency. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, don't stop thinking about tomorrow. Tomorrow is the South Carolina primary. And it may prove pivotal for Donald Trump, fatal for Nikki Haley or something in between. But the Republican Party finds itself less focused on that and more focused on finding an acceptable answer to this question. What do Republicans tell parents who want to start a family but need to try IVF. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Kristen, I want to talk about how the campaigns and Republicans in general are reacting to that. But first, we just got a brand-new ad from Nikki Haley's Super PAC. I shouldn't say SFA, the Super PAC that supports her. It's very harsh on Donald Trump. Listen to this. (PLAYING VIDEO) I mean, washed up failures. That's I'm sure going to be something that hits pretty hard inside the Trump campaign, personally as well.",

But I am reminded of something that happened before we even got to the Iowa caucuses, which was that the Club for Growth and the Super PAC that supports Club for Growth that was trying to run any single Republican candidate against Donald Trump.Put out a memo saying that every single type of ad that they put out didn't work. That actually any kind of different structure, made some Republican voters even more likely to vote for Donald Trump. And the reason I say that here is because it does appear that that's what's happening in South Carolina. He is leading in this state by 30 points. Despite the fact that she is outspent him. Despite the fact that she has outpaced him on the campaign trail. Despite the fact that she was the governor of this state. He does appear to steamroll her. And it's not just in South Carolina, it's also the Super Tuesday states. He's leading in all of them as well.",
