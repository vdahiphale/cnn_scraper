I think when you take the politics out of this and you take the Donald Trump of it all out of this, the result is fairly straightforward, strictly on a legal and constitutional basis. And it's not often that we see a nine to nothing ruling, but the justices did agree, in fact, that it is not up to the states to enforce and execute the 14th Amendment.You saw Justices Alito and Thomas in agreement with Justices Sotomayor and Kagan on that point. It simply could not be as a matter of law, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, that every state gets to do what it wants, because otherwise that would leave us with a, quote, \"patchwork of different states doing different things according to the decision.\" So, it's a rare 9-0 opinion and I think they hit the nail on the head here.",

The five justices in the main opinion said it has to be done by Congress. Only Congress can enforce this. The other four justices said, well, sure, maybe Congress can do it, but there also may be other federal means of enforcement.Now, frankly, I don't know what they mean by that. I don't know what federal entity other than Congress would be capable of enforcing this. So, there's a bit of disagreement about who can enforce this. Could it be just Congress or some other unnamed entity? But at bottom where they agree and what's really decisive here is it's not up to Colorado. It's not up to Maine. It's not up to Illinois. It's not up to any individual state. TAPPER: So, today's opinion does not directly address whether the court thinks President Trump's actions on January 6th and around January 6th qualify him as an insurrectionist.

They don't hold trials or hearings, except in very rare circumstances, not applicable here.There was never any way they were going to make a finding on that. Either way, none of the nine justices makes a finding on that. And second of all, they didn't need to make that kind of finding. This is a legal and constitutional and procedural decision.

He's also made this argument that, well, first he has to be impeached and then convicted by the Senate and only then can he be indicted. That, too, I think is ridiculous.But there's a third argument that may get some traction, which is to the extent the charges relate to conduct within the scope of the presidency, he is immune for that.

So, they have expedited this a bit, certainly not nearly as much as Jack Smith would want them to expedite it.But I do think we'll see a ruling from the Supreme Court sometime in June. And then that leaves maybe a very narrow window, potentially, where this case can get tried before the 2024 election. I think it's unlikely, but not quite impossible.

But to actually come to a factual finding, I don't think it's something that would have been properly before them to begin with.Plus, you have different bodies that have reached different conclusions on that. You have Colorado that says he was an insurrectionist. And then you have the Senate in the impeachment trial where he was acquitted of that.

So, they've kind of thrown out the whole impeachment judgment clause and they've thrown out blanket immunity.
