This was moments after chaos erupted when Israeli forces opened fire as civilians, desperate for food, were gathering at aid trucks. The Palestinian Ministry of Health saying that more than 100 people were killed and nearly 800 others were injured. CNN unable to independently confirm those numbers at this point. But an eyewitness as the gunfire triggered panic. People got trampled as these trucks were trying to leave the area. But an IDF spokesperson says there was no strike from Israeli forces toward the aid convoy. And instead, soldiers were conducting a humanitarian operation. Let's go live now to Tel Aviv where CNN's Jeremy Diamond is. Jeremy. two very different accounts of what happened. Help us sort through this.",

Earlier, President Biden spoke with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar. He actually told the Qatari leader that today's incident underscores the urgency of bringing negotiations to a close as soon as possible and expanding the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. We have CNN chief national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt, with us. Alex, what is the president saying about how, what happened in Gaza could complicate these negotiations?",

      "sentences": "He's saying exactly that, that this will complicate the discussions. And it's notable that he spoke with the leaders of Qatar and Egypt today. Those are the two other main mediators trying to get to this ceasefire.Now, remember, Boris, a couple of days ago, the president had said that there could be a ceasefire in place as early as Monday. That took a lot of people by surprise. And the president actually walked that back today, saying that it's likely not on Monday. But he said that hope springs eternal. What were really hearing from Biden administration officials today is that this really shows the urgency of the need for a ceasefire. The question that I've been putting two sources is, does this derail the ceasefire talks. That's something that Hamas indicated might be the case. This certainly complicates them. Or does it accelerate them? I think when you look at those overhead drone videos that we've seen, it really emphasizes the point that not enough aid has been getting into Gaza and it hasn't been getting to the right places. This incident took place in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, a long way away from those two southern border crossings where the aid is going in. So U.S. officials are saying, we need to get to a ceasefire because a major component of that ceasefire is not just getting those hostages released, it's not just a pause in the fighting, it's upping that amount of humanitarian aid going into Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Some pretty tense questioning on Capitol Hill as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin testifies about his failure to immediately notify President Biden and lawmakers after he was hospitalized last month for complications from prostate cancer surgery.The defense chief waited several days to disclose his whereabouts. That is something that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have strongly criticized. Today, scolding him to his face in his first congressional appearance since his health crisis . CNN's Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon for us. And, Natasha, those lawmakers really didn't hold back here. What were the big takeaways from the hearing? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Brianna. And as you said, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, they did express concerns over the significant delay that Austin incurred while, of course, he was in the hospital. In notifying any senior national security officials, really, including the president of his hospitalization and the fact that he was in the intensive care unit for part of that hospitalization. But of course, the sharpest criticism really fell along party lines. And you heard Republicans call it an embarrassment. Some Republicans said that it was a boon to propaganda by the Russians and by other bad actors who are trying to boy any kind of appearance that there is no firm command and control at the Department of Defense. But secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, he really emphasized here that even though there was a delay and a gap and something went wrong clearly in the notification process, there was never any actual gap in terms of the transfer of power. Here's just a bit of what he told lawmakers early this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN, DEFENSE SECRETARY: There was never any lapse in authorities or in command and control. At all times, either I or the deputy secretary was in a position to conduct the duties of my office. But we did have a breakdown in notifications during my January stay at Walter Reed. And that is a sharing of my location and why I was here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So there was a pretty tense exchange with another Republican lawmaker during that hearing where Austin was specifically asked, essentially, whose fault this was that the president of the United States, the White House, national security adviser, even his deputy, were not notified until days after he entered the hospital of exactly why he needed to transfer his authorities.And he could not give a very clear answer on that. He had told this lawmaker that he expected his staff, essentially, the building, to notify the proper people. But clearly, that did not pan out. Still, though, he would not place blame squarely on any of his staff members. And he simply said that this is a process that is going to be fixed moving forward. And that is exactly why there was a 30-day review carried out by the Pentagon to try to figure out just how this process can be smoothed out in the future. Again, really homing in here on the idea that this was a notification process failure and not one that actually jeopardize national security at any point -- Brianna?",

Let's bring in CNN business correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich, to talk about this. What's the impact here on WeightWatchers? It seems pretty severe. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: This is the power of Oprah Winfrey. When she announced that she's stepping down from the board of WeightWatchers, you see markets respond. At one point, at the open, WeightWatchers stock was down 70 percent. At last check, it was down about 23 percent. But she says that she's stepping down in May. She will not run for reelection for the board. She's donating all of her shares -- she owns about 10 percent -- to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. But she still plans to kind of stick around in some capacity advising the CEO and the company. But Oprah joined WeightWatchers in 2015. She was a shareholder. She was a board member up until May. And she was very much a spokesperson for the company. She really was able to inspire people. And she also was able to hold herself accountable to her weight loss goals. She has been very open about her struggles around weight loss. And she joined WeightWatchers, in part, to do it all naturally. However, as you mentioned, in December of last year, she announced that she was taking a weight loss drug. She says that she has found freedom in it, and she's never felt better at 70. So clearly, a big transition and for Oprah. But also a big transition for WeightWatchers.",

      "sentences": "Maybe not. This was clearly Oprah's decision. She's the one making the decision to step down.But it's interesting that WeightWatchers actually, coming off of this weight loss drug craze, started a whole new membership program where folks could join WeightWatchers and be on weight loss drugs, and they'd have access to doctors who could write them prescriptions, but also nutrition plans. And WeightWatchers, for their part, in a statement has thanked Oprah for all of the work she's done with the company and says that they very much look forward to continuing to work with her in some capacity as a collaborator and a partner going forward. But clearly, this is a big, big loss for the company. But just Oprah starting her next chapter/",
