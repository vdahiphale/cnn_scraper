How those inflammatory claims stand up against the actual facts. And as the President takes executive action on undocumented migrants, a story you'll only see here. How one man has taken the issue into his own hands and what he encounters in his nights on the border. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with breaking news. A request late today from the former president's legal team to lift the gag order now that a jury has found him guilty in all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to keep word of his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels from reaching voters in the 2016 election. As you know, gag order or not, he's already said plenty about the judge, the judge's daughter and witnesses in the case. Now his lawyers are seeking free rein. CNN's Kara Scannell is here with the details. Also joining us, bestselling author and former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin and retired New York judge, Jill Konviser, a longtime friend of the trial judge in the case. So Kara, what does the Trump team want?",

So they write in the letter to the judge, \"Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify continued restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump - who remains the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election - and the American people.\"And they go on to say that they think that there's even a stronger argument now to remove it because President Joe Biden has made comments on the verdict and has Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen, two of the key witnesses. So the court spokesman for the judge says the order speaks for itself, the DA's office has declined to comment. And either way, Trump is not prohibited from talking about the trial, talking about the verdict. It's just he's prohibited from speaking about these witnesses and the jury. The question will be, expect the DA's office will file a response and then ultimately see what the judge does.",

They're all public figures with access to the press themselves. Several of them have already commented. I think it's a little different with the jury. I think judges are very protective of jurors even after they have served, especially in such an inflammatory situation here and where their identities have largely been kept secret.

Witnesses told horrifying stories of some opening fire.The next day, June 5th, 1989, this defining image of the crackdown that unidentified man in a white shirt facing off against a column of tanks, a brave, lone act of defiance. His name and fate remain a mystery. No official death toll was ever released by the Chinese government, but human rights groups estimate it was in the hundreds, if not thousands. CNN's Will Ripley has done extensive reporting in China. Tonight he joins us from Taipei, Taiwan. So, can you just remind people of what this anniversary represents, Will?",

      "sentences": "In June 4th, 1989, 35 years ago, we don't know, as you said, how many people were massacred in Tiananmen Square. These were young, some of the best and brightest minds in China who were out protesting for democracy, protesting for an end to government corruption, and their calls were brutally suppressed by the People's Liberation Army.The day after this video and that iconic photo, which has been since known as tank man. We don't know the name of this man who looks like he was just walking to work and stood in front of a column of tanks. They were shooting bullets above his head, trying to get him to get out of the way. Even getting these photos to the rest of the world was quite an ordeal because at that time, Beijing was shutting down all live transmission. CNN had to hide its videotapes in the U.S. Embassy before tourists smuggled them in a suitcase and flew them to Hong Kong, which at that time was free to report about this. It's a very different situation today. In the photo, the most famous one, there was about six of them, but the most famous was Jeff Widener of the AP. They had to smuggle the film in a canister hidden in the photographer's shoe just to get these images to the world. But they remain not only iconic to this day, but I think for a lot of people, a symbol of the individual standing up to the power of the state.",

We're being censored as soon as we mentioned, as I said in the tease before the commercial break that we're going to be talking about Tiananmen Square. These color bars went up and the signal is now being blocked.So Tiananmen vigils have also obviously been banned in China. What's security been like there?",

      "sentences": "Well, obviously, there's always heavy security at Tiananmen Square. There's heavy security in Hong Kong at Victoria Park, where up until 2020, there were protests every year, sometimes with 150,000 people. This year, they arrested four people, two men, two women, ages 23 to 69. That's basically all that's left of any commemoration of Tiananmen Square in Hong Kong.And, yes, as you see from the color bars, China has essentially tried to erase this moment, this date, June 4th, 1989, from its history. I have friends who grew up in China who are highly educated people, but they didn't even know about The Tiananmen Square Massacre until they moved out of the country and learned about it on the free internet. Of course, China's internet heavily censored it, Anderson.",
