One estimate in May found Ukraine was losing about 10,000 drones a month.

You don't have that because you barely have an air force that might change. The only solution, I'm told, is drones and drones are the great asymmetrical weapon you have. Do you believe that that is the path for Ukraine to break out of this stalemate? MYKHAILO FEDOROV, UKRAINIAN MINISTER OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION (through translator): Yes. I think that the side will win that will have more drones that will use them with. The best quality drones are definitely the important thing for today and for the future in this war so we're going to put very many efforts in building an army of drones, so that we can develop and design air drones, ground drones and water drones because they really help us in real time to get quality information on the enemy.

That doesn't seem to be going away.FEDOROV (through translator): I think that today it's just the beginning of the technological war, a real one. We are just at the very early stages, everything is ahead. Drones will hit drones, will shut them down, and the role of A.I. will become much bigger in capturing targets on the battlefield, doctrines will keep changing. The systems of situational awareness will keep developing and we'll get some better understanding of what's happening in the battlefield and lose fewer people.

Elon Musk said no because he thought that was widening the war.Does that mean that if Ukraine were to try to get back territories that were captured by the Russians in 2014 Elon Musk will not allow his technology to be used in that process and it would be crippling for you because that would mean you would have no internet connectivity if you were trying to get back territories annexed in 2014? If you're trying to get the stuff that was annexed in 2022, you have the green light from Musk, but 2014, there's a red light. FEDOROV (through translator): In fact, that case just became well- known because Elon Musk is quite a popular person in the world, but there are technologies that one can use that work effectively in the Black Sea, in the Crimea, and these are other satellite-based systems, these are military satellite systems, and you see that there have been successful missions related to the Crimean Bridge and many other missions to hit the enemy ships, and all of it used very many different communication means.",
