We did the research. We rolled out a school wide phone-free policy on March 1st, but there is just not enough of a culture in the district and in our society to be able to enforce it easily. It takes energy, staff. Having the physical barriers, which is in this resolution, will help us. And researcher and author Jonathan Haidt, in the anxious generation, he says that's really the only answer to high schools especially having that physical barrier.So, I'm a teacher. I'm a parent. I'm excited for this. But really enforcement has to be figured out as a collaborative process between, you know, teachers, administrators, parents, students. And their needs to be education. A lot of families, students, even stuff, we don't know all the dangers of cell phones. Like the surgeon general is educating us. There's so many people out there educating us. It's like cigarettes.

The arrests are part of a major effort to crack down on a Chinese criminal money laundering ring operating out of Los Angeles. The ring is said to be connected to Mexico's drug cartels. A senior DEA official said the agency has seen an uptick in Chinese money laundering in the U.S. over the last year. A U.S. soldier has been sentenced to nearly four years in a Russian penal colony.
