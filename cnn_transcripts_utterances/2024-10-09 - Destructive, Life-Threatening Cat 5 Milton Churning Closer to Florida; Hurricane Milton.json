It is poised to be one of the most destructive natural disasters in Florida's history. Officials just forecast the storm will hit as a Category 4 along the west coast, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Sarasota, you can see down to Fort Myers, all in the path, big population centers, all extraordinarily vulnerable to a predicted huge storm surge.The outer bands are now being felt. Bridges to some barrier islands have already been shut down. Officials say if you can get out, get out, but that window is closing. CNN is stationed along the coast. First, let's get the new forecaster from Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, tell us what you're seeing.",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. We are less than 24 hours away from one of the most powerful top ten Atlantic Basin hurricanes to ever form that will impact western and southwestern portions of Florida. This did not weaken overnight and those are sobering words because we're only a matter of hours until we experience tropical storm force winds in this region and it's only a matter of hours before we start to see the water levels start to come up. The latest track from the National Hurricane Center does show a Category 4 major hurricane making landfall late tonight into early Thursday morning. The exact location of that most powerful right front quadrant of the hurricane is so important. We know this is a game of miles, right? One computer model still showing a worst case scenario for Tampa Bay but there are other computer models that bring it to the south. We should expect these types of wobbles with this type of an intensity of this magnitude. These storms tend to wobble back and forth and that again determines who will see the worst impacts.One thing's for sure, the catastrophic winds will not be confined just to the coastline, they will stretch far inland. And notice this updated map, this has extreme catastrophic winds, that's major hurricane force from Hillsborough County into Lee County, including Charlotte, as well as Sarasota. Now, in terms of this unsurvivable storm surge, again, it is that right front quadrant that is so critical, 10 to 15 feet. You can see that includes Sarasota, the Port Charlotte region. We are watching the satellite depicting every moment in its track is so critical on whether or not this has a southerly component or a northerly component and who gets the worst impacts. Flooding, rain will be a concern from this. John, we're talking about over two to three months of rain falling from the sky through the duration of this storm. It's already been raining. We've already seen tornadoes spinning up in Miami-Dade County earlier this morning. And that will increase through the course of the day today. I'm going to leave you with this, John. We have a rare risk of excessive rainfall leading to flash flooding where you see that shading of pink. Remember, if we've learned anything from Hurricane Helene, it is these rare high risks that caused the most destruction and also the most deaths.",

There's a little bit of a gust, but we know these conditions are only going to get worse.Right now, we're in front of Tampa General Hospital. We're keeping an eye on the Hillsborough Bay. We know that from Helene, the storm surge got so bad here that the waters actually touched and got several feet high up to the walls of Tampa General Hospital, the region's only level one trauma center. With Milton, we're looking at worst case scenario, double that storm surge, so ten feet on up. So, this is a precarious situation we're keeping our eyes on. And, of course, you have Florida officials telling folks that if you haven't already, please evacuate or seek shelter. We heard from Sheriff Chad Chronister of Hillsborough County saying that this is the 11th hour. Please get out. This is your shortening window of time to leave the area. Another matter of concern here is once these winds reach about 40 miles per hour, this is a community of bridges, you're going to start seeing the Sunshine Skyway, the Howard Franklin, the Corny Campbell Causeway, these bridges beginning to shut down. Also, first responders not as willing to go out for their personal safety. Over in Treasure Island, in Pinellas County, one of the one of the barrier islands, residents heard this.

Catastrophic worst hurricane in the history of Florida was coming right for Tampa Bay and it changed and it went to the Fort Myers-Naples area. These storms are unpredictable. That's why they call them the cones of uncertainty because of the uncertainty. I think everyone saw during Helene when this time they called for seven feet storm surge and we got every inch of that storm surge. Now, they're being prepared. We knew then that a lot of people didn't heed the warnings. They almost became a little too complacent. The good part was is the winds never became to sustained over 40 miles an hour and we never had to suspend service. We conducted over a thousand rescues with our amphibious vehicles, our marine unit with air boats.You know, this storm is going to be different. When it becomes too dangerous, we're going to have to suspend service. It's just too risky for our personnel who will be prepared and ready for that after-storm response. So, imagine that sickening feeling that I can't even think about when you figure it out, like, hey, I shouldn't be here, hey, I need help, and helps not coming.",
