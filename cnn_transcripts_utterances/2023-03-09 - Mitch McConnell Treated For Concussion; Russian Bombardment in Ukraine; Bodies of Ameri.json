People who live there are still worried about potentially hazardous conditions, as members of both parties call for more safety regulations.

And they went right after him about the accountability, trying to hold his feet to the fire at how they will show up for the residents there and how they will make this better for their lives that no doubt will be made harder going forward. I want to highlight this one exchange that just happened in the last hour between Senator Markey on the committee, and he was going right out after Andy (sic) Shaw, asking specifically if they intend to help compensate the homeowners who now have very diminished property value in the area of the derailment. Now, here's that back-and-forth. Happened just a moment ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

One of the nearby residents, Cathy Reese, who we spoke to, she lives in nearby Negley. Leslie Run runs right behind her home. In the days following the derailment, there were dead fish in that run.

So, Jason Carroll, Sunlen Serfaty, thank you both so much. So, from trains to planes and another fight on board, this time on a Southwest Airlines flight. Watch this. So this brawl broke out as people were boarding the plane in Dallas. Other passengers, you can see, they kind of jumped in to try to break it up. CNN's Ed Lavandera is live in Dallas for us. So, Ed, if it's not a near collision a runway these days, it's a fight between passengers. Any idea how this one started?",

We also heard from one witness on the plane who believed that the man who was sitting in his seat had perhaps bumped in to the punching man's family. But that's how it started, clearly escalated very quickly. We're told that the video actually started after the man throwing punches had already landed three or four different strikes on the man. And, obviously, you see the passengers there in the plane trying to help the crew get the situation under control and get the men separated. We are told that both men left the plane. Dallas police officials say that criminal charges were not filed against anyone in this particular situation. Southwest Airlines says they commended the actions of their crew for handling that situation safely and that the Monday flight did go -- continue as scheduled. It was going from Dallas Love Field to Phoenix, Arizona. But, clearly, as spring break season continues to heighten here in the weeks ahead, really kind of highlights that, as flights are full, tensions are also high, Kristin.",

And the remains of Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown will be transported to a funeral home in Brownsville, Texas, and a second round of autopsies will be conducted on U.S. soil. Their two friends who survived the kidnapping are in Brownsville right now recovering. Today, Mexico dispatched hundreds of soldiers to the border city of Matamoros, where the incident happened on Friday. CNN's Carlos Suarez is in South Carolina. The victims are from there.

However, that was not the case. As for Eric Williams, the other person that survived this kidnapping, he is recovering in a hospital in Texas, where he was shot several times. Now, the bodies, as you mentioned, of the two other Americans that died in here, Zindell Brown and Shaeed Woodard, as you noted, they're expected to be brought back to the U.S., to Texas, at some point today. We're told that another autopsy will take place, and then, presumably, the bodies will be released to the families. All four of them were from the South Carolina area -- Kristin.",

But the Mexican government has to do something to demonstrate they are taking a stand, and that they have some control of that territory, which most people will tell you and believe that that territory in Matamoros is controlled essentially by the cartels and its armies of armed people. So I think what you're seeing, by flooding that area with soldiers, by gaining control, two things may be going on. One, they may be looking for people and trying to make arrests to bring this further towards some kind of close for the Mexican government, but also asserting themselves in the area, so tourists who have been told by the U.S. State Department, don't go there, it's too dangerous, will be assured, well, there's a security presence now, and it's still OK to go for these medical procedures and other reasons.",

There have been times when the U.S. government and the intelligence community and the Mexicans have worked successfully to do damage and create setbacks for cartels.The best example we have, historically, is the work we did with Colombia, which took years and cost thousands of lives, mostly Colombian lives. As we have seen in Mexico, the cartels have killed hundreds and, yes, thousands of people, mostly Mexicans. And this is only a flash point, because we see four Americans, two of whom have died, caught up in that -- in that net, and a Mexican woman who was on her way to pick up her children from school who was killed in the crossfire of that same incident. So, if you ask the Mexican government, we're the problem. If there weren't millions of Americans buying fentanyl and other drugs, the cartels wouldn't exist. We're the market. And we need to cure our need for  drugs. If you ask the Americans, the Mexicans have let vast criminal organizations get far too powerful for far too long. So, in some measure, we're talking past each other. But we have seen, in the Colombian example, if we work together close enough for long enough, there can be real progress.

That's a possibility. Or are you going to have the cartel turn over, either dead or alive, the people that we have seen on that videotape involved in the shooting as further expendables and say, you can have these and let's bring this to a close?

The Ukrainians got their electricity system back and operational before this latest set of strikes. It's a long-term problem. We have got to find a way to secure Ukraine. And, however this war ends, Ukraine can't be left under attack by Russian missiles. So, although we're trying to push air defense there, we don't have it there yet.
