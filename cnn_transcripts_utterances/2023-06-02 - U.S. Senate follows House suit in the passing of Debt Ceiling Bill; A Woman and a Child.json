I'm Paula Newton.Ahead here on \"CNN Newsroom.\" The deal to suspend the United States debt limit passes the Senate, putting an end to the drama over whether the U.S. would default for the first time in history. Donald Trump says he doesn't know anything about a report on his handling of classified documents. More fallout from CNN's exclusive story on an audio recording of Trump that's now in the hands of federal prosecutors. And this mundane video of a Friday night in Kyiv goes viral sparking a massive debate about Russia's war on Ukraine. We'll talk with the person who shot it and find out what it really shows. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN center, this is \"CNN Newsroom\" with Paula Newton. The White House has announced that U.S. President Joe Biden will make his first Oval Office address to the nation on Friday evening. He's expected to speak about the debt limit bill that just cleared the U.S. Senate late Thursday. That crucial vote ensured the U.S. won't risk defaulting on its obligations anytime soon. But it was in fact a touch and go, the negotiation during all of these weeks, and it was hardball leading up to the very last moment. CNN's Melanie Zanona has our details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Senate on Thursday night passed a bill that would raise the debt ceiling until 2025 and also limit future spending. And the final vote tally in the Senate was 63 to 36. They needed 60 Republicans and Democrats to come together to pass this bill. And they did. Take a listen to Chuck Schumer talking about this bill after the vote.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Default was the giant sword hanging over America's head. But because of the good work of President Biden, as well as Democrats in the House and Democrats in the Senate, we are not defaulting. Democrats said from the start, we must take default off the table. For a long time Republicans, many Republicans in the House resisted. House Republicans were ready to take default hostage in order to pass a radical, hard-right agenda that never could have passed with the American people. So tonight's outcome is very welcome news for our economy and for American families.",

There were points where it looked like it was gonna go completely off the rails.And then the other half of the battle is that they had to sell this deal to their members and there was opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. Democrats don't like the stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients, they don't like some of the energy permitting reforms, and Republicans thought the bill does not go far enough to cut spending. They also don't like that it's gonna hike the debt ceiling for two years until after the next presidential election, but ultimately a coalition of members came together in the middle to get this done and avoid what would have been the first ever default.

That's all that we were talking about, to get changes in work requirements that essentially have no impact on the budget and some minor changes in permitting.

But he's the president.And if the domestic and global economy collapse into catastrophe, you know, there's no way he walks out of that blast radius. I mean, it affects him. So I think avoiding that was worth it to Biden to essentially renounce what he had originally set out, which is that he was not going to negotiate around the debt ceiling. And Paula, I think it was a very revealing kind of measure of the way Biden has approached this presidency. He has criticized Republicans, he's called out the MAGA faction and so forth. But in the end, he chooses to try to make the system work rather than going to war against the other side on the grounds that it is, you know, pursuing a radical agenda. He was very measured throughout this whole process. And that did allow him to bring this into shore with relatively minor concessions to Republicans, certainly not many more concessions that he would have to make in the budget process anyway later this year.

I appreciate it.Now CNN joins divers and researchers in the Red Sea as an entire species practically disappears overnight threatening the balance of life in its unique coral reefs. You'll want to see this story. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [03:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

We know that it is transmitted through the water. You don't need direct contact. That it takes 48 hours for an individual to go from a live, healthy individual to basically bare skeleton.GOLD (voice-over): Vital to keep the delicate balance of life here. These urchins consume the algae that can choke reefs already stressed by human activity, and the effects of climate change. Dr. Bronstein and his team of researchers from Tel Aviv University show us how the beauty and health of the reefs are under attack. We do not spot a single black sea urchin.",

And it is probably the most unique coral reef in the world, it is our responsibility to make sure that they will remain here for future generations.GOLD (on-camera): This coral reef is unique in the world because of its ability to withstand high temperatures, making it more resistant to the effects of climate change. And that's why this reef is so ecologically important to the globe. (voice-over): These tanks at the Inter-University Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, Israel, were once filled with the jet black urchins. Now they are covered in algae, a small-scale example of what scientists say is happening in the sea.",

Dr. Bronstein said it's likely spread by ships and possibly helped along by climate change. And it's spreading. Researchers are using DNA technology to make a difference.",

Governments need to move within weeks. BRONSTEIN; And decision makers need to understand that the window of opportunity to take action is very, very narrow and it's closing rapidly. If we don't move quickly to create the broodstock populations based on the Mediterranean population, the remaining population, if we don't take extra care about what we pump into this environment, we may find ourselves in a huge problem, in a huge situation. GOLD (on-camera): Israel shares this gulf and this problem with Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which you can see just behind me, and with which Israel has no official relations. But under the water, there are no boundaries and no politics, and international cooperation will be a key to fixing this problem. (voice-over): These fragile reefs where everything plays its part in the cycle, desperately waiting for help. Hadas Gold, CNN, Eilat Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
