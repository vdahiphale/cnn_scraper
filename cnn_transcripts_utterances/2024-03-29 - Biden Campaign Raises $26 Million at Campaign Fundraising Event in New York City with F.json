And President Biden's advisers are really hoping that this show of force from Democratic presidents last night will help build momentum as this election is kicking in to high gear. The campaign touting the fact that they raised more than $26 million from this one-night event alone. And they're hoping that this will add to the cash advantage that they currently have over former President Donald Trump as they're gearing up for that November fight.Now, President Biden, President Obama, and President Bill Clinton spent about an hour with late-night host Stephen Colbert, really laying out the stakes of this election, trying to warn of the threat that Trump poses to the country. They never named Trump by name, according to the reporters who were there in the room, but they did issue very stark warnings. President Biden saying that democracy is at stake and pointed to the January 6th insurrection, saying that there was no president in the United States that day as Trump sat here at the White House, as that unfolded. The president also said in his remarks, quote, \"We're at a real inflection point in history. This guy denies global warming. This guy wants to get rid of not only Roe v. Wade, which he brags about having done, he wants to get rid of the ability of anyone in America to have the right to choose. All the things he's doing, they're so old, a little old and out of shape.\" And the campaign also has provided a video from last night. Reporters who were in the room were not allowed to record any video from this event. But the campaign is trying to highlight a bit of a lighter moment between President Biden and Colbert.

Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered outside of Radio City Hall before and during the event, and the presidents were actually interrupted several time from protesters in the hall itself, some mostly protesting the war in Gaza, but also one relating to Russia.And it was notable that President Obama took a moment to address those protesters, as well as Biden did. And Obama said that they need to not just talk, but also listen. He said that just talking is something that the other side does. And it really highlights the fact that this is an issue that the Democratic Party will continue to grapple with heading into November's election. Now the president is continuing his push in New York City today. He's expected to meet with top donors at a spring retreat of the Biden National Finance Committee. Senior campaign officials, I'm told will also be briefing top donors on their strategy as they're really trying to have this all hands on deck moment as they're preparing for that face off against Trump in November.",

They say it's going to be more than $33 million, as you noted. But again, it is still early. We are still waiting to see what actually comes in. And they've released those numbers on a day that Biden was announcing that he was raising more than $25 million. But this is significant really for three reasons. One, overarching when you talk about more than $26 million and you talk about more than $33, this is setting up to be one of, if not the most expensive general elections in history.But this is also particularly significant for Donald Trump for two reasons. One, as we have reported, he has been facing somewhat of a cash crunch on the campaign trail. They are bleeding money out. This is going to help them, even if it's not $33 million, millions of dollars from some of the richest GOP owners are going to help the campaign. The other reason why this is so significant is the fact that we had seen so many of these big donors really turning their back on Donald Trump, or at least sitting on the sidelines during that primary season, waiting to see who the nominee was, or in some cases, just hoping that there was going to be an alternative to Donald Trump. What this signifies is that the Republican Party is really coming around the former president. They have decided that this is their candidate and they're going to back that up financially as well.",

He was there reporting for \"The Wall Street Journal\" when he was suddenly arrested and charged with  espionage. Gershkovich, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and the US government all deny that charge.This morning, President Biden said, he will never give up hope for his release. We me now is Josh Rogin. He is a columnist for \"The Washington Post.\" Josh, thank you so much for being here. One of the reasons I love reading and listening to you is you're blunt. You call it like you see it and when you look at the last year, you call Vladimir Putin a kidnapper here. JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Well, that's right. I think there are two things going on. One is that Vladimir Putin is a criminal, a thug, a gangster, and one of the things he does is he sends murderers and weapons  dealers around the world to commit crimes, and then when they get scooped up and put in foreign prisons, he captures some foreigners and tries to make a trade -- and that's straight up mafia behavior. But at the same time, he is also a dictator and ever since he came into power, but especially since the war in Ukraine began, he has been crushing dissent inside of his country by rounding up foreign journalists, Russian journalists, dissidents anyone who talks about the war at all in a way that he doesn't like. And this is what dictators do. They combine external aggression with internal repression every single time. So when you think about Putin in those terms, on the one hand, a gangster who is committing crimes and then try to get his criminal henchmen back into the fold and secondly, as a dictator who is trying to battle something greater called the truth, you can really understand why this situation is as bad as it is.",

He has driven western journalists out of Russia, western NGOs, and so in his mind, I am sure he thinks it is working. The problem, of course, is that the truth can never really be suppressed. That eventually, it will get out even inside of a closed society like Russia and over time, the people will realize that they're being lied to, so it is a losing game in the long run, but meanwhile, the people who paid the price are innocent people, not just Evan, who did nothing wrong, but Paul Whelan, a former  Marine, Vladimir Kara-Murza, \"Washington Post\" contributing columnist who is sentenced to 25 years in prison, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, dual citizen, Alsu Kurmasheva and countless others.

And so the pattern that we've seen is that, usually the deal comes after the conviction, that's not always the case, but is sometimes the case. And as we are now seeing by Evan's fifth pretrial detention extension, we don't even know when that sham trial is going to even begin.
