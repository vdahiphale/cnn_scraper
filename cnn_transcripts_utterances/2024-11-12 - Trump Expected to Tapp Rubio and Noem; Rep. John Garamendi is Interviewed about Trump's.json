California, way, way out ahead on dealing with the climate crisis, moving away from petroleum as a source of energy. It raises a very interesting situation for me. I represent all five ofnorthern California's oil refineries. And so we're looking at some 30,000 jobs. How do we transition those refineries away from petroleum into renewable. And frankly, we're making some good progress on that. So, California is going to lead. Other governors, Democratic governors, will also be very active in pushing back, not just on the environmental issues, but on a whole host of issues that affect the citizens and the constituents in each of those states. So, count on a pushback on many of the policies. We've, obviously, seen discussion about this on the rounding up all of the immigrants and deportation issues. There'll be a pushback, as there was in the first Trump term. But I do think that governors will also say, if there's a criminal, if there's somebody charged with a crime, deportation is appropriate.

You go beyond that, the Inflation Reduction Act deals with the climate crisis. But once again, those are working men and women jobs in the middle and lower- income brackets. We just didn't message it. We went from one major issue, starting with the American Rescue Plan, all the way to the Chips Act, and then the Inflation Reduction Act, and never went back and told the American public, particularly the middle class, the working men and women of America, that this was for them. And those are the jobs that are there.There were 16 million jobs created in the Biden administration. Many of them were for the working class in America, whether it was the lower or the middle income. And so, we just didn't message it. And we were up against a gentlemen - excuse me, an individual who spent eight years with his messaging. Trump took the four years in his administration and then the four years of the Biden administration to message a very, very negative message that actually resounded in the American public. So, we made a messaging issue, but the policies that we put forward were specifically for the working men and women and designed to address the problems of access, the problems of dealing with communities left behind.

And Trump's lawyers are saying that official acts came into this case, even though it was about Trump's cover-up of a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. And those official acts included testimony from his White House aides, Hope Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout, as well as tweets Trump issued while he was president.Now, prosecutors say that that was just a sliver of the evidence, that they had a tremendous amount of evidence, overwhelming evidence, and that this conviction should stand. But the judge is in this unique position, having to make this decision. He has set Trump's sentencing for two weeks from today. We know Trump's lawyers are trying to stop that from happening. That has been a key thing that we have said, that led to this sentencing being delayed twice already. So, they are going to - we're expecting them to move to postpone this sentencing, in part because this is a state case, Trump is the president-elect, and state cases don't proceed against presidents.

One of the key questions had been, how much Donald Trump was going to impact this race, because it's a secret ballot, which means that lawmakers can all vote for whoever they want and it will never clear who voted for who. But one thing to keep in mind is the impact that Elon Musk, Donald Trump, MAGA world is all having. And you've seen in the last couple of days that Rick Scott has gotten a surge of MAGA world endorsements from Republican senators, to popular talk show hosts. And I asked Cornyn, is he worried about that surge that Rick Scott's getting so late in this game from MAGA world. He said he is not getting into the back and forth in the press.
