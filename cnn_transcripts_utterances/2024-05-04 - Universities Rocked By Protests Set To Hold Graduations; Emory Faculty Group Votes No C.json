Hicks testified she was sitting on the plane when she learned that the Wall Street Journal plans to publish a piece about the National Enquirer's catching killed deal involving Trump's alleged affair with an ex Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump denies the affairs. Hicks said she spoke with Trump who was concerned about the story and he instructed her to deny it. She is quoted in the journal saying Daniels affair allegation is absolutely unequivocally untrue. Hicks said Trump's was concerned with how the article would be viewed by his wife, saying he wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren't delivered to his residence that morning. Prosecutors as text about Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels to buy and kill her story of an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen told The New York Times in 2018 that he made the payment from his own pocket. Hicks said she was skeptical about Cohen's motives saying I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person. Hicks describe Trump's assessment of the story saying it was Mr. Trump's opinion is that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. As Trump's attorney Emil Bove went to take over questioning, Hicks began to cry. After a break, Bove focused on Cohen trying to show he had no role in the campaign and would act on his own. Hicks testified Cohen was not supposed to be on the campaign in an official capacity, but would try to insert himself at certain moments.

What do I mean by that? What I mean is that every witness they've had so far from the National Enquirer that is Mr. Packer talking about the whole catch and kill deal, and his interactions with Michael Cohen, right talk -- Davidson and the who -- he's the attorney Davidson for Stormy Daniels. And of course, Karen McDougal and his interactions with Cohen.All of these witnesses preceding Michael Cohen are talking about things relating to Michael Cohen, Michael Cohen's actions, their interactions with him. And that eliminates what Michael Cohen has to do. It eliminates Michael Cohen having to be believed. It eliminates Michael Cohen having to be the core witness. So the prosecution and answer to your question amorous focusing on making Michael Cohen lift as little as he possibly can, and having all these preceding witnesses corroborate him. So it's not about whether you believe Michael Cohen, he then is an important piece of the puzzle. Of course he is. But if everybody else talks about what he did, what his role was, what the nature and purpose of his activities were, then how could you not believe Michael Cohen? And that I think is going to be the prosecution strategy and motive, because he is going to be savaged by the defense in terms of his you mention, you know, just his unsavory nature, the things that he's done, and certainly his lies, misrepresentations, his convictions, and so yes, I think that's the prosecution's role.",

But we're still waiting on the judge to rule on these four otheralleged violations of the gag order.

It's too prejudicial. It would have the jury certainly take a view of it not that they may not have heard about it outside the courtroom, but they cannot impose whatever they heard to evidence inside the court.So on that issue, I think the judge is right on that's a fair ruling. Right. With respect to the actual what the judge will do now, I think there'll be additional fines that will be imposed. It's still early on, remember the nature of what Mr. Trump said, right? Really preceded the whole $9,000 payment issue. I think now though, Amara, that Trump is on notice. Right? I think that what it'll do is if he put imposes additional, that is if Trump violates the gag order again, I think you could see jail at that point, but I don't think this ruling would include jail at all.",

The DOJ has charged with Congressman Cuellar and his wife on charges of bribery, unlawful foreign influence and money laundering.Both of them appeared in court in Houston yesterday and specifically, the DOJ has accused the Congressman of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities. One of those is a bank headquartered in Mexico City, and the other one is an oil company owned by the government of Azerbaijan. And according to this indictment, Cuellar agreed to accept these bribes in exchange for taking official acts as a member of Congress and agreeing to trying to influence U.S. policy by doing things like inserting favorable language into certain bills and committee reports and also delivering certain speeches on the House floor. Now this development comes over two years after the FBI raided both the Congressman's home and his campaign office back in January of 2022. But the Congressman maintains his innocence and says he will run for reelection in November. Let me read you part of his statement. He said, I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I've done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas. Now, we are also getting some reaction from the top Democrat in the House that's House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. He did announce yesterday that the Congressman would temporarily stepped down from his top post on a House Appropriations Subcommittee. We should note that Cuellar is a senior member of that very powerful panel, which has jurisdiction over some key spending and policy decisions. He also at one point was the co-chair of the congressional Azerbaijan caucus, but Jeffries also said that congressmen Cuellar should be innocent until proven guilty, guys. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I think here you have Secretary Cardona writing to university presidents taking a more forceful stance.But I think, you know, he really risked alienating both wings of his party.

So you know, due to the trial schedule, he's been forced to choose more local locations. And he's also been forced to do the swing state rallies in just one day. I mean, the campaign has also been forced to move three of their daily morning meetings. Due to the trial schedule, they've also had to really just accommodate a candidate, you know, who has certain wishes as he's on trial.

At any other time, that would qualify as strong. But this jobs market has been so hot that this is actually a cool-down. It's roughly half the pace of the prior month. When we look at wages, we can see that paychecks are still growing faster than prices. That's good news for main street, but also good news for Wall Street is annual wage growth is below 4 percent for the first time in nearly three years. That is what the Fed wants to see. Is they search for science at the jobs market, is coming into better balance between supply and demand. Now, this is just one month. It's too early to call a trend. Still for this one month, this does look like the goldilocks jobs report that many were rooting for, Wall Street, the Fed, and even the White House. They don't want to see a report that was so hot that it would add to those inflation concerns. Of course, they don't want to see something too. So cold, that it would raise concerns about trouble in the economy. And so, this does keep alive hopes for an interest rate cut from the Fed. Not in June, but maybe later in the Summer or the Fall, borrowers can get a break from these really high rates for mortgages, credit cards and car loans. One other point here, even though the unemployment rate did tick up unexpectedly in April to 3.9 percent, this is still low, historically low. In fact, the unemployment rate is now below 4 percent, 27 months in a row. We haven't seen anything like that since the late 1960s, one more month below 4 percent, and this will be the longest such streak in American history. Victor and Amara?",
