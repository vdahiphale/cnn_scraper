And the second half of my exclusive interview with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last hour you heard his response to allegations that under his leadership Turkey has witnessed an erosion of democracy. Mr. Erdogan's controversial economic strategy and whether he is prepared to reconcile with Syrian President Bashar Al Assad. Well, this hour we take a look at the country's foreign policy specifically its relationship with the U.S. and Russia. Now Turkey is balancing its relationship with Russia and Ukraine at Presidency war in Ukraine grinds on its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Today he is in Saudi Arabia for the Arab League Summit in a bid to strengthen his country's ties with the Arab world. He thanked the Saudi Crown Prince for supporting Ukraine but accused other Arab leaders of \"Turning a blind eye to suffering caused by Russia\". Mr. Zelenskyy later heads to the G7 meeting in Japan; well, Mr. Zelenskyy courting the east and west convergence you can see right here in Istanbul, two worlds split by the paused for a -- Turkey a key NATO ally is raising eyebrows by many believed not standing strong enough against Russia over the Ukraine war. Well, I asked President Erdogan about that in our exclusive interview first more of our discussion about the presidential election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (on camera): On the eve of the first round, you told your supporters that the U.S. President had given instructions to \"Topple\" you.

We couldn't purchase those systems from the United States. So that's why I bought the equivalent from Russia. And when the F-35s were not delivered to us, we were very upset because we our NATO allies. Turkey is one of the most significant members of NATO. That's when we started looking at the alternatives. When we saw the attitude of the Americans about the F-35s we told them to at least provide us F-16s and the necessary parts. So we continue our relations in a determined manner.

It's intertwined like two hands, so you can peel back one finger, there's still nine more fingers holding that relationship in place.

Although we are told that American forces, American air men and women will likely have some kind of role in this training. Now, when President Zelenskyy comes to, to Hiroshima this weekend, do not be surprised if he makes yet another pitch again, to get the F-16 military aircraft. So when we talk about how the G7 is supporting Ukraine, there's obviously this military component. But as you just mentioned, there's also this economic component in the form of sanctions. And the sanctions that we saw today, this doubling down very targeted on things such as construction, transportation, manufacturing, business services, all instrumental in components in funding the Russian war machine and the effort is to quash it. Also find it interesting today that the UK said that it would block the import of Russian diamonds. So it's really trying to find out these loopholes to make a broader economic statement, a broader economic show of force against Russian efforts. And then of course, diplomacy, that can be difficult, but it's something that President Zelenskyy will likely bring up in many ways during his discussions here at Hiroshima this weekend, Becky.",

Russia has just issued an arrest warrant for theInternational Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan.

A second ICC warrant was also issued for a Russian official sentiment behind the deportation of Ukrainian children. Russia, of course does not recognize the court's jurisdiction.

But the real world's richest man 74 year old Bernard Arnault worth more than $230 billion having built the world's biggest luxury goods company, all the while very personally raising, educating and evaluating his five potential successors. BERNARD ARNAULT, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, LOUIS VUITTON MOET HENNESSY: I think my group is controlled by my own family. So instead of looking every day at the stock market, I look for the next 10 years. BELL (voice over): All five of Arnault children work for their father. 48 year old Delphine, the Chair of Christian Dior, her brother 45 year old Antoine, who is CEO of the holding company of Christian Dior and the three children from Arnault's second marriage. 31 year old Alexandre, who's an Executive Vice President of Tiffany's, 28 year old Frederic who runs Tag Heuer and the youngest 24 year old Jean, the Director of Development and Marketing at Louis Vuitton's watches division. RAPHAELLE BACQUE, AUTHOR, \"SUCCESSIONS: MONEY, BLOOD AND TEARS\": He is at once an attentive father, a good father, but also a merciless boss, so the children had to work hard. He has a fairly clear idea of their qualities and their weaknesses. And when the moment comes, we'll be able to choose. BELL (voice over): The $500 billion LVMH dominates the world of fashion with some of its biggest names like Christian Dior, and Louis Vuitton. It was built through ruthless acquisition and like -- diverse with vineyards, hotels, restaurants, and newspapers. But it is in the treatment of their children, that the fictional and real characters diverge far from fostering discord. Arnault has ensured short harmony, but with a cold eye on business nonetheless. The stakes are huge, the value of the company but also the power that it brings. Like Logan Roy, Bernard Arnault has cultivated his relationships with the powerful acquiring a vast media empire and making LVMH a symbol in France. Its headquarters stormed by protesters only last month. But while Arnault has sought to protect his children, he's also made it clear what he expects of them.",
