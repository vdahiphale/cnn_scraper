It's good to see you, Shawn.So, these signs that U.S. intel has picked up of Iranian leadership being nervous about some of the actions of its proxy groups in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen. From a national security perspective, should that be comforting or more worrisome? SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATION FOR U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  Yes, thanks for having me, Kate. I think from a national security perspective, you know, this is something that I'm concerned about. Look, we have to remember that while clearly Iran is funding, backing and supporting many of these militant groups throughout the region, including the Houthis and Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and, of course, Hamas and Gaza, Iran does not always have full control over what these groups do. Now, Kate, that's not to suggest that Tehran and the IRGC aren't orchestrating some of the more than 160 attacks that have happened since October, but it is to say that, for the most part, it is the ideological alignment between these groups and Iran that sort of underpins many of these attacks. So, you know, I think that it's concerning because it really sort of sheds light and lays bare the lack of command and control that Iran has on groups that are all over the region, which obviously threatens our national security and continues to be a concern for any U.S. forces in the region.",

Kate, when I saw this, and I talked to colleagues in the intelligence community, it helped me understand a little more about why the White House is taking the time that it is to be really deliberate and cautious about when and where and how the United States responds.When we're talking about the Islamic resistance in Iraq, what we're really talking about is a network of disparate groups in Iraq that sort of came into existence back in 2003-2004 in response to the war in Iraq, the U.S. war in Iraq. And what's challenging about this group is that they're mostly anti- U.S. And while they are ideologically aligned with Iran, the funding that supports these groups and the command and control, again, is something that varies widely. And so when the United States says that this group or this network of groups is responsible, what that tells me is that the response that the United States has is imminently more challenging because, again, varying loyalties and you've got to be really cautious about making sure that you hit those pain points that cause this attack without, as we've talked about, escalating in the area. So, this does make it more complicated, but I think the administration is doing the right thing and taking their time and figuring out where to attack here.",

In over a year, you know, you were talking about how different it was. But, of course, Haley is actually ahead of Joe Biden by five points, and that's despite the fact that a lot of Republican voters in exit poll and entrance poll data have been saying, in fact, Trump is the more electable one.

It really does give you a sense of what the coalition is likely to look like if Biden, in fact, is able to win this election.Because if you compare this poll to 2020, he's weaker with young people, he's weaker with men, he's weaker with non-white voters, especially those without degree, but he's stronger with women, he's stronger with college graduates and he's stronger with seniors. And if he does win, I think there's a lot of evidence that's how the coalition will have to evolve for him. And the other thing that I think is important for Biden here is -- and important for Republicans who are kind of skating past this evidence, Biden is running his vote against Trump is nine points higher than his approval rating, okay? That is pretty much unprecedented in presidential elections. But it's a lot like what we saw in 2022, when there were a lot of voters who were dissatisfied with Democrats, dissatisfied with Biden and the economy, still voted for Democrats anyway, because they viewed the Trump-inspired Republican alternatives as too extreme. There's a warning sign about that in this poll as well.",

The Republican Party is now a MAGA-dominated party, heavily blue collar responsive to Trump's populist message. But they are more than enough to make that path unviable, to make it implausible for Trump to win if, in fact, those voters who say that they believe Trump is unfit, if he is convicted, do not vote for him. And with Haley, you're getting both a sense of how big that coalition is, maybe a third of the party, and they are being shown very clearly they are now the subordinate minority part of the party.

It's expected to be announced later today, and it would apply sanctions on individuals who are accused of being involved in some of the settler violence in the West Bank.And this has been an issue that has been deeply concerning to President Biden, to administration officials over the last several months. You have seen an uptick in these incidents involving Israeli settlers in the West Bank, as many as 500 incidents, 8 Palestinians have died as part of them. And it has been sort of a constant back and forth between the White House and the Israeli government to try and get a handle on this violence. And the real concern had been that this could undermine stability in the region at a moment, of course, deep instability as the war in Gaza rages. It is something that President Biden has raised directly with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. And as early as recently as yesterday, a top aide to Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, was here at the White House discussing all of these issues. Now, President Biden back in November had tasked administration officials with coming up with options to do something about this uptick and violence in the West Bank in December. He announced some visa bans on some of these individuals who would have been responsible for this violence. And what we'll see today is further action, further punishment in the form of sanctions against some of these Israeli settlers. But I don't think you can separate it from some of the pressures that President Biden has been facing from members of his own party to do and say more about the plight of Palestinians, not only in the West Bank, but more particularly in Gaza. President Biden will be in Michigan later today. That is home to one of the largest concentrations of Arab-Americans in the United States. Certainly the anger in those communities has been palpable at President Biden's handling of the conflict in the Middle East. He doesn't have anything in particular on his schedule to speak with some of the members of those communities today, but certainly this is something that the White House has been confronting and dealing with for the last several months, Kate.",
