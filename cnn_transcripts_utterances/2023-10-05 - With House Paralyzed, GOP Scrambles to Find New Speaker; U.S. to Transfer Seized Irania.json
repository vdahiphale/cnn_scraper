There is, of course, I'm concerned that Jordan might be a bit too right-wing for more moderate members tastes. He says that will not be a problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  I think we're a conservative, center-right party. I think I'd be the guy to unite that.

They were given this impeachment inquiry, and it's their actions that suddenly, actually, they can't execute on any of it. I think you use the word irony, which is the right one. You also had some really great reporting that stuck out to me about Liz Cheney, who, of course, no longer in the House after she had a primary challenge he lost. She and Kevin McCarthy have, there is a lot of bad blood between the two of them, and it goes back to January 6th.

So, in the days leading up to the votes to oust McCarthy, Liz Cheney saw Congressman Dan Goldman, a Democrat from New York, on TV talking about what Democrats were weighing at the time, and sources tell me that Cheney called Goldman to discuss the threat that McCarthy presented to the country after everything that she felt like she had learned from her work on the January 6 committee. She talked about her -- McCarthy's relationship with former president, Donald Trump, and all of the work that she had done to uncover Trump's involvement with January 6th. And then Goldman shared that conversation with the entire DemocraticCaucus when they met behind closed doors on Tuesday, shortly before the vote to oust McCarthy. And that Tuesday meeting, Kasie, is really where Democrats came together and united behind this idea that they were not going to help McCarthy. Up until the point, there have been some conversations about, maybe there are some concessions we should get. Maybe there's a power sharing agreement we can do. That meeting was a decision, absolutely not, we're staying unified and that conversation between Cheney and Congressman Goldman was just one of the motivating factors that got Democrats united.",

I can't imagine why there might be nerves about whether the U.S. government can't get it together enough can continue funding this. Let's talk a little bit about that.

And now, it's Iranian weapons are going to be used on the Ukrainian side.I think the other optics here really is how desperate the situation has become that, you know, NATO is effectively having to send Iranian weapons to Ukraine because it hasn't got enough of its own. We heard earlier this week from a senior member of NATO saying that staring at the battle of the battle of the weapons cache if you like, they're just running out of ammunition to send to Ukraine. So, it's a really desperate situation. And it has been very complicated, as Nada was suggesting the legality around this using these Iranian weapons and then sending them off to Ukraine. But it has been an interesting one. But as notices as well, it's not a game- changer. It's just useful weaponry for the Ukrainians right now.",

Behind the scenes, I wouldn't quite describe it as panic, but the only conversation is what on earth are we going to do if America stops sending money to Ukraine, because Europe is going to have to try to make up for it. But if you look at the finances, there's no way that they can. I don't think there's any answers right now.

This is the current radar, and you can see, lighter rain stretching across Arkansas, but it gets heavier the farther south you travel. Interstate 45, Interstate 20, running east and west of the heaviest, fell to the northeast near the Texarkana region. That's where the radar indicated totals were upwards of ten inches. There were some flash flood warnings. In fact, there is still one ongoing right now, impacting about 20,000 people, including a camp in Marion County region of northeast Texas. This is the storm system responsible. Remember, yesterday, we talk about a one-two punch of cold front. Here's the first one. There's the second one, that's a big game changer, right? That's going to be bring us our autumn weather. That we've been previewing for the past couple of days. It is advancing through the Midwest. It's got its eyes set on the Northeast.
