On the one hand, of course, he is trying to see what pressure the U.S. can bring to bear and what accommodations the Israelis can agree to in order to get to a ceasefire agreement that would also see the release of dozens of hostages, some of whose family members may have been among the demonstrators that the Secretary State went to meet with just moments ago.But of course, beyond that, we know that the CIA director is in Doha, Qatar, also pushing for a deal alongside his Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari counterparts as those negotiations continue. But of course, there is also this impending military operation in Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians are currently sheltering. And the Israelis are making quite clear that they are determined to go into Rafah, regardless of what the United States says. The Israeli prime minister has indicated a willingness to listen to U.S. alternatives. Sending a delegation of some of his top advisors to Washington next week. But at the same time, he's also making clear that no matter what the U.S. says, it's not going to sway him from what he views as a military imperative to go into Rafah. And in fact, after his meeting with the secretary of state, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, in a video statement that there is, \"No way for us to defeat Hamas without going into Rafah.\" And then he goes on to say that he told the secretary of state directly. I hope we will do it with the support of the USA. But if we have to, we will do it alone. Jim.",

Security Council voted today, vetoed by the Russians, the Chinese, and the Algerians. But the main action, frankly, is not in Jerusalem. I think it's in Doha.

And there's another thing we need to keep in mind, and I'm sure the administration is conscious of it.This is not just a question of Benjamin Netanyahu's preferences. We seem to think that he's the lone actor here. The fact is you've got the majority of the Israeli public and most Israeli politicians, certainly Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, who sit in the war cabinet. I think they too probably believe that the Israelis need to mount some sort of significant operation in order to deal with the last remaining elements of Hamas's organized military structure.
