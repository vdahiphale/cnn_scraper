CNN is, of course, on the scene and the Hawaii governor will join us live with all the latest developments. And the top prosecutor in the Hunter Biden probe is elevated to special counsel as the president's son now appears headed to trial. We are breaking down the legal implications and the political fallout. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I am Wolf Blitzer. You are in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get right to the breaking news coming out of the first hearing before the judge in the Trump election interference case. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is on the story for us. Jessica, first of all, tell us about this newly released protective order and what else happened in today's hearing.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. This was the first that we have seen of Judge Tanya Chutkan in this case. She took charge immediately. She did not give prosecutors that broad protective order that they wanted but she was firm with Trump and his team that they are not to disclose sensitive information, including material about the grand jury or search warrants. So, that is all what's part of this protective order that she issued just a little while ago.And during the hearing itself, she gave several warnings to Trump and his team, and she said this. She said, the fact that he is running a political campaign currently has to yield to the administration of justice. And if that means he cannot say exactly what he wants to say in a political speech, that is just how it is going to have to be. So, because of that, she says she's going to be carefully scrutinizing any statements from Trump and his team. She basically said that anything that could be interpreted as intimidating witnesses or prejudicial to potential jurors that could really threaten this entire judicial process in this case as we move toward trial. So, what is under these terms that prosecutors have in this protective order? Well, under the terms, they are prepared to begin handing over material today. And what that material includes is 11.6 million documents, it includes hundreds of recordings of witness interviews and it is those recordings part of which Trump is prohibited from disclosing publicly. So, Wolf, we will see how quickly this case could go to trial. The prosecution wants to start on January 2nd. Trump's legal team, starting next week, will propose their start date. It is likely that they will propose it after the 2024 election. But at the rate that Judge Chutkan is moving now, she will likely want to hue closer to the prosecution's proposed January date but we will see how this ultimately moves forward to a trial. Wolf?",

How do you think she's going to deal with all of this? KARL RACINE, FORMER D.C. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, I think she's been dealing with this entire case and exceptionally, well-reasoned, balanced manner. And what you saw today was a split decision. She did not give the government all that it wanted. The government actually sought to restrict the ability of Mr. Trump to analyze the evidence without his lawyers. She struck that down. She permits President Trump to access this evidence. It is really important that he has access to the evidence anytime he wants without a lawyer present, yet she is going to make sure that witness intimidation, obstruction of justice, or any interference with the administration of justice is not going to occur on her watch.",

It would not surprise me.And, again, we have no idea what he is going to do. We know the things that he says upset his lawyers. We know that that they are frustrating to his lawyers because they cannot control him. Donald Trump has a history of testing the boundaries. And so I think that you can see a scenario where he will continue to say provocative things online to see if the judge will turn away from it. There are other defendants, who, if they were in similar cases, obviously, there is no parallel to this with the former president, but other people who have been connected to January 6th related cases have not gotten as much leeway in certain aspects as Trump has. And so I think it is very likely he will test the bounds and then we will see what the judge does.",

Also the fact that as a criminal defendant, he will be required, if these trials go ahead before Election Day and after Election Day, will be the same thing. But he has to physically be present. He will not be able to be on the campaign trail for those days.These cases are consuming a lot of resources and a lot of time and he is facing a potential cash crunch. He is facing a likely prospect they want to stop start putting his own legal bills, at least to some extent. And he has said publicly he is willing to put in whatever campaign money he has to toward the actual political race. He did do that a bit in 2016, but commensurate with the overall amount he spent, it was relatively small. We will see what happens here.",

Lahaina was once the capital of the kingdom of Hawaii, going back to the ancient settlers. They knew that the cost of this paradise was living with wind and surf and occasional volcanic lava. But no one ever imagined a firestorm moving with such speed that it forced people into the ocean for refuge or some of them either passed away due to the waves, breathing in the water, or breathing in the smoke. And I think people are just now coming to grips with just how devastating this is. There is much fear that the casualty count, the fatality count, could get into the hundreds. Now, I've heard that sort of thing going back to the Florida Keys after Irma or Puerto Rico, even after Paradise. And a lot of people ended up being okay because the communication was just cut off.

So, 59 fatalities, that is up from 55 earlier today. That we can confirm. And it is heartbreaking, of course, the loss of life. The storm did come on extraordinarily fast with 80-mile-per-hour winds moving the fire. So, that's what happened. We have more than a thousand people that we are still connecting with. We are not searching for them, per se. We have several hundred homes that did burn, and those houses will be assessed in the coming days starting tomorrow morning with the FEMA team and the people that can tragically identify whether someone has perished in their home. These 59 fatalities that have occurred, as was reported earlier in this segment, did occur out on the streets or out on the open as people were trying to escape the fire. So, that is where we are numerically right now. There are a lot of things going on. We're really just into the third-and-a-half-day of this response. A lot of things are going on simultaneously. Mostly, what we are trying to do is get relief for the people and we opened up 15 minutes ago to allow people to travel back to their properties to go and assess them.

It is a product, in my estimation, of certainly global warming combined with drought, combined with a super storm, where we had a hurricane offshore several hundred miles, still generating large winds. As everyone knows, the islands are very prone to natural disasters, whether it is a volcanic eruption, which you guys have witnessed on many occasions, or a tsunami, or an earthquake, or in this case, a fire.",

And the telecommunications were destroyed very rapidly. That is why, normally, we would phone call one another and then through what's often called the Coconut Wireless, where everyone speaks to everyone else in their community, we would know right away that there was danger. That communication was cut off by the destruction of essentially 1,000-degree heat that was coming down the mountain. That is not again to make any excuse for anyone. And we're going to check and be very safe and sure that we did what we could. But I have to tell you, this was a very fluid situation across the islands with the storm. We were unable to get helicopters up in the air, for example, to drop water that night because you cannot fly helicopters with gusts of 89-mile-per-hour winds. You will crash your helicopters and kill your pilots. So, these were the considerations and the consideration that occurred in the island setting on the backend of a hurricane. But we will do all that we can to find out how to protect our people more going forward. It's just we have not seen populations like this in the last 30, 40, 50 years ever threatened in an era of global warming, and that's a concern.",

They went to court, the judge overseeing the case had some questions, had some pushback on the plea deal. There have been talks between the parties. But at this point, according to court filings, it appears that this case is headed to trial. Now, I want to read a statement from one of Hunter Biden's lawyers, Chris Clark. He says that it is hard to see why Weiss would have proposed such a resolution, the plea deal, if there were other offenses that he could have successfully prosecuted. And we are aware of none.

Yes, Ukraine says it's still on the front line moving forward, some good news in the southern offensive, they say that they are making important but small gains around the town of Robatinia (ph), but also the previous nights have been tough. We've seen awful video from Zaporizhzhia where there was a children's playground hit by two ballistic missiles, but also, again, this night sirens in Kyiv and news emerging that attacks in the west may have been focused upon a training center, say Ukrainian officials, for pilots for the F-16 program. Remember, it's so vital for Ukraine to have some element of fight in the skies, their air force depleted over this war, and Russia experiencing air superiority amongst a lot of the front line that we've seen in the south. That makes it very hard for Ukraine to keep pushing forward. And the suggestion really is that these ballistic missile attacks were essentially one or four hypersonic missiles were intercepted by Ukraine, that they're aimed at slowing this advance in Ukrainian forces.
