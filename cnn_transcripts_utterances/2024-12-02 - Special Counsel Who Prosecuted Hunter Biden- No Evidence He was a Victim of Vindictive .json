      "sentences": "Some new details now on President Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter. We're told that by doing so, the President bypassed the Justice Department, even though he relied on the agency for every other act of clemency. Biden made the announcement yesterday, going back on a big promise that he made not to do it. And it means that Hunter will no longer be sentenced later this month on federal tax and gun convictions. And it spares him from any chance of going to prison, which was certainly a possibility. It also grants Hunter Biden clemency from other federal crimes that he may have committed during a 10-year period.In a statement, Biden explained: \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he's my son - and that is wrong.\" Here with us now, we have CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, was this a surprise? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: No, absolutely not. I've been covering Hunter Biden's legal issues for several years now, and there was no way that President Joe Biden was going to allow his only living son to go to federal prison for cases that Biden believes are, quote, \"selective and unfair.\" I was there for every day of Hunter Biden's Delaware case. Rows and rows of that courtroom were filled with Biden family members, including the First Lady. It was clear that they were there to support him. They felt that the case was unfair. And his lawyers thought there was a chance they could convince the jury of that as well. We spoke to at least one juror who did ultimately convict Hunter. They said that they believe the case was, quote, \"A waste of taxpayer money,\" but the prosecutors proved it beyond a reasonable doubt. But, of course, Hunter faced a second case in Los Angeles. And just hours before that trial was supposed to start, he entered a sort of unusual plea deal where he pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced. He was looking at a possible sentence of up to 17 years in prison, hefty fines surpassing a million dollars. You don't enter a plea deal like that unless you are confident you are going to get some form of clemency. So this is only surprising to people who have not been paying attention to the facts of this case and the support Hunter has received from his family.",

But Donald Trump and his team are seizing on this opportunity to kind of hammer home this idea that President Joe Biden said over and over again that he would not pardon his son, Hunter, that he would not get involved in this process. And then, of course, obviously, what we saw over the weekend transpired.Now, Donald Trump is trying to link this in some way to those rioters on January 6th. This is what he posted: \"Does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.\" Unclear there if he's talking about the abuse and miscarriage of justice being the pardoning of Hunter or the people who are currently in jail for what they did on January 6th. But one thing to note here, it seems as though Donald Trump is going to try to use this pardoning as an excuse for whatever he does with those people who participated in January 6th. One thing to note, they are not hostages. The people who are in jail were people who were prosecuted to the law because of their actions. However, Donald Trump has long promised that this was something he was going to do in terms of pardoning these people who participated in January 6th. So it's unsurprising if he actually does it. We're still trying to get details on what that looks like. But now it seems as though he's kind of saying tit for tat, which is not exactly what we had heard originally.",

They would appoint an agency review team. And that would be the team on the ground that kind of worked to make sure there was a smooth transition. As of now, the State Department is saying essentially they don't even know, they don't believe that they've appointed this agency review team. And if they have, the agency review team has not reached out to the State Department. It's not that surprising, given what we have seen across the federal government, across the administration. They took forever to sign this document in the first place and we have seen over and over again, essentially this kind of disregard for the traditional transition process.

I said many times that if Hunter Biden were not Hunter Biden, he would never be charged with these crimes.And when you start to see what Donald Trump is planning to do with his Department of Justice and with his FBI and the degree to which Hunter Biden has already been shamelessly attacked as a private citizen by Republicans, I certainly understand why the President felt like this miscarriage of justice should not carry forward and that he should not be at risk of retributive prosecution for political reasons, which is not the proper way to execute our rule of law.",

And that is not who we should have leading what should be a nonpartisan, apolitical FBI that has a 10-year term for a reason so that it is not in line with the political process.

We had an entire subcommittee for two years on this, and they didn't show one example where there was any weaponization. This is projection and it is a distraction. The reality is that Donald Trump tried to 10 times or more weaponize the Department of Justice in his first administration, and he is now putting loyalists in the critical positions at the Department of Justice who will absolutely weaponize it even more. So the risk we have is under a Trump presidency that of the Department of Justice being weaponized, not at all under a Biden administration.
