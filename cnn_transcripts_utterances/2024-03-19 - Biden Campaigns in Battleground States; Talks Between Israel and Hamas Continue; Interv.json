I will speak to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Mike McCaul. And we're following reaction to Trump's claim that any Jewish person here in the United States who votes for Democrats -- quote -- \"hates their religion and everything about Israel.\" Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. We begin in Miami. Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro is set to make history when he reports to federal prison in Miami in just a matter of minutes. The 74-year-old will be serving time for refusing to turn over documents or testify before the January 6 Select Committee investigators. He will become the first former White House official to ever be jailed for contempt of Congress. CNN's Randi Kaye is on the scene for us in Miami. Randi, I understand Navarro will be speaking to reporters any minute as he gets ready to walk into that prison. Any idea what he will say?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf.We are here in a parking lot just down the road from the prison, folks here behind me, of course, setting up for this news conference. We expect that he will express some anger about how all of this went down and some frustration, for sure. As you know, he had asked the Supreme Court to intervene. He wanted to remain free while he challenged his conviction, and they rejected that request. But we can tell you a little bit from his prison consultant, who has been speaking with CNN. Yes, he does have a prison consultant who has been helping him sort of transition to what life will be like on the inside. And we can tell you from that prison consultant, Sam Mangel, he has told CNN that Navarro will spend about four months likely in an air- conditioned unit for elderly male inmates. He's 74 years old. There will be bunk beds. There will be about 80 men in that dormitory. He will have to take classes. He will have to get a job inside that prison. The consultant said he's been urging him to work as a library clerk, so he can avoid the warmer temperatures, Wolf, on the outside here in Florida. And on the inside, he will be able to use e-mail. He will be able to make phone calls. He will be able to watch television. We understand there are about 12 television sets in that area of the prison where he will be. And some of them are in Spanish and some of them are in English. And the consultant also told CNN that he actually has two other clients. One is a doctor. One is engaged in politics. And they are both going to help Peter Navarro acclimate, if you will, to prison life. But just a little bit about him, we know that he was convicted in September for not complying with this subpoena to share documents and testify before the House select committee which was looking into the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He did file that emergency request, as I mentioned, with the U.S. Supreme Court, which was rejected. And he now is about to become the first former White House official to actually go behind bars to serve time in prison for contempt of Congress. We know that he was sentenced to four months, Wolf, but his prison consultant tells CNN that it's likely he will only serve about 90 days of that time, depending on how things go, because there are laws in place that allow for early release of federal inmates, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is the first time that these two retired generals will be testifying publicly on Capitol Hill since they left their posts.And I think one of the really big questions going into this hearing is whether they are going to go further than they had previously in their descriptions of the recommendations they made to the president over the Afghanistan withdrawal and further in their criticisms of how the withdrawal played out, because they are civilians now. They are no longer in government. So whether that gives them a little bit more freedom to discuss that very chaotic exit from Afghanistan in 2021 really remains to be seen. We know that the State Department in its after-action review of the U.S. withdrawal said that the decision of both President Trump and President Biden to end the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan had serious consequences for the viability of the Afghan government and its security. The State Department was pretty scathing here in just how this withdrawal played out and the fact that the Biden administration, in making that decision to leave, actually destabilized the Afghan government because it made the Afghan government believe that they were no longer going to have that support from U.S. troops in the country. So, Mark Milley, who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he has said publicly that he believes it was a strategic failure by the United States to essentially allow the Taliban to take over the entire country, to take over Kabul in 2021. He has said that he believes that the evacuation of U.S. personnel of Afghan allies should have been done and begun much sooner. And General Frank McKenzie, who was the CENTCOM commander at the time, he has said that he recommended to President Biden that roughly 2,500 American service members stay in Afghanistan in order to kind of have that stabilizing presence there. The Biden administration has said repeatedly, in their defense, that if they had kept the troops there, they would have been attacked by the Taliban because of the decision by the Trump administration to strike this deal with the Taliban to leave by May of 2021. And so they basically have said their hands were tied. We will see what McKenzie and Milley say today in the hearing, but it should be eye-opening, because, as I said, they do have a little bit more freedom now that they are not in government, Wolf.",

He is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that will hold this hearing later today. Chairman, thank you so much for joining us. Specifically, what answers are you looking for from General Milley and General McKenzie today? REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX):  Why did this go so wrong? I think they're going to set the record straight. They're free to tell their story now. They're not -- no longer within the Department of Defense. These are the two top generals who oversaw the evacuation. They will say there was no plan for evacuation. And if you don't have a plan, you plan to fail. That's exactly what happened in Afghanistan. I think all roads lead to the State Department and the White House, and I think that's what you're going to hear from these two commanding officers today.",

They didn't do that until Kabul was actually falling and the embassy was being evacuated. That led to the chaos, the drama. It also led to the Abbey Gate bombing, the suicide bomber that killed 13 service members. Many of the families, by the way, Wolf, will be present at this hearing today. And I can tell you they are not happy with this president.

Imagine the embassy in Kabul as it's getting ready to fall and the Taliban's moving in. We had 23 employees, an extraordinary number, crying for help, essentially:  We need to get out of here. It's going to get overrun by the Taliban. We need to remove employees and the documents and destroy classified documents, which, by the way, were not all destroyed. [11:10:17] And then, secondly, the notes to the after-action reports were not produced. And a second time going through contempt proceedings, we got those documents. I have to say, Wolf, we're sorting through the classified and unclassified. But needless to say it's very revealing about what was happening on the ground at the time, a very consistent narrative of chaos, no plan, no direction from the White House, then leading to the Abbey Gate suicide bombing.",

I don't prejudge facts until they come in. But somebody has to be held accountable for this. Somebody has to say, I'm sorry for your child being killed at Abbey Gate. And that really hasn't happened. And so I do think this will lead to accountability. It should. But the fact of the matter is, the commanding officers on the ground at that time were all promoted. There was no accountability within the DOD. In fact, also, Wolf, after the sniper testified that he had the suicide bomber in his sights and requested permission to engage him, he got no response from his commanding officer. That is a case where there's no accountability present. The DOD has yet to produce any of the documents that the chairman of Armed Services and myself have requested, including the sniper photos, which would confirm if this was indeed the suicide bomber. We also need to hear from the commanding officers on the ground that made these decisions, or lack thereof, in terms of dealing with ISIS-K and suicide bombers.",

You can do that in a very -- from a special operator standpoint. And I believe and I certainly -- I hope that's what Israel is contemplating, is to target these high-value targets of Hamas in Rafah. They're not going to stop until Hamas is eradicated, and they will not stop during Ramadan.

And he still had to appear before Congress and turn over documents. And he did not. Now, there was a period of time long ago when Congress did lock people up on their own whenever officials didn't respond to their subpoenas. We aren't in that era anymore. And it is very difficult for the Justice Department to decide they want to bring a case like this and take it through the courts. But what happened here is, he just didn't have this executive privilege bubble as protection. And the court system said, this is a prosecution that the Justice Department can bring. At the end of the day, it's good for Congress that they can have enforcement like this. Peter Navarro says it's very bad for the executive branch.
