      "sentences": "Good morning. I'm Erica Hill. It is a very busy Tuesday at this hour.We are officially now two weeks away from the midterms. A major focus on the Senate battle in Pennsylvania today, one of the most critical races this cycle. Tonight, Republican Mehmet Oz and Democrat John Fetterman will face off for their first and only debate. And we are on the ground in Harrisburg. Overnight in Florida, incumbent Republican Governor Ron DeSantis going toe to toe with his Democratic challenger Charlie Crist. The two sparring on a number of topics. We'll discuss with Charlie Crist in our next hour. Plus, new this morning, Adidas officially severing ties with Kanye West following a rash of offensive and anti-Semitic comments. What could it mean for the brand, for West and why did it take so long? We begin, though, with this news just in to CNN. A Moscow regional court upholding the drug smuggling conviction of American basketball star Brittney Griner. She was sentenced, of course, to nine years behind bars in Russia. CNN's Kylie Atwood is live at the State Department for us this morning. So, Kylie, what more are we hearing about what this could mean in terms of challenges for her with this sentence?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, as you said, the court upheld the verdict, which means that Brittney Griner has still been found guilty of smuggling drugs into Russia. That was largely expected. We didn't think that the verdict was going to be impacted here.But when it comes to her sentence, her sentence has been slightly reduced. It's a nine year sentence originally and what the court determined today was that the time that she has spent in pre-trial detention, each day is going to count towards one and a half days of her prison sentence. So that essentially reduces a few months off. But what we are finding is that this isn't really surprising. Russia wasn't really expected to come out and really change the verdict here or all together change their position that Brittney Griner has been found guilty. And Brittney Griner was actually someone who spoke during this hearing today. I do want to tell you what she said via video link. She wasn't there in-person. She said, quote, yes, I pleaded guilty. I do not -- I did not intend to do this. But I understand the charge against me and I hope that this will be taken into account. She also said, quote, it's been very, very stressful and very traumatic to my mental and physhic state and to my family, who haven't been able to communicate. Of course, Brittney Griner has been saying over the past few weeks through her lawyers that this has been a really challenging time for her. She's worried about not being able to come home. And we should note that this trial today effectively ends the legal proceedings. And so now the onus is on the Biden administration, the diplomats, to try and pull off some sort of diplomatic deal, some sort of trade potentially, a prisoner swap, to try and get Brittney Griner home. Now, we're also hearing from the White House this morning with the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, coming out saying they are aware of this news. They are calling on Russia to immediately release Griner, and also saying this, quote, President Biden has been very clear that Brittney Griner should be released immediately, and, in recent weeks the Biden/Harris administration has continued to engage with Russia through every available channel and make every effort to bring home Brittney, as well as to support and advocate for other Americans detained in Russia, including fellow wrongful detainee Paul Whelan. Of course, the Biden administration working behind the scenes with Russia to try and secure some sort of deal. They say that there has been a pretty regular pace in terms of back and forth to try and produce a deal to get her out. But what they have continued to say is that Russia has not engaged in a really substantive way to try and bring an end to getting her and Paul Whelan home. Guys.",

      "sentences": "That's right, the sparring back and forth, Erica. This is such a dynamic race that holds so much value for both Republicans and Democrats. It's an open seat here in Pennsylvania. Democrats wanting to flip it to their side. Republicans wanting to hold on to this seat. So you can imagine just how much attention, how much money has been spent here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.So we have John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor, Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee there, and new polling from CNN showing it's a tight race. Fetterman leading 51 percent to 46 percent going into tonight's debate. Also interesting what our polling showed when we took a look talking to likely voters about what was the most important issues for them. And if you take a look at what they responded with, the economy, far and away, their biggest concern. What they're most focused on followed by abortion and voting rights and elections, the security of elections. So, that's kind of the dynamic at play as we head into this evening. Here's what we can expect. You'll remember that Fetterman is recovering from a stroke that he suffered just days before the May primary. He has been very open about suffering from auditory processing issues which means he's been using closed captioning in public formats to be able to kind of understand what someone's saying and then respond to it. We saw him do that at an event over the weekend with Senator Amy Klobuchar. A pretty public test run of how tonight will go because he's going to be using that closed captioning technology in this debate with Mehmet Oz. We've also seen Fetterman's surrogates' kind of lowering expectations. We saw Klobuchar even saying, you know, he's not that great of a debater. He's really more about the issues, that sort of thing. And then, of course, you compare that with Mehmet Oz, who spent years and years on television talking to people at home, being an on air TV talent. So, that's kind of what we're looking at as we head into tonight. And both men, of course, seeking to get any edge in this race that they possibly can. This is an ever tightening race here in Pennsylvania. I've laid out why it's so important for both sides of the aisle to capture this seat. And so what they're trying to do is really edge out any -- get any edge they can, Erica. We have found some undecided voters here on the ground. We've talked to them. They kind of seem like unicorns, but they do exist and these two campaigns trying to swing either of them to their side with this debate tonight.",

But you're running for governor. You're running for governor. And I have a question for you. You're running for governor.

You know, it's hard to imagine other businesses are going to want to do -- partner with him. And so the question is, where does he go? And the only business that's welcoming him with open arms right now is Parler, and that's this social media platform which is a hot bed for right wing extremism.
