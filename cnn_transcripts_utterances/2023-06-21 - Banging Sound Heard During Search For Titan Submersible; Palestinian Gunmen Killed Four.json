It's unclear though for how long and when it was heard again, hours later, more sonar devices were deployed. They've also heard other sounds which were not described as banging. Well, there is now renewed hope time is running out, with the crew estimated to have less than 30 hours of oxygen. This up owned by the underwater exploration company OceanGate disappeared Sunday on its descent to two of the wreckage of the Titanic, almost 400 nautical miles southeast of Newfoundland, Canada. The wreck sits in two pieces at the bottom of the ocean more than two miles or four kilometers below the surface. As many as eight vessels from the United States, Canada, France had been sent to assist in the search, which is happening from the air, on the ocean surface as well, as beneath the water. We have more now in those efforts with CNN's Miguel Marquez reporting in from Newfoundland. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: This is a complex search.

For more, let's go live now to CNN's Vedika Sud in New Delhi.What more do you know about the number of people who've perished in the heat wave and just how bad has it been? VEDIKA SUD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's been pretty bad, John. At least 100 people dead in two of India's most populous states in Northern India, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Let me start with Bihar. According to state officials there, the number stands at 40 plus for now. There could be an increase in the death toll. The heat in June is quite bad here in India, especially Northern India, where the temperatures soar to as high as 46 degrees Celsius. That was what it was in parts of Eastern and Northern India last week. Now, let's talk about Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India. It is governed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Now, there have been more than 60 deaths in one district itself in the state of Uttar Pradesh. And (UNINTELLIGIBLE) have been raised over the reasons behind it. There are concerns that the state government is really not coming clear on the reason behind it. Initially, it was said by health officials in the district that these deaths were purely due to the heat wave that the district is facing. But very soon, it was (ph) shouted out to another district in Uttar state by government officials, and the other health officials after have been saying there could be various reasons for the deaths that they have seen in Ballia district in Uttar Pradesh. Now, what's clear is that the temperatures have been very high, but what we also know from eyewitness accounts is that there's been a massive surge in the number of patients coming into one district hospital in Ballia. According to eyewitness accounts, the staff out there is overstretched. There are too many people coming in. However, CNN cannot verify if all these patients coming into that district hospital are purely due to heat-wave-related issues, medical issues. What's also clear is that India has been seeing extreme climates for the last few years. Take February this year, John. In February, which is supposed to be a cool month, given it's still winter -- although the winter is tailing off in the country -- in Northern India, the temperatures were higher than it's ever been in the last century. The last time India saw temperatures as high as they did in Feb. was in 1901. So clearly, there have been too many incidents due to climate change that India has been seeing, and they will continue, and that's the fear. The central government, health minister of India did hold a meeting yesterday, where he's been taking stock of the situation. He's promised that there will be action on the ground, but for now, the death toll stands at more than 100 in just two states in Northern India -- John.",

Earlier research showed frequent or excessive napping was associated with high blood pressure and Alzheimer's.
