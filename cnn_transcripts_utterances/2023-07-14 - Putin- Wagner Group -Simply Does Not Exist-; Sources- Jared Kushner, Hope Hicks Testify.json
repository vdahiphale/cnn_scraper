MIKE LYONS (RET), U.S. ARMY: Yes, a lot of fiction going on in Russia these days. It's kind of maybe its opposite day because it's exactly the opposite. I mean, to say the Wagner group doesn't exist or hasn't existed is just not --- doesn't make any sense. There's reports this morning of them training in Belarus already those some of the potato soldiers that they have there in those places. Vladimir Putin is definitely trying to consolidate power, though. But he also knows that Prigozhin is a strong charismatic figure, has a group that follows him, and can't put him in jail. I think that he's someone in a box with him. He's not getting rid of the Wagner group. They project power in Africa and other places around the world that it would be too difficult for him to try to recreate a private military company. So, that's a lot of fiction I think coming out today.",

Sources say this is what federal prosecutors want to know.

Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. It's great to see you, Renato. Thank you so much for being here. Let's talk about this. What do you think of this line of questioning in this -- in the -- in this special counsel investigation into 2020? As the New York Times put it, they asked whether Mr. Trump had privately acknowledged in the days after the 2020 election that he had lost.

You know Trump can't take the witness stand himself unless he wants to be subjected to weathering cross-examination. He has a right to remain silent.But what he might do is try to put on other witnesses who could try to make his defense. And his defense is going to be that he genuinely believed that he won. That all of these fake elector schemes and other methods to try to obstruct the proceedings in January 6 were because he believed he was being cheated out of legitimate land. So, what they're trying to show and I think a lot of the viewers probably saw a preview of this during the January 6 hearings, is that they want to lock in the fact that all of these witnesses around Trump, people who are pro-Trump, his own family, advisors, were telling him that he had legitimately lost the election.",

They're going to have their own defenses. They may be silly, they may not be the strongest arguments, but they'll have their own argument. They're going to want to review every page of documents.
