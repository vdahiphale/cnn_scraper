And his handpicked candidates, in the 2022 midterms, all lost. But I think you're going to have to differentiate yourself, more than just an electability argument, for Trump voters, to want to switch over to you. And it is going to be interesting, to see how DeSantis will define himself. I think one place that he has done an effective way, of doing that, is with COVID. He's tried to say, \"Hey, look, Trump didn't\" -- like \"was for locking down the country.

And the Republican caucus can't even potentially stay together, to make sure we don't default on our debt. So, I don't think it's the left that is really the problem. I think what DeSantis is actually doing is pretty interesting, is there's a long way to go in this Republican primary. And I think he just really wants to stay alive. I don't know if he even thinks he can get number one, in Iowa. But he's like -- Iowans are used to kind of going against the status quo. In 2008, they picked Barack Obama. In 2020, they picked Pete Buttigieg, on the Democratic side. In 2016, they picked Donald Trump, who at that point was not part of the Washington establishment. And so, I think he's thinking, \"Let me see if I can get number two, in Iowa.\" Then, we move on to New Hampshire, and maybe somebody else beat -- wins in New Hampshire, maybe a Chris Sununu, if he gets in the race.

Never Back Down is out there, right alongside, his campaign volunteers, speaking to voters, registering voters, engaging with voters. So, he has that. The only thing that I think that maybe is a miscalculation, from my conversations, with Democratic voters, and Independent voters, moderate Democrats, is he makes this argument that Trump has a ceiling, and that he has more appeal, with this slice of the electorate, that he can appeal to, to more Independents than Trump can.

As someone, who has spent over a decade, in professional accounting, I wanted to share some numbers, with you. The current deal, what we have is, reducing our spending by $1.5 trillion, over 10 years. We have shortfall just this year, in addition to all of the debts, $1.5 trillion. So, we're not even getting to pre-COVID numbers adjusted for inflation with our discretionary spending. With our mandatory spending, we're not even touching almost nothing, in the ton of fraud and abuse. And we don't even have a conversation, how we can resolve this fiscal insanity. I look at Government Accountability report, audited financials. 50 percent are not audited. Almost $250 billion of money was not in proper payments. And we're not dealing with anything like that. So, I'm very disappointed that we cannot have a serious conversation, about the future of our country. And I always say, like great run with a great artist. Michelangelo said the biggest danger for most of us is not that we set our expectations too high, and achieve them, but actually too low and reach them.

His force is doing very badly, in Ukraine. He's escalated the attacks, on Ukrainian cities, already. If he could do more, he would. And I think his messaging here is really about trying to reassure the Russian public, who have got to be freaking out that there are actually attacks happening, inside Russia, now, something that they had not seen before.

And now that they see something inside Russia, I think it adds to that confusion. But one thing I want to come back to what Jim Sciutto said, which is making an assumption that Ukraine was targeting civilian targets. We don't know that. We don't know what the targets were, because all of the drones that were fired, were shot down by Russia. We don't know where they were going. It could have been military targets. We don't know. We also don't know where they were fired from, or who did it. And so, I think we all have to assume that Ukraine would have facilitated this, in some way. But there's a lot we don't know.

They probably could not have done that without some kind of tacit Ukrainian support. But, at the same time, it wasn't Ukrainians doing it. Wasn't Ukraine conducting the attacks. As far as the drones go? We don't know where they're fired from. And I think that's significant, because it's a long way, from the Ukrainian border, to Moscow, with a lot of air defenses, along the way. So, for these drones to get there, it indicates to me they probably weren't fired from Ukraine, but somewhere inside Russia. Even then, we don't know who did it. It could be Ukrainian Special Forces.
