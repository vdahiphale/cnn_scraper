But on the other hand, last night once again illustrated that his colleagues are getting deeply frustrated with these tactics and they're making some pretty stark warnings.Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you do not believe these holds are having an effect on the military, I don't question your sincerity, I question your judgment. This will be the last holiday this happens. If it takes me to vote to break loose these folks, I will. SEN. TODD YOUNG (R-IN): This is personal to me. This is personal to this United States senator. SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): All you have to do is suspend, your godless, lawless, abortion travel policy. You're blaming him for our supposed lack of military readiness. I can't believe anybody buys this crap. I really can't. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because if you remember, Kate, Republicans had sort of a closed-door family meeting to discuss this issues specifically, and Tuberville was presented a number of options. Tuberville said he was still thinking about those options. One of the top options on the table right now is this idea of filing a lawsuit. Essentially you would have the House of Representatives file a lawsuit against the Department of Defense to end this policy. And I am told that Jay Sekulow, who Senator Lindsey Graham has argued would be good at representing the House in that kind of lawsuit, actually talked to Senator Tuberville earlier this week, telling him that he thought that this was a strong pathway forward. But, again, it's just not clear Senator Tuberville is going to take the offer of trying to find a way forward. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are threatening to bring a rules change to the floor that would allow the Senate to move these military nominations in a mass vote. But, again, it's not clear that they would have nine Republicans needed to pass that rules change right now. Kate.",

This happened off school grounds near Rancho High School. All of the students are -- are believed to have been students there. Where this group of people, and it's been video that has been all over social media, attacked and jumped Jonathan Lewis. They're punching him, kicking him, beating him. And he's not defending himself. A good Samaritan saw him there in this alley and took him back to the school where they took him to the hospital and he died six days later. And just listening to his father describe what kind of individual Jonathan Lewis was, he's saying that he was a loving, caring person and that he was looking out for one of his smaller friend, who was being bullied at the school. All of this, according to law enforcement sources, is because of a stolen vape pen perhaps and some stolen wireless headphones. Unbelievably tragic story, Kate.",
