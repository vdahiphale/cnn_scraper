And I think they do not want to escalate into a full-face confrontation with the United States. They expect the United States to hit back. I think they're happy that the United States has not hit Iran.That it has hit specific targets that it has associated with particular actions of these militias and I think the Iranians have at least put out in their own newspapers and media that no Iranians were killed, no Iranians were there. The buildings were empty, which means that they're not claiming any casualties that requires escalation. So I would anticipate that the Houthis and the Iraqi militias will have to show some kind of a reaction but it would not be at the level that would escalate this conflict, and that depends on what the United States does next.",

I think the broad strategy here is to attack the United States, attack Israel, consolidate the strategic gains that they made on October 7th and continue to make. Make sure that the guerrillas win and the conventional Israeli army loses as you mentioned in your introduction.But I don't think that every decision is made in Tehran. And it only takes something big like the killing of the three American soldiers that might lead to essentially that kind of command and control. And there have been 160 attacks made on U.S. targets. More than that as time that we're speaking and I don't think everyone of this is managed out of Tehran. I think Iran has given the broad support that this is the time to put pressure on U.S. and Israel but I don't think they managed them as tightly as we're assuming.",

They have no love for these militias that often stir up trouble for the Saudis, the Houthis in Yemen have been a sworn enemy. And yet, I was in the region 10 days ago, they really don't want a wider war, right. So which is -- which is dominated right now, the desire to purge Iran in a sense or the desire to not let this spread into something wider?MINA AL-ORAIBI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE NATIONAL: I would say the primary priority at the moment is not to let it spread further. The Gulf requires stability, always wants to see a de-escalate. Absolutely there are huge concerns about these militias. Let's not forget that the Houthis attacked both the UAE and Saudi Arabia before they were attacking ships in the Red Sea. There is a sense that a limit has to be put on these militias. Jordan and the attack that the three American soldiers were killed in was on Jordan. That was the first time that you have these militias targeting Jordan so directly. And so there is a concern this is going to get out of control. But the key concern in the Gulf at the moment is getting a cease-fire in Gaza which will take away some of the excuses that these groups are using to escalate further. And the second, to see a serious American strategy on how to deal with these militias. Again these militias have been getting stronger and stronger for at least the last 15 years. And part of it has been because of the U.S. turning a blind eye, seeing that they can live with them as long as their own troops are not targeted and yet we see them escalating year on year.",

All of them backed and financed by Iran. What is the best strategy? David Sanger in \"The New York Times\" today has an analysis piece which I thought was very interesting where he says hitting Iran hard has not proved to deter them. He pointed out that the assassination of Soleimani, the Iranian commander, did not really deter Iran as we can see now. But that sometimes negotiating with them has had some at least temporary effect on pausing Iranian activities. How do you think the U.S. should be handling this issue of getting these militias to cease and desist?",

      "sentences": "Mina, what do you think that the Gulf Arabs, the United Arab Emirates, the Saudis, the Bahrainis would want? Because again, you know, they don't have this dilemma which is they don't like Iran. But the Iranians are not taking advantage of the Palestinian issue and the Gaza war and are seen, I think, as much more of the champions of that cause. The Gulf Arabs are largely silent. There have been some condemnation but it's Houthis who are launching missiles. It's Hezbollah that are throwing missiles. And they claim on behalf of the Palestinian cause.AL-ORAIBI: Well, I mean, Hezbollah and the Houthis want that -- and the militias in Iraq walk want that to be the narrative. That actually the way you support the Palestinians is by launching missiles here and there. Rather than having a concerted effort to get the recognition of the Palestinian state which is actually what the Arab League, what Saudi Arabia, what the UAE and others are working towards. So I think it's really important in the framing to think what success is and what we want and ultimately there has to be a Palestinian state that would end a lot of what we're seeing now. The United States, Fareed, you began the program by saying that the United States wants to get out of the Middle East. The reality is that the United States is in the Middle East and gets involved to prolong certain wars or conflicts without ending them or taking a final solution on them. So we'll give an example. When it comes to Israel and Palestine, without the American veto there would have likely been a call from the U.N. for a cease-fire that would have been binding and yet it's the United States that uses the veto so it is involved. Likewise, when we look at the Houthis, one of the first measures that the Biden administration did was to remove the Houthis from the terrorist designation that they have for the tax cut they had done in the region, and therefore gave this impression that it's OK for them to continue. And the list goes on. The U.S. is involved enough. Ultimately, to weaken these militias, you need nation states that function. Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, their weakness has allowed for Iran to extend its power and its influence. One of key things Iran has wanted to be able to create in the region is to have a land border and control running from Iran all the way to Hezbollah. So cutting through Iraq, cutting through Syria, and into Lebanon. And so it has worked for years on this and continues to wield influence. What we're seeing on the ground, but also in the last two days, you've seen the militia leaders appear in Baghdad to say we are still here. (INAUDIBLE), who was the brigade that was targeted by the Americans in their strikes on Iraq most recently, was there in public being seen in hospital to say I could walk about without -- with impunity, with full impunity in Iraq. If you had a strong nation state that holds to account militia leaders then we would be having a different conversation rather than waiting for air strikes that really don't bring a solution on their own. It's hard work that you need stronger states.",

In the 1990s and 2000s, when people crossed the border, they were coming knowingly and intentionally illegally. These were young men typically in their early 20s, typically from Mexico or Central America, and they walked across the border and they tried to avoid contact with law enforcement, and then slip into the job market in ways -- without coming into any contact with any kind of official.So, enforcement was the answer for illegal immigration. That is not what is happening now. What is happening now is you have the minors, people under 18, or family groups coming, and they are seeking contact with the law because they want to enter the asylum system where the law is on their side. Anyway, the law is on their side. They get to stay in the country pending a hearing which can take years, decades. So, back in the 1990s and 2000s, you can say, yes, enforce the rules against illegal immigration. But with asylum-seekers, the rules are on the asylum seeker's side. You have to change the rules. And we're talking here about international treaties. We're talking about statutes. But above all, about judicial precedence. If you want to change those, you need acts of Congress.",

Like your religion or your race. But people are coming to the United States and saying, back in -- where I'm from there is a lot of violence, there's a lot of crime, there's a lot of domestic abuse, and I've walk through three, four, eight, 10, 12 countries on my way to get to this one. So, the bills that are being negotiated in the Senate would say, no, those are not good enough reasons.

So, what we are really betting on is what does a Chinese state prepared to do to promote greater efficiency, greater dynamism in their economy? If they could do that then, I think, they could still grow at four maybe even more than four percent a year for the next 20 years and that would still be double America's rate.
