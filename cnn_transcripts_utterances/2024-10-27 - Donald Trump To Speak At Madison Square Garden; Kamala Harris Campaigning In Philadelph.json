Over 40 million ballots have been cast with early voting underway in many states across our nation. That includes battleground Georgia and North Carolina, which have both seen record turnout so far, as well as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Happening right now in New York City, a rally at Madison Square Garden for former President Trump. You see there, Elise Stefanik. He will also be joined by running mate, J.D. Vance, one-time presidential hopeful RFK Jr. Again, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who's going to join us a little bit later on this show, and billionaire Elon Musk. Vice President Harris is in Philadelphia getting out the vote in some more intimate settings, meeting people in a church, a barbershop, and a bookstore. Her running mate, Tim Walz, is in Las Vegas. In the week ahead, Harris will head back to Michigan, North Carolina, and Nevada. Walz has stops scheduled in Wisconsin and Georgia. As you can imagine, it's an all hands on deck moment as the race for the White House remains a toss-up. CNN's poll of polls showing it is just simply too close to call. And for more, we go to CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's with the Trump campaign at Madison Square Garden. Kristen, a huge turnout there. This is a homecoming of sorts for Trump, a rally in his hometown with his name in the bright lights of the MSG marquee. Tell us more about why he's picking this venue and what their strategy is here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Just that they've been wanting to do this now for several months. They're referring to it as Donald Trump playing the Garden, which is how you generally refer to someone who play at Madison Square Garden. They were trying to get this booked. They didn't think it was going to work out because of the fact that New York is such a political place, liberal leaning political place, and also just the dates and time of it, but here we are.Now you have to remember one thing. Donald Trump's team really doesn't believe at the end of the day it matters entirely where he is. So we are in the deep blue state of New York. They believe this is a national media episode. And people are going to be taking this across national media platforms as we are, as well as the biggest media market in the world. So they are trying to reach those people as well. For Donald Trump, this is, as you said, somewhat of a homecoming. So despite the fact that he's not in a swing state, something that's incredibly important to him. The other thing to keep in mind here is how much money they're actually raising from this event. They've been selling packages in order to get people to take pictures with Donald Trump. They sold the suites here. There's VIP access to the former president. They're actually treating this essentially like a second RNC. You see the list of speakers that's very similar to what we saw at the RNC and a kickoff as we get into this final week of campaigning ahead of the actual election. Now, if you're curious as to what some of the people here who are listening to, it's pretty vitriolic. We have heard somebody say that Kamala Harris is the devil. Another person say the anti-Christ. One person referred to Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage. So it gives you a little bit of an idea of what the tone is here in Madison Square Garden. Donald Trump, again, expected to speak roughly within the next hour. We'll see if he holds to that timing, but we wait and see what his closing message is as he kicks off the final week of this campaign before election day.",

Now, if you ask any Republican operatives who actually work in the state or even if some of his senior advisors, they say that's not happening. But what they do hope is going to happen is that there is some enthusiasm from Republicans that drives them out to the polls from the former president that might help with some of those New York House seats that are particularly more vulnerable areas.Donald Trump actually was on the phone last night doing a tele-town hall with Elise Stefanik as you mentioned as well as some of these vulnerable lawmakers trying to boost them up, trying to reach out to voters to get them to hit the polls for these people as well. We'll see if it works. Notably though, Jessica, even though this is part of the strategy, none of them are slated to speak today.

Of course, this ad that you mentioned has a lot of mentions of Phillies, and it is one that again, they're trying to use to convey the vice president's message. And that's really what the next few days are going to be.They want -- her team, they want to tap into some of the good vibes that they had early on in the campaign, bring that back, while also trying to continue to draw that short contrast with former president Donald Trump and continue to issue their warnings of a potential second Trump term, but to do that they're having to increase exposure of the vice president and her message. One of the ways they're doing that of course is through ads and playing them during these big moments, but it's also making sure that she's on the campaign trail often and what we have seen most recently is he's almost daily gaggles with reporters traveling with the vice president where she is rapidly responding to former President Donald Trump. So all of that together is part of the strategy by the Harris campaign to stay front and center and continue to feature some of their issues prominently in the closing days of the election.",

Its possible Trump might run better in some of them than he did four years ago, but still the control of the House is largely being decided in the roughly 17 districts, I think it is, that Republicans hold that voted for Biden in 2020.

Today, his running mate agreeing with him that mainstream Democrats are a greater threat to the country than foreign adversaries like North Korea.So on the one hand, you've got Democrats who want to emphasize that. And that is a message aimed primarily at white collar suburban college educated voters. They're the ones who respond most to it and the related arguments about Trump as a threat to rights, particularly abortion. Then you have the other camp of Democrats who say she has to emphasize bread and butter issues to try to reel back some of the voters of color who have moved away from Democrats over discontent about the economy and maybe more working class white women voters who are more economically squeezed. I think she's actually come up with a pretty effective bridge of that with this one line that she says, Donald Trump will come into office again with an enemies list. I will come into office with a to-do list for you. And I think that is a pretty elegant way of bridging those two arguments. And I suspect that that's what we're going to hear from her, that Trump is so consumed by his desire for retribution against all those he thinks that has wronged him, that he will both threaten the Constitution and ignore your needs, your daily needs on everything from health care to home health for seniors to prescription drugs.",

And from what we know about his schedule right now, it seems like this last week will follow very much that same pattern. As of now, he is having two official events, first in Tuesday in Baltimore, Maryland, where President Biden will discuss the administration's work, investing in infrastructure and climate crisis. And on Friday, the president will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There he will be talking to all unions. It's no surprise that he is in Philadelphia. This is a core, the Commonwealth of Philadelphia, battleground state that he knows, of course, very well.

You know, we've heard the former president talk very openly about what he describes as the enemy within, people here in America, Americans that he thinks are more frightening and more potentially threatening than our enemies that exist outside in the world. And he has named various politicians, but he's also posted on Truth Social that he would investigate and go after anyone that he thought was an enemy from within.Do you think John Kelly and Mark Milley, yourself, anyone, might be concerned that they might be targeted if President Trump were to get back in office?",

We are, must be, and I hope, and I believe always will be a nation of laws. That is critical. Our military will defend the Constitution in any crisis.",

They've had three months of unbroken success going after, as you point out, Yahya Sinwar, the exorbitant leader of Hamas, now dead. Too much blood on his hands to even measure, including American blood. They have struck successfully against Iran. Iran has tried to strike them with very little effect. Again and again, you see Israel moving militarily.As to where it goes from here, Jessica, I think, and let's hope this is true, that things will now settle down from this cycle of violence we've seen. The Iranians don't seem to have the stomach for another round of significant retaliation. Israel has been clear that they feel this most recent set of strikes are sufficient, at least for the moment. Combat operations are winding down in Gaza. They're continuing in Hezbollah to the north. But I think the hard combat is going be measured, I hope, in a few more months, and this thing will not widen into a true total regional war. I think the chances of this settling down are about 80% at this point. I'm still worrisome, but I think better than where I might have predicted a month ago.",

And let's face it, North Korea is a one trick pony. It is a nation that is simply a militarized state. And so, these troops, which are currently training in Russia, will hit the front lines. I've seen numbers estimated between 3,000 and 12,000. It's a significant military addition to the forces of Russia who are losing so many.And final thought on this, Jessica. In the midst of worrying about it, as we should appropriately, we also ought to reflect that this reflects Russian weakness. Believe me, Vladimir Putin doesn't like the image of him going on bended knee to Kim Jong-un to get troops to keep his offensive going. This is a sign of Russian weakness, but it could have real impact on the battlefield.",
