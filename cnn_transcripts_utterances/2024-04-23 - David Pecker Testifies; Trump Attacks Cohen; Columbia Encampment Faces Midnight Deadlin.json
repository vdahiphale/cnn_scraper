He doesn't say, Marcus, I want you to do A, B and C, and then tell me D, E and F. It's innuendo, it's intimation, it's you're supposed to understand through, I guess, telepathy what I really want you to do, kind of mob style, people think -- keep talking about it.Here, Pecker testified though that Trump was a micromanager of sorts, that he was knowledgeable, he was detail-oriented, and then he also signed -- signed checks and sought invoices. Does that help to get you closer to Trump being involved? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: That testimony stood out to me tremendously, actually, because it showed that Trump is involved in the details. So, this isn't just a negligence of the books. This isn't a negligence of how you're keeping the records or where the payments are going. Because Trump is micromanaging and looking at the checks and where the money is going from an early stage, it sounds like from -- David Pecker understood that's the way Trump was at all times. So, I think it's not direct evidence per se, but it is circumstantial evidence of Trump's personality, the way he carries himself, and the way he manages others to that point you just made because sometimes his orders may not be explicit or expressed, but when it comes to the finances, he has his eyes on where the money is going.",

But then, Trump said this, Molly, \"Any time you do anything like this, it always gets out. Let me think about it, and I'll have Michael Cohen call you back in a few days.'\" What does that tell you?",

And despite the turn he has taken now, you know, Michael Cohen was fanatically loyal to the man he always referred to as Mr. Trump. And we knew that he was always out there defending his reputation.I think, to Marcus's point, you know, this also fits with what we know about how meticulously Trump pays attention to his image in the media, right? He -- right -- while this trial was going on, he's tweeting about the details of the way he's being covered in \"The New York Times.\" So, to this day, I think, is very much fits with what we know about how Donald Trump has always very carefully managed perceptions of himself, always very carefully monitored the media coverage of himself. So -- but it's wild to actually get this behind-the-scenes glimpse, right, because if you were covering this campaign, you saw these headlines come out in the \"National Enquirer,\" you sort of went, wow, they really seem to like Trump and they really seem to not like all these other guys, I wonder what's going on. And then back in 2018, \"The Wall Street Journal\" broke the story about the \"catch and kill\" scheme and the Stormy Daniels payment, but we have never heard it actually from Pecker's mouth before. And so, to hear him talk about it and to hear all the details in this -- in this first-hand way is really fascinating for anyone who sort of watched it from the outside.",

So, you know, Tim was talking earlier about how obviously annoyed Trump is to be sitting there. Everything is about domination for him, right?

CHEMALII walked by one of them Saturday night and they were banging loudly on the Columbia gates praising Hamas. They were the ones who, when Jews individuals who identify -- who are very identifiable as Jewish walked by, told them that they were pigs and told them to return to Poland. Just rhetoric that is completely unacceptable. That said, while they are separate, these are extremists from the outside and non-students, the students on the inside are coordinating with them. They are telling them what time to come and protest. And so, there is some onus here on the students to take responsibility. I believe that if the -- if the students want to protest for a ceasefire or for divestment or whatever it might be, fine, do it within the rules of the school and don't -- and just associate yourselves from these extremists in order to make your own cause credible.",

That is not how it should be.But the fact is that there have been Jewish students who've been -- who've been targeted, who've been harassed, who feel unsafe, and that -- that -- they have a right to be on this campus and to study and to learn, which is the mission and priority of the university.

It's these students have taken over the university. And the universities are trying to negotiate with them when, really, they should be offering leadership, direction, and redirecting their energies into things that are more positive, getting kids back into the classroom. And clearly, these students aren't going to classes. I even had a class of my own canceled because of what's going on.
