Plus, I'll be joined by Republican Congressman and veteran Rich McCormick, what does he think of Senator Tommy Tuberville's hold on military promotions. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Thursday, November 16. There are just 61 days until the Iowa caucuses, 354 days until Election Day. This is today's STATE OF THE RACE. Welcome to STATE OF THE RACE. President Joe Biden standing on the world stage this week opposite Chinese President Xi, trying to capitalize on the biggest advantage Xi has in the 2024 campaign. He is the incumbent President. Republican rivals not named to Trump have been quick to criticize Biden for being too close to China. But, the President poked Beijing with these comments to our MJ Lee yesterday.

CNN can't independently verify these claims. But, the ongoing humanitarian toll in Gaza is an increasingly politically explosive issue for the President here at home. In Washington, law enforcement had to evacuate top Democratic leaders, including Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, from the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. Capitol Police clashed with protesters outside. Capitol Police say six officers were injured in the confrontation \"ranging from minor cuts to being pepper sprayed, to being punched.\" Congressman Sean Casten wrote on social media, he was among those evacuated, saying, \"The building was surrounded by protesters who had blocked all modes of ingress and egress.\" Activists of the demonstration have accused police of attacking them, saying they were pepper sprayed. Capitol Police have not yet responded to CNN's request for comment. Let's dive into all of this with today's panel, former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent, Democratic Strategist Joe Trippi, and CNN Global Affairs Analyst Kimberly Dozier. Thank you all for being here. Congressman, I want to start with you just because for people that aren't familiar with the geography here in Washington, the DNC is kind of part of the Capitol Hill complex. It's like adjacent to it, and that would explain why the Capitol Police were involved in this. But, blocking all the entrances and exits is a tough situation for members to be in. It seems like Capitol Police were taken by surprise. What was your reaction to seeing these pictures last night? CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN, &amp; EXEC.
