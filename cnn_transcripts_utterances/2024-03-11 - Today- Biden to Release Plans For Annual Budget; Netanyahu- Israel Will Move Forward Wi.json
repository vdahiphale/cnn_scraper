So this is a proposal that is expected to build on his State of the Union Address, especially those components that look at building the middle-class. So some details from the proposals include raising taxes on large corporations, reducing corporate profit shifting 25 percent tax on billionaires on billionaires it all in all would cut the deficit by $3 trillion in ten years.Now, despite those positive indicators on the economy, the president is still facing low approval ratings on how he has handled the economy. So this is an attempt to appeal to those voters and take the message on the road. The president is headed to New Hampshire today after a few stops over the weekend, both in Pennsylvania on Friday and in Georgia on Saturday. So all of this taken together, just trying to bolster the president's message as he hits the campaign trail, and as this election really gets ramped up, Kasie.",

Do we have control of our southern border?We know that immigrants actually have lower levels of crime than nonimmigrants but these, we have these shells -- these cases, these terrible cases of murders, including the one of the -- the one in Georgia. So the problem -- the president clearly misspoke. He didn't mean to use this word, but then apologizing doesn't add to the impression he's trying to build these being strong on immigration, that he's done kind of a pivot when it comes to immigration. BEDINGFIELD:  And that's certainly fair. But I do think -- I will say, I do think that he has found and I think you heard this in the State of the Union. I do think he's found a more proactive kind of aggressive message on immigration, both obviously, talking about what he's done to be tougher, which absolutely speaks to the concerns that people are feeling across the country. No question, you know? But he also has an affirmative case to make out the melting pot of this country and the contributions that immigrants make to the economy.
