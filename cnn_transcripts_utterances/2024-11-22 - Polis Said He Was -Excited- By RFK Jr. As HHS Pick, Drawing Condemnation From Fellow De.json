      "sentences": "To be clear, those things are completely false about vaccines causing autism. Vaccines have saved millions of lives. You can look at how a lot of diseases that were the scourge of prior generations are all but eliminated or eliminated today.And, look, I supported Kamala Harris. I wish that we were talking about her appointments and how wonderful they were, including for Health and Human Services. But should it be any surprise that when we have a president-elect who himself says false utterances as well, again, if that was disqualified, we wouldn't have this president- elect. So we have to find a way to, of course, rebut those things and say these are the facts, but also look for opportunities where we can. And if there is an opportunity to reduce harmful pesticide use with negative consequences on the ecosystem and our health, if there's a way to save people money on prescription drugs, if there's a way to improve nutrition, reducing consumption of processed foods and increasing health, I think we've got to find a way to work with anybody in the incoming administration. And just on vaccines, I mean, in your home state, because of some of the rhetoric that we've heard from RFK Jr. and people like him, you've seen a decrease in vaccinations in the '23-'24 school year. 92.1 percent of the students were vaccinated. Among kindergartners, it fell to 90.1 percent. It sounds like a lot, but it's certainly going down. Are you concerned about that? POLIS: You know, our goal and what the science advises is we want to keep it north of 90 percent to establish kind of herd immunity, reducing transmission. Parents who make what I consider to be an ill- informed decision, it is their decision not to vaccinate their child, are, of course, putting their child at greater risk. So, again, I encourage everybody to look at the data. It's not something that people should do at the point of a gun, it's something people should do because it helps save the lives of those that they love the most.",

Of course, that's natural for this period. Of course, we need to get past that and show a proactive agenda to save people money, reduce costs, make life easier and better for every American family. Increase social and economic mobility by making training and apprenticeships more available.

We're probably going to have either the same House majority or smaller than we had coming out of 2022.

So what does that mean, not only in the House, what does it mean in the Senate for the midterms? And how do they gauge how closely to hang to Trump? And does that actually translate into anything when he's not really on the ballot in the next midterms? It's a real test for these folks. I think more in the Senate than in the House, because the House is just much more Trumpian than the Senate is. But those folks, if you're a senator, you're saying there is a post -- they've been here long before Donald Trump, and they're going to be here long after Donald Trump.
