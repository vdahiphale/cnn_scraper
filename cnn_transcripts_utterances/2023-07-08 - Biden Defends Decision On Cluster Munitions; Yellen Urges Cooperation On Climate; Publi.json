These weapons are banned by more than 100 countries but not Russia, Ukraine or the United States. A big drawback is that many bomblets don't explode right away and pose lethal hazards for years afterward. A cluster munitions have already been used in Ukraine, such as this Russian attack last year.But this will be the first time the U.S. will be supplying them.

Two Democratic senators wrote in The Washington Post. Cluster munitions such as landmines undeniably offer some battlefield advantages, yet using them would compound the already devastating impact of the war on civilians and Ukrainian troops, with effects lasting for years to come.

And the president made some good points as did your other commentator. The fact of the matter is we have held on to them for a very specific need and a very specific part of the world for a very specific war plan. We would not be holding on to them if we didn't see a very important requirement. Now, on this battlefield, as was explained, Russia is using a very different type. They're munitions leave almost 30 percent behind unexploded. And that is what we are concerned about. And Russia has used these weapons specifically in civilian areas. Neither would be the case in what we bring to the battlefield. The DPICM has got about a 1.85 dud rate. So, 30 percent for Russia, 1.05 percent for ours. Very different munition and as the President pointed out, the Ukrainians are going to use them in all the military places.

Early data from U.S. meteorologists shows Thursday's temperature climbed to more than 17.2 degrees Celsius, or roughly 63 degrees Fahrenheit.Well, experts say the extreme heat is an enormous wake up call for the climate crisis. A senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center says this is almost certainly the warmest the planet has been in at least 100,000 years. And it comes after last month saw the planet's hottest June by a substantial margin above the previous record. Joining us now from London is Bob Ward. He is the policy and communications director for the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and environment at the London School of Economics. Bob, so good to have you with us. Four straight days of record highs is a grim milestone for the planet. What drives this?",

So taking the temperature all around the surface, but we are seeing extremes also becoming more intense and frequent. At the moment, there's a very severe marine heatwave going on in the North Atlantic, including around the coasts of Britain, temperatures are four to five degrees higher than normal.It's having impacts on all sorts of marine life. We've seen all sorts of disruptions to fish stocks. And these are the kinds of things are happening all around the world. We will also see undoubtedly, over the next few weeks, a couple of months increase heat waves. Last year, there was an intense heat wave across Europe. In the U.K., temperatures incredibly got above 40 degrees Celsius for the first time and they have real impacts. The heatwave conditions last summer in the U.K. killed almost 3000 people. So, these are very severe impacts.",

We are getting perilously close to that. And the scientists have already laid out a number of major impacts that that could happen, not just to increased heatwave period, we also get increased periods of heavy rainfall because a warmer atmosphere holds more waste moisture.So, when it rains, it rains harder. It overwhelms our drainage and sewage systems, we get flooding, particularly in city areas, it can wipe out crops, threaten our food security. So, we have got to cut greenhouse gas emissions, absolutely no alternative. And we've got to do it urgently and get it down, essentially get our emissions down to zero by the middle of this century if we can.",
