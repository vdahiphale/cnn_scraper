An Israeli official now telling CNN that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the IDF evacuation operation in Rafah must be completed by the start of Ramadan, a month from now.Plus, Special Counsel report cleanup. The White House and President Biden's allies pushing back with sharp criticism on the Special Counsels characterizations of the president, calling it gratuitous and inappropriate. And two teams are set to go head-to-head and the biggest game of the year. No, I'm not talking about Super Bowl LVIII. Not really. Its Team Ruff vs. Team Fluff. You'll meet the players of this year's Puppy Bowl. Hello, everyone. And thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. We begin in the Red Sea, where U.S. Central Command has just announced it has carried out more strikes on Iran-backed Houthi targets in Yemen. CENTCOM says the strikes happened Friday and were aimed at drones and missiles that were getting ready to launch against nearby ships. Last week. The U.S. along with the U.K. launch strikes on more than a dozen Houthi locations. CNN's Nic Robertson is following the developments from Tel Aviv. Nic, what more are we learning about the latest round of strikes?",

It's basically a small boat packed with explosives and targeted those before they hit shipping in the Red Sea.And also, four anti-ship cruise missiles were targeted. The Houthis often keep these head and they keep them in bunkers or in caves. And it appears that when they are bought out prior to use, they are targeted and as well one mobile cruise missile launcher was targeted as well. All of those between the early hours of Friday and early Friday evening, Yemen time. So, this designed to keep the shipping lanes in the Red Sea safe and designed specifically as well to protect U.S. Naval vehicles that are patrolling the coastline there. Fred.",

However, targets are being hit by the -- from the air in Rafah, as we've seen in other areas. That can happen before a ground incursion happens.The prime minister has said the army must provide a way to make the civilian safe, to evacuate the civilians. We haven't heard from the army yet what that may look like, but what they've used before to keep civilians safe, sometimes doesn't. They are targeting Hamas civilians. civilians have been killed in in many operations on every day, that the operations continue inside Gaza. Now, what the prime minister has laid out today is that all these operations should be completed in Rafah by the 10th of March, which is the beginning of Ramadan, as a holy month for Muslims. So, this is an additional deadline and it seems with 1.4 million people, they are very crammed in into this town that is literally right against the border with Egypt. Many people have had been forced to move multiple times. They have sort of -- the IDF has worked its way from north to south in Gaza and this is the last hurrah stronghold. This is how the IDF describes it. The -- to have the operations completed by the 10th of March, would seem to be a stretch because Khan Younis, a town that doesn't have that size of population, the military operations there have been going on for several months now.",

But this report also touches on one of the defining themes of this campaign, which is the president's age, and his fitness for office. And that really struck a chord with the White House this week as Biden's aides said that this was inaccurate in the way that the president was portrayed. Saying that he is sharp, and he is tireless.And we saw the president himself, angry about the way that he was described in this report, in that press conference that you see there, that was quickly put together, in which, he especially was angry about the fact that the special counsel had included that he didn't remember when his son died. Now, Vice President Kamala Harris was strong and her pushback just yesterday about the way that she viewed how he was described in this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, he also drew on the distinctions between President Biden and former President Donald Trump, who also mishandled or was alleged to mishandle classified documents. So, he explained that as well.Now, as far as how this plays out on the campaign trail, senior campaign officials said that President Biden does best when he is with voters. And we have already seen an uptick in the retail politics that President Biden likes to engage in, that all intended for voters to make their own judgments about the president's acuity. But it is no doubt that they are having to grapple with what this report says as they head into this election season where the president's age is going to be front and center.",

President -- or former President Donald Trump did not do that. It was more difficult to get those classified documents back. So, it comes down to cooperation versus not enough cooperation.

And then those who support him are going to say this is a gratuitous political hit by a Republican prosecutor, who worked for Trump. And, you know, it will all wash out.But I think, to Priscilla's point, Biden now has the obligation to be out and among potential voters to prove essentially, that Hur is incorrect. That he needs now to engage in much more hands-on retail politics, because that's the only form he has left to disprove what Hur had said. If Hur indicted him, he could have gone to trial and said, look, I'm not infirm, I'm not old. I'm not willful. But he doesn't have that option.

They're bringing a host of resources we're told, including physical scanners for those entering the stadium, as well as explosive detection canines. There will be sensors on hand that essentially sniff the air for any type of chemical, biological, radiological threat. All that's happening on the ground.

Now, one specific concern that authorities are really worried about pertains to drones, drone technology, obviously very cheap to obtain. We're told, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies will be on hand with counter drone technology, I've seen this stuff up close, it's really impressive. They have the ability to electronically drop a drone from the sky, or even take control of it and vectored away from a particular place, obviously, for the drone is carrying a potentially dangerous payload, you wouldn't want to bring that down in a populated area.

You know, it was several months ago that there was first this discussion of the fighting coming to the south and the promises were made, that the south, the people in the south, those people who fled three or four times to what was called safety, the south would not endure the ferocity attacks of the north. That has not happened. CNN show that very, very clearly those families are under immense threats every single day, as we now know by thousands and thousands of children being killed.So there was an idea of safe zones but safe legally must mean more than not being bombed, it must mean access to food and water and protection. That's non-existent, Fredricka. I saw that. I saw streets packed with people. I saw girls, teenage girls queuing for four or five hours to use a bathroom. There is no way safe, legally, ethically to go, to go to the north. Two thirds of the homes have been damaged or destroyed. There's unexploded ordnance and weaponry everywhere. There is nowhere safe. There has been nowhere safe. But of course people have hid in Rafah, 600,000, twice the population density of New York City. The idea to have a ground offensive remembering that Rafah gate is also where the vast majority of humanitarian aid that comes in, the small amount relative to what is needed comes in. If we jeopardize that, then, yes, you just -- we will see a catastrophic number of people being killed or simply dying from deprivation and disease.",

The map behind me, all of these red dots that you see, those indicate the warmest winter so far to date. The orange dots, not much better, those placing in the top five. And you can see a lot of them hovered right over the Midwest and the northeastern region. That means the moisture that's come into those areas so far has been in the form of rain, not snow, leading to very significant snowfall deficits.Marquette, Syracuse and Erie all more than 50 inches below where they normally would be this time of year, even Minneapolis and Cleveland, roughly two feet below average. And it's not just snowfall. It's also ice, the Great Lakes region, the total ice coverage right now, only 5 percent. Normally up to this point, they would have about 37 percent. That means we're looking at a near all-time low for those lakes. And the forecast doesn't really look like we're going to be seeing much more ice. In fact, looking at just the next 24 hours, all of these dots indicate a place that couldn't have having a record high temperature. Now we are going to see those temperatures drop back soon. Cleveland going from 56 today down to 40 by Monday, Raleigh 73 today, down into the 50s by Monday. And the reason for that is we've got a cold front coming through. And not only is it going to bring temperatures back down, it's also going to bring a lot of rain to areas of the South that could end up producing some flooding concerns across several states, but also the potential for severe storms not just today, but also Sunday as well as Monday.",
