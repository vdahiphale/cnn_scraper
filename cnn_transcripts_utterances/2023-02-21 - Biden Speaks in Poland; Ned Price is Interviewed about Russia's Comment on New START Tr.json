      "sentences": "That happens to be a true story. But, you know, I was here last year and we visited the base where Polish and American troops were and standing side by side, showing our strength and determination.The truth of the matter is, the United States needs Poland and NATO as much as NATO needs the United States because there is no way in which for our ability to operate anywhere else in the world and our responsibilities extend beyond Europe. We have to have security in Europe. It's that basic. That simple. That consequential. So it's the single most consequential alliance. I would argue, maybe the most consequential alliance in history. That - not just modern history, but in history. And so I made it clear that comments of the United States and our allies as part of the commitment is real. And that a year later, I would argue NATO is stronger than its ever been. I -- as I told President Zelenskyy when we spoke in Kyiv yesterday, I can proudly say that our support for Ukraine remains unwavering. And as I told our Russian counterpart in our -- well, it was a while now, I said, you're seeking the - the (INAUDIBLE) of NATO. You're going to get the NATO-ization of Finland. And it turns out I didn't know Sweden was come along as well. But all kidding aside, I think we're in a -- if we keep our head and we are focused, I think we're in a better position than we've ever been. And I want to thank you, President, for how Poland has supported Ukraine. It's been extraordinary, Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, what you've done. Truly extraordinary. Last year when I was here watching people come across the border and the feeling that those little children, the looks on their faces, those mothers who left behind husbands and fathers, it was just incredible the way you welcomed them. What is it, 1.6 to 1.7 million Ukrainians you've welcomed. And, you know, we -- and we reaffirmed our ironclad commitment to NATO's collective security, including guaranteeing that the command headquarters for our forces in Europe are going to be in Poland, period. And we're also launching a new strategic partnership with plans to build nuclear power plants and boast Poland's energy security for generations to come. And Mr. President, the connection between Poland and -- Polish and American people is extremely strong and deep. I was kidding with the president. I was, as a young man, I was born in a coal town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, northeastern Pennsylvania, in an Irish Catholic neighborhood. And when coal died, we moved down to Delaware, to a town called Claymont, Delaware, which was a working class town. And -- but everyone in town was either Polish or Italian. I grew up feeling self-conscious my name discontinued end in s-k-i or an o. But all kidding aside, the connection between - I was telling the president, the pride, the overwhelming demonstrable pride that the Polish Americans feel about Poland and the role you're playing now. We were talking about it. It's extreme.",

I am absolutely confident in that.So it's a delight to be back and I'm anxious to get our discussion going. Although the president and I solved all the problems in the other room a moment ago. There's nothing to solve. But all kidding aside, there is a critical, critical, critical, critical relationship for the United States, and we thank you for all of the cooperation and help.",

But this is something we monitor every day.

Strategic stability is one of those. We've been calling on Russia for some time to meet with us so we can conduct these inspections, so we can insure that Russia is in compliance.

If it's just a proclamation, if it's just for propaganda purposes, if it was just because he wanted a sound bite or a news bite out of what was otherwise a pretty empty state of the nation address, 90 minutes that he gave to his own people, that's one thing. If Russia decides to take steps to actually move in the direction, to actually take steps that heighten the irresponsibility that we've seen from the Russian Federation over the course of the last year with nuclear saber-rattling, nuclear bluster, potential threats, that's very much another.",

We believe in the necessity of maintaining lines of communication even when we're in a state of relations like we are now. We have an embassy in Moscow. The Russians have an embassy here. Secretary Blinken has demonstrated his willingness to pick up the phone to speak to his counterpart. Foreign Minister Lavrov, Secretary Austin at DOD, Chairman Milley has done the same. Jake Sullivan has done the same. We are acting responsibly. And part of what responsible powers do is maintain the ability to communicate with one another. Now, the more narrow part of that, yes, we did give the Russians notification that President Biden would be transiting into Ukraine. We didn't want any miscalculation. We didn't want any mistake on their part. It was really a notification. It wasn't a dialogue. You heard from the national security advisor there wasn't much of an exchange.
