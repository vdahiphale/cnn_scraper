Rishi Sunak was greeted by mostly cheers as he arrived at 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister. And just like the two prime ministers before him, his promise to end the political chaos and turmoil which has become a recent hallmark of the Conservative government and to bring an end to the worst economic crisis Britain has faced in a generation.He's also spoken with world leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, both agreed on continued support for Ukraine and the need to hold Russia accountable. But in the hours ahead, Sunak will face his first Prime Minister's questions in Parliament, with opposition parties spilling blood in the water, it will likely be a knock him down, drag him out bare knuckle slinging match. And earlier, Sunak admitted the government has made mistakes, just not by him. But his predecessor, Liz Truss. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Rishi Sunak is the first non-white Prime Minister and the youngest in some 200 years and yet in his first speech in office, he didn't dwell on either of those milestones, perhaps because there is far too much work to do. British Sunak has the difficult job of uniting his fractured party. So far though the appointments to his new Cabinet seem to show he is willing to extend an olive branch.Roughly half of the Cabinet picks have been part of Liz Truss' Cabinet, others have served under Boris Johnson. He even brought back Truss' former home secretary who resigned less than one week ago. In his first speech as Prime Minister, he promised to get serious about paying down debt, bring compassion to challenges and focus on the basic campaign promises the Conservatives ran on in the 2019 election. Sunak opted to keep in place Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt who had been brought in to clean up the economic mess brought by Liz trust, but Sunak will need to go even further to patch the huge hole in public finances and to try to tame inflation. Sunak says he is well aware of the challenges he faces and how tough things will be, but he insists he is not daunted. Scott McLean, CNN, London.",

But, you know, I think he wanted to be seen as someone who had confidence from a clear majority of Conservative MPs, which he was able to achieve.In the days ahead, I think the most important thing for Sunak, in terms of stability within the party is for him to actually do some of the basic legwork of politics.

I mean, that was the big problem with the 45 percent -- the cut from the 45 percent top rate of tax was that, no -- there had been no preparation.
