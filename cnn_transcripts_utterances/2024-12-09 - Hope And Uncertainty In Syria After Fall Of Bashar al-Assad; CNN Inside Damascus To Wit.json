Very different, two different flags there, in fact, two groups, but one -- the flag with the stars on, one described as the Syrian independence flag, and you can see that adorned on that building. So, we'll keep an eye on these images for you. But 24 hours after, what was this lightning offensive that toppled the regime in Damascus, liberating the city? These are the pictures this evening.

They're lining up for gas. They are trying to make sure that they have enough food to ride out this transitional period where nobody really knows what's going to happen. Now, you can see behind me at the end of the road there, that is the central bank of Syria. Yesterday, there was extensive moving there. A lot of people in the city started to feel a little bit concerned that this was going to be a chaotic period. Then more rebels arrived in the capital. The looting appears to have stopped. It does seem very calm on the streets. Of course, there are many people who are elated the Bashar al-Assad is finally gone.

As of this morning, the flag of the Syrian opposition flies above the embassy here in Moscow. And we asked here at the embassy, and folks here told us that the embassy is actually working as normally, even though the transition in Syria is already very much taking place. For the Russians, however, they were one of the biggest backers of the Assad regime, and of course, still have major military assets inside Syria as well. They have an air base in Hmeimim, close to Latakia, which is very important for them, not just for air operations in Syria, but also to project power into the Mediterranean and even all the way into Africa. And of course, they have a major naval base in Tartus, and just last week, conducted big naval exercises, firing some high-powered missiles from ships inside the Mediterranean Sea.

I also thought it was interesting for him to talk about his background, coming -- growing up in the housing projects of Brooklyn, and what a code of honor individuals like him and those that grew up around him had about protecting girls. So, he's making an appeal on several different levels about his role as a protector of girls and women, and not one that not as a predator.
