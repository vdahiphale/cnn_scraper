I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, we'll have a live report from Ukraine where the army says it's repelled Russian attacks in the southeast in what it says was a difficult fight. Then, Alexey Navalny's mother pleads for the body of her son to be returned. We'll have her video address. And the U.S. proposes a temporary ceasefire in Gaza in a draft U.N. Security Council resolution. I'll be joined by the CEO of a leading U.S. humanitarian agency. Just after the fall of the key Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, Russia has launched a new wave of attacks. This time the Ukrainian military says it held off a renewed Russian offensive in the Zaporizhzhia region overnight. It comes as Ukraine marks a day of remembrance for the heavenly hundred, those who lost their lives in the 2014 Maidan Square protests in Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Ukraine is, quote, \"still standing 10 years later, despite continued attempts to destroy the country and its independence.\" CNN's Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Payton Walsh is in Kherson in southern Ukraine. And Ukraine's defense strategy, Nick, are repelling those renewed attacks.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, look, it's clearly been a difficult 48 hours start of this week, according to Ukrainian defense officials, obviously the fall of Avdiivka, the subject of weeks or months of assaults, but there appears to still be some momentum that the Russians have that they're trying to capitalize upon.Most notably in Zaporizhzhia region, one of the key victories of the limited success of the summer counteroffensive that Ukraine had so much NATO funding to try and execute Robotyne, a tiny village, frankly, but one that was taken by Ukraine last summer. That now is under heavy Russian assault. Ukraine cleared that they've repelled those attacks, but there appears to be another prong of that assault slightly off to the east. And then along the front lines, a series, frankly, of pieces of bad news for Ukrainian forces. Russia, it seems able to push forwards, commit significant numbers of troops to various separate assaults. Suggestions around Avdiivka that fell, there may be other attempts there. Bakhmut, the other last major city taken by Russia in May last year, suggestions of motion there, and then also Kupyansk to the north where President Zelenskyy visited troops just yesterday. A lot of bad news. Ukraine simultaneously trying to sound like it is successful in repelling these assaults, but also candid about how persistent and frankly widespread they are. At the moment, also saying that they took two Russian fighter jets out of the sky in the country's east. But we're into a very perilous time here, because the potential for this moment has been telegraphed for months. Back in December, when aid was initially held up by Republican-led Congress, they were concerned morale was being impacted. It was a matter of time till the front line saw real change. Well, that change is upon us now. And so, ultimately, Ukraine is now left with a difficult task of keeping people feeling that the fight is worth it, that the fight is winnable in their messaging and in their behavior too, but also projecting to the outside world the urgent need for assistance. Sweden today passing a record $683 million worth of aid for Ukraine, but that is a fraction of the $60 billion they urgently need from the U.S. And for two weeks, the U. S. Congress will not even be discussing the possibility of passing that, and those two weeks a lot could certainly change here. In Kherson, Max, I should tell you where I'm standing now, the sound of artillery is pretty constant and that's a reflection of how Russia is not running out of ammunition, is able to fund its frontline assaults and Ukraine quite the opposite.

      "sentences": "Yes. So this has just been coming out in the last few hours. This is a 33-year-old resident of Los Angeles, according to a statement from Russia's FSB, which was their internal security. She's 33. There's two alleged crimes that she's being accused of. One is collecting funds for Ukrainian organizations. Those funds allegedly then were used for battlefield supplies, medical supplies, but also weapons.[08:05:02] And the second thing is, is interesting because this is actions outside of Russia, specifically in the U.S. being accused of public actions, they say, in support of the Kyiv regime, whether that was demonstrations or protests, it's not clear at this point. But the actual criminal case that's been opened is under the charge of treason, which is a very serious crime in Russia. It used to be that the maximum sentence there was 20 years. Last year, they upgraded that to the potential for life imprisonment. That's likely to be when there's a repeat crime or things like that, but serious enough that they have not released her on bail. They say that she is being held what they call preventive measures. But as you say, there's always a lot of scrutiny when any U.S. citizen is arrested in Russia. Obviously, the relations between Russia and the U.S. have basically collapsed. We have a situation Evan Gershkovich, that Wall Street Journal reporter, now approaching the year mark in pre-trial detention. He just had an appeal denied today. Paul Whelan, more than five years behind bars. So this, we're still waiting for more information on this, but it will be very closely watched.",

So yes, it's currency. This is how they try to win back the prizes that they want from overseas. And it's -- it is potentially political. We don't know if we can say that yet with this case because we're waiting for more information about who this individual actually is but still something to watch very closely.",

U.N. experts are calling for a probe into allegations. They've heard that Israeli troops killed, imprisoned, raped and sexually assaulted Palestinian women and girls. They want an independent investigation. Israel says the allegations are despicable and unfounded. In a separate development, the U.S. is now calling for a temporary ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas and proposing its own draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council. This comes after the U.S. said it would veto an Algerian draft, which is set to come up for a vote today. CNN's Nic Robertson is live from Tel Aviv. I think the Algerian proposal was an immediate ceasefire. The U.S. isn't, and that's the crucial difference.",

There's a desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza is critical that gets in and the hostages released as well. He had sometimes it's only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering and the importance of a permanent peace is actually brought home. So rare intervention of someone who's meant to be a non-political figure getting involved in what many people see as a political issue, but he's very clear that he's speaking on behalf of all of the victims of this crisis on all sides. Russia's foreign minister is on the second leg of his diplomatic tour through Latin America. Sergey Lavrov is expected to hold talks with Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas.

Lavrov is in Caracas at a moment where Latin America finds itself at the center of the diplomatic circles, just like Europe was last week.He's meeting Maduro today, but crucially tomorrow he will go to Rio de Janeiro where he will participate in a meeting of G20 foreign leaders, foreign ministers, where also Antony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, is due to participate. It will be interesting to see how the two interact with each other because it was the first time that they will meet after the death of Alexey Navalny. Today in Caracas, Lavrov is due to do a press conference. It will be the first that he does after Alexey Navalny's death. So it will be interesting to see what he says. And his visits to Cuba yesterday and to Venezuela today shows a sign that Russia is not focusing only on Europe. It's still very much interesting to project influence all around the world and especially in the United States backyard by meeting Maduro, who in recent weeks, it's interesting to notice what's going on inside Venezuela these days. There has been increased repression and increased crackdown on opposition leaders. The opposition leaders have been barred from running in an election that is scheduled for later this year. And at least 19 people have been detained for participating in an alleged plot to kill Nicolas Maduro. There has been no proof provided by the Venezuelan authorities. But it's a moment where the tensions between Caracas and Washington are running very high. There is a lot going on between the two countries. And, of course, Lavrov's presence there is only adding fuel to the fire. Max?",
