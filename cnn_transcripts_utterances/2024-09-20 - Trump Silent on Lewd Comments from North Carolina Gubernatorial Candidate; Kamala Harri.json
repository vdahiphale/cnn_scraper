With just 46 days until the election, the nominees are moving full speed ahead with their campaigns.Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is set to travel to Georgia to deliver remarks on reproductive rights while Republican nominee Donald Trump campaigns in the swing state of North Carolina on Saturday. Now his visit comes as scandalous revelations about his ally, a candidate for governor there, rocks the campaign. On Thursday, a CNN K-file investigation revealed Mark Robinson's history of disturbing, lewd comments on a message board for a porn website. Trump has praised and endorsed Robinson, but his campaign isn't saying whether Robinson should drop out of the race. But the Harris campaign has been sharing video and photos of Trump and Robinson together. Robinson denies making the comments. The deadline for him to quit passed about three hours ago, but he's refused to leave the race. We get more on the CNN investigation from CNN's Diane Gallagher. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Mark Robinson, the controversial and socially conservative Republican running for governor here in North Carolina, made a series of inflammatory comments on a pornography website between 2008 and 2012 on a message board in which he referred to himself as a black Nazi, expressed support for reinstating slavery, as well as other lewd and degrading comments about women, according to a CNN-K-file investigation. Now, despite a recent history of very anti-transgender comments, Robinson said on the website, which was called Nude Africa, and included a message board that he enjoyed watching transgender pornography. He also referred to himself as a perv. Now Robinson denies making these comments and they do predate his entry into politics where he is currently serving as a lieutenant governor of the state. They were made under a username that CNN was able to identify as Robinson by matching a litany of biographical details and a shared email address as well. Many of those comments were again gratuitous and sexual, lewd nature. They were made on that website. CNN is reporting only a small portion of Robinson's comments given the nature of them. Robinson did tell CNN on Thursday that quote, \"This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me. I'm not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured this. These salacious tabloid lies.\" He also put out a video statement, getting ahead of the CNN story before it was published, saying comparing himself to Clarence Thomas, calling it a, himself a victim of a high tech lynching. Now Robinson's camp opponent in the gubernatorial campaign, the current attorney general here, Democrat Josh Stein, his campaign released a statement saying, quote, \"North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be governor. Josh remains focused on winning this campaign so that together we can build a safer, stronger North Carolina for everyone.\" Now Robinson has been endorsed by just about every Republican in the state of North Carolina, as well as former president Donald Trump, who at one point called him Martin Luther King on steroids and better than Martin Luther King. The Trump campaign has said that it is focused on winning North Carolina and the presidential race. The fallout with Republicans here in the Tar Heel state does continue as many Democrats try and link their opponents today to Mark Robinson and those comments that he made. Diane Gallagher, CNN, back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE) [03:05:00] BRUNHUBER: North Carolina is one of several swing states that could prove crucial in the presidential race. Now the state hasn't been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Barack Obama in 2008, but the latest poll shows a tight contest there with Harris at 49 percent to Trump's 46 percent. Political analysts disagree about whether the turmoil in the governor's race will have an impact on North Carolinians' choice for president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Donald Trump also claimed on Thursday that Israel would cease to exist if Kamala Harris were to win in November and not him. Again, this is something we have heard from Donald Trump.He also continued to argue that he would end the war between Israel and Hamas without offering any specifics. But look, the goal of the pair of events on Thursday evening was for Donald Trump and his campaign to really try and court Jewish Americans who are feeling disaffected by the way that the Biden administration and Kamala Harris as vice president are handling the war in the Middle East. That was the goal of this tonight and it also comes on the heels of Donald Trump having had a tiff with Miriam Adelson, a major mega donor over the summer where one of his top aides had sent a series of angry texts to her. Since then they have repaired their relationship. You saw Miriam Adelson introduce Donald Trump at both events, but this is a very important moment for Donald Trump in a key voting bloc that he is really trying to shore up support with just 47 days left until Election Day.

So let's start there with that Oprah event. What do you make of its potential impact?The fact that it's Oprah and streaming, you know, she herself has such a wide reach and it's sort of an innovative way to reach even more people. It was supposedly aimed at undecided. So do you think it would actually convince anyone who's on the fence or is it just sort of another turnout generator? LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF THE U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAM, CHATHAM HOUSE: I think it's certainly a turnout generator for those who are already either registered Democrats or, you know, sort of are deciding how enthusiastic that they are. And we've seen since Kamala Harris was top of the ticket that enthusiasm amongst Democrats has really arisen. It sort of, you know, went a little bit flat after the Democratic National Convention and came right back again after the debate. So I think it's about keeping that enthusiasm up, hoping that people register, that they go to the polls. The undecided voters, you know, it's very difficult to know how they'll be influenced by this. They might, if you look, unfortunately, at the racial divides in polling in the United States, there is a very significant racial divide in this election. Some people will look at that and feel like it doesn't represent them. Others might. And Kamala Harris, of course, as we know, is trying very much to play to the middle ground in American politics. The fact that she talked about guns in the way that she did was very nuanced, trying not to be too left. And her economic policy is, again, playing to the middle, her desire to cast herself very much as a candidate for all people  is very important in a race where you have fifty three percent of white Americans are coming out in favor you know according to the polls for Donald Trump and obviously that that's it you know that's a data point that doesn't tell us what we need to know because we're worried about swing state voters and how they will move this election in either direction, but it's still constraints that you know that the race is a very significant issue in this election.",

But after nine years, many Germans are saying enough.

Severely sliding in the polls, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz now says he's getting tough. We will utilize all possibilities to carry out entry refusals within the framework of the law, he says, and we've put a concept for effective entry refusal on the table, where we are prepared to do this with the opposition.

Bundeskanzler Scholz, welcome to the club. Other European leaders have vowed to combat Germany's new border regime. This type of action is unacceptable from the Polish point of view. Poland's prime minister said, after all, I have no doubt that it is the internal political situation in Germany which is causing these steps to be implemented and not our policy towards illegal immigration on our borders.

The bank is encouraging people to make plans with loved ones to counteract such scamming attempts. Alright, for more, I'm joined from San Francisco by Josh Constine, venture partner at V.C. firm SignalFire and former \"TechCrunch\" editor-at-large. Great to have your expertise on this disturbing story here. So we're all basically familiar with the old school type of scam where someone calls or emails the victim and claims that the family member is in trouble or in jail or something and needs money. So how does this one work exactly? JOSH CONSTINE, VENTURE PARTNER, SIGNALFIRE, AND FORMER EDITOR-AT- LARGE, \"TECHCRUNCH\": I mean, the question is, am I even really Josh Constine? It used to be that you couldn't believe everything that you read, and now you can't believe everything you hear or see either. These new form of social engineering attacks, which are hacks where instead of attacking the computer system, you trick a human being into actually helping you with the scam, are becoming more and more powerful thanks to A.I. And so essentially what's happening is, scammers will take a clip of your voice from social media, a YouTube video, a podcast, maybe even a news broadcast like this. They'll create a clone of that voice, and then they'll use that to call your loved ones or business partners to try to scam them out of money. And oftentimes, hackers will actually lie in wait. They'll get into your email through a phishing scam. They'll wait till there's a moment where it sounds like you're going to transfer some money or you've got a family member in need and that's when they're going to jump in with a phone call that sounds just like one of your family members or colleagues. And that's why people need to come up with new ways to thwart these threats.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, unbelievable. Just so sophisticated. And it seems to be becoming more common. A recent survey by that bank found that more than a quarter of respondents said that they'd been targeted by an A.I. voice cloning scam in the past 12 months. 46 percent of them weren't aware that type of thing existed, and 8 percent said they would send over as much money as requested by a friend or family member. So just give us a sense of how big a problem this is already right now.",

      "sentences": "You know, a quarter of them, that sounds pretty paranoid. I think a lot of people are just assuming regular scams were actually A.I. powered, but you know, spear phishing and phishing scams like this are a $1 trillion per year business. Actually 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent every day and that's increasing 150 percent per year. It's getting worse fast.And spear phishing where a specific person is targeted rather than just blanketly sending as many of these scam emails as possible, where you target a specific person are actually 500 percent more effective because they seem really authentic. These scammers are going to a lot of work to find out exactly how do you sound, what do you talk about so they can fool your loved ones. You could say that they're spearing no expense.",
