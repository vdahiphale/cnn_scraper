The first is because, of course, they're cut from the same cloth. You know, Putin is a former intelligence officer himself. And so it's important for him to bring, you know, one of his own home.But it's also a really important message to future assassins and future Russian assassination and liquidation teams. And that is go off, do what it is that I tell you to do in a foreign country, which they've been doing quite frequently over the past couple of years. And if you get caught and even if you're sentenced by a legitimate judicial process, don't worry about it. We will be able to get you out. Just hang tough. So this is this is a really chilling reminder of what we're dealing with when we're talking about Russia these days. Truly a pariah state involved in all sorts of violations, not only of international law, but just moral violations. And this is the type of thing that Putin values.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, before I answer that, let me just note an interesting thing right there. You can see two children. We know that among the 24 released today, there are in addition two children. We don't know. I don't think who's who their parents are.But a number of the Russian spies who are being released today from countries like Slovenia, Norway and Poland, they were working as what we call illegals. They had some kind of cover, whether it was as a journalist or some other kind of official -- non-official, of course, very non-official cover. And oftentimes posing as someone from a different country. So those children right there with Vladimir Putin with bouquets of flowers in their arms, we believe that they are the children of at least two of the spies, I believe, who are who are coming home to Russia today. Now, to your question, yes, there is -- there's all kinds of debate about whether Russia is collecting hostages in order to be able to make trades like this, to get people like Krasikov out, to get people like Viktor Bout, the so-called merchant of death, who was who was traded for WNBA star Brittany Griner a couple of years ago. And when Griner was traded for Bout, there was a lot of resistance within the Biden administration, specifically from the Department of Justice, who saw this as a way of incentivizing the kidnapping of people like Paul Whelan -- of Evan Gershkovich. Now, we did hear Jake Sullivan push back against that today. He actually said that he doesn't believe there is any real evidence to suggest that based on an analysis that he says was carried out by Ambassador Roger Carstens, who is the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, who does all of this negotiating around the world. So when asked how they can prevent, you know, this kind of thing from taking place in the future, for Americans getting picked up in the future and then eventually having to be traded, they answered this is why Americans need to follow our suggestions. And right now, of course, the biggest suggestion for Russia is simply don't go there. That is something that is that is told to American civilians, to American businesspeople and to us as journalists as well. It's really drilled into us that you are in dangerous territory if you are in Russia. I believe I heard our Steve Hall say that earlier today that it is a terrible idea to go there so that you don't end up in a situation like this.",

The Russians have a strong preference with stuff that is this sensitive, stuff that they really don't want leaked or out in the press in any way, shape or form to do an intelligence service to intelligence service type of relationship, to use that as the primary vector for these things. And this is, of course, one of the reasons why CIA has people not only in Moscow, but also all over the world, because there is this sense, especially among it's interesting how it is specifically true amongst dictators and people who come from an intelligence background.They think, OK, let's use the CIA channel. Let's use these super secret as they see it. Very clandestine, very, you know, protected channels. And that's the best way to do it. The Russians demand that in these types of things. They certainly have in the past. It doesn't surprise me that they've that they've done that here. Of course, from our perspective, CIA is simply going with the national security, you know, team in Washington and doing what they are told. The director CIA is part of that team, but they're not policymakers. They simply act as the conduit. And that's the way the Russians like it, because of the secrecy and keeping it quiet.",

And these were alliances that under the previous administration had been strained and often criticized.And so these are tangible measures of where these kinds of alliances can produce something quite important. And this is not a military operation. This is a diplomatic victory. So I think Biden will point to this, as will his supporters and supporters of international alliances, as proof that the legacy of the Cold War, the kind of international connections that the United States forged still are very important in 2024.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, this is just a remarkable operation that was carried out. And stunning new details that we are learning about the fact that two months before Ismail Haniyeh was in Tehran, staying at a guest house that he was known to stay at, it appears that a bomb was planted inside that guest house and concealed for the entirety of those two months. And only once it was confirmed that Ismail Haniyeh was in his bedroom in that guest house was that bomb remotely detonated, killing not only him but his bodyguard as well.Now, Hamas and Iran have said that Israel was responsible for this assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in this. But I am also told by this source who was briefed on the matter that Israeli officials briefed U.S. officials yesterday about this operation, but they only briefed them after it had happened. U.S. officials are maintaining that they were not informed ahead of time. The secretary of state said as much yesterday as well, which is also interesting. Now, the guest house in which Ismail Haniyeh was staying in was actually run by and under the protection of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, known as the IRGC. And so this represents a stunning breach of security for them. We should note, of course, that this assassination adds to all of the tensions that we are seeing in the region, and it may very well be the event that tilts this region into deeper, deeper conflict. And that's partly because it's not the only killing of a major Iranian proxy leader that we are seeing in the region. Hours before this assassination, Israel carried out a strike in Beirut, killing Hezbollah's senior-most military commander. And today as well they have now confirmed that they killed Mohammed Deif in an airstrike nearly three weeks ago in Gaza. Mohammed Deif is Hamas's or was Hamas's military, top military commander. The leader of its military wing known as the Qassam Brigade. And so all of this together is putting a picture together of not only what Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu described last night as crushing blows that Israel has delivered to its enemies, but also, of course, all of these events putting this region increasingly on edge and increasingly on the brink of an all-out war.",

I mean, Simone Biles and what she is calling the redemption tour rolls on.The GOAT capturing an historic gold in the all-around competition. It's the sixth gold of her career, more than any American gymnast ever. Hang that thing in the loop. Simone regaining the all-around title that she won in Rio in 2016. So she does something that nobody else has ever done. She's the first woman to win an individual Olympic gymnastics event twice in non- consecutive games. She's 27 years old now. This is the first ever Olympic final, by the way, where two former all-around champs were battling it out. Along there with her teammate Suni Lee. Suni took the bronze. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil took the silver. But here in Paris, Simone now has two gold medals won, but she's not done. She can win three more after where she was rocking this diamond encrusted GOAT chain. She has five moves named after her because no one else can do them. She's the greatest of all time, and she has the chain to prove it. So competition is super hot here. It's heating up, but temperatures are too. Boris, I'm having a really bad hair day today. You know what I'm talking about. But sorry for the spoiler. If anyone hadn't seen it, must tune in. It's incredible to watch what Simone Biles can do.",
