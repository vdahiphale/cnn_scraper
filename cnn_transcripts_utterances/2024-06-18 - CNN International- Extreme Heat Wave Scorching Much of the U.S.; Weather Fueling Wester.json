Another fire in northern California called the Sites fire is also burning out of control. Similar scenes in Los Angeles County, where crews are battling the so-called Post fire.

And they say that at any moment, things can change. And that's why they're so concerned about the wind. And they expect these winds to remain high through Tuesday. So firefighters are saying that they have been able to keep the fire lines, but that it is still very challenging work because of the high speeds of the wind gusts in this area. You're seeing some of the crews here on the ground attempting to put out any hot spots so that you don't get those new fires because of the wind in this area. You're also seeing some of the crews in the sky using these helicopters to do water drops. So it is a joint effort between the different crews in this area to try to gain some containment. Here is what officials are saying about this fire. FLEMMING BERTELSEN, U.S. FOREST SERVICE: It means we're going to be tested, especially tonight. Ridgetop winds are going to be calling for 50-mile-an-hour winds on ridgetops. And during the day, valley winds 25-plus. So we're augured in, and we're making a stand.",

And I'm told that they walked Donald Trump through some of the critical House races that they think he could be helpful in come November.Now, remember, Donald Trump last week traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met with House and Senate Republicans, and he promised them that he would do more, more tele-town halls, more messages of support to try and get these people not only reelected, but to also try to expand their majorities, both in the House and the Senate. And that's really important, not just to lawmakers in Congress, but also to Donald Trump, because if he were to reclaim the White House in November, he's going to need a lot of Republicans to pass his legislative priorities. And so that was the key focus. They said that they wanted to talk about a unified message, about how they can all be on the same page in the next stretch looking forward to Election Day. Now, I also think it's important to note that Donald Trump has been far more hands-off this election cycle than he has been in the past, and that's because in 2022 he endorsed several candidates that went on to win their primaries, only to lose on the day that it counted, which was Election Day in the midterms. And so according to my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign, they tell me that they don't want to get involved in races where they don't think the candidate can actually win. And so they're going to be mapping out where Donald Trump can be lending his support and which races it will really matter. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Bannon is trying to talk to those people who have stuck with Trump from 2016 to 2020 to now. And in a sense, Bannon's message is one of trying to raise the stakes of the election to mobilize the kind of core MAGA base of Trump voters.",

They retreated back into North Korea after the warning shots.Meanwhile, North Korea is rolling out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin. The streets of Pyongyang are lined with Russian flags and banners of the Russian president. He's expected to arrive in the next few hours for his first visit in many years. But the trip is raising concern with the U.S. and its Western allies about North Korea's military support for Russia's war in Ukraine. Live to CNN's Ivan Watson.

This is a chance for Russia to show that it's not isolated as a result of the war in Ukraine. President Putin, by the way, just also had a phone call with Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, which is one of the holdouts from that communique at the Ukrainian peace summit.So they're very much going for these sort of on-the-fence, non-aligned countries trying to build up their own alliances. And the optics of President Putin's face lining the streets, these posters lining the streets of Pyongyang will help with that. But I think concretely it's about, for the West and the concerns that we see from the U.S., it's about the potential quid pro quo here. Take a listen to national security spokesman John Kirby on this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: What we are concerned about, Trevor, is the deepening relationship between these two countries. Not just because of the impacts it's going to have on the Ukrainian people, because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets. But because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean peninsula. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Russia vetoed the extension of a mandate of a panel of experts at the U.N. who monitor violations of North Korea's U.N. sanctions. That mandate has now expired. Those sanctions violations are not being monitored. So North Korea now has this sort of powerful ally, a permanent member on the U.N. Security Council that makes future sanctions very unlikely.
