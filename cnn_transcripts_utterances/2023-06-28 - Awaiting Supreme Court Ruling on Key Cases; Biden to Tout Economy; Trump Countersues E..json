CNN has exclusively learned federal investigators interviewed Giuliani in recent weeks. And, today, Raffensperger is expected to also face questions, this all having to do with the parallel special counsel investigation, if you will, by the Justice Department into Trump's efforts to change the outcome of his 2020 election loss. You will recall Raffensperger was the state official that Donald Trump asked in that phone call to find the votes he said he needed in Georgia.

We still don't know exactly what the focus is. But we know that, months and months ago, Giuliani got a subpoena from federal investigators looking for information about payments he got around the 2020 election. We also know that Jack Smith, the special counsel, has been looking into the whole fake electors scheme, and Giuliani played a role in overseeing the fake electors across seven battleground states. And we also know witnesses are getting questions about what the lawyers around Donald Trump in the wake of the 2020 election were doing in a number of them, including Giuliani, who were spreading baseless claims of election fraud. So these are all areas the special counsel could be probing. And, as you said, we're seeing a lot of activity right now around the January 6 investigation.

We're talking about the past. And what I'm running, I'm running because, America, we're facing challenges with our economy, with our energy policy with national security. There are the challenges going on in the world, what's happening in Russia, Ukraine, what's happening with China. We're in a cold war with China. We're in a -- essentially, in a war with Russia. We have sent everything but troops. And I know that it's -- it's great for President Biden when all we're doing is talking about the past, but I'm running for president against President Biden.

And so now the president's advisers have landed on this Bidenomics messaging push to try and flip those numbers. It is a central political challenge, though, for the president. And it also runs the risk of Republicans appropriating that term to point to the bad elements of the economy and blaming it on the president.
