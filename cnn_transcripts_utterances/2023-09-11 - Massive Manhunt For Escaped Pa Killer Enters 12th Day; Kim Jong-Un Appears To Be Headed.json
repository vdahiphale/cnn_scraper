Danelo Cavalcante was seen at least two times on Friday. By Saturday evening, he had stolen a delivery van from a dairy. According to authorities, he tried to make contact with at least two former acquaintances on one in East Pikeland Township and another in Phoenixville, where he was spotted on a ring camera.On Sunday morning, police found the van he apparently abandoned after it ran out of gas. It was more than 20 miles from where authorities had been focusing their search efforts. In that time, he also changed his appearance. He shaved his beard and cut his hair and was wearing different clothing. CNN's Danny Freeman is joining us now from Chester County, Pennsylvania. A lot to unpack here. It looks like a very different person from the person who initially escaped from jail.",

And frankly, it was also one where there were a number of major setbacks when it comes to bringing Cavalcante back into custody.But really to understand why, you got to go back to Friday and Saturday, because just a few miles from where we are at the command post, that was where the bulk of the perimeter had been for the multiple days prior to this weekend. And think about it, this was the largest amount of law enforcement presence that we had seen on Friday going into Saturday. Troopers were searching cars. They were searching trunks, all in that area. That was the environment that Cavalcante was able to escape. So here's more of what we learned yesterday. Basically on Sunday, the Pennsylvania State Police told us that Cavalcante was able to slip through that perimeter likely on Saturday. And then, as you mentioned, he was able to steal a van from a nearby dairy farm. And he was able to do that because the keys were left inside of that van. He then drove 20 miles to the Phoenixville, Pennsylvania area to the north. And that's when he was caught on camera trying to enlist the help of an old associate of his. The associate did not ultimately help him, instead turned over ring camera footage of Cavalcante at his doorstep to the authorities. And that's where we saw this new image, clean shave and wearing a greenish or yellowish hoodie. Then on Sunday morning, police actually discovered that van, but it was abandoned and Cavalcante was nowhere to be found. Sara, I want you to take a listen, though, to some sound that we have with a former roommate of Cavalcante. Listen how he describes his feeling as this manhunt continues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it has been days to get as high up in the Atlas Mountains, a very difficult place to reach. What we're showing you here is also where you can see just some of the destruction. Mountains of concrete covering streets in parts of Morocco this morning. Country's strongest earthquake in 120 years that hit late Friday night.Here's a map to show you the destruction and how far it reached the 6.8 magnitude quake. The purple area that you see, that's the epicenter we're talking about in the Atlas Mountains. Areas marked with the yellow there though, they also felt very strong quakes and shakes just to show how far out this disaster is reaching. Nearly 2,500 people are reported to be dead so far. And nearly that very same number are reported injured. Rescuers are hitting the outer limits of that initial 72-hour time frame that's always discussed when it's most likely for survivors to be found amongst the rubble. Joining us now to talk about efforts to bring aid and assistance all along the way is Ozan Agbas, he's with Doctors Without Borders.

However, we also know from the reports that those are the most affected areas. BOLDUAN: Absolutely. And have you -- how are they describing what they are seeing?

And we see this in Morocco as well now, especially in those villages, shelter is definitely coming up as one of the highest needs. People are sleeping outside.And even though the weather conditions might be mild or more available in the cities, it is quite rough when it comes to the mountain villages, especially at night, it gets really cold. So that is one of the main concerns. Food is a concern. However, there's a tremendous effort put together by the civil society, the communities around this region, and they are providing some food to the victims. However, we also see the needs around water, particularly safe, clean water, especially if the boreholes or wells are affected in the villages we see then people are cut off from water support or from water services that they would normally have. And lastly, quite important and vital support is on the medical side. Now I have to reiterate that what we see on the ground is a great effort from the government of Morocco to provide those services.

And despite the fact that, yes, usually when you can't find a broader agreement on a one year spending bill, the fix is to work together with the Senate to pass something for a couple of weeks, just to give you a little extra negotiating room. But even that is going to be a huge lift for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. That's because he has some on his right flank who are arguing that they won't support a short term CR, including Chip Roy.He is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and we just spoke with him moments ago. He said that he does not support a short term CR because he wants to see broader changes to border security. He also wants to see significant cuts in spending and promises to do so in the future. So that is just giving you a sense of what Kevin McCarthy is facing when it comes to the broader spending fight that's happening on Capitol Hill. This week, the House of Representatives is going to try to advance a defense spending bill that is just one of 12 appropriations bills with Republican support. But even that is going to be, again, a heavy lift because aides that I'm talking to say the votes aren't there yet. And there are going to have to be negotiations and conversations that happen with both members on his right flank and members who are running in swing districts to find a way forward on just passing that one small bill. So that gives you a sense here, John, of the divides between the House and the Senate and even within the Republican Conference. John?",
