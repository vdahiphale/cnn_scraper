The fate of student loans right now is uncertain as the justices soon decide whether or not President Biden's debt forgiveness program can take effect. The plan would erase up to $20,000 in loan payments for borrowers. And with more than 40 million eligible borrowers in limbo, $400 billion of taxpayer money is on the line. Will the Court block Biden's plan.  Plus was a website designer's free speech violated by a law in Colorado? The designer opposes same sex marriage. And if the Court rules in her favor, civil rights groups are worried it could leave the door open for business owners to deny services, not just to same sex couples but even along racial and religious lines.Let's bring in CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica.

Ukraine does have good intelligence sources within Russian ranks clearly but he says he's aware that the FSB that's the Russian security services have been tasked with assassinating Yevgeny Prigozhin. And he says whether that's successful or not, we'll see over time.Now, the mere prospect that this is being raised suggests I think it's fair to say that we really don't know how well they're supposed to deal between Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led an armed rebellion against Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin is indeed going. In fact, one of the key tenants of that deal was that Prigozhin was supposed to go to Belarus and stay there, possibly with his Wagner fighters as well. But a man who's notoriously not publicity shy has not emerged in Belarus. Its president has said he's there. But there have been unconfirmed sightings of him in St. Petersburg, planes affiliated with him have gone Moscow, St. Petersburg, Minsk and back again, so a lot to suggest. But he's certainly not settled in a quiet hotel in Minsk. But the broader question here is, who knew what, when really. And if the FSB were as some intelligence officials in the West have suggested getting hints of this perhaps ahead of the plot? Why did they not act beforehand if Russian military had an inkling? Why did they not act beforehand? Why potentially, are we seeing this order coming out now? A lot to be answered and all of it undermines Putin's grip on power. Kate.",

They talked about the possibility of executive actions and also met with civil rights groups, education groups to try to feel out, and hear what they thought other alternative actions could be and what their concerns would be moving forward, as well. Ultimately, for the time being that they have landed on the Education Department issuing guidance to colleges and universities to try to ensure diversity in their student body. They're also planning on holding this summit in the coming months with students and also educational leaders to talk about affirmative action as President Biden; he made clear in those remarks that this cannot be the last fight when it comes to the issue of affirmative action. But in addition to this case from yesterday, the Whitehouse is also bracing for a huge decision from the Supreme Court today on the fate of President Biden's student loan program. You'll remember he rolled that out last summer trying to make good on a campaign promise. And this is a program that could affect roughly 40 million student borrowers. Now, behind the scenes, the Whitehouse has been preparing for various scenarios over the course of the past few months. That includes coming up with contingency plans, some possible different policy outcomes that they could relate to people if the Supreme Court were to strike this down. If the Supreme Court lets it stand, the administration's attention would turn to trying to get that debt relief out to student borrowers as quickly as possible.
