We have got one big development after another in that Georgia election subversion case against the former president and his 18 co-defendants. And tonight, we are learning that Rudy Giuliani is set to meet with Fulton County District Attorney's Office tomorrow to discuss a bond agreement. That's according to multiple sources. And I will talk tonight with a Giuliani adviser about what is ahead for him. Plus, with Trump's surrender looming, new bond agreements and last- minute legal maneuvers, how a top member of the Trump White House and a former DOJ official are both trying to avoid arrest tonight. Which of Donald Trump's 18 co-defendants did surrender today? And who reached bail agreements with the Fulton County D.A.? And we've got new developments in the Mar-a-Lago case as well. And with 2024 just around the corner, President Joe Biden has named the new White House counsel, as he's facing a special counsel investigation into his own handling of classified documents and the Hunter Biden investigation as well, as House Republicans eyeing a potentially impeachment inquiry. We've got much more to come on all of that. But we begin tonight with a big night of Trump legal news. Here's -- first of all, there is Mark Meadows, who was Trump's right-hand man in the waning days of his administration, and former top DOJ Official Jeffrey Clark, both of them trying to move their state cases into federal court so that they do not have to surrender by this noon Friday deadline, that, as the first two of the former president's co- defendants surrender today at the Fulton County Jail. John Eastman, the right wing attorney who advised Trump on how to subvert the election, and Scott Hall, a bail bondsmen and a pro-Trump poll watcher in Atlanta. Now, meanwhile, we have a new filing in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. Special Counsel Jack Smith's office is investigating whether to Trump employees gave a false testimony to a grand jury. We will get to that this hour as well. Plus, Rudy Giuliani is set to meet with the Fulton County District Attorney's Office tomorrow to discuss a bond agreement. Former New York police Commissioner Bernie Kerik has been working with the former mayor to help him find a Georgia lawyer to represent him in this case. But to start out tonight, I want to bring in an adviser to Giuliani himself. Joining me now is Ted Goodman. Ted, thank you for joining us. We did just learn tonight that Giuliani is expected to meet with the Fulton County D.A.'s office tomorrow. How soon do you expect that he will surrender in this case? TED GOODMAN, RUDY GIULIANI'S POLITICAL ADVISER: Look, I don't know who is giving you that information but what I can tell you is that -- I am not going to talk about the mayor's movements for security purposes, however, discussions are happening.

And he is representing a couple of witnesses who may be called to testify at this trial.And what emerges in this filing is, it sort of gives an explanation of why prosecutors added those additional charges against the former president and against these other aides. And they say this information came from this I.T. worker. His name is Yussel Tavares. And he was also represented by Stan Woodward, the same Trump-funded lawyer. And after he made those initial statements saying he didn't know anything about the surveillance tapes, he changed his story after he got a new lawyer, a public defender and said that not only was the president involved, but Walt Nauta and of course Carlos de Oliveira, who was the property manager, implicated all of them in this effort to allegedly delete the surveillance tape.
