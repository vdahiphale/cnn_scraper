Voters are turning out in record numbers this week in the run-off between Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democrat, and Herschel Walker, the Republican. On Tuesday, Democrats will find out if Warnock is headed back to the Senate, giving his party some breathing room as they try this month to pass key priorities before Republicans take over the House of Representatives in January. Now, this week, we got a hint of what a Republican-controlled House could look like, as a handful of lawmakers on the fringe of the Republican Party, frankly, vowed to block Leader Kevin McCarthy's bid for speaker, while the party squirms around former President Trump's dinner with notorious antisemites and Holocaust deniers and Trump's refusal to disavow them or assail their twisted ideologies and, as if that weren't enough, Trump's new call Saturday to -- quote -- \"terminate\" rules in the Constitution so as to reinstall him as president. Coming up, we will talk about December priorities with Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who is set to defend his seat in two years in increasingly red state Ohio, plus Republican and congressman-elect Mike Lawler, who is warning his Republican colleagues not to cause chaos on their first day in charge. But we begin today's show with foreign policy and a remarkably strong uprising against authoritarian governments in China and Iran, while, here in the U.S., President Biden underscored ties with European allies and the unified West's opposition to Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Joining us now to discuss, Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Secretary Blinken, thanks so much for joining us. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  Good morning, Jake.",

Now, I know the White House says that such a move could have unintended consequences, such as delaying food exports. But, frankly, the government of Ukraine isn't buying that explanation.

Then he engaged in a land grab in Eastern Ukraine and Southern Ukraine. That's been failing because the Ukrainian military has been pushing back and taking back a lot of the territory that Putin gained. Now, to your point, what he's doing is trying to weaponize winter, turn out the lights, turn off the heat, put the Ukrainian people into darkness and cold just as they head into the winter months. This is indeed barbaric. We're pushing back very strongly in our support for Ukraine, making sure that they're getting the missile defenses they need, working on getting them the different pieces for their energy infrastructure that they need, as Putin tries to destroy it. As to sanctions, we have leveled unprecedented sanctions against Russia, unprecedented export controls, all of that in coordination with dozens of countries. I just got back from meetings in NATO. The solidarity among the NATO partners, the G7 partners is very strong and resolute. So, we're constantly looking at different measures that we can take to, as necessary, increase the pressure. We're working with Congress right now on legislation that would help us get around some of the challenges of using the state sponsor of terrorism designation, which, as you said, has some unintended consequences.",

We see, across their economy, devastating effects from the sanctions that only grow. And, in particular, if you're looking at Russia's efforts to modernize its economy, whether it comes -- whether it's energy technology, whether it's its basic telecommunications, infrastructure, whether it's its defense and aerospace industry, every single day that goes by with these sanctions in place, the burden on Russia gets heavier and heavier, its ability to prosecute these kinds of wars gets weaker and weaker.",

Now, I know the U.S. supports the rights of all people to protest, but specifically on the zero COVID protesters in China, does the Biden administration support the protesters in China? BLINKEN:  Of course we do. We support the right people everywhere, whether it's in China, whether it's Iran, whether it's anyplace else, to protest peacefully, to make known their views, to vent their frustrations. And as that repressed in one way or another in any given country, we speak out against it, we stand up against it, and we take action against it. In the case of Iran, we have worked very hard to impose sanctions on those responsible for the crackdown on mostly Iranian women, who've been leading these -- in an incredibly courageous way, these protests since the death of Mahsa Amini, as well as trying to make sure that Iranians have in their hands the communications technology to allow them to continue to talking to each other and connected to the outside world.

It is critically important.There are obviously significant challenges with both programs going forward. We need to ensure that the trust fund is sustainable. And so I think we need to evaluate what needs to be done. Frankly, I think there should be a blue-ribbon commission, much like was done back in the '80s, a bipartisan commission, to evaluate the long term aspect of Social Security and Medicare. But we have a responsibility to fulfill our commitments there. And so my objective is to make sure that they are sustainable for the long term.",
