Officials shut down schools and canceled hundreds of flights, train routs and and ferry crossings due to the heavy rains and flooding. The former typhoon swept across the Korean Peninsula Thursday after pummeling southern Japan twice. Khanun is now weakening as it continues over land and into North Korea. Northern China also seeing rain from the tropical storm. That, as it recovers from flooding and record rains from Typhoon Doksuri that hit about two weeks ago.

That is the storm system that we're most concerned about for the next couple of days.Still some spots though that picked up almost 300 millimeters of rainfall. Not quite that much here, but we can see the flooding there in South Korea. And there's still going to be a little bit of rainfall left, a little bit -- a couple of centimeters really for anybody. All eyes on this eye, so to speak. This is Lan, Typhoon Lan and in just a few hours forecast to be a 215 kilometer per hour storm as it's in now very warm water. Much less of a storm as it gets to the north but still will be a typhoon making landfall likely in Japan. Yesterday it was a little bit far to the curve to the right, maybe missing. Not today, we're kind of back in the middle of where that cone was yesterday. An awful lot of rain coming in. And also some win of course, coming in with Lan across the next couple of hours. And to the matter -- as we look at Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the winds will begin to pick up and pick up and pick up, and then obviously we're going to get some landfall here. Those were the European models that I was just showing you and the rainfall could be heavy, those white spots in there. That's 500 millimeters of rainfall.

The small city of Bazhou where 0the protest took place, was a deliberately flooded by authorities following a government disaster plan aimed at protecting bigger cities like Beijing and Tianjin. At two a.m. on August 1st, authorities activated a flood control plan, releasing water from dams into flood storage and detention zones. They then had to evacuate more than 800,000 people living in those zones, which quickly flooded. State TV showed the Communist Party chief of Hebei Province touring the disaster area, instructing subordinates to reduce flooding pressure on Beijing and vowing to resolutely be the capital's moat.
