Heading into the remarks, senior advisors to the Vice President said they wanted to target undecided voters. Those voters who may still be on the fence, like disaffected Republicans or those who are just fatigued by former President Donald Trump.And over the course of her remarks, the Vice President laid out her policies and proposals on a number of issues, including on immigration, on health care, on reproductive rights. As she did so, she compared each of those to the priorities of former President Donald Trump. Essentially casting him as consumed by revenge or in the case of the military as someone disrespectful to the military service. Now, the vice president did, of course, spend some time talking about January 6th. That speech back in January 6th of 2021 by former President Donald Trump leading to supporters storming the U.S. Capitol. Now she talked about, again, the former president being focused on what she called, quote, the enemies list versus her to do list for Americans. And what was telling about the remarks was how much time she was spending introducing and reintroducing herself. At one point saying that many of those that were watching may not know her well yet. [04:05:00] A recognition of her truncated campaign, but also her explaining that she has not spent all of her political career in Washington, calling back to her time also in California. And to that end, the vice president saying that she would welcome other opinions and include those who disagree with her at what she called a seat at the table. So again, the vice president and her team seeing these remarks as the kick start to the homestretch of the election as she again tries to peel off those Republican voters and former President Donald Trump, but also convince those that the campaign believes still needs some convincing.

That's the computerized forecast of how much precip is going to come down. Now, there's going to be obviously flooding damage, but this is a wind event. Everything has a certain factor. Is it a wind? Is it a surge? Is it a flood? We know the one that moved through the Philippines didn't have much wind, but it certainly had flooding just last week. So this is what we're seeing here as the wind and the surge will probably be equal to or not even greater than the flooding potential here. An awful lot of wind damage here. Many spots here, all the way even into China, are going to see tropical cyclone winds somewhere maybe even over 100 kilometers per hour and then on up toward Kyushu. Now, Taiwan is no stranger to these big things. Since, like, 1950, there have been 30 Taiwan landfalls of what's an equivalent of a Category 4 or 5 Atlantic hurricane.

But this year we've already had two, and really another, but Krathon and also Gaemi has already taken its toll there in damage across the eastern parts of Taiwan. There's going to be more. Obviously, we could even still see this continue to increase in intensity, probably likely go down before landfall, but we're still going to have to watch this.

The statements from the IDF spokesperson said that they're, quote, trying to understand why so many people were in Beit Lahiya at the time. They say that they had given the order to residents to evacuate several weeks earlier.In fact, just last week, we had one IDF representative saying that they'd believed that there was no population in that area. Now, they say that they were targeting a suspected terrorist and that they had no intention of collapsing the building. Now, we don't know what kind of bomb they used to kill this one terrorist, but clearly bringing down a multi-story residential building was a significant arsenal. Now, it has been condemned across the board. [04:25:00] We've heard the United Nations Human Rights Office saying that it's one of the deadliest attacks that we've seen in nearly three months. The director of the hospital nearby, Kamal Adwan, where all of the injured and dead were going to, said that the hospital simply cannot cope, that there were injured on the floor in the hospitals, that many of their medical staff have been arrested or detained by Israel or forcibly evacuated. So they desperately need more medical staff, saying there's not a single ambulance in the area either, saying, quote, those who can reach Kamal Adwan Hospital receive first aid, but those who cannot die in the streets. This is our reality, an utterly catastrophic situation in every sense of the word. Now, more than 93, as you say, have been killed at this point. That's confirmed, but the death toll could be higher, as we see from footage on the ground and those that we have spoken to, that there are still many underneath the rubble that they simply cannot get to because they are trying to get to people with their bare hands. There's no heavy equipment. It has also been condemned by the Biden administration. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller speaking yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: We are deeply concerned by the loss of civilian life in this incident. This was a horrifying incident with a horrifying result. I can't speak to the total death toll, but there are reports of two dozen children killed in this incident. No doubt a number of them are children who have been fleeing the effects of this war for more than a year now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, of course, this is in an area in northern Gaza that we know that Israel has been operating in for several weeks now.They have been trying to evacuate hundreds of thousands of residents out of the area. We know that there is very little humanitarian aid getting into the area. We have heard this from the health officials that are still in that area. So it really is a very desperate situation for the residents that are still there. Now, the Israeli military says they are investigating what happened at this point. At very least, it does appear as though it was a very significant intelligence failure not to know that there was still a significant number of residents in that particular area -- Max, Christina.",
