And the fact that he's supporting Donald Trump and will not be in the way of Donald Trump, I think, is important. It's marginal. It's not a huge thing. But I think they do have to be careful.

And we've seen that women have been galvanized, regardless of what side of the aisle they subscribe to, they've been galvanized around women's reproductive rights, access, and choice. Women want to be able to make those decisions for themselves. Between them, whoever their partner is, and their good lord.At this point, there is a pressure from conservatives to have government intervene in something that has for a very long time been fought for women in privacy rights. And I think that in as much as the Democrats can continue to carry that mantle, can continue to talk to women across multiple demographics about why they need to stand forward, in addition to bringing in men, there are several men-led organizations, Men for Choice being one of them, that is laying out the advocacy points for men as to how this affects their lives as well. We can't talk about the economy, we can't talk about women's roles in it without also talking about them and family planning. Birth control and access to birth control options are a huge part of women's reproductive rights. And the Republican Party has decided that they are going to fight this war on women no matter what.

People who fight for civil rights, people who fight for the betterment of their country, people who fight for education, access, and equity in terms of employment, in terms of housing, in terms of security. These are very patriotic goals. People who want to uphold democracy not only here but also abroad. These are things that are the cornerstones of who we are. And for Democrats, it is making sure that they make that claim. And for the longest, they think that, unfortunately, they allowed a seeding of patriotism to the Republicans. And at this point, they are taking it back. They are being very outspoken about it.

She was convicted of voter fraud after casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election while under supervised release from prison. Earlier this year, a Texas appeals court overturned her conviction and it seemed like it was all behind her. That is until now. An appeals court is granting the Tarrant County district attorney request to take another look.But let me be clear about something. This woman cast was called a provisional ballot. Let me explain a little bit about what that is precisely. When there is any question about whether you are eligible to vote, we look to a federal law called HAVA. It stands for Help America Vote Act of 2002. And under that law, any U.S. resident should always be able to cast a provisional ballot even if their registration status is not clear. Now, it does not mean the ballot has to be counted. It's a conditional ballot. It will only be counted if they're actually eligible. Now, election officials will try to verify voters' identity and eligibility to vote by looking at the voter rolls or verifying signatures. Are they actually registered? Are they voting in the right jurisdiction? Are they supposed to be voting there? Is that a real signature? They may also require additional information from the voter. And they can also require an affidavit like this one in Texas. If they can verify identity, eligibility, they count it. If they can't, they won't. And even if they are counted, they are counted last. Now, this woman, Crystal, she filed a provisional ballot, but she was also on supervised release for Texas, for tax evasion in the federal courts. Now, in Texas, you cannot vote while on supervised release because your sentence is not technically over. Now, she says she did not know she was ineligible because of that. Apparently, election officials did, and they didn't count her ballot. Crystal Mason and her attorney, Justin Moore, join me now. Crystal, just going through this and thinking about how this was a provisional ballot that was not ultimately counted, this case appeared over -- over when your sentence was overturned and you were acquitted. How are you feeling now that it's being looked at again? CRYSTAL MASON, CHARGED, CONVICTED, AND THEN ACQUITTED FOR ATTEMPTING TO CAST A VOTE WHILE ON FEDERAL SUPERVISED RELEASED DURING 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION:  Overwhelmed.

It's mind-blowing to me that this is someone who has so much on her plate and has her own attacks that are coming at her, yet for whatever reason, she still has energy to pour into others. And so, as she continuously says that it's important to lift others up, I just wanted the people to know that she believed that because ultimately, I don't think this election is about qualifications. All right, like, Donald Trump is wild and ridiculous, right? I think this comes down to who people like the best. And what we knew early on in the polling was that people were getting excited about her, but they didn't feel like they knew her.

Well, now, in less than a week, Hunter will get his turn to compete for gold in the Paralympics, and they both join me now. I think we were so excited for you, Tara, and we were so excited when it happened. And then to see the two of you following your career for a long time, it was such a beautiful moment. Bring us into that moment. What did it mean to you to get that immense support from your husband, someone you've known since high school, who is an Olympian in his own right? DAVIS-WOODHALL:  Yes, it was honestly a moment of a lifetime. I mean, I've been dreaming of this moment since I was four years old, since I started track and field. So, being able to accomplish this, it meant everything. And then to have my partner here there, you know, we've been working so hard this season to get to this moment right here, it was just such a special interaction between us. And -- I don't know, it was just a moment in time that we'll probably never get back, but now there's videos and pictures of it forever. (LAUGHTER)",

We actually are leaving for Paris tomorrow or the next day, I guess, rather, and this will be my third Paralympic Games. Every year, I've been able to learn something new. Tara and I got married in 2022. Since then, we've been training together every single day. We cook together. We recover together. So, we really have done this whole entire process as a team. So just being there for each other and being able to celebrate in that moment and put on display all the hard work we've done is like -- it's so incredible.
