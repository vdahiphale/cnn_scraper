The stage is set for tonight's big speech from President Joe Biden, perhaps the biggest of his presidency. In just a few hours, he is set to deliver a State of the Union address that have to navigate some pessimism about the economy, anxiety over record immigration frustrations with the Israel-Hamas war and growing concerns about him personally, about his age with those hurdles complicating Biden's path to reelection and a looming rematch with former President Donald Trump. Dozens of top Biden allies want him to unleash his inner hulk to start being more aggressive on camera when he makes the case for a second term. Let's start this hour at the White House with CNN's MJ Lee. MJ, Biden is facing huge policy implications, huge political implications tonight. What should we expect from his speech?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Boris. Without a question, this is going to be one of the most pivotal speeches that President Biden delivers as president. And so much of that, of course, has to do with timing and the moment that he is in, in terms of the huge issues that he is confronting both abroad and here at home and we definitely expect that throughout the speech, he is going to for one look back on his accomplishments over the last three years and also try to paint a picture of what a second term of the Biden presidency would look like. And he's going to use a lot of these policy ideas to make that point.We know that he is going to be talking about, for example, the situation in Israel. The state of the economy, of course, is expected to be a big feature of this speech. He'll talk about other things like reproductive rights and the situation at the border. Another critical issue that his base very much cares about and the rest of the country, of course, has been critical about him - with him on. And the White House has, we should mention teed up a number of announcements that will be unveiled in tonight's speech as well, including, for example, raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent. And one way in which we are going to get a pretty good sense of the top policy and political priorities for this White House and this president is by looking at the guests who the First Lady has invited to join for tonight's speech, including, of course, Kate Cox. This is the woman who was denied an abortion in the state of Texas. We'll see Shawn Fain, the head of the UAW. Just goes to that base that we were talking about and part of that key coalition for the President. And also a woman named Jazmin Cazares. She is the sister of someone who was killed at a school mass shooting. Of course, gun violence is a domestic priority that the President has talked about a lot over the course of the first term. And keep in mind, this is going to be us hearing President Biden deliver this important speech, but also presidential candidate Joe Biden as well. And to that end, we do expect to hear a good amount of finger pointing at Republicans when it comes to policy issues and just a lot of drawing of that contrast between the vision for - vision that he has for this country and the vision that he says is broken that Donald Trump has for this country as well, Boris?",

They want that Biden out there.Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, really top Biden allies saying to me, you got to hear it from the candidate himself. That's what the question is here. It's about showing the - is Biden tough enough that he needs to answer that question, not just in tonight's speech, but overall, as we head into this campaign year. And, of course, it's all about calibration. Brian Schatz, another big Biden supporter, a senator from Hawaii said to me, you can't be at 11 out of 10 on the alarm scale for the next eight months. But on the other hand, there needs to be this sense that Biden is there, is engaging, is showing that there is the enthusiasm for reelecting him and also, of course, answering some of the questions that are there about his age and whether he's up to the job.",

Those are the words that are coming out from White House officials today.We will see what this actually comes to. But, of course, last year, Joe Biden had a pretty good speech from the view of the White House and that moment where he engaged with the Republicans when they started jeering him and got them to, it seemed like, jeer the idea of cutting Social Security and Medicare, which had been part of some Republicans' proposals and then said, I enjoy conversion. That was a really good moment in the minds of the White House aides and of the President himself. They are hoping that they'll get another moment like that tonight. My sources tell me that they looked for a couple of places where they could trap Republicans into that. We'll see how it all goes down.",

They were even seen passing out buttons beforehand that said, say \"her name, Laken Riley.\" The House Republican Conference was also passing out buttons that said, \"Biden border crisis.\"So clearly, they are trying to time this vote in conjunction with the State of the Union address tonight. But Democrats said this was just a way to sort of exploit a death that happened. And that is why you saw so many Democrats ultimately vote against it. But I talked to Marjorie Taylor Greene. She is a member from Georgia, where Laken Riley is from. And she said that all of her Democratic colleagues in the state delegation voted against this bill, and that she is going to make sure that voters in the state remember it.

The data, though, when you scale back doesn't show that immigrants, whether legal or not, are more likely to commit murder or more likely to commit violent crime than American citizens.And the way it's described by folks like former President Donald Trump, who's now the Republican nominee ostensibly for president, is that Hannibal Lecter is crossing the border. The folks that are coming into the country are out just to kill and maim and rob and destroy. Being someone that comes from an immigrant community, being someone who is an immigrant yourself from an immigrant family, does that concern you that that rhetoric damages what is supposed to be one of the key parts of the American dream that you can come here from anywhere in a legal fashion and find success?",

And in there, in that mass, there is a criminal element that's entering the United States.Look, in Miami, we had a former Venezuelan police officer that was kidnapped, arrested, and taken and murdered by gang members of something called Tren de Aragua, which is a gang that originated in a notorious prison in Venezuela. They're being let loose. They go, they cross the Darien, they get into the United States. And that's just one example of what's happening here in the United States. We're not saying that every immigrant coming in the United States is a criminal. I know that I've spoken to them, that most - the majority are coming here for the American dream. They need to be doing it in a legal fashion. But in that mass of millions of people, there is a criminal element. And yes, that is putting American lives at risk, Laken Riley is just an example of that. That poor former police officer from Venezuela in Miami is another example of that.

There's no free election, no freedom of expression, no freedom of religion. You've got thousands of people that are political prisoners. You've got 10s of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people that maybe have perished in the Florida straits and trying to cross to reach our shores in the United States to find freedom.

      "sentences": "So, Boris, it just started. We're about, I don't know, 15 minutes or so into this meeting. This is the private investigator, the investigator that was hired by the city of Uvalde back in July of 2022 out of concern that there was a cover up here by the Department of Public Safety, the DA that they were not getting enough information.And so the mayor at the time decided that he needed to start his own investigation, and he hired a former police detective from Austin, Texas, a man by the name of Jesse Prado. He's a 25-year veteran of the Austin Police Department. He did this investigation. And now nearly two years later, we're starting to see the results of it. And finally, today we are getting our first indications of what he found. And certainly so far already, he's been testifying at the city council hearing that there were failures. We know that there were failures, but we've not gone into any of the intricate details of exactly how the officers of the Uvalde Police Department failed in their duties that day. What we do know, based on body camera footage and other evidence and other information that we have reported on, is that three of the Uvalde police officers, a lieutenant, a sergeant, another police officer, were some of the first officers on scene that day. They were in the hallway as the gunman was shooting. And as they were in the hallway approaching the classroom, the gunman was firing through the walls and they retreated and then basically went back again and then retreated again. And they've been criticized by other investigators, certainly by the Department of Justice and by the Department of Public Safety in their investigation, for not going in that classroom, for retreating. And sort of how they had described it was that the momentum had stopped. In those first few minutes when they got to the scene, those officers should have kept going and should have gone inside that classroom to try and stop the gunman. And we know they didn't, and ultimately officers would wait for an hour before they went in. The other thing obviously that we have heard a lot about from the Department of Justice report, and now what's happening inside, is the lack of leadership that day. The chiefs that were on scene that day, from the school police chief to the acting police chief with the Uvalde Police Department on that day, that didn't take any kind of leadership role to insist that their officers go inside, that they form a team and that they go inside. [15:25:07] So that is some of what we are starting to hear, that there was a lack of leadership, that there was failures that day. We've not gotten any indication into exactly what each of the officers from the Uvalde Police Department did that day or how, if at all, they're going to be held responsible for their actions that day. Important in all of this, obviously, is the families. They are here today. There's a number of them inside. They are expected to speak at some point. They want accountability. They want some of these officers fired, disciplined and it's not entirely clear at this point if any of that is going to happen. So certainly as this day progresses, this is something that the families are going to be speaking about. But certainly to have this report finally, nearly two years later, from the Uvalde Police Department, from their investigators, is going to be significant.",
