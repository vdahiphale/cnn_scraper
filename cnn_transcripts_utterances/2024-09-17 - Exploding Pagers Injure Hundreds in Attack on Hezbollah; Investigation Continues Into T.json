Now, I spoke with several of Donald Trump senior advisers today and also, of course, over the last 48 hours or so. And they said, look, of course, there's going to be enhanced security measures this week. Yesterday, we know that the acting Secret Service director, Ronald Rowe. He met with many Trump officials yesterday in Florida, but he also met directly with the former president. I was told from people who were read out on that meeting that it was a cordial meeting. It was very short, but that Rowe walked Donald Trump through different security options that they have and ones that they will make available to them. Now, Trump's team says, even though there is expected to be enhanced security this week at these different events, they won't go into detail into what those are, but, of course, makes sense. I mean, this is a very sensitive issue right now, but they did say keep your eye out. Tonight, Donald Trump will be in Flint, Michigan, for a town hall. It's being moderated by Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. They said, keep an eye on that event. You will maybe see some heightened security measures, especially for the reporters like me and Kristen Holmes, who are often on the events and we track these things. But later this week, he's also -- tomorrow, he's going to Uniondale, New York. Thursday, he will be in Washington, D.C., Saturday, North Carolina, so still an aggressive schedule. And just one thing, though, I think, I want to make very clear here is that what we're seeing now is Donald Trump acting very differently in light of what happened on Sunday compared to what happened in the aftermath of Butler. We saw back then that Donald Trump and his team had called for unity. Donald Trump himself said that he was a changed man. This time, he's been much more immediate in trying to cast the blame on Democrats and using the rhetoric of saying their rhetoric is what has led to some of these assassination attempts or apparent assassination attempts. And so I think you will hear a lot of that rhetoric this week.",

Now, of course, this is an interview that follows one -- that in late July that former President Donald Trump did with the National Association of Black Journalists. If you recall, it was then that the former president called into question the vice president's racial identity. Now, up until this point, the vice president has really chalked this up to the same old tire playbook by the former president. So we will see if she goes any deeper on that today when put in a similar setting that the former president was in. Now, the campaign, their focus today is really on making an aggressive push for young voters on National Voter Registration Day. They have announced plans to be on college campuses, to be online to try to get younger voters registered to vote and also backing their campaign. Now, I will tell you that they are quite excited about an endorsement that came in and over the last hour by Billie Eilish. She endorsed the vice president's campaign. And the campaign tells me they were aware that she was preparing to do that and that all of it is part of this broader effort to get younger voters registered to vote. Now, the vice president later this week also headed to Michigan and Wisconsin, two states that President Joe Biden only narrowly won in 2020, so a big push this week for voter registration, but also for her to have this unscripted moment here with the National Association of Black Journalists.",

Who uses a pager? This is something that Hezbollah started doing because they believe that their phones had been compromised in terms of intercepts by Israeli intelligence. So this was a way to communicate, they thought, securely. These pagers started exploding. And before we go to the video, just warn people this is a little graphic and may be disturbing, but these were people on street corners. They were people in stores. Here's a man in the supermarket. The pager appears to be in his bag or on his belt. It explodes. He goes down and he doesn't get up. The people around him do not appear to be injured. These pagers all seem to go off at about the same time. Watch the man who is about to pay at this counter. He's standing there. He reads a message coming in on the pager and then it functions. So that suggests to us that the detonation was sent as a message. There he is looking at it, and then the device functions. So this is extraordinarily remarkable in terms of tradecraft.

Who was the vendor? Is it a vendor we have used before? From the espionage standpoint, you have to say, did they manufacture a device, create a company, pose as a Lebanese vendor, sell it to Hezbollah? Or, as Juliette said, did they interrupt the supply chain, get the delivery before it went to Hezbollah, change the internal workings, which is, they had to put a small amount of high explosives inside, they had to put an initiator inside, and then the software that would accept that command detonation simultaneously for thousands?

And just picking up on what John said, this -- look, you go after terrorist groups through a number of ways. We have seen the leadership being -- trying to take out in Hamas, including in Iran, as we saw earlier. Going after the communications network is the single most effective ploy or activity that a country can do, because, one, it leads to paranoia and suspicion about how they will communicate. They can't plan. They don't know who's alive, who's dead, where everyone is. They don't know how to address people or how to regroup.
