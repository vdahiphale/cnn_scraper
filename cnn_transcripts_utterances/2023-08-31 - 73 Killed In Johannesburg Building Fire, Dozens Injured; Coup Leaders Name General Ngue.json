The U.S. says Russia and North Korea are actively advancing an arms deal. UEFA's president finally speaks out about embattled Spanish Football Chief Luis Rubiales. And Swiss Bank UBS posts a huge profit, but challenges lie ahead. Officials in Johannesburg say there is no indication a fire that killed at least 73 people inside a residential building was deliberately set. The fire broke out inside a so-called hijacked building, a structure that was abandoned by landlords and taken over by gangs who rent space inside to migrants and others in need of housing. Those buildings have become increasingly common in Johannesburg, despite efforts to regulate them. David McKenzie is in Johannesburg at the scene of the tragedy. We know what didn't cause this. We're told this wasn't deliberate. Do we know what the cause was? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL Well, Becky, I have to just adjust that slightly, because over the last few hours, there have been less talk about this not being deliberate. Now, I'm not saying that it was deliberate, but those earlier statements have been walked back a little bit and I think an investigation has to ensue. But if you look at this area behind me, there have been frantic efforts to try and save people. In the very early hours of this morning, as this raging inferno pushed through this building, many people struggled to get out, even if they were potentially able to get out, because at least one exit, it appears, was locked. I spoke to one man who was still in a very bad way, physically, who managed to escape. Here's his story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So the number of people who we might -- bodies which we might still recover here, there might still be more, but we will behave if we don't get more, because it also -- it is also a traumatic experience for us as emergency services workers. Because I think in my 23 years of service in the fire service, I've never come across something like this. So I don't think that we will have something like this maybe in many years to come. So we will be happy if we don't really get even more bodies because it's also traumatic to us as emergency services workers and also to the family members who are on the ground who are waiting to see their loved ones. So we have activated our chaplaincy service, who normally conducts some trauma counseling -- debriefing counseling as and when we have incidents like this one. Even though the scale is much more bigger, this is something which has never been heard of in the city of Johannesburg. It has never happened. So all of us, I think it's a -- we are really devastated, us, being emerging services workers and also, you know, the people who are affected. So we're hoping that we will work together with other city stakeholders, so that firstly, we bring up to speed in terms of recovery of any other bodies which might still be outstanding, and also to make sure that our affected families are assisted to find closure. And also maybe this incident will also trigger, you know, or speedup the process of making sure that we get rid of some of these buildings, if not maybe refurbishing them and making sure that they are habitable.

Now, what this newly released U.S. Intel report tells us is that they believe that they are actively advancing this potential arms deal. And they believe that it went a long way back in July when the Defense Minister of Russia went to Pyongyang. He met with Kim Jon-un, the North Korean leader. He was at a military parade with him. He was attending an arms exhibition as well, surrounded by different weapons technology that Pyongyang owns. And it is believed, according to this U.S. intelligence report, that that is where some of this negotiation took place. It's something we heard earlier this month as well from the South Korean side. The intelligence agency here saying that believed that also they were talking about possibly military exercises between the two countries. Also saying that they believe at the beginning of this month there was a Russian plane which left Pyongyang and appeared to have transferred unknown military supplies. Now, CNN has no way of knowing what those supplies may have been, what in fact was on that plane. But this is something that South Korean intelligence has been tracking.

Well,that is because in just a couple of hours time, the European Champions League draw for the group stages is taking place in Monaco. The eyes of the world watching on European football's flagship competition. Five Spanish clubs involved. It's very difficult for the president of European football's governing body to promote and sell and speak glowingly of what's to come without having addressed what has played out. And I'm sure we at CNN are not the only media organization to have been trying to get President Ceferin and UEFA to make some kind of a comment over the last 11 days. And this is how they have decided to do it. With one interview with the French magazine L'Equipe. They hope to make their comments and move on. But you strongly suspect that that will not be the case. I think it's fair to say it's a cursory comment, isn't it? President Ceferin did yes say the actions of Luis Rubiales were inappropriate. He did go on to say, \"We should change things\". That was the final line of the statement. \"I'm sad such an event should overshadow the victory of the Spanish national team. We should change things.\" But he didn't say what we should be changing and how. And UEFA's stance has been, well, world football's governing body, FIFA, are the body who we were in charge of the Women's World Cup final when these incidents took place. They are the body that has handed down the 90- day suspension of Louis Rubiales and their disciplinary committee has opened proceedings. So UEFA have said, we are going to leave it to them. That isn't what a lot of people were hoping for and it really hasn't placated a lot of people who feel that this has happened on UEFA's watch. The World Cup final, of course, was two European nations, England and Spain. President Ceferin didn't go. The feeling is that he is a longtime friend and ally of Luis Rubiales.

We are told that yesterday, after this freezing episode, McConnell spent some time calling up some of his allies in and around leadership and reassuring them about his ability to serve. He was also reaching out to donors and reassuring them as well, according to our colleague Manu Raju. And he also made it a point to carry on with his schedule. Last night, he was at a fundraiser for Congressman Jim Banks, who is running for Senate. So they're clearly trying to put on a business as usual front. But we still don't know what caused these freezing episodes. There have been other health scares, including early this year when Mitch McConnell fell. He had a concussion, hit his head, broke some ribs, and was out of the Senate for six weeks. And his office has been very tight lipped about his health. They've been very reluctant to disclose information. And because of that, the speculation and questions about his health and future continue to grow. And I think one of the big questions going forward is how much longer is Mitch McConnell going to lead Republicans? He is the longest serving leader in the Senate history, and as of right now, he has until the end of next year. That's how long his current term is. He has vowed to continue serving as leader until the end of next year. But it's a different question about whether he will run after that and if he would have the support of his conference to do so.

And it's really interesting just to see what a good deal that actually was for UBS in the so-called negative goodwill charge. It's $29 billion. It's pretty much the entire profit for this quarter. It's certainly a record for UBS. Essentially, that means all Credit Suite's assets minus what UBS paid for it, which wasn't very much, Becky, I have to say. Other standouts from this was the controversial, I think, news that they are going to absorb the Credit Suite domestic bank into UBS. There were lots of discussions about whether or not they would have to spin that off. There were some protests when the acquisition was first announced, essentially because this reduces the number of banks domestically that people can use. So about one in three people in Switzerland will now be using this one bank once the entire integration has happened. As you mentioned, jobs. That was the moment in this results where you could not pause. I mean, we already saw 8,000 jobs disappear from Credit Suisse. Those were voluntary. They earmarked another 3,000 today as a result of this merger. But they haven't put a figure on the total number of jobs that will be lost. They did put a figure, as you said, though, on what the cost savings will be by the end of 2026, a number that, of course, investors like $10 billion. And to achieve that, you would imagine they will have to cut many more jobs. And actually, looking at some analysts' comments today, they're expecting perhaps between 30,000 and 35,000 jobs to be cut overall as a result of this. So certainly plenty of good news for investors.
