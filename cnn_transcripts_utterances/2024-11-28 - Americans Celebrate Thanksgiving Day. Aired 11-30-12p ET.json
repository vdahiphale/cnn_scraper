You saw a little bit from Chicago, from Detroit as well, and it was a real treat for us to see all of those marching bands.The color guards go by right where we are here on the streets of New York City. Thanks so much for spending part of your holiday with us. This is CNN's SPECIAL THANKSGIVING IN AMERICA. You know, Chicago is celebrating 90 years of its annual Thanksgiving Day parade this year. And as things are winding their way down, the great state street, that's where we find CNN's Whitney Wild. Whitney, you have had the perfect spot to see this parade all morning long. And I love the diversity of all of the performances and the musical acts and the dancing that we've seen. What's really stood out to you?",

He's been the voice of the Chicago Cubs for many years. There were Bolivian dancers. There were multiple dancers and drummers representing Korean culture here.There were Mexican dancers. Let me take you or just give you the last little peek of the parade here. It is really a rich tapestry of all of the different cultures  that make Chicago unique, and really John and Erica, that's what makes this parade so unique. This parade centers very much, very specifically on the different cultures that are represented so richly throughout the city of Chicago. So, today is the truest Chicago parade in that sense for sure. And then to top it off, guys, it's like 30 degrees here, so, it doesn't get much more, Chicago than that. A crisp Thanksgiving Day here in Chicago, crystal clear skies though, absolutely perfect day. So, a wonderful bunch of performances to bring you guys. Back to you. HILL:  Yes, it looks like a beautiful day, Whitney, thank you and happy Thanksgiving. We are extra thankful this morning of course, for our hosts here in New York City. Congregation Sherith Israel, they have welcomed us at this location this morning. Sherith Israel, actually the first Jewish congregation in North America. And today, they host a special observance of Thanksgiving. It is a multi-faith food drive, bringing together people not just from this congregation, but from churches and other churches and synagogues. They're all banding together to help their neighbors here in New York City. So, we want to thank them for not only hosting us, but for all the work that they are doing here in New York. A number of American service members, of course, who are serving overseas, and even those who are serving domestically, they're a long way from their loved ones on this holiday. But they will still get a taste of home on Thanksgiving Day, including a feast with all the trimmings and a chance to watch some of the great football games. They're going to be able to watch those. My colleague Salma Abdelaziz is joining us live from Kaiserslautern, Germany. So, Salma, you were there at a USO Center. Tell us a little bit about what's happening there on this Thanksgiving Day.",
