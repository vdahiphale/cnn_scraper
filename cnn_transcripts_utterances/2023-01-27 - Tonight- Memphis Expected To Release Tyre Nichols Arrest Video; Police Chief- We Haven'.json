Shimon will be back with us in just a few moments.I also want to bring in CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, Civil Rights Attorney Areva Martin and the former President of the NAACP, Cornell William Brooks. Cornell, let me start with you. We keep hearing that this video that's about to be released shows a beating that defies humanity. As you reflect on the killing of Tyree Nichols and other acts of police brutality before this, I wonder what's going through your mind right now. CORNELL WILLIAM BROOKS, FORMER PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NAACP: Well, I'm really taking back to the video of Rodney King more than a generation of Go, where the nation witnessed essentially the first viralized video of police brutality. And here we are this many years later, this many decades later, where we are sitting in a kind of American theater on the edge of our seats, waiting for the movie of man's inhumanity to man, police brutality being revealed yet again. And so what I think about is how long, how many hashtags, how many human beings killed? How many lives decimated and desecrated does it take for American policing as an industry to come to grips with the fact that the culture is sick? We need more policies. But the culture of policing is sick. And it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if the officers are black, because black wrapped in a criminal shade of blue is a danger to white people, black people, and people of all colors. And so I'm really sickened by this because it is absolutely inhumane and it's serial inhumanity.",

Now, there are places, Wolf, and this is important, where the civil service laws, as constructed wouldn't allow that to happen so fast. They would be suspended, first without pay, then with pay, this could be drawn out. But she took advantage of her situation there and acted directly and swiftly and surely.",

I think what's so galling for so many people, even though we haven't seen the video, is the notion that five officers could be at the scene. And perhaps even more that we don't know about, but that those five who participated in this brutality, that not one of them had the presence of mind to say to the others, enough. Stop. We're going too far. He's under control. He's in handcuffs.And given what we witnessed with Derek Chauvin and the kneeling on George Ford's neck and the civil unrest that we saw happen across the world after George Floyd, you wonder, how can any police officer in America, in any police department, not have that in their minds, in their hearts, when they go out and face the public? So there's so much that we still need to learn about what motivated the actions of these officers. Hearing that, she said that she didn't see any reckless driving, she didn't see any probable cause, she didn't even see a reason for Mr. Nichols to be stopped. That another unarmed black man died in the custody of police during a routine traffic stop says everything we need to know, which is that policing in this country is in crisis.",

But we haven't seen any kind of influx of people to indicate like we have in some other -- during some other situations where people come from out of town to protest or anything like that. We've not seen that for the most part. It's been a very quiet downtown here in Memphis, and people have just proceeded with their day.Certainly this is on the mind of everyone here, and everyone is hoping and expecting a peaceful night.

So, in other words, thinking about policing in -- as you would public health, right? In other words, police officers working beside social workers, working beside teachers, working beside many members of the community to keep the community safe.And so, in other words, putting the accent on keeping everybody safe, including from violent police officers and using more tools. I mean, let's be clear about this. Where we have this specialized unit, this so-called Scorpion Unit, where you have officers who can jump -- who jump out of cars, who are on plain clothes, who function like an occupying army. There are other ways to engage the community so that you're able to get at weapons, you're able to get at people who pose a harm to the community. So what we look to do in the futures is to gauge more mayors, more police chiefs to both change policy and the culture of policing. And to be clear, policing should not be assumed to be necessarily violent, right? It should be routinely nonviolent, right? This should not be a matter where we just accept the death of civilians as the price, the casualties of policing.",

JB SMILEY JR., VICE CHAIR, MEMPHIS CITY COUNCIL: Well, what the Memphis City Council has done in terms of getting the community prepared for what we believe to be essentially almost a repeat of Rodney King is, you know, getting on the phone talking to the community leaders, talking to the community activists, talking to the faith based leaders, trying to ensure them that we're going to take all the steps necessary to make sure this never happens again. And if you know anything about the city of Memphis, it's a community of people who lean heavily on their faith. And I believe the faith leaders have an opportunity to step up and show the world how we will handle this going forward. And I do believe what you will see peaceful protest in the city of Memphis.

And he said that they used all kind of profanity against him. They threw him on the ground talking about where the drugs and where the weapons.
