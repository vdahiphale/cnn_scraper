Here's a live look at Broadway in Nashville, Tennessee, where it is 4:59. And good morning, everyone. I'm Rahel Solomon, in today for Kasie Hunt. Great to have you with us, and good to be with you. A new House ethics report is out, accusing former Congressman Matt Gaetz of violating state laws regarding prostitution, statutory rape, and drug use. The 37-page report finds that Gaetz paid women for sex or drugs on at least 20 occasions, and includes text message screenshots, where Gaetz asked women to bring, quote, \"a full complement of party favors\" to his hotel. The committee says that this was a code word for Ecstasy -- Ecstasy or other drugs. Another exchange shared by the committee, an unnamed woman and Gaetz seem to be arguing overpay when she asks Gaetz, quote, \"So, I'm not to be taken care of for last week? Gaetz responded saying, quote, \"I gave you 250 today.\" And about last week says, quote, \"You gave me a drive-by.\" Now, Gaetz is striking back at the report on his X account, posting or reposting about it more than 30 times since its release, writing in part, quote, \"They did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind, where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.\" Members from both sides of the aisle, meantime, responding to the report and to Trump's former pick to lead the Department of Justice.

And I think that it -- it speaks to something that we've talked about in the news before. We've talked about in larger kind of circles before, which is that Matt Gaetz is kind of universally disliked. There is a bipartisan agreement that he's not a great person. We saw a lot of kind of -- and I think this is really important. We saw a lot of Republicans commenting on Matt Gaetz prior to the ethics report being released, saying things like, we don't actually care if the ethics report comes out. We don't know if it would be great if Matt Gaetz was A.G. We think this might be a problematic pick. And I think part of it, especially what we saw with some of those reports from congressional members, was that they were incensed that Matt Gaetz was on the congressional force [SIC] -- floor, allegedly talking about these incidents and bragging about these incidents. So, now they've come out to play. And I think part of the underlying politics of this is that a number of members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, were absolutely fine with this seeing the light of day. It's particularly interesting, given that Matt Gaetz stepped down from the attorney general position. So, there's no blowback retrospectively for these Republicans to actually release the report. Now, the next part of this is how can -- you know, what comes of this? He is a private citizen. He is no longer -- I believe he is now employed by a different media outlet. But aside from that, you know, this may be one of those things that simply was about ensuring that he stays in his box, that he is not in a position of power like the attorney general. And there was wide bipartisan agreement on that.",

I don't know that he will view Matt Gaetz as a winner over the long haul. He also values people who can be personally in control. You know, he's -- famously doesn't use drugs, doesn't use alcohol, and never has.

But what the real test here will be, the real litmus test is how does the MAGA base continue to receive Matt Gaetz going forward? And what you see from him is actually this exuberant confidence that he will be stronger amongst the MAGA base than ever before. How far we have come from the wholesome values that once was the Republican base. So, we're going to see this play out in Florida statewide politics, perhaps a gubernatorial campaign or a Senate campaign.

And this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones. President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people. Early yesterday, the White House announcing Biden is taking 37 people off a federal Death Row, not commuting three individuals: one of two brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing; Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina; and Robert Bowers, who killed 11 at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue. In a statement, Biden pushed back against the use of the death penalty at the federal level, saying, quote, \"Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all of the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss. In good conscience. I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\" My panel is back. Let me begin with you again here.

I'm going to end the federal death penalty. I'm going to commute them all on the first day, every one of them. But to come here at the end and say, I'm going to commute this death sentence and not that one, and do so after he shielded from the voters when it can't hurt him politically, it's just a cynical play. I just don't buy it. I don't buy that this has anything to do with his Catholic social teachings, because he's -- didn't do it up front.
