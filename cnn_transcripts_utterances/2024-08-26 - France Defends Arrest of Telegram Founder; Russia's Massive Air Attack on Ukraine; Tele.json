      "sentences": "It is 8And wherever you are in the world, this is your \"First Move.\" A very warm welcome to \"First Move.\" Here is today's need to know. Not political. France defends the arrest of Russian-born founder of the social media app Telegram. Massive air attack. Ukraine targeted by 127 missiles and 109 drones in what was the biggest air attack since Russia's invasion. More talks on Gaza. Negotiators meet in Cairo to discuss a ceasefire and hostage release deal. And out of office, out of reach. Australia gives workers the right to disconnect. More details on that story coming up. But we start in Ukraine, which is dealing with the aftermath of what officials are calling the most -- the massive air attack since the war began. Ukrainian authorities say hundreds of Russian drones and missiles were fired overnight into Monday. We have some video obtained by Reuters, which shows a projectile targeting a reservoir. The attacks have killed at least seven people and have damaged the country's energy infrastructure. Ukraine's president has vowed to respond. Meanwhile, Ukraine says its troops are now seizing more territory inside Russia in the Kursk region. Our Frederik Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A close call for these Ukrainian soldiers, filming a missile impacting in a reservoir close by. Part of the massive Russian rocket and drone blitz destroying Ukrainian energy infrastructure and leaving residents scrambling for safety. Some inside the Kyiv subway. These people singing, who else will stand up for our freedom today if not you, if not me? Kyiv says Russia launched more than 120 missiles and more than 100 drones. While many were intercepted, others struck areas across Ukraine. Putin sticks to his style, Ukraine's president says. He's a sick creature, and that's been obvious for a long time. But it's also clear that he could only do what the world allows him to do, weakness, lack of decisions, fuel terror. The strike's possible retaliation for Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in Russia. And Vladimir Putin's army still appears unable to stop Ukrainian troops advancing there. Kyiv's saying their forces are making gains even three weeks into the operation. And another possible blow for the Russian leader. After Putin visited Azerbaijan last week, the founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, was arrested in France, revealing Durov was in Azerbaijan at the same time as Putin. The Kremlin quick to claim Putin didn't meet with Durov in Baku. DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (through translator):  We don't know yet what exactly Durov is accused of. We haven't heard any official statements on this matter yet. And before we say anything, we need to wait for the situation to become clearer. What exactly are they trying to incriminate Durov with? PLEITGEN (voice-over):  French media reports Durov's arrest warrant is related to Telegram's alleged failure to moderate content, reportedly facilitating money laundering, drug trafficking, and the spread of pedophilic material on the platform. Telegram says Durov has nothing to hide. There have been questions about Pavel Durov's possible relations with the Kremlin. On Moscow's streets, support for the Russian social media mogul. It's connected to the fact that the man sticks to his principles, this man says, and his main principle is freedom of speech. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One of the things that they might do is they might let the Ukrainian forces that have invaded that particular area, those about 488 square miles that they've taken, they might use that as basically a ploy to draw the Ukrainians further into Russia and then perhaps do something else from a military perspective. But as far as the missile strikes and rocket strikes are concerned that occurred overnight, those are, you know, clearly a Russian reaction. And the idea there is to decimate as much of the Ukrainian infrastructure as possible. The volume of attacks, the targets that were used, some of them, deliberate, some of them more indiscriminate, was clearly designed, in my mind, to really be a message to the Ukrainians not to go too far into any other region in Russia, but also, to limit their activities. Plus, it's a warning that a large part of the Ukrainian infrastructure could be destroyed by the Russians.",

And in fact, a lot of the group chats that -- or the equivalent of group chats that, Telegram can host, that provides a lot of groups in many different countries. The option of communicating very cheaply and very directly. but those communications are by their very nature, not encrypted.

Of course, your defenders are going to say, well, you don't interrogate the head of a telephone company for having bad people working -- on using your instrument to communicate, you know, various crimes or the planning of various crimes. However, social media efforts are, you know, definitely different than social media platforms because of their ubiquitous nature have drawn a lot more criticism and a lot more legal scrutiny for the fact that they do facilitate a lot of bad actors' actions, anything from drug trafficking to child pornography.

There goes most of the weather, though, across parts of New England. Out into the ocean, the orange area here is what we're concerned about for tonight. These storms may even continue through the overnight hours. And, Lynda, after hours and after dark when people are sleeping, that's when the storms are the most dangerous. It's been very hot. That heat is firing the fuel to these storms. Even Chicago, tomorrow will still be 96, although, it cools down for the rest of the week, it doesn't cool down in Cincinnati or Indianapolis, all the way down even toward the Southern Ohio Valley, it will remain hot there. Something else that's hot is the water here south of Japan. This a typhoon. 110 miles per hour. So, over 170 kilometers per hour there. And as we move this up toward Kyushu -- now, remember, last week we talked about this thing going straight north. It had no intention of doing that. It went straight west. And now, it's turning back to the north where it was supposed to go in the first place. Unfortunately, now, Kyushu, you are in the way where the areas to the north of there are in less danger because the storm will have lost some power. But there will be wind gusts at 100 miles per hour, 160 kilometers per hour without a doubt on land. Kagoshima likely even could see 10 inches of rainfall. So, somewhere in the ballpark of 250 millimeters of rain with that wind and with that storm surge. This will be a fairly dangerous storm for Kyushu, right here, this big island right down here. Now, that's not up toward Honshu, not up toward Tokyo, but there'll be wind in Tokyo probably later in the day on Thursday and Friday. So, what we're doing right now is we're watching the storms in the upper Midwest. We'll watch for tornadoes as well.

Then he's going back to Michigan on Thursday to Wisconsin for this town hall, then Pennsylvania. All of these, of course, are swing states. Now, this town hall, the structure is going to be that he gets up there and speaks for 15 to 20 minutes, and then he takes questions from voters in the audience. You know, we don't know what kind of voters, are they all Trump supporters, probably. But it will be him interacting with voters, or at least that's what we're told by the campaign. We certainly never seen him do one of these. Again, that wasn't structured through a Fox News or through CNN or one of these media organizations. So, it'll be unclear how it'll work. But I think what is clear is that they are looking for different ways to go after Kamala Harris. They have tried to find their footing with her in this new race, with her at the top of the ticket. And she has really been on a bounce. She -- we saw the bounce that she had from becoming the top of the ticket. The enthusiasm around her, the boost in polling. Whether or not that lasts is anyone's guess. The Trump campaign had hoped that it would be over by now. But regardless, Donald Trump himself has had a hard time hitting Harris, finding attack lines that land and really trying to break through this bounce that Harris appears to still be on.

So, this really speaks to just how popular he was and how the entire European, if not global, football community reached out to himwhen he revealed his diagnosis earlier this year. And one of the offers he got was to come to Anfield, the home of the Liverpool Football Club, to manage their legends team for the day. He had said that he was a lifelong Liverpool fan. I think of all the jobs he had, this the one he would have wanted the most. And it really was just such a fabulous day. Such a feel-good day. So, much emotion, so much support from the Liverpool fans. And many of the Liverpool legendary players who were involved in that game. And that just really speaks to how Eriksson was regarded and revered within the football community.",

He's also a member of the private four-person crew. If all goes well, he and a crewmate will conduct the first ever commercial spacewalk during the five-day mission. The vehicle that will reach an orbit that extends up to 870 miles, that's about 1,400 kilometers from Earth. And that is the furthest any astronaut has been since the Apollo program. Well, former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman is here. He's also the former director of space operations at SpaceX. Good to see you.",

It definitely involves more risk than a typical NASA mission, like the ones that I was a part of.They're going really high, as you pointed out, about 1,400 kilometers, higher than anybody has been except for the Apollo astronauts that flew to the moon. But that also puts them up into some pretty severe radiation environments in the Van Allen belts. Then they're going to drop down and do the first spacewalk ever done by a commercial entity. And you know -- and they're also doing about 40 different science experiments. So, this mission is really loaded with a bunch of really bold things. And yes, it's -- I'm a little concerned.",

We put them in vacuumchambers that simulate the lack of pressure, the lack of air and they perform quite well. But we've never tried to go through the whole thing end to end in space, in zero gravity. And there, it's about a two-hour timeline. And there, there's going to be some time pressure, you know, the clock is running. As soon as they let the air out of the cabin, then they only have so much air inside their oxygen tanks. And so, they have to get this done in an expeditious manner. And if things start going wrong, they will have -- they could have some pretty challenging operational environments. Now, I'm very confident in the SpaceX team. The ops team at SpaceX is really top notch. And I think that they'll carry themselves with great aplomb through this whole thing. But yes, it's a bit of a nail biter. And two of the crew members are actually friends of mine. So, that's why I'm kind of particularly on edge.",

When yougo out there -- and there's nothing between you and the entire planet and the cosmos except for this thin piece of glass, that's your helmet. What you almost forget is there. It's an incredible experience. And I'm really happy for Jared and Sarah that they're going to get a chance to go outside and have a look. Now, all four of the astronauts are going to vacuum, you know, even the people -- the two crew members staying inside. So, I think it's really kind of unfair that they don't get credit for doing a spacewalk because the only difference is they keep their seatbelt on. Otherwise, it's really the same.
