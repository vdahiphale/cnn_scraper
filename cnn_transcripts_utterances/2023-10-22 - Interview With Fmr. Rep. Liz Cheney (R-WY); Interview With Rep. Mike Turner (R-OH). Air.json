I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is grieving so much pain and loss of life.This morning, the Israeli military says it is stepping up its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza. The IDF also hit a mosque in the West Bank to prevent what it called an imminent terror attack, all as we learned, more unimaginable, unimaginable details about the brutality of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli civilians on October 7. Now, with the anticipation of a ground war building, the human devastation in Gaza is coming to a clearer focus. Disturbing new video just into CNN shows a hospital in the Central Gaza district overwhelmed with bodies following overnight airstrikes. Just now, more aid trucks are beginning to be allowed to enter Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing, although it's not clear how many or what they were carrying. The first aid trucks were just let through yesterday, as the U.N. warned civilian lives in Gaza are being pushed -- quote -- \"to the edge of catastrophe.\" And as anger at Israel and his supporters in the West grow throughout the Middle East, there are new signs of concern about this escalation growing into a regional war. The U.S. military is deploying additional missile defense systems to the Middle East -- quote -- \"in response to escalations throughout the region.\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a call with his Qatari counterpart last night to discuss further efforts to get American hostages released after two American hostages were released by Hamas and are making their way home. What Hamas got in exchange for those two hostages has not been disclosed. Joining me now from Northern Israel is CNN's Matthew Chance. Matthew, when it comes to fears of this war spreading to becoming a larger regional conflict, Israel says it is evacuating even more communities near where you are.",

And towns and villages all across this very volatile region in the north of Israel close to the Lebanese and close to the Syrian border as well, they have all been cleared out. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of people both here and in communities in the south of Israel as well who evacuated because of the attacks last week in Gaza who have now been displaced because of this ongoing violence in the country. The situation here in the north is particularly of concern, because the Israeli military say there's been an upsurge in attacks by Hezbollah forces across the border of the course of the past several days, drones being flown above Kiryat Shmona, rocket strikes, anti- tank weapons being fired at the border fence, infiltrations of militant fighters that have been repulsed as well. And all of this, the Israeli military say they have responded to. They have been carrying out an increased number of attacks inside Southern Lebanon, but they have warned Lebanon as well and Hezbollah as well that it will press further, that it will launch enormous strikes on Hezbollah and, indeed, on Lebanon if that escalation continues. One IDF spokesperson saying that Hezbollah is playing a dangerous game and dragging Lebanon into a war that it will lose. And so, yes, look, there's a lot of concern about what Lebanon is doing, about what Hezbollah in Lebanon is doing, but an absolute kind of commitment, it seems, from the Israelis to strike back hard if that escalation continues, Jake.",

The objective remains the same, of course, they say, which is to, in their words, destroy Hamas and dismantle its military infrastructure. But in terms of when the actual green light for a land invasion is going to be put on or not, we don't know yet. I mean, there is a possibility -- although this isn't an official position at this point, there is a possibility that Israel may be waiting to see what further results the talks between the United States and Qatar and Hamas may yield in terms of more hostage negotiations and more hostage releases. Already, two U.S. citizens held by Hamas, of course, in the past 24 hours have been released. Obviously, there's a hope that more can be, their freedom can be brokered as well. But that's not the official Israeli position. They're saying they will choose the exact time and the exact moment when it's best suited for a military incursion for them to green-light it -- Jake.",

He insulted the defense minister of Israel, called him a jerk. He praised Hezbollah as smart. What was your reaction to that?

The other thing to remember about Donald Trump is that he reportedly shared Israeli intelligence with the Russians very early in his term. He also, as we know now from the indictments that we have seen from Jack Smith, shared highly classified military documents apparently relating to military action potentially against Iran. He shared that with Mark Meadows' ghostwriters and political consultants, it seems, according to the indictments. So, if you think about not only is he out there advocating for complimenting America's adversaries and, in fact, terrorist organizations that slaughter innocents; he also seems to have shared very highly classified intelligence information, both ours and the Israelis, in fact, with adversaries.

The sources say that Friday's release of two American hostages, Judith and Natalie Raanan from outside Chicago, signaled that negotiators believe they could make progress on freeing some of the more than 200 hostages believed to be currently held by Hamas.
