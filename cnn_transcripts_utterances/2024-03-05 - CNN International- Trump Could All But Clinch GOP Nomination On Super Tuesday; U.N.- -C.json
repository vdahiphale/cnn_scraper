I'm Rahel Solomon, and this is CNN NEWSROOM.Just ahead, polls are open in a Super Tuesday like no other as Nikki Haley hopes to gain some traction against Donald Trump. We're going to have full coverage ahead this hour. Plus, China's leaders gather for their annual congress and said a bold growth target. We'll have a fresh report from Beijing. And tracking methane gas from the skies. How a new satellite could provide a key to fighting climate change. But we want to begin with this being the most consequential day of the U.S. primary season. It is Super Tuesday with voters heading to the polls in 15 states in one territory. Now, by the end of the day, we will know a lot more about the race for president. For Joe Biden, there is little meaningful opposition. But we will be on the lookout for signs of protest votes or weakness in the wake of last week's large uncommitted vote in Michigan's Democratic primary. But all eyes today are really going to be on the Republican field, where Donald Trump is looking to sweep today's contest and potentially knock Nikki Haley out of the race. But Haley, meantime, continues to press her case, and she says that Republicans need someone different as the party's nominee. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We lost in 2018, we lost in 2020, we lost in 2022, but look two weeks ago. Republicans lost the vote on Mayorkas, they lost the vote on Israel, the RNC chair lost her job, and Donald Trump's fingerprints were on all of it. How much more losing do we have to do before we realize maybe Donald Trump is the problem? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So Eva, talk to us a little bit more about the closing message that Nikki Haley had for her supporters ahead of Super Tuesday.EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: You know, Rahel, Super Tuesday really serves as the ultimate test of her message. She's a very disciplined campaigner, and her core argument has been centered on electability. She maintains that the former president is just too much of a liability in November, that she would be the best person to confront President Biden in the fall and that the polling thus far has reflected as such. But she hasn't said what she's going to do past Super Tuesday. The big question tonight is, can she decisively pick up any states? She's been in 10 states in the past week, crisscrossing the country, but she maintains vague about concrete expectations, only saying, she'll continue to stay the course if she remains competitive. We're not quite sure what that means. Now, I was with her during her New England swing in Vermont, and I have to tell you, Democrats were showing up to her rallies. Independents, anti-Trump Republicans who said that they would rather vote for Biden in the fall than they would Trump, that's a real warning sign for the Republican Party. But even as she has more aggressively confronted Trump, she thought that that Supreme Court decision to keep him on the ballot in Colorado was the right choice. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Haley's team says she's not going to address supporters tonight because the polls in some states, they close at a very late hour, but we do know that she's going to be watching these results come in from South Carolina.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, President Biden is expected to handily win the Democratic contest that are occurring today in Super Tuesday. But there are elements of today's vote that his team will be watching quite closely to try to gain some insight into the type of voters that will be heading to the polls in November.Of course, turnout in the Super Tuesday contest will be key. The Biden campaign can look to see what kinds of voters, Democratic voters are coming out to support the president in these primaries. And then there is also that uncommitted campaign that is being waged in at least one of the states. This follows last week's Michigan primary, where over 100,000 people voted uncommitted for Biden in the state of Michigan in the Democratic primary. That was a protest vote due to frustrations about the president's handling of the conflict in Gaza. In Minnesota today, they have also launched an uncommitted campaign. Now, this campaign was organized much -- with much shorter time frame, so it's unclear what kind of momentum they will pick up. But it does come as the campaign has been grappling with parts of the Democratic Party who are frustrated and threatening to sit out in the election in November. The campaign, of course, is also watching this and what it will mean for the Republican primary contest is Biden advisers fully believe that Super Tuesday will be the moment that really the Republican nomination is cemented around former President Donald Trump, who they fully expect to be their opponent in November. And to that point about the former president, we're really seeing President Biden this week trying to ramp up his preparations towards that major State of the Union address that's occurring on Thursday. That will really give him an opportunity. Even if he doesn't go by after Trump by name, it'll give him a chance to offer a contrast with Republicans and the former president. One thing that we will see President Biden on today, he returns from Camp David and then he's hosting a meeting with his competition council here at the White House where he's expected to announce a few initiatives when it comes to trying to lower costs for American families. One of those is taking aim at credit card late fees that Americans are facing. There is a new rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that will slash credit card late fees from the current average of $32 a month to $8 a month. This is something that could bring savings of up to $220 annually to more than 45 million Americans who are paying late credit card fees at this time. This is one of the administration's efforts to really tackle junk fees, a way to try to lower costs for consumers, and it's something that will feature prominently in his speech in the State of the Union, which is expected to really focus heavily on an economic populist type of messaging as he's trying to present that contrast to the former president. Now -- so while today's Super Tuesday contest will be revelatory when it comes to the GOP contest, the White House right now also has their eyes on that State of the Union as really one of the President's biggest platforms to offer his vision for a second term and trying to remind voters of what he has accomplished in the first one.",

We're going to have much more on Super Tuesday later this hour, but for now, we want to go to Gaza because despite growing calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, Egypt's foreign minister says that negotiations have not yet reached a point where a ceasefire could be achieved. International mediators are racing to broker a hostage deal and truce ahead of Ramadan. On the ground in Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says that at least 97 people were killed in just the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, a new United Nations report says that there is, quote, \"clear and convincing\" information that hostages held in Gaza were sexually abused. The report also found that sexual violence, including gang rape, occurred during Hamas's October 7th terror attacks in Israel.

He's meeting with Secretary of State Tony Blinken today. They'll, of course, be discussing the potential for an Israeli ground operation in Rafah, where a million and a half Palestinians have sought refuge and where the U.S. is adamant that Israel mustn't go in on the ground until such time as there's a concrete plan to ensure their safety.They'll also discuss other elements like the potential for normalization with Saudi Arabia the day after this war, or as part of an agreement to bring this war to an end. They'll also be talking about tensions on the northern border between Iran's proxy Hezbollah and Israel, where tensions have been simmering and the U.S. is adamant that that must not escalate into full blown war. But, of course, there is a subplot here, certainly in Israel, where Prime Minister Netanyahu is incredibly angry that Benny Gantz, who, although in the war cabinet in a show of unity following the October 7th terrorist attacks and the war with Hamas, hasn't -- didn't get signed off, didn't get this trip signed off by the prime minister. The prime minister, even going so far as to tell his ambassador in the United States not to cooperate with this trip. And so although Benny Gantz, as I say, is part of this war cabinet, one of the key decision makers when it comes to Israel's war with Hamas, he's also the chief rival for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Indeed, opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that we're an election held tomorrow, not only would Benny Gantz beat Prime Minister Netanyahu, but his party would trounce him. Rahel?",

And as you mentioned, Donald Trump will be shy of the delegates that he needs to become the Republican nominee, regardless of how many states he wins. But it could move him closer to that ultimate goal.Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's advisers, the real thing they're hoping for today and what they're really looking for is to see Nikki Haley drop out. They know that she had promised to stay in the race at least through Super Tuesday. But beyond today, it's very unclear what she's going to do and how she sees a path forward. But I know that Donald Trump would love to get up on that stage tonight at Mar-a-Lago where he'll be giving remarks this evening and declare himself the Republican nominee, but it's very unclear if that will happen. And again, it'll be a couple weeks for him to be able to receive the necessary delegates he needs to cross that 1,215 threshold. Now, I also just want to give you a sense of the importance of the state of Virginia where I am today. The Trump campaign very much sees it as a battleground, even though Donald Trump lost the state, both in 2016 and 2020. But in my conversations with the campaign, they tell me that they think he has a real shot of picking up a lot more support here in a potential rematch with Joe Biden. And it's actually one of the two states that he visited in the lead up to Super Tuesday. He came here to Richmond on Saturday. He was also in North Carolina, and I think that just gives you a sense of how they view this state. And I did talk with some voters who were exiting this polling location behind me earlier this morning. The polls opened here in Richmond at 6:00 a.m. And, so far, I think, you know, you're seeing a lot of different support for different candidates. But the really interesting thing about Virginia, and this is not the case in most Super Tuesday states, is that it's an open primary. That means Republicans, Democrats Independents, anyone who is registered to vote can vote for whichever candidate they want, regardless of which party they are registered with. And I spoke with two registered Republicans who said they voted for Nikki Haley. And the main reason for that, Rahel, was because they said they were against Donald Trump.

If you look at some of the late individual polls that go into this average, Trump has been running a little bit stronger. But if you average them all together, which is the smart thing to do, don't overinvest in any one poll, no clear leader, but Trump has clearly been gaining a little bit of steam as we go forward. Why is he gaining steam? Well, these are the numbers that are troubling for the president. Here's one from the New York Times/Siena College poll. Is President Biden too old to be an effective president? Among all voters, 73 percent say yes, 25 percent say no. Here's the troubling part. Even in his own party, the president needs big Democratic turnout in the fall. More than half, 56 percent of Democrats say they think he's too old to be an effective president. 43 percent say no.

Talk to me a bit about the push pull you think, the conversation that maybe his advisers are having with him. Because on the one hand, Biden has been pretty consistent that he is the only person who has and can beat Trump. But if he loses, that becomes an asterisk to his legacy.",

And if the chief instigator of January 6th is the replacement, is Biden's replacement in 2025, it would really damage Biden's role as the restorer of the United States.So he's in a peculiar bind because for his legacy and for what he views the country needs, Trump has to be defeated in November. Up to last year, he could convince himself that he was the only person who could beat Trump. The problem this year is the age factor is starting to take a toll. I'm not suggesting it's taking a toll on how he governs the country, but the perception of how he governs the country has been affected by the fact that he seems to be -- how should I put this -- aging a little more rapidly. And that is the problem for him, which is he sees himself as the only person to pull together a coalition to beat Trump, but he is also, personally, weakening his own candidacy because of father time.",

Our special coverage begins today at 4All right, a group of former executives of Twitter is suing Elon Musk, saying that he has failed to pay them more than $128 million in severance. The group claims that Musk has not paid them what they were owed after he fired them just hours after taking control of the company, which, of course, he rebranded as X. They're saying that the refusal to pay up was his revenge after he was forced to go through with a $44 billion purchase that he had tried to get out of. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But let's bring in CNN's Brian Fung, who joins me live from D.C. Brian, so walk us through who exactly is suing Musk and what more do we know about what they want?",

And in this case, it's some of the most senior people at the company, at Twitter before the acquisition went through. It includes the former CEO, the former CFO, the former chief legal officer, and the former general counsel of Twitter, all of whom were fired, as you said, just hours after Elon Musk closed the deal in October of 2022.And what they're saying is that Elon Musk owes him -- owes them a combined total of $128 million in severance payments because he hatched a plan, allegedly, to deny those payments to them. And now, this isn't the only allegation against Musk for, you know, non-payment of severance benefits or other benefits by former employees. There's a separate lawsuit by a former HR executive at Twitter who's trying to represent a proposed class claiming that Musk owes them $500 million in unpaid severance payments. And Musk -- and X have also been sued by vendors and by landlords who say, you know, X hasn't paid its rent or its service bills. So these allegations that Musk has not been paying what he owes to various people, those claims are just mounting up, and it seems to be a growing headache for his company as he tries to put it back on its feet.
