Thank you for joining us this afternoon.Right now, more than two dozen states and 65 million people are on alert, as a powerful winter storm hits coast to coast. Brutal conditions are slamming Flagstaff, Arizona, just a short time ago. And this man was barely able to stand as the wind gusts whipped the blinding snow around him. And, in 29 states, they're in the path right now for the storm, the snow warnings right now stretching to Southern California, flakes even possible on Los Angeles beaches. And, in Utah, miles and miles of dicey driving. You can see cars stranded as crews work to clear the roads. And, in Minnesota, the National Weather Service is warning of historic snow, possibly the most in decades. Meteorologist Jennifer Gray is standing by for us. But, first, CNN's Adrienne Broaddus us is in Bloomington, Minnesota. Adrienne, what's happening where you are there? I see some really icy streets behind you.",

The plows have been moving along this stretch of highway behind us, but we saw the first phase of this storm here in Minnesota yesterday into this morning.We saw moderate to -- light to moderate snowfall. And so, right now, there's a break, but the snow, the significant portions of the snowfall will pick up later this afternoon, into tonight, into tomorrow. Here's what we can tell you. The governor here, Governor Walz, has issued some executive orders. For example, he's already mobilized the Minnesota National Guard. So, if there is someone who is stranded, if they need help, those Guard members can get to those folks to help them. The wind, I got to talk about that right now. You see I'm struggling to talk. It has picked up, in my opinion, significantly since this morning. And this wind is only going to get worse. That's what is causing those blizzard warnings in some part of the state. So you're going to have strong wind gusts, up to 30 to 45 miles per hour, along with the snow that's falling. The big message to folks in and around Minnesota is to stay home. If you don't have to be out on the streets, stay put. Some schools have been canceled. Some students are having e-learning. And something also to point out is somewhat local, but, for the (AUDIO GAP) in the Twin Cities, the governor of Minneapolis -- not the governor -- the mayor of Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey, as well as the mayor of St. Paul, have opened up parking spaces for those residents -- Abby.",

That will do everyone a lot of good.Our thanks to Adrienne Broaddus and to you, Jennifer, for that report. And President Biden is now on his way home after he rallied support for Ukraine nearly a year to the day after Russia's invasion. Biden began his overseas trip with a surprise visit to Kyiv and ended it by meeting with the leaders of NATO's eastern flank known as the Bucharest Nine. These are the countries that are on Russia's doorstep, and they fear that they could be next if Vladimir Putin wins and Ukraine. Also new today, Putin met with a top Chinese diplomat in Moscow, as China denies reports that it may provide lethal aid to Russian troops in Ukraine. We will go to Moscow in a moment. But, first, let's start with CNN's Phil Mattingly, who is in Warsaw, where the president just left. Phil, just does White House feel like this was really a mission accomplished for the purposes of this trip, keeping allies together and sending that signal to Vladimir Putin?",

      "sentences": "You know, Abby, for the better part of the last several months, several administration officials have talked about just how important they saw the one-year mark as being a critical moment for the president to deliver at least some type of remarks that really underscored his view of the inflection point he saw, not just Ukraine and the war, and -- but really the entire Western Democratic alliance, but also really draw attention about the path ahead, which is certainly going to be grueling.As they talked about kind of the broad outlines of what they wanted, I don't think they could have imagined it would have gone as well as the last three days did. And I say that because there was never a certainty that the president would be able to pull off the trip to Kyiv. Instead, he was standing shoulder to shoulder with Volodymyr Zelenskyy one year after most people didn't think he was going to be in office anymore, that Kyiv would be in Ukraine hands, a day later was able to, as the kind of a collective attention of the world was drawn to that moment, stayed on him as he delivered those remarks about the stakes, making it clear that this was not just about one conflict inside Europe. This was much bigger than that. And I think today was also a really critical moment, sitting down, meeting behind closed doors for more than an hour with these Bucharest Nine countries, the eastern flank countries for NATO. So much of what these three days have been have been dramatic, symbolic, really trying to kind of lay down the marker for what's next. But, Abby, this was a meeting -- and so have several others over the course of these 72 hours -- behind the scenes about substantive issues about what will be needed going forward. And that is real, and that is complex, and that is very difficult. And administration officials acknowledged those challenges. These meetings were critical to lay the groundwork for the steps ahead in the next couple of months. I think, more than anything else, they're happy with the moments that they had. But those meetings themselves and what they produce in the weeks and months ahead will perhaps be the best test of the success of this trip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And there's a couple of reasons for that. It's economics. There's some ideology there as well. But, really, China understands that, over the long run -- and the Chinese really do look at this in the long run -- they need to preserve at least their economic relationships with the rest of the world if they want to reach that aspirational goal that they have been the world's number one superpower. So they can't just unilaterally side completely and absolutely with Russia and not expect there to be significant impact that's going to negatively result in that goal that I was just referring to, where they want to sort of become a major superpower. So they're walking this fine line. It's a very complex relationship between those two countries. So it's fascinating to watch how they try to work it out.",

So, I -- it's difficult for me to imagine a circumstance where China would decide on a large-scale basis to throw significant military assistance to the Russians. First of all, it would be noticed and immediately condemned, and they would be probably impacted. It wouldn't surprise me if some of the new sanctions that we're anticipating coming out of Western governments directly addresses that question. So the Chinese have to be really careful, again, about compromising their longer-term goals with short- term answers to Russia's request for assistance.",

Plus, Alex Murdaugh, former law partner -- his former law partner is on the witness stand. What he just revealed about the night of the murders. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:20:35] PHILLIP:  For prosecutors investigating Donald Trump and his allies over their alleged scheme to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results, the question isn't if they will pursue indictments. It is how many. CNN has learned that Fulton County investigators are still debating the scope of that criminal case and how many indictments to seek. The foreperson for the special grand jury in the probe confirmed to CNN that they recommended multiple indictments, and she teased about where Trump fits into all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's going to be a lot of attention. There's going to be a lot of litigation over the course of many months. So they're smart to, I think, make sure that they're bringing the right charges on the front end. And so what I think they're debating is whether or not to bring, for example, the strongest, most narrow charges, things like interference in an election, or potentially forgery, or some very narrow charges, vs. something very sweeping, like a RICO enterprise, where they're suggesting that this was some sort of organized crime racketeering scheme, very, very broad, more difficult to prove, more sweeping and so forth. So I think that's the sort of thing they're debating. They're also, I think, weighing, for example, do they want to bring charges against more individuals or just pick the individuals for whom they have the strongest charges? And so I think that's a healthy debate. It's often the case in a prosecutor's office, and that's what's going on right now.",

So, I think that's what I would perceive as likely here. There still has to be evidence that's put into the new grand jury. Often, that's done by reading the transcripts from the special grand jury into the new grand jury, so putting that evidence before the grand jury that's going to be considering indictments. But, obviously, there are still some decisions to be made. So delay is always possible. And I think the foreperson's comments only add more complexity and put more of a burden on the prosecutors, because it's another distraction that they have to consider.",
