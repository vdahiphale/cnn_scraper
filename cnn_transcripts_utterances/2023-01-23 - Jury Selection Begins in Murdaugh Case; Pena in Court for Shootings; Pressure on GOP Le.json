They said that part of this is simply staying in the fight in all of this. They say they're having a lot of trouble getting spare parts and also ammo for their Soviet-era tanks. Even internationally, they say, that stuff is becoming very difficult to source, especially because of the attrition on the battlefield here. Now, a senior Ukrainian source that we spoke to said they need around300 to 400 modern western main battle tanks. And they believe, with that number of main battle tanks, they could possibly beat up to 2,000 to 3,000 Soviet era and Russian battle tanks. So certainly they say they need a lot of this, but it would also have a huge effect, especially if they want to get their territory back, which obviously a lot of which is still occupied by Russian forces. It's still shaping up to be quite difficult. I was in touch with some senior German sources throughout the course of the day, and they're still saying they want a broader coalition in all this. They especially want the U.S. onboard, which means they would love the U.S. to give those Abrams main battle tanks. Of course, we've heard from the Pentagon and from Washington that right now they're not willing to do that. They believe that the Abrams is not suited for the battlefields in eastern Ukraine. Obviously, it takes a lot of gas, has that very complicated turbine engine. However, the Germans seem pretty adamant about that point. They do seem to be trying to work out a compromise and there is the feeling that it could happen, but right now it seems as though there are still some things that need to be sorted out. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians say the most-suited tank for the terrain here is really that German-made Leopard II battle tank, guys.",
