So that's going to tell the story. We're likely to hear the basis for why these charges are actually being brought.So there is some strategy. An indictment doesn't have to set forth every single thing that prosecutors know, but it does have to set forth enough to justify bringing the particular criminal charge. Therefore, we're likely to hear some of the what the underlying evidence -- specifically, what was learned from those raids. What did that reveal? We're going to learn about the basis for these particular charges and I would suspect a lot of that is going to be electronic footprint. Remember, during these raids, phones were seized. Computers were likely seized. So that's going to provide a lot of evidence relating to what these charges are in the underlying case.",

This morning we're getting new details about the movements of the suspect arrested in this second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. With us this morning, CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service agent, Jonathan Wackrow. Jonathan, this is the map of the golf course. Let me push in a little bit on the area of interest here. You can see this is the location -- the approximate location of where the suspect was with the gun. And then we learned yesterday that he was in this area, broadly here and maybe just across the street here, for about 12 full hours. What's the significance of that, and what's the significance of trying to figure out whether it was actually right here in the shrubs or in this broader area for that timeframe? JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT (via Skype):  Well, what we know John is that this suspect had ample time find the right location to launch his attack. Twelve hours is an astronomical amount of time for an assassin to really conduct pre-attack surveillance, understand the movements of people in the vicinity, understand where local law enforcement may be driving by. They can see where the Secret Service may be setting up in advance of Donald Trump's arrival to the golf course. So this would-be assassin actually had the advantage of time to really look for this attack location. And that's really disturbing when we think about the threat environment that surrounds former President Trump.",

And we were told yesterday that the shooter didn't get any shots off and didn't have a line of sight on Donald Trump either.You talk about setting up -- having the ability to set up for 12 hours, and that's of concern to the Secret Service. Well, then, what could they possibly do to prevent that? Again, here is the broader golf course. Here is all these main streets. This is Summit, this is South Congress right by. I mean, would the Secret Service have to shut down the area for a day before the former president wants to play golf?",

      "sentences": "Again, you bring a good point here. Again, this is where Donald Trump was. This is the approximate location of the shooter. Trump was on the fifth hole. This is kind of by the sixth hole. The agents were moving ahead of Donald Trump as he golfed.Jonathan, those in the Secret Service and those in the press who have covered candidates or presidents know this is what's called an OTR -- an off-the-record stop for Donald Trump. It wasn't on his schedule, technically, that he was going to go golf on Sunday. When you have OTRs that gives, I think, the Secret Service an advantage because people don't know usually where a candidate is going to be. But Donald Trump golfing on a Sunday at his club isn't really as OTR as OTR is supposed to be, is it?",

A would-be attacked -- all they have to do is just wait.The pattern of behavior of the former president, especially when it comes to golf in certain areas, it's not really a true OTR. The element of surprise is gone. You know if he doesn't have anything on this schedule on a Sunday he's most likely going to go to the club or play golf at that club. So again, I think this is where the further refinement of the protective model for Donald Trump, not as just a former president but Donald Trump as an individual who is facing this astronomical threat environment -- that needs to change, and they have to recalibrate how they're dealing with these OTRs. Because there is no element of surprise when you go to a location that he owns. That is eliminated. So -- and I think that's what the acting director was trying to state yesterday is that change in protective methodologies.",

And I think there's been a real move to put everything on his shoulders. And he deserves some of that weight but not all of it. I worked at the Republican National Committee the morning that Gabby Giffords was shot. I went into my office and had a conference call with colleagues about how are we going to be responsible in this moment. Several years later at a baseball practice, Rodney Davis, former Republican member of Congress, stood in the hallways of the Capitol in his baseball cleats talking to Brianna Keilar about taking down the hate. And what we've seen is the hate is not taken down. When an alleged comedian posts a picture of Donald Trump decapitated -- and she's going to be at Carnegie Hall later this fall -- it tells you that rhetoric is seen as acceptable. When people were telling -- when Maxine Waters, a Democratic member of Congress, says get in the Trump people's faces, what do we expect to happen? The point is it's incumbent on all of us -- Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz -- all of us -- every Republican and Democratic member of Congress to take this rhetoric down because somebody is going to get hurt.

And people react to that language as well. And we've seen this again, Sara, over the years. Should Donald Trump use more responsible language? Absolutely, as should Democrats, as should everyday American citizens. And that's a cultural problem as well. This isn't just politics.

      "sentences": "Yeah, John. So look, last week the Pentagon revealed that it still has about $6 billion worth of funds to spend on weapons and equipment taken directly from DOD stockpiles and sent to Ukraine.Now, the reason why they have all of this excess money that is actually set to expire at the end of September when the fiscal year ends is because these aid packages that the Pentagon has been sending to Ukraine over the last several months have been smaller than usual. They haven't wanted to spend all of the money that Congress gave them in that supplemental back in the spring over the last several months because they simply don't have the excess supply on the shelves that they are willing to part with at this point to provide to the Ukrainians. And this is really an issue, of course, of production capacity. The U.S. has tried to ramp up its production of 155-milimeter ammunition over the last several months and year to try to meet the demand by the Ukrainians in this very protracted war of attrition against the Russians. They are also trying to ramp up the supply of Patriot batteries. But this is a long process and ramping up that production is going to take years rather than months. And it's not going to be an immediate backfill of the U.S. stocks that the Pentagon would feel comfortable with at this point. And so the issue now is a question of military readiness. Of course, the U.S. does not want to dip into its stockpiles too much to the point where it might actually affect the U.S.'s own ability, of course, to be prepared for conflict. And so now we're learning that, of course, the Pentagon, as a result, has been sending a bit less supply to Ukraine because they are trying to preserve their own stockpiles. Now, this is obviously having an impact on the battlefield in Ukraine itself. President Zelenskyy saying that stuff is not arriving fast enough. And, of course, time is of the essence with winter fast approaching, John.",

Biden administration officials saying his recent executive action cracking down on asylum claim access is the reason behind the drop, and that border crossings have now dropped to 2020 levels.The issue of immigration remains very clearly a top issue for voters. And also, very clearly, Donald Trump has led -- has made this a cornerstone of his campaign and has shown in the polls that he has remained leading on this issue. CNN's Arlette Saenz is tracking this for us from the White House. So, Arlette, what are you hearing in terms of the latest numbers from the White House?",
