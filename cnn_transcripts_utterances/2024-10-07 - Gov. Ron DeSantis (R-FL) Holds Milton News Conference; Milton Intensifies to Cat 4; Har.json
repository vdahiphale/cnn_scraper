RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Hurricane Milton, when we were here yesterday morning, said this is a tropical storm, might become a hurricane yesterday, but probably by today. And it became a hurricane very quickly. And so not only is it a hurricane, it's already a major hurricane and its now a category four hurricane with maximum sustained winds at 150 miles per hour. It is expected to make landfall on the west coast of Florida sometime between Wednesday evening or perhaps even very early on Thursday. This has gone slower than the projections were in terms of the - how it's moving towards Florida. And if that continues, it's going to push back when landfall will happen. Of course, you can see impacts prior to the eyewall making landfall. We have made a pre-landfall declaration request to FEMA for support, and Kevin has been working with the administrator. And we anticipate positive approval on that. We have 51 counties in Florida currently under a state of emergency. The executive order that I signed over the weekend also orders all disaster debris management sites and landfills to be open 24/7 in the lead up to Hurricane Milton. We had a lot of debris left from Hurricane Helene on Florida's gulf coast. That creates a huge hazard if you have a major hurricane hit in that area this week. So, we've marshaled state assets to be able to help with that mission and were going to continue to do that until its safe, till it's no longer safe to do so. So, we do have a category four hurricane. It is currently located 745 miles west-southwest of Tampa. It has not moved terribly quickly, but that, obviously, could change going forward. A storm surge watch has been issued for the Florida gulf coast from mainland Monroe County northward to the Suwannee River, the Dixie-Levy County line. Eight to 12 feet peak storm surge is potential for northern Pinellas, all the way down to Charlotte, including in Tampa Bay. Five to ten feet peak storm surge is possible from Yankee Town southward to the Pascoe-Pinellas County line and from Englewood southward to Benito Beach, including Charlotte Harbor. Hurricane watches have been issued for portions of west central Florida and Florida's nature coast. Tropical storm watches extend further south and north through southwest Florida and the keys and along portions of the Florida panhandle. Vision of emergency management is busy facilitating hundreds of resource requests from communities as we prepare for the impacts. We've already sent - sent major truckloads of food and water to central Florida in preparation for points of distribution sites after the storm. We're also coordinating the deployment - BOLDUAN: All right, we've been listening in to the latest update from Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, as the - as that state now prepares for another major hurricane to head towards its west coast. This is just less than two weeks since there - as they're still starting - continuing to clean up from Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago. Let's get over to CNN's Derek Van Dam. He's been tracking this all throughout the morning. Now a category four. And the governor made clear, I mean, 51 of the state's 67 counties now under - have now a state of emergency declarations.",

Gaza's health ministry says nearly 42,000 people have been killed in the enclave. They do not make a distinction between civilian and combatant. Nearly 2 million people have been displaced. And overnight, we have heard about Israel making new moves into the northern part of Gaza and telling people in the southern part of Gaza, issuing new evacuation orders there as the offensive - as the operation offensive continues there. Joining us now to talk about what is happening today with that humanitarian crisis is Dr. Tania Hodgson, co-founder of Gaza Medic Voices. She's also an intensive care doctor with Doctors Without Borders, and Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency physician from Chicago who traveled to Gaza to treat patients and help earlier this year. Thank you both so much for being here. DR. THAER AHMAD, EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN, VOLUNTEERED IN GAZA: Thank you.",

TANYA HAJ-HASSAN, CO-FOUNDER, GAZA MEDIC VOICES: Frankly, Kate, I struggle to even think about it as a war anymore. You have a population of 2 million people in effectively besieged in a concentration camp that have been killed indiscriminately for 365 days now. And I know you said that the ministry of health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but neither did you when you referred to all those killed on October 7th. The death of any human being as tragic, and especially the death of civilians who have nothing to do with any of this. What I can tell you to help you delineate those figures is, 70 percent, or 69 percent if you want to be accurate, of those killed are women and children in Gaza. Women and children. That - that is not a normal percentage of those killed in times of conflict.",

HAJ-HASSAN: Kate, in all - in all honesty a humanitarian crisis is what you deal with when you have a hurricane, what you deal with when you have an earthquake. You have an - an insult and a humanitarian response. This is my - my career. This is what I do for a living. Every single person who does this for a living will tell you the same thing, this is different. This is not a humanitarian crisis. Kate, and I'm going to say it very clearly for your viewers to hear, this is genocide. When 70 percent of the population that are killed are women and children, when the population is starved of food, of water, of medicine, when you have attacks, repeated attacks on all the hospitals, the clinics, the aid distribution sites, the humanitarian aid agencies that tried to help, more U.N. workers have been killed in Gaza than in U.N.'s history. When you have over 900 families that have been exterminated, that have been taken off of the civil registry, killed, when you have over 17,000 children that have lost one or both parents, when you have bakeries, aid distribution sites, churches, mosques, schools, and in the last three days, in the last 24 hours in fact, a hospital today that was bombed, as you just reported, the hospital where I personally was working, and I can tell you, they are working every second of every day to try and sustain life. When Israel's strategy and evidenced on the ground suggests that they're doing the exact opposite. They were targeted today. There was a rehabilitation hospital that - a rehabilitation center that was targeted in the last 24 hours. And there was an orphanage that was targeted earlier this week. These are the types of places that are being targeted. And so it's really hard to hear it over and over and over again, framed in the way that it's being framed in the media, which, frankly, Kate, is very misleading. It is very misleading. Three hundred and sixty-five days of this. Death tolls that are so far outdated we have no many - we have no idea how many people are killed. But I am - I am genuinely afraid about what we're going to find out when the dust settles. History books will be written on this. And countries will have to reckon - media agencies will have to reckon with their major role in the genocide of an entire population and in the destruction of humanitarian law and rule of order.",
