We're waiting right now for Republican lawmakers in that state to reaffirm a new abortion bill that the state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper said last night in this broadcast would turn the clock back 50 years for women. He vetoed the Republican passed measure, which bans most abortion after 12 weeks and imposes other limitations making it harder to get even before that 12-week period. This afternoon, the State Senate overrode his veto, so now, we're waiting to hear from the House where this all could hinge on a single vote. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is in Raleigh for us tonight. So where does the effort to override the governor's veto stand now?",

That was the first part of this two-part process.  Now, this is when it gets a little bit tricky here because it's a numbers game. So in order to override the veto in the House, after this particular debate that is happening right now, they need to have three-fifths of the voting and present members there. Now, if all Republicans and all Democrats are there, Republicans do have enough members if they all vote to override, but that is the key. They have such a narrow supermajority that if one member chooses to defect or chooses not to vote, then the veto override fails and this bill does not become law. If all Republicans vote together tonight, then this bill will be law. Anderson, we expect the vote to take place sometime in the next hour or so as debate continues there on the floor.",

We are talking about jamming this through the system, rapid warp speed here that we are operating. It has since been vetoed.And after and leading up to the governor's veto, he was sort of crisscrossing the state trying to court constituents of these four Republican lawmakers leaning back on past comments they had made about abortion access. Now, two of those lawmakers spoke out against the governor's sort of pressure campaign saying they didn't feel their past statements had conflicted with the current way this law is written. One of those lawmakers, Senator Michael Lee did vote to override the veto in the Senate, but the other three members are in the House. Now, Representative John Bradford has said that he thinks that the governor is wrong, but those other two members, Senate, excuse me, Representative Tricia Cotham and Representative Ted Davis have been quiet about this. Ted Davis did not vote for the bill when it came up roughly two weeks ago in the House. He was absent. Trisha Cotham did vote for it. However, she, you probably remember infamously switched parties last month and when she ran as a Democrat, she ran on a pro-abortion access platform, so much so that she actually introduced, helped introduce a bill that would have codified Roe versus Wade into law in North Carolina. This session just a few months ago, Anderson, we will see how she votes tonight on this veto override.",

A really, really ghastly brutal campaign in stark contrast, almost antiseptic campaign going on in the air with a series now of very intensive air bombardments over Kyiv, culminating last night in very concentrated focused air bombardment. This is how it unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice over)\" A new Russian tactic in the air assault against Kyiv, concentrated fire by missiles and drones, testing Ukraine's air defenses probing for weaknesses.  Ukraine says it shot down 18 missiles, including six Kinzhal, Russia's hypersonic weapon. It was once considered invulnerable to air defenses. Now, not so much. YURII IHNAT, UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE COMMAND SPOKESMAN (through translator): Six of these missiles were fired in the direction of the capital. They were all destroyed by our air defense. KILEY (voice over): Russia has been trying to overwhelm Ukraine with air attacks for months. The results though have been more pledges of air defenses from the US and especially the UK and now even Germany after months of holding back. On the ground, the conflict grinds on in Bakhmut.

We don't really know and they're probably -- they have multiple options at this stage. So Anderson, the counteroffensive probably underway right now. We're just not seeing it, and they are doing reconnaissance in force. They're attacking the logistics backbone of the Russians.

Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating form of dementia that currently affects more than 6 million U.S. adults. The CDC projects it could affect as many as 14 million Americans decades from now.Our Chief Medical Analyst, Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. So, Sanjay, researchers were tracking a man in Colombia, from what I've read, who had a bad family history of early onset Alzheimer's. He didn't get it like most of his family did, and they discovered something in his genes. Is that right? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So this is a very well-known study in Colombia. It's been going on some 40 years. There's a family, an extended family, an extended family, some 6,000 people. And what they found is that there's this one mutation, it's called PSEN-1, presenilin 1. If you have this mutation, you have almost 100 percent guarantee you're going to get Alzheimer's disease. So that's made this particular family very important to study. Now, what they have found is that a couple of times now, the second time it's happened, that despite having that mutation, which again, almost guarantees you're going to get Alzheimer's, there's been a couple of people who still haven't gotten it or they got it much later than otherwise expected. And that's made them, you know, interesting to study. They're trying to figure out what's protecting them, what's making them resilient to Alzheimer's. And is there something that we can all learn from that?",

One-third are men.Is there a different biological process that's happening? Are women diagnosed earlier than men for some reason? They don't know. But again, the protein in this case was helpful, not as helpful. And that's going to be another important clue.",

But I think, as one researcher put it, putting more of this protein in the brain in some way could be protective against the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.Again, very, very early, but there could be therapies. But I think one of the most interesting findings, though, is a second point that you're making. So many of the therapies over the last couple of decades have focused on eliminating or reducing the amount of amyloid plaque in the brain. It's part of the amyloid hypothesis. With this particular brain, this person's brain, who was pretty protected against a guaranteed diagnosis of early Alzheimer's, he still had a lot of amyloid plaque in his brain. He still had a lot of tau tangles in his brain, so more than anything, it may send a signal. Hey, look, maybe we shouldn't focus as much on those treatments as some have already suggested, but instead focus on treatments like this one --",

The man broke into the Green Vault museum in Dresden and stole $123 million worth of jewels. They were part of a well-known Berlin crime family. But some of the most valuable items are still missing. And others who took part in the robbery are going free until their sentences begin.CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): It's one of the most brazen heists in modern history. Robbers shattering glass cases with hammers and making off with tens of millions worth of museum artifacts in Dresden, Germany in 2019. I don't need to tell you how shocked we are also about the brutality of this break in, the museum's director said at the time. This is of invaluable art, historic and culture historic value. The gangsters first started a fire, causing a power outage in the Green Vault museum. Then they broke in and stole 21 pieces of historic jewelry, some of the most valuable in the world, studded with more than 4,300 diamonds. The total insurance value of the loot around $130 million. Five of the six suspects, all members of an infamous Berlin mobster clan, have now been convicted by a German court. One defendant was acquitted. The sentences range from four years and four months to a little over six years. However, some are walking free after a plea bargain with the prosecution, causing angry reaction throughout the country. Three of the main offenders among the adults have been released today, the presiding judge said. But where are the jewels? While the robbers did tell investigators where some of the stolen artifacts were located, helping divers to retrieve them from a canal in Berlin, the most valuable pieces are still missing without a trace. The now convicts claim not to know where they are. This means that the state of Saxony can and must claim its damages within the framework of civil lawsuits, the presiding judge said. State authorities are offering a reward of up to half a million euros for clues helping to find the missing historic jewelry. But they acknowledge some of the pieces might never be found because they've been broken into pieces. All this as those now convicted of stealing the artifacts walked out of the courtroom and drove off, allowed to serve their sentences at a later time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
