And It's Friday, April the 12th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Israel, which is preparing for a possible attack from Iran whilst the U.S. is working to prevent it.Iran's foreign minister spoke by phone this week with his counterparts from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. has reportedly called those three diplomats, urging them to help lower tension in the region. Israel bracing for retaliation after a strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria last week that killed a dozen Iranian military officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's preparing for all scenarios. Here's more of what he had to say during a visit to an Israeli air base on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We are in the midst of the war in Gaza, which continues in full force. At the same time, we continue our unceasing efforts to return our hostages. But we are also preparing for scenarios of challenges in other arenas. And we established a simple principle. Whoever hurts us, we hurt him. We are preparing to meet the security needs of the state of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All of these efforts are due to close coordination with international partners and aid organizations to maximize our combined humanitarian efforts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Both Israel and the United States believe that Israeli targets, American targets in the region are all at risk. Most likely from Iranian proxies in the region.And you have really a flurry of activity to prepare for this and also to try to prevent it. You have the U.S. defense secretary speaking with his Israeli counterpart, reminding them of America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security against Iranian threats. You also have diplomatic efforts from Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling most recently the Turks, the Saudis, the Chinese, urging them to get the message to Iran, not to escalate. Arguing that it is in no one's best interest. You also have American allies, the Germans, the Brits, speaking directly with the Iranian foreign minister. [04:05:00] But according to Iranian state media, the message that, for instance, the British foreign secretary heard in response was that it was American and British silence on that attack in Damascus that is enabling Israel to escalate things throughout the region. In fact, the Iranian mission to the U.N. said this on X, quote: Had the U.N. Security Council condemn the Zionist regime's reprehensible act of aggression on our diplomatic premises in Damascus and subsequently brought to justice its perpetrators the imperative for Iran to punish this rogue regime might have been obviated -- mean removed. Now the U.N. secretary general condemned the attack, but the Security Council itself discussed a Russian drafted statement on this. But because the U.S., the U.K. and France couldn't agree on the details at that moment of what precisely had happened, ultimately no action was taken -- Max.",

And she was asked in a congressional hearing about this external analysis, saying that it was plausible or likely that famine, especially in the north, was already occurring.And she said that USAID had gone through that, scrutinized it and believes that it's credible. And she was asked point blank whether famine is happening already. And she said, yes, in fact, she said that the lack of aid getting into the northern part of Gaza had already contributed to the deaths of children there. Now, this is substantial. This is significant because this is likely to add fuel to the calls on the U.S. government to condition U.S. military aid or maybe cut off temporarily U.S. military aid to Israel. Because American law states this, quote: No assistance shall be furnished to any country when it is made known to the president that the government of such country prohibits or otherwise restricts directly or indirectly the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance. Of course, the U.S. has already made abundantly clear to Israel, especially as of late, that it needs to do more to ramp up aid deliveries into Gaza. And it seems for the moment the Israelis are listening and starting to do that. The question that the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, made clear is whether or not this is going to be a temporary blip or something that is sustained in the long run -- Max.",

It's been mainly in the ground forces. They lost a couple thousand tanks in the ground forces. They've lost as many as 75,000 killed from the ground forces. But they've replenished those.

Now, bear in mind that the Russians entered the Cold War with literally tens of thousands of army vehicles. Most of those went into store. They were stored very badly, and they have taken -- well, some years now to return back into service. So these are perhaps not the sort of leading edge tanks and armored vehicles, but these are old Cold War ones. But they have been re-refurbished. And as the General said, there are thousands of them.I think also that the West has been optimistic, I suppose, about casualty figures. The Russians have been highly successful in recruiting a lot more soldiers, especially those out of Central Asia. They are also recruiting foreigners, of course, out of places like Cuba, Syria, etc. So they have a mix of Russian nationals and foreigners. And of course, the Russians, much to the surprise, you know, to our surprise these days, but historically normal for the Russians, have of course used very large numbers of the convicts and of prisoners as well.
