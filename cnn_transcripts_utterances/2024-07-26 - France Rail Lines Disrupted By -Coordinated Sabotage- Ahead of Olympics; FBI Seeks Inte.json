French officials are investigating an attack on 300 rail lines that shut down travel for tens of thousands of people.Police say key rail lines connecting Paris were targeted in the attack. Cables were set on fire and taken apart. And workers say it'll take days to repair the damage. Let's get to Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. She's actually in Paris. Juliette, what kind of impact is this having? And do we know who might be behind this?",

There we're discussions about concerns about this kind of vandalism.This was pretty well-organized. The one silver lining is, whoever did it -- I'm not defending them -- clearly, did not want a mass casualty event. It was done in the middle of the night. It's done in a way in which it was clear that the trains would not be functional. In terms of a lapse, this is a -- this is a country, like most of Europe, it's very dependent on rail. There's rail lines everywhere. And they -- a lot of them are vulnerable. They're in fields. They're in suburbs and other places. The train stations -- I've been to a couple today -- are heavily fortified. The police presence is like nothing -- I go to a lot of mega-events. This is my fourth Olympics. It's like nothing I have ever seen before. Part of that is because the opening ceremonies in a few minutes are on the -- on the Seine River, and therefore, quite open. But I'm -- I'm standing above a line of about 40 cop cars with their sirens on.",

I mean, from the moment Paris decided what this design would be, people in my field had been hearing about what the -- what the security planning would be around, right? A very, very -- I think it's going to be stunning if it works -- event. And that is they're going to have the boats with the athletes on the sand. They're going to have the entertainment at various like little islands -- I was down there earlier today -- sort of in the middle of the river. And then people sitting by there.So what does that mean security-wise? It means every person who gets close to the Seine has a QR code that has to match their passport. I already went through it once. About a week ago, they set up something called the Silt Area, in which you literally could not spend the night close to the Seine unless you had gone through a background check. And they were -- they were rejecting people. There's snipers on every building. I can see a bunch on the -- just down the street that are looking over the river. And the goal is that it's protected enough in terms of both sides of the river. Bridges are closed. Automobile traffic is closed. That the athletes can enjoy themselves. There's lots -- I have to admit -- there's lots of buzz about Celine Dion and Lady Gaga on the street. So hopefully, in four hours, everything would've gone smoothly.",

Someone may have examined the former president's ear and perhaps may have had some kind of answer to this. I don't know that we'll ever get an answer, to be honest.

But the bigger question I think, what this means for the relationship with the FBI and Donald Trump.

Essentially, you're getting someone who is untouchable where they are to one other place where they can then be taken into custody. The hope is that they won't become suspicious. They won't abort their travel plans. Here, it turns out, according to CNN's Evan Perez, that it was Guzman Lopez who was actually helping U.S. investigators to get Zambada onto an airplane under false pretenses. That aircraft then landing in the U.S. where both men we're taken into custody. Now, a short time ago, Zambada was presented in federal court in west Texas, where he pleaded not guilty. The detention status of Guzman Lopez still somewhat unclear right now. But I am told that an FBI aircraft that's frequently used for extraditions, left El Paso last night and landed near Chicago early this morning. Guzman Lopez faces an indictment in Illinois. So if he was, indeed, on that aircraft, Brianna, expect that we will be seeing him in federal court soon.",
