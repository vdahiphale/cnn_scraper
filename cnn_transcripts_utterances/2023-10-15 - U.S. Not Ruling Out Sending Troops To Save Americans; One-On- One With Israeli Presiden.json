The kibbutz, as you know, is an epitomization of socialism, equality, very pro-peace place. You should know that in that kibbutz, they lost 10 percent of their members, from young to old. I saw the most horrific scenes. I saw -- I saw the skull of the woman in which house I visited. The house totally destroyed, totally destroyed, and they just cut her head off. I saw a pool of blood in that house where the picture of the children is hanging and grandchildren are hanging on the wall, with the knives and the hatchets which they went in. I saw the most horrific scenes possible. I saw bloodshed and I was thinking to myself, because in kibbutz Be'eri, there was a special fund to help their neighbors from Gaza. For years, they've been paying money to help their friends and neighbors in Gaza, because they advocated peace. And all of a sudden, life was shattered. And the same life was shattered for the Israeli nation. My nation is bleeding. My nation is in pain. My nation is in sorrow. And we are faced with an extremely cruel, inhumane enemy which we have to uproot with no mercy. I'll show you another example. This was found on one of the terrorists. This is a booklet, okay? This booklet is instruction guide how to go into a civilian premises, into a kibbutz, a city, a moshav, how to break in. And first thing, what do you do when you find the citizens? You torture them. This is the booklet. It says exactly how to torture them, how to abduct them, how to kidnap them. So, therefore, the story is not Israel versus Palestinians, or Judaism versus Islam, God forbid. The story is about human, humanity. Are we with the good or are we with evil? That's why (ph) humanity should stand, and the battle that we are carrying out now as a nation rising up as a lion is against evil.

They shoot the missiles at our children from their homes, from their shops, from their mosques, from their hospitals.For years, they've been trying to do it. For years and years and years, ever since we withdrew from Gaza in 2005, we pulled back from Gaza. You, Wolf, covered that story, that was a very painful story for Israelis. We withdrew to the last iota, the last inch, and ever since, we're getting thousands of missiles and attacks and terror attacks. But this one exceed them. This one has no comparison to anything. And when I stood up in front of the joint session of Congress, in July, I said to the House, the joint session, Senate and Congress, I said terror cannot be acceptable in any way or form. This is the battleground. That's what we are fighting, and we are trying now to move the civilians so that they will not be hurt, and we want to go in and uproot that infrastructure of terror.

And she's there in Gaza, and nobody knows her whereabouts. And so many other Americans and so many other people. And this -- this living in - in not knowing what's their whereabouts is hell. Actually, this paradise place turned into hell, and it is our obligation to move it from being hell to back to being paradise. And part of it is to bring back the hostages immediately with no conditions back to Israel.

Incidentally, perhaps give hope also to the Palestinians out there so that they can run their life independently in an honor -- in an honorable way, live -- live and let live. But right now, they are under the suppression of Hamas. And what we are trying to do is move them to another safe zone so that they won't be hurt. But Hamas is threatening them, stopping them. Hamas has all the fuel, by the way. It's using the fuel to fight us and shoot at us. Hamas has all the water that they need. They're stopping it. Hamas has clear instructions that they have given to their soldiers to basically torture the people in Gaza. That's what we are seeing. And let me tell you another interesting fact. Hamas is the one that with their missiles broke all the electricity wires supplied to Gaza. We are not responsible for the electricity in Gaza. They are. But since they're sending out fake news and libels (ph) and stories full of lies, our answer is very clear, we will do whatever it takes that civilians will not be hurt.

It was an extremely painful process.We told our people that this will be the new Hong Kong of the Middle East. Within a year and a half, Hamas held a coup d'etat, killed their own cousins, brothers, and family members who were in Fatah, and shoved them out of Gaza, totally disconnecting themselves from the Palestinian Authority, which is in the West Bank. And they -- and they turned this place into an Iranian-supported platform of terror.

They've got hundreds of thousands of troops, 300,000 troops, maybe as many as 400,000 troops who are ready to move in.

And there you are, you know, that you are going to be, in essence, you know, a very vulnerable in a very vulnerable place at that point.DAVID SANGER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I thought it was fascinating interview that Wolf did and as fascinating for his non answers as for his answers. So, as Cedric has said, in this battle, it's going to be very hard to separate civilians and militants. And that's exactly the way Hamas wants it, right. They want to make sure that if there is a battle, particularly in the northern part of Gaza, that there are a lot of civilian casualties, and that the narrative shifts against Israel in that regard. And what was missing I thought from President Herzog's otherwise very compelling argument is a plan for two steps of this. Let's say they are successful, and they get rid of the Hamas leadership, who then runs Gaza. They don't want to. They've been this and tried this before. And yet, it's not clear who would run it. And secondly, it's not clear where all those people are going to go. I mean, to say that they should go to the southern part of the country, even if they could get there is not itself going to be a solution. And that's why I think it's pretty important that Secretary Blinken is, he is flying around the region, he's trying to get the gate opened that would let them go into Egypt. The Egyptians don't want them there. The other Arab allies have not stepped up and said, OK, if they can get them into Egypt, we will take care of them here. And that's the two parts of the plan that are missing.",

And they were moving the Israelis and the Saudis towards doing that. But obviously, what has happened now has set that back, big time.One of the things that the Saudis kept telling me, and I interviewed several of them throughout this entire process is that in order to achieve a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the Israelis have to do some significant things to help the Palestinians and to move what is called this two state solution, Israel living alongside a new state of Palestine. And the Saudis were actually trying to make that happen. And now all of that has gone away, given the Hamas attack on Israel.",

One of the things that the Israelis have said to the IDF spokespeople and others and commanders have said, we don't want to advertise what we're going to do, because that could endanger the entire Israeli operation.So we're not going to tell you precisely how this is going to unfold, when it's going to unfold. It's going to happen, but we're not going to give you details, because that endangers the operation, it endangers Israeli troops 300,000 or 400,000 troops who have now been activated or been mobilized to go into Gaza and God forbid elsewhere, as well.

And in order to be able to do this, we need the civilians to get out of the war zone.For that, of course, this is why we gave this urgent message to tell them to leave. By the way, the way we evacuated our warzone, we evacuated to Sderot this morning. It's a town of 30,000 people and we will evacuate more and more and more. Usual understands, of course, that when the civilians evacuate to the south, they need basic humanitarian conditions to live their lives. And as President Herzog explained, this is very important. Israel will do its share in that. But of course, this cannot be Israel responsibility, right. I mean, Hamas opened this war, we did not get an advance warning for our people to leave all of the communities around Gaza, Hamas came in and saw them. I don't remember, are we getting --",
