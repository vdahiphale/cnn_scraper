Any moment now, the Pentagon take on a tragic turn in Russia's war on Ukraine. A missile cross from the war zone into Poland, killing two. Early signs point to Ukraine firing that missile responding to a Russian attack. NATO's leader says, blame ultimately falls on Russia.Plus, right now a Senate leadership showdown. Rick Scott says Mitch McConnell is to blame for the GOP midterm debacle and he mounts a challenge to the veteran Republican leader. And Donald Trump starts the next campaign. The former president's announcement speech veered from the truth quite a bit, and it painted a grim view of American life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: The citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through. And the total effect of the suffering is just starting to take hold. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The two are wrapping up a meeting with the Ukrainian defense contact group. Those talks with allies supporting Ukraine, our response to a wartime tragedy. A missile that crossed into Poland and killed two people.It was a Russian made missile. But initial U.S. and NATO assessments are that it likely came from Ukraine's air defense system. Still, the NATO secretary general firm in saying Russia is the aggressor in this war, and so Russia bears ultimate responsibility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: Let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility, as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.

      "sentences": "That's right, especially since from when we heard it, we didn't know exactly what was going on. We understood fairly quickly, John, that this was a Russian made missile. Clearly had it been launched from Russia or by Russian forces, the implications would have been extremely grave because of the nature of the fundamental articles. At the very foundation of NATO, of course, an attack against one country is an attack against all, and it would have had very serious implications.Hence those calming words that you heard from Jens Stoltenberg, the ambassadors of the 30 NATO alliance members met here earlier on. And at the end of that meeting very quickly, he gave that initial assessment, calling for calm and urging everyone to keep working together. Of course, the investigation has yet to conclude this is a preliminary conclusion. Moscow is claiming that the investigation will find that this is a provocation from Ukrainians, and we will have to wait for the outcome of the investigation. For the time being though, the fact is that Article Four, Article Five, NATO treaties have not been invoked. And for the time being, it is all about trying to figure out exactly what happened. In fact, that meeting that you mentioned a moment ago led by Lloyd Austin, he began by explaining that this is in fact a reminder of how desperately Ukraine needs updated much more sophisticated defense systems that it has at the moment, suggesting that what is of use had failed to stop that missile. And that has been at the heart of that meeting that's been ongoing, how to get more NATO countries to pledge some of those more sophisticated defense systems that Ukraine has been asking for.",

Jeremy, thanks so much. He'll be standing by as well.Let's get some important perspective now from Andrea Kendall-Taylor. She is the former Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia. Andrea, grateful for your time on this day. You heard Melissa Bell talking about, in the initial moments after a missile hits ground in Poland and people say it's Russian made. There was this worry that we could have an Article Five moment, that we could have an Article Four moment. Now that they believe this was Ukraine's air defense systems firing a missile because of the incoming Russian barrage and it inadvertently crossed into Poland. What is happening right now? We know the defense secretary is on this phone call. What are the conversations within NATO about what do we need to know and what comes next? ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR, FMR. DEPUTY NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER FOR RUSSIA: Well, I think as the reporters have highlighted, Austin and others are meeting in this Ukraine Contact Group, which is a regularly scheduled meeting in order to coordinate important critical military aid to Ukraine. So, I imagine they're all taking stock of what has happened. And figuring out how to lean into this moment and equip Ukraine with what they need to end the war. I think one of the most critical points that comes out of this for me, is that it is in America's interest and our allies' interests to equip Ukraine, to take back their territory and end this war as quickly as possible because the longer this war goes on, we will continue to be exposed to risks like this. So, I think it's conversations about air defenses and other systems that Ukraine need, so that they can more quickly retake their territory and end this war.",

If you're Russia, you're saying this is a provocation from Ukraine, you're looking for cracks in the coalition here. That was why President Biden convened that meeting right away. That is why this defense secretary, and the chairman of the joint chiefs are on the phone with allies right now.From the President of Poland came words, the White House quite welcomed, saying this is a tragedy, but that he too blames Russia, that if Russia were not the aggressor in this war, that would not have happened. Explain to viewers who might not understand. Poland has reserved the right to invoke Article Four. Article Five is an attack on one, is an attack on all. Explain Article Four. KENDALL-TAYLOR: Article Four enables a NATO member to trigger immediate consultations when one country feels that they are under threat. It is not in any way directly linked to triggering Article Five as you mentioned. And it's important to note that Article Four has been invoked regularly, including earlier this year by the polls when Ukraine - sorry, when Russia initiated its attack on Ukraine. So, it is just an opportunity for the allies to get together for immediate consultations to compare notes intelligence and chart the way forward. As you noted, it looked like the polls were going to trigger Article Five - Four in the immediate moments afterwards, but given the intelligence that's coming in, they have rescinded that request.",

This after an effort by Senator Ted Cruz along with a handful of other conservative members of the Republican conference tried to delay this until after the Georgia runoff, which is on December 6. They failed in that of that porch. They got support, though of 16 Republican members of this conference, who are present and voting.It is unclear exactly what will - how many votes will ultimately come down for Senator Rick Scott, but we do expect him to fall well short of the majority needed to become the next Republican leader, that is according to virtually every Republican senator that we talk to. And of course, Senator McConnell has been working the votes behind the scenes for some time. So, the only question now is, how many votes Rick Scott gets. So, they have been talking behind closed doors. They have been members who have given nominating speeches on behalf of Mitch McConnell, dominating speeches on behalf of Rick Scott. Scott has made his case that Mitch McConnell is the status quo. They needed change in direction, criticizing his stewardship of the Republicans outside group that spent tons of money in this past election cycle. Behind closed doors yesterday, Mitch McConnell returned criticism over Rick Scott's handling of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and some Republican senators came to McConnell's defense, including Susan Collins of Maine, who questioned the spending decisions of Scott's campaign committee. So, there's finger pointing has been happening behind closed doors for days, John, because of just how disappointing those election results were. But just in a matter of moments, we do expect that results to come forward. And that's when Mitch McConnell will become the longest serving party leader in U.S. history. John?",

There's also questions about whether Mitch McConnell will continue to serve out for the rest of his term, doesn't stick around in 2024, especially if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. Now he has said, he's going to serve all the way through. He hasn't answered what he would do going beyond that.But there are serious questions. This is the first time McConnell has ever faced a challenger and just, you know, 30,000-foot view here is remarkable. The amount of unrest, we are seeing in both the House and the Senate Republican Party's right now. Mitch McConnell do not think he would be here right now. Kevin McCarthy certainly didn't think he'd be in this position right now. And it's really overshadowing the fact that the House is probably on track to win the majority for Republicans and that McConnell is about to break the record for being the longest serving leader.",

Merrick Garland is the Attorney General, not a Supreme Court justice because Mitch McConnell stood up and said, sorry President Obama, not going to give it to you, too late new term.You mentioned the new wing. Here are the three we know publicly who are supporting Senator Scott. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin just reelected, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Mike Braun of Indiana, newer members of the United States Senate, recent years, the Tea Party movement and so on. So is this a the new ideology, more than a generational thing, more than - it's a new ideology within the Republican Party. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: In some ways and listen. If you're a senator, you are a very ambitious person. And I think some of the frustration goes to that and goes to the way in which Mitch McConnell has a bit of a top-down leadership style, and people who want to move up and have a voice and a presence in shaping the future of the Republican Party. There is frustration with that. Listen, a few weeks ago, I remember us at this table essentially saying Rick Scott and Mitch McConnell, were going to be battling over who would get the most credit over Republicans taking that the Senate that obviously hasn't happened.",
