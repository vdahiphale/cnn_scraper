Calling himself a hostage, Niger's president urges the United States to act in a \"Washington Post\" op-ed. Former U.S. president Donald Trump pleads guilty to charges over the -- not guilty for charges over the 2020 election. And three years on, the people of Beirut remember the port blast in anguish. Moscow claims it repelled a Ukrainian drone attack on one of its key naval bases overnight. A Ukrainian source tells CNN that one of Ukraine's sea drones successfully attacked a navy ship. And these social media images shared Friday appear to show a damaged Russian warship listing heavily in the Black Sea. And look carefully at this nighttime video, which CNN was able to obtain. It appears to actually show an approaching drone. Well, we are watching a courtroom east of Moscow at present where Russian opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, awaits the verdict in a trial that could add, could add two more decades to his time in prison. The longtime critic of President Vladimir Putin could get up to 20 years if convicted of what prosecutors call extremism. He is already serving a more than 11-year term for a separate conviction, and says he expects a, quote, \"Stalinist sentence\" of around 18 years in this case. So let's bring in CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robinson, who's with us now from London to discuss all of this. And we are awaiting that verdict. It is very unusual for a Russian court to actually acquit on a case like this. What can expect at this point?",

This one, according to Ukrainians, was carrying 450 kilograms of explosives. That's a massive punch that it appears to have delivered which is -- can explain why this heavy, tough warship is seen towed into port, listening to one side. These naval drones if you will seem to be able to reach at a range that we haven't seen before because this is a long way from Ukrainian soil. So there's that. And also we understand that at the same time that that was happening, the Ukrainians had launched some regular airborne drones if you will on a similar track towards Crimea. So it's potentially here that they were using a diversionary tactic to occupy the Russian defensive forces, looking in the skies, when they should've been looking in the seas. But as we've seen before, Ukraine is able to get one or two big punches like this before Russia realizes that its military assets are now in target of Ukraine's ever improving munitions and explosives. And that's what this seems to be. This is, you know, a morale boost for the Ukrainians and of course a dent in the armor for the Russian military, and you know, a chip on Putin's, you know, sort of status as somebody who's getting the war right. We saw them lose the Moskva, that massive warship, last year. This is another one that looks like it's headed semi towards the bottom of the ocean.",

We could find out then if his third trial will be held before or after Americans decide whether to reelect him. The former U.S. president and 2024 Republican frontrunner pleaded not guilty Thursday to perhaps the gravest charges yet.

That's what they are trying to do. In contrast to the case in Miami, where one of the codefendants of Donald Trump has stretched out his arraignment over one month, he spent a month of the calendar just trying to get a Florida lawyer so he could be arraigned. In the District of Columbia court yesterday the judge made it clear that this case should move much more quickly. The judge Tanya Chutkan set a hearing for August 28th which is about five days after the first Republican primary debate. And what she's ordered is that the two sides, both Jack Smith, the special counsel, and the Trump team, need to put forward their briefs. Each of them get seven days. And then she is going to set a trial date. So the question is, whether that trial will happen before the 2024 election. That seems to be what the court is trying to do. Now immediately after the magistrate said that from the bench, the former president's lawyers stood up and raised objections. They said this is a voluminous amount of information that they haven't even gotten yet from the government as part of the discovery process. They also pointed out, their constitutional questions, that they're going to try and litigate. And as you know, Becky, the former president has made clear, his legal team has made clear that they want both of his cases to be put back, to be pushed back, and have this happen after the election for obvious reasons. And so now we'll see how this plays out over the next period of months. Can they try and slow this down? I'll tell you this, in that courthouse, which is right across from the U.S. Capitol, where the January 6th attack happened, the judges repeatedly have said that one of the reasons why they've been pushing to adjudicate the hundreds of cases of these rioters is because they want to have a deterrent effect. They want to make sure that after the next election, nobody tries to do what happened then again -- Becky.",

The junta warning on state television that any military intervention from the West African regional block known as ECOWAS will be met with an immediate response. Well, ECOWAS has threatened to use force if Mohamed Bazoum is not reinstated as Niger's president by this weekend. The junta also announced it has dismissed the country's ambassadors to France, the U.S., Nigeria, and Togo. And it has revoked various military agreements with France because of its, quote, \"offhand attitude\" to last week's coup. France however is rejecting the junta's move to cut military ties. Let's bring in David McKenzie on this. You are watching developments from Johannesburg.

That's becausein previous coups in the Sahel over the last few years, pretty quickly you got a sense that the coup leaders have consolidated their power, and that the game was up for the president or leader at the time. It doesn't appear like that now I have to be honest. You have the junta as you say cutting ties with the French militarily. But the French are just dismissing that, saying that they aren't the genuine government of Niger. And also hinting in their statement, the French saying that they're just elements of the military. So there is an open question now whether there is broad based support of this coup takeover by elements of the security forces in Niger. You've had this diplomacy today, the ECOWAS, the regional group sending senior former leaders and diplomats into the country to try and hash out some kind of negotiated settlement. That clearly hasn't happened yet. And as you say, the clock is ticking. ECOWAS has been much more forthright and aggressive in potentially dealing with this coup, saying they could send in troops, and that the deadline would be some time maybe Sunday into Monday. Here's the response from a spokesperson of the coup leaders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMADOU ABDRAMANEADOU ABDRAMANE, NIGER MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator): ECOWAS being impersonal, any aggression or attempted aggression against the state of Niger will be met with an immediate and unannounced response by Niger's defense and security forces on one of its members with the exception of the suspended friendly country.

There are some analysts who are saying, well, while that deadline was given, there may well be some wiggle room if it looks like there is a chance for a successful negotiation to bring back democracy somehow to Niger. The U.S. in particular while it's talking in strong terms hasn't called this a coup as we've spoken about. And interestingly, the Pentagon has said that that very large base in Agadez, a drone base of the U.S. which is critical for intelligence gathering and for anti-terror operations, is still operating in some shape or form, and they are still cooperating with the military. When you put all of this together, it means that this is a very fluid situation and certainly hasn't settled one way or the other -- Becky.",
