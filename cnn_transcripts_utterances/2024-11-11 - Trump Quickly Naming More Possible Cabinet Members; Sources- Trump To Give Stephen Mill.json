The newest Trump pick just dropped in the last hour. Former New York congressman and gubernatorial candidate, Lee Zeldin, has been tapped to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. That follows news from last night where Trump named Tom Homan, who you might remember as the ICE or Immigration and Customs Enforcement director from his first term, his time, he's going to be the border czar in the second Trump administration. Trump says Homan quote, will be in charge of all deportation of illegal aliens back to their country of origin, unquote. Homan said this on CBS in late October. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I am told that deputy chief of staff actually is minimizing the amount of power that Stephen Miller is going to have in a second Trump administration.He is going to have a lot of say on policy decisions of course on immigration. I'm told a lot of immigration policy including the plans for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is going to stem from the White House. But, also, he is being involved in a lot of these transition roles now. He has a big say in that and we've seen miller is really uh particularly in the last weeks of that election traveling with Donald Trump. He was the one who told the former president that he believed immigration should be the number one issue that he talked about on the trail advice we saw Donald Trump use in real time. And so, I think that is going to be a very big pick and you can't -- you know, you can't minimize the role that Stephen Miller is going to have come January -- Jake.",

      "sentences": "Well, this was widely expected. Tom Homan has been a supporter of Donald Trump over the last several years. It tells us two things though. One, as you heard from Alayna, the power center on immigration policy is going to be the White House.Number two, it's that they're taking this very seriously. That might sound obvious but Tom Homan is a veteran immigration official. We talk about his time during the Trump administration but he had served at ICE during the Obama administration. In fact, he presided over the time where Obama did deport a record number of undocumented immigrants and the former president at the time had granted him the highest civil award. So, he has a lot of experience when it comes to immigration and specifically immigration detention and removals. Now, he was also behind family separation he is an architect of that. He certainly does take a more hard line view on immigration policy. But when he has described how he envisioned this going, he says that he wants to target criminals specifically public safety and national security threats. Now, we don't know what the definition is of those beyond what may seem obvious. But in addition to that, he also wants to resume work site enforcement raids. That was something that President Biden discontinued in 2021. Now, when we've covered these types of enforcement measures before you may go for one person, but you may come across others who are undocumented and there can sometimes be collateral to these types of enforcement measures. It's also a way that you rack up the numbers when it comes to immigration detention and deportation. So he is going to be at the center of this and he is someone who knows how to do it. So that is going to be -- so it was quite telling that they named him to be the borders are should also note. There was a time in the first administration where Donald Trump wanted to bring him on as czar and it caught Tom Homan by surprise. He didn't end up joining but certainly he has been an influential voice on the outside, and I'm told that he is going to be critical on the inside as well.",

Look, just under the Biden-Harris administration convicted criminal aliens percent less deportations than what we saw under the first Trump administration.I think it's important not to just gloss over the fact that you want to remove dangerous people from -- from American communities. It's just not happening now. The Biden team will say that that's their priority but the numbers don't lie. They're just not removing folks in the manner in which they should. So I think if they were to ask that should definitely continue to be the priority but this idea that you're going to exempt whole classes of individuals from the law, I don't think that should be the case either and of course we've seen that as well.",

There's one -- almost 1.5 million individuals here that have gotten a final order of removal from an immigration judge but have not left the country. And again, they've gone through the due process system and so, it's really important to remove those individuals but the example that you gave of an illegal alien spouse married to a U.S. citizen, there's a way to cure their illegal entry into the United States. The law already allows for that. They've got to take advantage of that they've got to do that process and then they can come back into the country legally. So I think a lot of this is just explaining the various options out there and again we come back to allowing folks to come into the country legally is fine. I don't think that anyone is not in favor of that. It's the illegal activity and then sort of turning your head and blessing it and say, no, that's fine, let's just move on.

And the Russians believe that they're going to be able to drive the Russians off that Russian territory there in the Kursk, something that the Russians have said they want to do. Vladimir Putin has said he wants to do, but he's also said that he's really in no rush to do that. The Russians are continuing to say that for them, the main battlefield is still in the east of Ukraine. Never the less, the force seems to be formidable.The Ukrainians are saying that, U.S. sources are saying that. The Ukrainians are also saying that the North Koreans are apparently among those Russian military troops on the ground, that those do play a very important role in all of this. They say very few are on the front line even though there have been direct battles between Ukrainian troops and North Koreans but they say just the fact that even in the rear, in the second echelon that there are North Korean troops there, that frees up more of the Russians to then assault the Ukrainian forces that are there on the ground. The Ukrainians have said as far as Kursk is concerned, the area they did their incursion into, they don't want to annex that territory. Ukrainian does not want to keep that territory, but they believe it could be very important as a bargaining chip for the Ukrainians if and when any sort of negotiations with the Russians, for them to possibly exchange that territory in return for areas that the Russians currently occupy inside of Ukraine. Right now, the vibe were getting here inside Russia with that incoming Trump presidency is that people are not sure what a new President Trump will bring, but they believe they might be in a good position to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow, Jake.",

They were saying it's false, it's untrue, completely untrue.So they obviously want to say that none of this ever happened. One of the reasons for that of course, for that, is that the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, he was at a conference in Sochi in the south of Russia when this call allegedly took place. It went on for a long time. Till half past midnight local time Russia. At that time, he said he had not had any contact with Donald Trump after Donald Trump was elected. However, he did say he was willing to speak to Donald Trump even before he takes office and he did say that a lot of the things that Donald Trump said in the campaign trail, for instance, wanting to end the war in Ukraine, wanting to normalize relations with Russia, those were things that were interesting for the Russians. So they certainly seem to be wanting to build relations once again. There's hope of the incoming Trump presidency, but also, uncertainty here in Moscow as well, Jake.",

I think you've lifted up our veterans in a -- in a uniquely powerful way, one.Two, as it relates to Los Angeles, our decision to appeal a part of the judge's ruling there reflects the following, over the course of the last year, we have permanently housed in the United States about 48,000 homeless veterans. The president announced today that the level of veteran homelessness across the country today is lower than it's ever been. It's down something like 56 percent since the recorded high in 2010. So, we're making good progress the judge's ruling in Los Angeles would have us take resources dedicated to new housing that's not part of our existing master plan. Under the existing master plan, we've gotten hundreds of new units built on the facility in Los Angeles. We've permanently housed in the last year homeless veterans in Los Angeles. This would redirect resources not only from Angeles and San Francisco but from across the country into not previously arranged for efforts. And every day today in Los Angeles every day, we have available transitional housing for homeless veterans. So we think it's not consistent with the plan, a plan that is working well and a plan that we take deadly seriously and that we've shown you know as the president announced today is reducing veteran homelessness.
