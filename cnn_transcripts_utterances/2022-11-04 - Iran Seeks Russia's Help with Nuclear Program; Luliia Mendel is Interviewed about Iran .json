      "sentences": "That's the big question right now. And we don't actually know how Russia has responded to this request by Iran to help kind of bolster its nuclear program with additional nuclear materials, with nuclear fuel fabrication, things that could help power its nuclear reactors. And, of course, we should note that experts say that it depends really on which reactors this fuel is used for in terms of the nuclear proliferation risks. So kind of very technical stuff there.But the bottom line is that Russia and Iran's partnership is expanding and it's worrying U.S. officials and U.S. allies just because of the shear amount of areas where we have seen Russia and Iran begin to cooperate in recent months, including, of course, in Ukraine, where Iran has provided Russia with hundreds of drones to use there. So, the bottom line right now is that according to the U.S. intelligence that was described to us, Iran has been looking for a backup plan should nuclear talks fail. They want a contingency plan, a deal with Russia, a side deal with Russia, that allows them to reconstitute their nuclear program quickly if they have to. And this is not only if the nuclear deal fails, of course it seems very far out of reach right now, but it is also in the event that a nuclear deal somehow goes forward. They believe that there is still a high risk. That even if a deal is struck, then a future administration could simply pull out of it, right, and sanctions could be reimposed and then Iran would be left where it is. So, right now, the officials are watching it closely. We were told by the National Security Council spokesperson that they will work to counter any cooperation between Iran and Russia that they deem counter to their counter-proliferation efforts. But ultimately, you know, it is not something that they are going to be able to address immediately just because of the shear, you know -- the way that U.S., Russia and Iranian relations are just so, you know, hindered right now, Jim.",

Final question, if I can. You've been well aware of the nuclear threats that -- both in rhetoric and hints, et cetera, that the Russian president and other officials have made.

And I'm very much concerned because we don't know, maybe they want to do something terrible there. Actually, this is the same what we heard yesterday from - from Russian - pro-Russian collaborator who is appointed there as an authority, and he said that something terrible is going to happen there. While we also have heard from the U.S. intelligence that Russian military leaders were discussing usage of nuclear tactical weapons and we are afraid maybe he would like to use a tactical weapons there. But also let me remind that there is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that is fully under control of Russians. And they shelled there. And they control it.

One of our big worries has been the back sliding on education because of the school closures. And so these are core issues that -- and I call it a crisis facing development.
