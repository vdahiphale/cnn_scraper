      "sentences": "Well, Isa, frankly, we could have a prime minister as soon as Monday, if all of the chips fall into place for thatscenario. So, basically, the chair of the 1922 Committee of back-benchers and the chalk(ph) party chairman today outlined the rules of how leadership race will work. A very expedited leadership  race. And so, all of the nominees need to be in by Monday afternoon. And so, they have the next three full days in order to try to get enough support from their fellow MPs to actually get on any kind of ballot. But the bar, frankly, is high. We're talking about the support of 100 MPs that any leadership candidate will need to be even considered. So, given that there are 300 some odd conservative MPs right now, potentially there could be up to three candidates. It is a high threshold, considering the fact that in the first round of voting in the leadership race in the Summer, nobody reached 100 votes in the first round of voting. It wasn't until the second round of voting that Rishi Sunak reached 100. And then, it wasn't until four rounds later when Liz Truss reached a 100, and then in the end, there was only three candidates whoever got the support of 100 MPs. Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. So now, there are plenty of questions about who might actually be able to reach that threshold this time around. Surely, some of the more minor, less experienced candidates may not put their names forward. They may opt back other candidates. But surely, this is setting up to favor candidates like Rishi Sunak, like potentially Penny Mordaunt, perhaps not Boris Johnson, if the talk of his potential return to politics or attempted return to politics, or the leadership, I should say, are actually true. Now, if they actually do get more than one candidate to reach that initial threshold, this is not a coronation on Monday. Then if they get down to two candidates, then that should go to a vote amongst the membership. But given that we're on such a shortened timeline, Isa, that brings up all kinds of potential questions about how to reach voters that the party may not actually have an e-mail address or any kind of electronic communications with. And also, about the security of voting online. Here's what the party chair said about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But they dohave a loudspeaker, and so that's why you can hear them chanting over and over again, Tories out. And perhaps, that chant over and over again is reflective of how the country is feeling about the Conservative Party at this point. Their popularity is extremely low. If a general election were to be held today, they would be absolutely trounced by the Labor Party. Labor is pulling, at least, with twice the support that the Conservatives actually have. And so, that's why the Labor Party is calling for a general election, saying that the conservatives no longer have a mandate to actually govern the country. The difficulty for the conservatives is that there's really no incentive for them to actually call a general election at this stage, given the disarray that the party is in right now. And given the fact that they're just about to sign on a brand new leader. Surely, they would want to have some time to get their house in order before going anywhere near a general election, Isa.",

There's a couple of very strong candidates, Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, Penny Mordaunt, who is currently the leader of the House of Commons, both secured well over 100 votes from each -- from the last leadership election. Both have good, strong reputations. One is particularly strong in economics with Rishi Sunak, but Penny Mordaunt has had some extremely good performances in the House of Commons, lifted the morale of her colleagues, and may provide a very strong challenge, as a potential leader. So, I think it will revolve around those people, a possible outsider is the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who represents very much the far-right of the parliamentary party and conservative membership. So, I think colleagues will probably be wary promoting someone like that to the leadership, and possibly can be bad luck, who did very well. She's now the business -- International Trade Minister, and she had a very good go at being leader from a start. She's quite a young, relatively new member of parliament.

The government is making it very clear to people, take responsibility, turn the lights off, don't use equipment that draws a lot of -- a lot of power. We need to conserve what we have, and people are respecting that. But you heard from -- we heard from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here today, an appeal to the international community as well for support and help, and helping keep the electricity supplies going.

So it willdepend a lot on how many people put themselves forward. And what part of the party vote what they split? Because if there are several right-wing candidates, then maybe none of them would get through because they wouldn't cross the 100 MP threshold. All that is to be decided. But the maximum number of candidates we can get is three. Now of course, it is possible that only one person will get through. And if it's two, perhaps they will drop out before or maybe those two names will go to the membership. But what that 100 threshold does suggest, according to my sources, is that it will make it a lot harder for that blonde elephant in the room, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to make it through to the membership stage.

As everybody knows, they would lose if they were to call the election. They're so unpopular. The Labour's way, way ahead of them in the polls. The only other way to do it is if Labour, the opposition party, called a vote of no confidence. That would be unlikely to work because the Tories actually right now have a majority in Parliament. They want to hang on to it. So people are beginning to say, when do we get our say? Especially on these very radical economic measures that were instituted by basically a party of two, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, without any due diligence from any independent data crunching, fiscal observers who usually do weigh in. What's going to happen, you've been talking to Bianca about it, is they're going to have this MP selection. They said the nominee should be in by Monday. We'll see what happens. In the meantime, I spoke to the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, a Labour MP, a Labour member. Obviously. And he is abroad. He was quite shocked, he said, and surprised by all this.

He obviously was the former chancellor, who precipitated Boris Johnson's fall. He also brought up the idea of Boris Johnson.

For the country's finance minister, the terms have been even briefer with four appointees in the past three months. And it's this instability, coupled with low economic growth, that has really prompted unflattering, let's, say comparisons with Italy. For example, this magazine cover by \"The Economist\" has caused outrage among many Italians. Now Italy's ambassador to the U.K. has hit back at what he calls old stereotypes. \"Although spaghetti and pizza are the most sought after food in the world, as the largest manufacturer in Europe, for your next cover, we would suggest you pick, for a change, from our aerospace, biotech, automotive or pharmaceutical sectors. \"It would cast a more accurate spotlight on Italy. Also taking into account your not so secret admiration of our economic model.\" An interesting case, if you are not sure, let me show you that front page again of \"The Economist.\" We can bring it up, I will ask my producer to bring it up again. Because I want to discuss this with Silvia Borrelli in Milan, correspondent for the \"Financial Times.\" And Silvia, look, I'm not an Italian. I found it a bit offensive. Your thoughts? SILVIA SCIORILLI BORRELLI, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\": Hi, Isa. Well, definitely some powerful symbolism there. And, of course, Italians don't like to be stereotypically portrayed as people who are kind of colorful and live in a country full of sunshine and great food but are kind of lazy and, you know, don't have anything more than that. But you know, if we look at things for the way they are, Italy has been characterized by political instability, slow economic growth, as you said. It has always had very nervous bond markets. So there is a parallel there, right? I don't necessarily think that cover reflects the context of the article. But of course, there is a very strong parallel between what Britain's going through right now and Italian politics. The only difference, I think, is that, for Italy, it's structural. And it has now been embedded in the system and Italians have found a way to make it work. As for Britain, they've created it for themselves and they're having a very hard time managing the instability.",

And it has a system of checks and balances in place. So things work all in all. It is the third economy in the European Union and it is a G7 country. Notwithstanding the almost 17 governments in 70 years. So clearly the Italians don't like that, you know, British people see them as lazy or that they always point to the defects as opposed to the great things that are part of the country, as the ambassador has pointed out. But of course, again, you know, Italy is now back to form a new government. The right wing government that is likely to be in power very soon has had some propositions that are very similar to Liz Truss.
