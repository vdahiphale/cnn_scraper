Just ahead, an escalation crisis in Sudan sees thousands desperately trying to escape as foreign nations run and rush to get their people out. We are live in the region with more on this unfolding story.Also ahead, Russia's Foreign Minister is in New York today to chair a U.N. Security Council meeting and is already hitting out of the U.S. Plus, CNN hears from the voiceless victims of a banking crisis in China. Many of them still can't get access to their money, months after they were promised they'd be paid back. Land and Sea nations from around the world are scrambling to get their citizens out of harm's way as the security situation in Sudan deteriorates. A deadly power struggle between rival military factions is now in its 10th day. Embassies are being closed and diplomatic staff is also being evacuated. Meanwhile, in the Capital Khartoum phone lines are down, internet services sketchy and authorities are urging residents huddled in their homes to stay there. Let's get CNN's Stephanie Busari. She's in Lagos, Nigeria. It does seem as though there's a massive operation underway, and some countries are handling it better than others.",

And this is according to this Doctor's Union of Sudan.And so these ongoing fighting is hampering efforts to evacuate citizens. Some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., France and Canada, among others have managed to get their diplomats out and some private citizens have to make their way in bus journeys to countries such as Egypt alongside other Sudanese citizens. And his verse journeys are not easy at all. We're here in very uncomfortable journeys where very young babies have been a part of the passengers and they are some of them sitting on the floor. It's about 1000 kilometers away from Khartoum to as one in Egypt. So that people are faced in desperate situations to try to get out of Sudan. Do they stay and face bombing and dwindling food and water supplies, lack of electricity? Or do they get on the road and make these very, very dangerous journeys, Max?",

So there's a sense of people feeling abandoned once all foreign workers and foreign citizens are gone. Are people still going to care about us? That's the question that people are asking, Max.",

This all comes as Russia is threatening to terminate the Black Sea grain deal, which is because the crucial to easing the world's hunger crisis, as it safeguards the passage of ships carrying Ukrainian grain and oil seeds from Black Sea ports.Russia says the initiative will be over if G7 countries ban exports to Russia.

      "sentences": "Right, so the background here is, of course, this black sea green initiative that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey back in July. And alongside that was a memorandum of understanding between Russia and the U.N. that Russia had demanded would involve alleviating some sanctions that it said was preventing its own food and fertilizer from reaching the market.So that part of the deal Russia says has not been met, it's still having trouble with its own exports. And that is why it's threatening to pull out of the deal. There's another obviously elements of this that Dmitry Medvedev, the Former President and Prime Minister has added in, which is this consideration by the G7 to flip around the way that it restricts exports to Russia from just restricting some of them to de facto restricting all of them with some exceptions. So it has obviously taken great offense to that and is now threatening to cancel the grain deal. It's done this before Russia pulled out of the deal in the autumn and then returned. So this is a way of sort of showing its leveraging this major diplomatic achievement, really the only one that was made in this war that has huge consequences for the world and doing it at a pretty sort of interesting time when we know that. For example, Ukrainian grain exports into certain European countries have been stopped because they're worried about a glut undercutting their own farmers just comes just weeks before Turkish presidential elections. So it seems that the timing of this is interesting, but it's not necessarily in Moscow's interest to pull out of this deal altogether.",

His team is finalizing the details of the campaign ahead of Tuesday's expected video announcement. Mr. Biden spent the weekend at Camp David.According to sources he was putting the final touches on his campaign launch, but recent polling shows his age at 80 could be a major factor in the campaign. According to an NBC poll 70 percent of those surveyed said he shouldn't run again. And almost half of them cited his age. White House correspondent Arlette Saenz joins us now from Washington. There are criticisms obviously about his decision to run again, but they don't seem to be many other democratic contenders that the wider world would know about.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think Max, that is a long standing historic complaint, particularly leveled, I think historically against the British who frequently have been accused of not prioritizing the interests of British nationals over their relationship with local authorities.But more broadly, also, the Americans have been haunted by the killing in Benghazi a few years ago of their own ambassador at the embassy there, again, under a Democratic administration in Libya, during similar period of chaos. So I don't think we should be particularly surprised that the Americans, the Brits, the French, and most of these nations prioritize getting the people for whom they have a kind of direct moral and personal responsibility. If you like in terms of diplomats, there are some ambassadors from some countries that have remained behind, Max. But more broadly, this is actually a military problem, you can relatively easily take a small number of people, particularly people working for a government, who were in the government communications structures out of the country, if you deploy Special Forces. Now we saw the British deploy the Special Air Service and paratroopers in a joint operation involving 1200 personnel to get over 100 people out of the country. But if you think that the Americans have got 16 to 19,000 American passport holders in Sudan, the British might have many, many hundreds. One can assume various nationalities have many, many more than that the Egyptians, of course, have very close by they've managed to evacuate nearly 500 people overland. Now the focus is out of Djibouti here as you've got a huge concentration of International Special Forces, which is why we're not allowed onto the base because these are the most elite. And secret operators around the world flying missions in and out of Sudan trying to organize, trying to connect themselves to people who are stuck in very difficult circumstances. The fighting in Khartoum, in particular, isn't across front lines. It's a pell-mell across the whole city with pockets of forces fighting one another with civilians, trying to navigate between them frequently. Crossing the localized frontlines in order to get out very complex situation, which is likely to get more and more complex because there is no sign of any of the negotiations efforts for a ceasefire to get international people evacuated, materializing. And then, Max, on top of that, because you've got poorer countries like Uganda who just had to move people. There's a report we've got 300 Ugandans on the road to the Ethiopian border, which is a long way away by bus that seems to be the only option for many people, Max.",
