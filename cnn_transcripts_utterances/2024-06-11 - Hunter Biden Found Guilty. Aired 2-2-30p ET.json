Here's David Weiss.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID WEISS, SPECIAL COUNSEL &amp; U.S. ATTORNEY FOR DISTRICT OF DELAWARE: This case was about the illegal choices the defendant made while in the throes of addiction, his choice to lie on a government forum when he bought a gun, and the choice to then possess that gun. It was these choices and the combination of guns and drugs that made his conduct dangerous. Second, no one in this country is above the law. Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant. However, Hunter Biden should be no more accountable than any other citizen convicted of this same conduct. The prosecution has been and will continue to be committed to this principle. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And yesterday, when they took their first vote, which is usually what you do when you go into the back to begin your deliberations, you put the first vote in the deliberation room. And then you put the second vote in terms of these three counts, who's for a conviction and acquittal, who's not sure. One of the jurors tells Hannah that it was 6-6, so it was split half and half. We know this jury is comprised of six men, six women. It is a majority black jury. We learned when they came back this morning it was 11-1 in favor of conviction. So at least some jurors went home, and after some more reflection, after they got some sleep, they decided that they were, in fact, convinced the prosecutors had proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt.We learned that the other jurors really focused on that one holdout and convinced that individual that prosecutors had proven the element of knowingly. Knowingly is significant because prosecutors had to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly lied when he filled out that form to own the firearm. He knowingly lied that he was either using or addicted to illegal drugs. And we have kind of a mixed verdict from the jury on whether this was a worthy pursuit. One juror telling Hannah that they believe this was a waste of taxpayer money, but they thought they had no choice but to convict based on the instructions that they were given by the judge. But then another juror that Manu Raj and I talked to on air said that he believed that, yeah, it was a legitimate pursuit. So it seems like even though they were unanimous in their conviction, a little bit of a mixed verdict in terms of whether this case, which has come under criticism even from prominent Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Representative Matt Gaetz, mixed verdict from the jurors as to whether this was a good use of taxpayer money.",

You saw him put out a written statement where he reiterated what he's essentially said from the start, which is he loves his son, he supports his son. Obviously, he is showing with his feet by going to Wilmington that he supports his son, that he's there for his son. You know, there's not a huge imperative for the president to turn the narrative toward conversation of this and, you know, adding a topper to this event and bringing the conversation back there doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So I'd be really, really surprised if he adds something at the top of his remarks. Not impossible that he might take a question from reporters on his way out the door, but I would expect that he will probably be focused on the on the topic at hand here.",

So you have the gun trial and you have this gun event. And I just wonder what you think about that.SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yeah, I mean, so the next system-so when you complete form forty four seventy three in order to possess or purchase a firearm or to transfer a firearm or to pick up rather transfer of a firearm, you complete that document. The FFL holder typically at a gun shop will run your information through NICS national instant background check system, which is in existence because of the ninety three Brady Act, President Biden knows a whole lot about that. And it's to make sure that you don't have any criminal background in order to legally possess a gun. So it is interesting that the president is speaking about this issue. Yet his son, for the most part, would have been able to successfully complete the background check were it not for his inability to do so because he used illegal substances. I do wonder, though, and I mentioned this to Kate earlier. Would the president potentially commute his son's sentence to avoid SCOTUS being able to take a look at this and say, wait a minute, we do need to make some changes because this is in violation of the Second Amendment? And I think that's a fascinating topic for the White House to consider.",

So I would be I would be very surprised if he used it in that strategic way. I don't think that's the lens through which he's seeing it.",

So they answered that question. And then he said, I believe, and the jury believed, he did knowingly buy the gun knowing he was addicted. Pretty, pretty common sense. The other thing that I just thought was interesting was we asked him, was the jury influenced by the Biden family? And you could really see this was a Delaware jury because first, juror number 10 said, not at all, put it out of our mind. But when he talked about members of the Biden family, he called the first lady Jill. That's a Delaware jury. And Hallie and Naomi, they know the members of the family.",

Needless to say, you're looking at a period of months to low one years or but not several years in prison. Like so when we hear this, well, he's looking at 25 years in prison.

And it is certain that the Republican nominee will try to use this to muddy the waters, to try to paint some sort of equivalency between what he faced and what Hunter Biden faced.

And you contrast that with the former president who's attacked the legal system. He's questioned its legitimacy. And so I think that is part of the choice voters are going to have in November.

But it's becoming harder to do. And I do think this campaign, because of the way that the former president is launching attacks on the system, will be a stress test, unlike many that we faced, and a stress test for the legal system.
