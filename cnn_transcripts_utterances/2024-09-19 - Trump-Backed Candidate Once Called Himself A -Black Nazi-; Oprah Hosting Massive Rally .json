I'm Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight: we begin with breaking news, the Trump campaign reeling tonight after a stunning report from our own KFILE which reveals the Trump-backed candidate for governor in North Carolina, mark Robinson has made dozens of disturbing and comments on a porn website. Some of the comments are frankly so disturbing that we cannot air them. But they include Robinson writing, quote, I am a black Nazi, and, I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. Robinson also calling himself a, quote, perv while discussing his affinity for transgender pornography. Keep in mind that he has called transgender kids sick and demonic. These comments were made between 2008 and 2012, and at this hour, Robinson is defiant, refusing to step beside. At this point, Robinson has only five hours to do so, five hours in order for Republicans to find a replacement candidate. The deadline is tonight at midnight. As for the Trump campaign, they've released a statement trying to distance Trump from Robinson, saying, we're focused on winning North Carolina and we will not, quote, take our eye off the ball, by trying to avoid the topic. But here's the fact: Robinson's Trump's guy. This is what Trump's been saying about Robinson for years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is Martin Luther King on steroids. I think you're better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two. One of the great stars of the party, one of the great stars in politics, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. I'm a great supporter of his. You're incredible lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. He's a hot politician. He's a hot politician, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. A real star, great guy, friend of mine, Mark Robinson.

Mark Robinson had previous comments that voters were well aware of and still elected him lieutenant governor, and he got Trump's endorsement. I can't imagine that Donald Trump would backup wait from that endorsement and somehow turn up the heat the next four hours to try to boot Robinson off the ballot and bring in a different Republican.
