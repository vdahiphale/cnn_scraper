In addition to the fact that basically since 2011, first, with the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, and then by the Civil War between the east and the west, that simply the maintenance said basic civil servants -- services have been largely ignored.And therefore this is the consequence, this disaster happens. And the authorities in the eastern part of the country where Derna is simply aren't equipped to deal with this disaster. What we're seeing is and hearing accounts of just bodies strewn all over this city, covered with blankets. But it's hot still in that part of the country. And doctors are concerned about the outbreak of disease as a result of all these dead bodies. Hundreds, it looks like thousands of bodies in the street. Now it's also hard to get assistance to the town because many of the bridges and the roads leading to Derna have been washed away. And because of the political divisions, for instance, Algeria has shipped emergency relief supplies not to the eastern part of the country, but to Tripoli, which is more than a thousand kilometers away. And therefore there's a desperate appeal by the authorities there for the world to help. But the response has been fairly meager. The United States announcing it's donating a million dollars in assistance, Britain a million pounds. But the depth of need there is much, much greater than that. Brianna?",

Republican Senator Josh Hawley calling it a, quote, giant cocktail party. And Democratic Senator Dick Blumenthal says it is unproductive. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT), CHAIR, PRIVACY, TECHNOLOGY &amp; THE LAW SUBCMTE.: This forum is not designed to produce legislation. Our Subcommittee will produce legislation. My goal is not a informal behind closed doors discussion. It's new laws. Not bills, but laws. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I've been texting folks, Boris, both on the Congress side and on the tech side. And there seems to be a mutual agreement that this was optimistic, that this was quasi productive. There has been some naysayers, like Senator Richard Blumenthal, who have said, look, this is a closed door hearing. There's no legislation being debated. What's the point?But the point here is that there's now consensus. A real sense of urgency needs to happen in order to get government to regulate AI. Before, we did not have a set of major tech CEOs all sitting around a U shaped table nodding their heads, saying, this is something that needs to get done. Now we have that consensus. And so I think most folks thought that this meeting was productive, yet we still don't have any sort of real legislation that's pending at the moment.",

Do we promote open AI algorithms and systems, or do we want to keep them closed? These are the types of things that lawmakers and committees like Senator Richard Blumenthal and his partner on the Republican side, Josh Hawley, are debating right now.But to your point about this happening in an era when it didn't happen in social media, two thoughts there. One, a lot of these folks now have experience on Capitol Hill. They're much more willing to come and talk to members of Congress and the Senate because they've done it before. And then, two, I think they've learned their lesson. They did not have a strong hand in shaping regulation in the social media era because they weren't actively participating in it from the start. They ran in fear. Now, these big tech firms have huge D.C. offices, big numbers of lobbyists on the ground. They're less afraid to go in and get their hands dirty and work to sort of shape some of that legislation.",

One of the big concerns was that the airplane lobbies were influencing the FAA because the FAA didn't have the capacity and quite frankly the experience and expertise.You're seeing a similar thing happen with big tech where congress is leaning on the firms that they seek to regulate to inform them and educate them and to help them shape rules about these firms. That's actually a big problem and a big concern. In terms of what to expect and what each side wants, today's meeting was so high level, Boris, they didn't really get into the nitty- gritty. They talked about AI being good for things like solving the hunger crisis, solving cancer. You know, they didn't talk about specifics of how they're going to actually create legislation.",
