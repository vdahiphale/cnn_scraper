(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG WENBIN, SPOKESMAN, CHINESE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (through translator): All separatist acts seeking Taiwan independence will be met with a crushing defeat dealt by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. And all separatist forces for Taiwan independence will have their heads bashed bloody in the face of the historical trend of China's complete reunification. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Taiwan, of course, has responded sending out its aircraft and warships and saying its missile system is on standby. How long could this last, Will? RIPLEY (on camera): So, the drills are scheduled to last for two days, Lynda. But what was interesting to me is that they're calling this Joint Sword-2024A, which begs the question, could there be a B or C? It wouldn't be surprising, given that China has essentially normalized this escalatory military activity that used to be unheard of until, frankly, a couple of years ago. Remember when Nancy Pelosi made the controversial visit to Taiwan, and then China did these war games the kind of which -- the scale of which Taiwan had not seen. But since then, we've seen them do this in response to what they view as provocative behavior, provocative statements. Some might argue that they're looking for an excuse, if you will. So, they want to listen to something that comes out of Taiwan, which then gives them a chance to throw their military assets around the island conduct what is tantamount to a dress rehearsal for what some fear could be a full-scale invasion down the road, something that China has never ruled out as they vow to eventually, in one way or another, unify with this democracy that the communist rulers in Beijing have been coveting for more than 70 years, but have never controlled. So, we don't know if the timing was deliberate, if Beijing, in planning these exercises, also was expecting the drama outside of parliament and inside parliament. But certainly, this is exactly the kind of thing that they are aiming to achieve here. They want to do what they can, to inject doubt, to try to destabilize this new government, a government that they worked very hard before Taiwan's election to try to send disinformation and encourage anybody that they could not to vote for this particular government that's now in power. So, this is playing out, in many ways, exactly like Beijing wants. Of course, Taiwan's new president does have a lot of supporters. Those protesters outside parliament, they're angry because they think that China friendly lawmakers here in Taiwan are trying to take power away from him. And we just have to watch in the coming hours because these drills could actually bring out more young people to the streets. It really is a -- the kind of drama that you cannot write a script for. I mean, this is real-life and it's happening in real-time here in Taiwan. And we're not even a full week yet in to the term of President Lai Ching-te.",

And we have seen China do this in the past. The U.S. was aware of the possibility of that. The official urged essentially China to back away and respect this electoral process and an inauguration, even if China doesn't have an electoral process, a democratically elected government. Taiwan does. And the U.S. urged China essentially to back off, saying their large- scale exercises are escalatory, or risk an escalation and destabilizing the region there. So, the U.S. position, quite clear here, even as it tries to walk that line between respecting the U.S.'s One China policy, but also making sure that Taiwan essentially has its own independent ability to govern itself.",

It was the worst day for the blue chip so far this year amid new signs that the U.S. economy is too strong for rate cuts. A.I. chip giant NVIDIA bucked the trend, rallying more than 9 percent after its solid profit report on Wednesday. NVIDIA closing above $1,000 a share for the first time ever. But the chips were down for aerospace giant Boeing. Shares tumbled 7.5 percent after the firm's CFO warned that financial pressures will persist for the rest of the year. Well, in other business news, Elon Musk said at a tech conference in Paris Thursday that artificial intelligence will ultimately take all our jobs. He says working will be optional.

I don't think it's that dangerous, frankly certainly not today, and it might in the future. But then, the design of A.I. systems in the future would be very different from what they are now. So, once we have a design, we can decide how to make it safe. But today, trying to figure out how to make future super intelligent A.I. systems safe is like asking in 1925, how do we make, you know, jet transport safe? And jet transport was not invented yet.

      "sentences": "And it actually should have already started by now because our water temperatures are already in July, kind of normals.So, it could start any time. We don't really have like a cutoff anymore. We've had pre-season hurricanes before pre-season tropical storms all the way through here. The 2024 hurricane season now, 17 to 25 storms. And if that happens, we only have 21 names. We'll have to get to that other list that we used a long time ago where we actually went to the Greek alphabet. We're not going to do that this year. But 17 to 25 storms. We're going to see up to 13 hurricanes and seven of them could be major. At least an 85 percent assurity that this is going to happen. Only 5 percent possibility that it could be less than normal. But what's important, Lynda, is accumulated cyclone energy. It's wind in the ocean in a tropical system for how many hours added together, and then you add the entire season together. And we're at 150 to 245 percent of average, of the mean. Now, the mean is about 100. It's plus or minus, depending on how many years you use in the average. But it's the accumulated cyclone energy based on the wind speed and for how long and how many storms we get. So, if we go back and take a look at the ACE for all the previous years here, the past four, which seems like we've had some very active years. Nowhere near 245, 145, 95, 145, 179. The last time that we were anywhere near that 245 number was 2005, Katrina, Rita. I mean, I can go on, Wilma, all the big names that we remember from 2005. And we look at the water temperature now, when we look at the water temperature in '05, the water is warmer right now than it was at this time in '05. And we have the La Nina. La Nina is going to push the jet stream farther to the north. It's going to stop the sheer that's here in the atmosphere where the storms form. Storms don't like to be touched by anything. They want to be all by themselves, just kind of sitting there spinning. Don't blow me over, just let me sit here and spin. So, when that happens, we have likely more storms and that's where we're going with this. This is the reason, look at the water temperatures, three to five degrees Fahrenheit warmer here in the main development region and already one to two in the Gulf of Mexico. And if you take a look at Copernicus' numbers that we looked at from April, all of these dark reds right through here, it is the warmest ever for that time of year. This was the end of the April, but still, we're still there right now. This map hasn't changed very much. The warmest by standards for April and now for May. Why do we run out of numbers? Why did we run out of names here? Because we don't use U, we don't use Q and we don't use X, Y, Z. So, there's only 21 names for 25 potential storms. We have to go to Adria, which would be on the next list to try to figure out how far we go from here. One more thing that's going on in the deep south where many of the hurricanes may land or at least tropical systems may land, it has been a brutally wet spring. Some spots more than twice as much rain as they should have. That means the ground is muddy. That means the rivers are flowing. There's no place to put more water. If you put a 100-mile -- 160 kilometer per hour wind through some of these forests, you're going to knock down trees because the trees roots are just sitting there in mud. You put five or 10 inches of rainfall in these rivers that are already a bank full in many spots, we're going to get more flash flooding. So many things to talk about this year. Let's hope we don't get the 25, because just a few years ago, we got the 30 number. Remember when we were like Alpha, Beta, Delta, Zeta, wherever we went on that year, it just went way too far to iota, I think. So, that's -- remember that?",

It does not show the initial incident in which Sheffler allegedly disobeyed that police officer's orders and then dragged him with his car. But it does show just seconds later, as the officer chases down Sheffler's vehicle, he appears to strike the car with some sort of object and then converses with Sheffler through the driver's side window before other officers arrived and take Sheffler into custody. The city says they do not have any video of that initial encounter, and that's because the officer's body camera was not turned on, something that the chief of police says is in violation of the department's policy, and as a result, that officer has received counseling from his supervisor. Earlier today, the mayor and the chief of police held a press briefing. They did not take any questions from the media and they didn't address the charges that Scottie Scheffler is still facing. He faces four charges. By far the most serious is that second degree assault on a police officer charge. It is a felony. And a source tells me that behind closed doors, at least some top brass at the police department have voiced some concern that the felony charge may be excessive. I spoke with Scottie Scheffler's attorney just after that press conference, who said the videos that were released back up their version of the events, that this was all a misunderstanding.
