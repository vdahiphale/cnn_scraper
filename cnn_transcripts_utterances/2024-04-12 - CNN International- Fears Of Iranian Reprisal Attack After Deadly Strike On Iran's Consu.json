It is something Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been calling for in his meetings here for many months. Samantha Power laying out the importance and the need for it, last week in a phone call President Biden where Prime Minister Netanyahu essentially demanding it. And over that weekend, the government -- Prime Minister Netanyahu saying there will be a new border crossing opened. It was supposed to be Erez, predominantly for foot traffic, not for aid. But then, officials by Monday this week said Erez wasn't going to be possible.So, what we've seen in some nighttime, a short 30 seconds clip of nighttime video released by the IDF and COGAT, the body of Israel that oversees aid go into Gaza, is two or three trucks of aid, one with cardboard boxes on, one with sacks, it looks like it could be food, potentially flower going in down a dirt track at nighttime with a military escort, we understand. It appears to be the main route that the military uses to go into Gaza from the north, a place called Zekeem, but the government isn't saying that officially. But, from what we've seen, that's how it looks. This is a drop the United States, the White House, many other countries, UN agencies, looking to Israel to multiply this up many, many, many times. This small opening that opened last night isn't going to be open for more days. How much aid can get through? None of that is clear. But, it does indicate that that pressure to get food desperately needed into the north, northern part of Gaza, 300,000 or 400,000 Palestinians, their children on the verge of starvation, some dying from lack of food, that perhaps this is the beginning. But, of course, that's the scrutiny. What else is going to follow? How much else? How often? How frequent?",

The embattled Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives is hoping to shore up support in his party by making a pilgrimage to Donald Trump in Florida. Mike Johnson will appear with Trump at Mar-a- Lago today to discuss their concerns about election security. They're expected to highlight the issue of non-citizen voting, even though there is no evidence non-citizen voting is a meaningful problem in U.S. elections. And it's worth noting that Johnson played a prominent role in Trump's effort to get the U.S. Supreme Court to look into the 2020 election, despite no evidence that voter fraud played any role in Joe Biden's victory. Let's get more now from CNN's Alayna Treene. So, Alayna, appearing alongside Trump, it's apparently a big deal for Johnson. I mean, it kind of reckons back to the former House Speaker McCarthy kissing the ring. So, after all of this, it is Trump's staunchest allies in the House who are talking about trying to oust Johnson from this speakership. Is this more about Johnson maintaining his position, or what's going on here? What's the goal?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's definitely a huge part of it, Fred. House Speaker Mike Johnson is making that trek to Mar-a-Lago in part, and largely, I should say, to emphasize his close ties to the former President. Of course, it comes as he faces a threat to his speaker's gavel. And I'm told from many sources familiar with the planning of this event today that it was really Johnson's team that was pushing for this public event. So, I think you can kind of read between the lines there. But look, in my conversations with Donald Trump's advisors, they tell us that this event today is really to emphasize and call attention to what they argue are state proposals and lawsuits aiming to allow non-citizens to vote in elections.And as you rightly pointed out, I think it's very important for us to be clear here that there is already a federal law that bans non- citizens from voting. But, this is really part of what we've seen be a major theme of Donald Trump's. He has claimed in the past that Democrats want undocumented immigrants coming into the country in order to impact the results of the 2024 election, and this is really part of that fearmongering that we've seen Donald Trump and other Republicans use to continue to stoke fear with voters about a very real and concerning issue for them, which is immigration, and how immigrants will play in the election. And I do just want to point out as well, Fred, that there is some nuance here. We do know that in some cities, they do allow non- citizens to vote in some elections, for example, school board elections, but this is not a widespread problem. Now, we're also told, and our colleagues Kristen Holmes and Melanie Zanona laid this out in their story today, that part of this event today is going to be Donald Trump and Mike Johnson re-litigating the 2020 election. And remember, both Trump and Johnson played a role in peddling the false claims that there was fraud in the 2020 election, and that really tried to use that to overturn the election results. Now, another part of this that I think is just very interesting to keep in mind is Mike Johnson is also going to Florida with something else at the top of his mind, which is this idea of Ukraine funding, and it's something that has been really a perilous issue for him. So, it'll be interesting to see how he tries to walk that line with the former President today. And one other thing here, Fred, is that they are billing this as a press conference, but it's still unclear whether they're actually going to take questions. I'm told from Trump's advisors that they do expect them to take questions, but, as we both know, that doesn't always mean they will.",

      "sentences": "Fred, it certainly does start on Monday. So, all of these jurors are going to be coming to the courthouse in Manhattan where Donald Trump will be for the first day of this trial. The process starts with jury selection. So, the dozens of people that were subpoenaed to come and provide their civic duty, their public service as jurors, they're going to get a questionnaire. That questionnaire has 42 questions. It asks the typical things that you would ask to screen jurors, their feelings about law enforcement, some of their background as far as their professions.And then, they're going to be asked questions about how much engagement in politics they have, specifically extremist politics. Are they people that have been supporters of left-wing or right-wing extremist groups like the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, Antifa? What are their feelings about how Donald Trump has been treated? Those are questions that will allow prosecutors and defense lawyers to ask people further things, once they write down their answers. There are no questions, though, on how people voted exactly, what their political contributions have been in the past, and what their party registration is. And so, that is not the issue here. The question and what the court is going to be trying to do is make sure that even if people have strong feelings about Donald Trump, one way or another, and they've heard something about this case or him in the past, they just want to make sure that the people can set aside their feelings and weigh the facts and the evidence without bias. If someone says, however, they can't do that, they're not going to be a juror.",

But, what it boils down to is that they weren't aware of enough to know that what they were doing was wrong when they moved those boxes. So, they do admit to moving boxes, but they are saying things like there is no allegations that say that they knew what was in those boxes, or that they knew that there was a federal investigation that they could be obstructing whenever they move boxes on Donald Trump's behalf. So, that focus on the obstruction case against Trump and these two others, that's going to be at issue in this court hearing today. And we are getting all kinds of new court filings by the day, because the judge is starting to free up some more transparency in this case.",

Trump's attorneys have tried three times to delay the trial, but an Appeals Court judge ruled Wednesday that the trial will go on. And this will be one of Donald Trump's highest profile cases. So, officials say law enforcement has a put a sophisticated multi-layered security plan in place. Brynn Gingras is joining us now from New York with a look at the security preparations. Brynn. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Fred, a robust security package. That's how law enforcement describes it to us. Now, remember, this is the first criminal trial of an ex-President in history, but this isn't the first time Donald Trump has been in court. Right? He has been in and out of courtrooms for the last year or so. And in New York, there has been a couple of trials. So, law enforcement has really looked to those events to kind of build on top of this one to figure out exactly what they need to do, and they've been practicing this for the last couple of weeks. And so, they say they're going to bring out all the toys, is how they describe it to us, that talk. That means bomb-sniffing dogs. They're going to have barricades to create frozen zones or streets around that courthouse, Lower Manhattan, drones. And they're going to have more cameras. About 50,000 cameras can actually look in on that one area from a central hub at the NYPD. So, this, like you said, is going to be multi-layered. And of course, there is a lot here they got to keep their eye on. There is going to be a huge media presence for the six to eight weeks that this trial is expected to last. There is going to be likely protesters and supporters. And there is likely going to be a lot of chatter online, as they describe it. That's something they're really going to zero in on and have to be nimble about in order to respond to. Inside that courthouse, a little bit of detail there. We know that the 15th floor, where the trial is actually going to start on Monday and take place for that duration, it's going to be shut down for the general public. People are going to have to go through several security measures just to even get on the floor to cover it for the press. And the elevator that the former President will use will also be frozen. So, there is a lot of security measures that are going to be taking place. And like I said, it's going to be a lot of stamina on the part of law enforcement, though they say they're very used to this.

He barely attained the post. He is barely keeping it. He is already under attack by some of the same right wingers that ushered Kevin McCarthy out of the speakership.

But, what's interesting is KPMG said that it's also possible that AI in the future helps make a four-day workweek possible. The thinking is that AI is going to automate some of those boring tasks that we have to do, sending emails, writing reports, combing through research, and give everyone a little bit more time to get other work done. And then, in the long run, maybe that'll free up time so that people don't actually have to work that fifth day.A lot of uncertainty around these predictions.

So, a lot of guys out there still finishing, including Tiger Woods, didn't get off to a great start. He bogeyed 14. And so, he is even par right now as he is playing the 16th hole, and it's going to be a long day for Tiger Woods. He has got to play 23 holes out there today. So, it's going to be a lot of walking for Tiger. But, I went out there. I watched Tiger quite a bit on Thursday. Looked pretty good. He hit six drives over 300 yards, and Tiger is trying to set a record today and make his 24th straight cut here in Augusta at the Masters.Now, yesterday, as I mentioned after those storms came through, it was a beautiful day, other than the wind. It was a pretty wild day out here on the course. I mean, there were gusts up to 40 miles per hour, and it is going to be like that again this afternoon. So, the golfers are going to be dealing with those conditions. But, the wind didn't seem to bother Bryson DeChambeau. I mean, he was able to deal with it easily. The former U.S. Open champion birdied his first three holes of the day. He finished with eight birdies on the afternoon. He is your leader right now at seven under. This was Bryson's best Masters round of his career. And after a few down years, which including missing the last few cuts here in Augusta, the now live golfer says he has found a new approach to the game, just keeping it simple. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRYSON DECHAMBEAU, MAKING 8TH START AT MASTERS, BEST FINISH IS T21: It's been a journey, to say the least, one that I have thoroughly enjoyed. But also, it's taken a big toll on me in numerous situations. I'm just doing the same thing every single day in and day out. I'm not trying something new. I'm trying to figure something out. And that's what I feel like, just accumulated into playing some really good golf. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
