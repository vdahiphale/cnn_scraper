We heard yesterday that the most severely wounded Palestinians are getting out. The foreign dual nationals breakthrough very sudden. And we spent the day at Rafah today, there was no suggestion that this was about to, happen even though the Egyptian prime minister had been there with us. No hint of a breakthrough and yet this morning this extraordinary development. The fact is, that as we understand, it all of them will be getting out. But there, is of, course beyond the difficulties of the deal itself and how the negotiations must have been extremely fought together, you talk about various parties -- Israel, Hamas, Egypt through, Qatar and with the United States, many of them not speaking to each other. It would've been extremely fraught. There is now, the very logistical headache of getting these people through. Some of them will be traveling without documents. Most of them have been through the most extraordinary events over the past 3.5. weeks not to say tragedies, depending on who is getting there in the coming days. People who will be traveling without documents, people who may or may not have been wounded, people who may or may not have lost family members. And some of them traveling without documents.

A doctor at a nearby hospital says scores of civilians were also killed in the attack. I want to bring in CNN's Rafael Romo, who is in Tel Aviv for us. And we've been hearing, Rafael, IDF defending the strike on Jabalya. We have just seen from that report, civilians have been severely impacted and it's been put down to the tragedy of war. That is the line. But give me a sense that they can confirm, if the man they were after has also been killed and how many Hamas operatives who were at this refugee camp, to justify the strike? RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SR. LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Yes, hi, Eleni. That very same question was asked of the IDF earlier today. And what we heard is that their own intelligence tells them that it was, indeed -- as we hear -- there was an alarm earlier today. What you hear over here is telling us that that air -- the siren emergency is finishing up. But they say that they're all -- intelligence is telling them they killed that commander and, let me tell you, Eleni the Israel Defense Forces insist that the airstrike that killed a large number of people at the largest refugee camp in Gaza, was, quote, \"a clear military necessity and also a legitimate target.\" This is what we heard in the last few hours from Peter Lerner, a spokesperson with the IDF. Lerner described Ibrahim Biari, the Hamas commander they were targeting, as an arch terrorist, who, given the chance, would attack Israel again and again. Lerner also said that Biari was surrounded by dozens of what he called his henchmen. And that they were planning to conduct more attacks, which made them a legitimate target. But this gets a little bit tricky, Eleni, because Hamas says that Biari was not even at the site of the camp when it was struck. A spokesperson for Hamas has denied Biari was there and called the Israeli strike a heinous crime against safe civilians, children and women. One point the IDF is trying to stress is that the bombing itself does not explain the collapsing of all the buildings. Another IDF spokesperson said earlier today that collapsed tunnels were partially responsible for the scale of destruction from the Tuesday strike. At this, point, Lerner also said that Hamas intentionally places its infrastructure in civilian areas, arguing that its militants are a brutal enemy that has no regard for human life. As for confirmation, again, we are waiting to get more of that. But what they're saying so far is that their own intelligence has confirmed that Biari is dead.",

So as we understand, it 110 foreign passport holders, plus, importantly, some 80 to 81 severely or critically injured patients who need surgical interventions to save their lives. That was also negotiated as part of this operation today. With regard those who are left, well, as I understand, it I have been told by sources here that foreign nationals who want to leave will be allowed to leave. It is just the process. It is starting today, for example. As far as U.S. officials are concerned -- and I've been told here we are likely to see U.S. citizens today but likely to see them tomorrow. As we understand it, there are some 400 U.S. passport holders with their families. That could be as many as 1,000 people going through that border crossing, to be met by American authorities tomorrow. Other countries, for example, Jordan, we now understand, have initiated their evacuation of their citizens. It is not clear on the numbers as of yet.

What kinds of questions do you expect Don Jr. to face today, to field today?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, Eleni, it is questions about the preparation of those financial statements at the heart of thiscase. Keep in mind, the judge has already ruled the defendant, Trump Org, the former president, his two adult sons are liable for fraud. However, the state is still trying to prove they all sort of worked together over decades, along the fraud scheme, in preparation of those documents. Listen, we had heard a deposition from Donald Trump Jr. last year, when he was under oath, and sort of distanced himself from how those documents were prepared. Saying, listen, he has a business degree but he relies on his accountants, on his legal team to prepare those statements and then he signs off on them. We do expect somewhat of that similar testimony when he finally does take the stand. Quick thing to point out, right now, there is a state's expert witness on the stand. There will be direct examination of this witness and then cross- examination. So it is possible that Don Jr.'s testimony could slide until tomorrow. After that does happen, we are expecting Trump's next son, Eric Trump, to take the stand. More pointed questions toward him since we heard his name come up numerous times throughout this trial so far. And then, later next week, we expect the former president to take the stand and then, Ivanka Trump. So we have a pretty hectic couple of weeks in this civil trial.",

He and Don Jr. took amore expended role, when their father took the presidency when it comes to Trump Org. That is why they are defendants in this case. To that point, they have a lot to lose. The state's -- the attorney general is trying to get $250 million from Trump Org in repayment from those financial statements that they say has created a loss for the state. They are also trying to put the Trumps out of business, so they have their livelihood at stake here. The more pointed questions will be to Eric Trump, though, because he has more of the business side of Trump Org, where Don Jr. has been more of a campaigning side with his father. He is always on social media, talking about even this trial, how it is a witch hunt. So it will be a little bit different in questioning but they all do center around how these financial statements were prepared and, you know, did that really cause a loss for the state, in terms of money?",

On the same day, King Abdullah stressed in a phone call with U.S. PresidentJoe Biden the importance of a cease-fire in Gaza. The UAE has condemned the Israeli airstrike from Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza. Its foreign ministry saying, indiscriminate attacks could, quote, \"lead to devastating outcomes for the prospects of peace and stability in the region.\" Meantime, Tuesday, Iran's foreign minister met the Qatari emir in Doha, the tiny Gulf state playing a key role here in negotiations between the United States, Israel and Hamas for the release of hostages and foreign nationals from Gaza. That is in large part because of its good relationship with both Iran and the United States. The Iranian foreign minister met Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political arm of Hamas. Iran's foreign minister has since gone on to Ankara to discuss the conflict. Turkiye's rhetoric toward Israel becoming more harsh in recent weeks as the death toll rises in Gaza. All of that, after the director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, was also here in Doha this weekend. David Barnea was there to discuss the ongoing efforts to get hostages released by Hamas. Resources familiar to the talks tell CNN, looming over all of this diplomatic shuffling, another visit from the U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken to Israel expected this Friday. The State Department saying he will make other regional stops. You can be sure those other diplomatic missions will be in an effort to quell rising tensions. I am Becky Anderson in Doha.
