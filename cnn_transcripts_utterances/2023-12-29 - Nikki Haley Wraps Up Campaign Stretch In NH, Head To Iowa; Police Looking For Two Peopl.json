And this was, without doubt, a mistake, a flub, and she is making the necessary correction.Look, I don't think that question was -- certainly, it wasn't normal. It wasn't a trick question. But it wasn't hard. And the initial answer is, the root cause of the Civil War was slavery. While she didn't say it at the beginning, she has made the necessary correction unequivocally saying that slavery was the root cause of the Civil War. And she has said that every time she's been at one of these events. I tend to look at this stage of the game. 18 days out from the Iowa caucus, I look at what is the Des Moines Register saying. Not the New York Times or The Washington Post. What is the union leader saying? What is WMUR saying? These local news outlets. And they're saying -- looking at them today, they're saying she has made the correction, she has done the cleanup on Aisle Haley, and voters are moving on. Looking at a St. Anselm poll, the number one issues they're concerned about are the economy, abortion, immigration, and national security. And you leave the editorial board rooms of Washington, D.C., and New York and you go to the machine shed in Iowa and you go to the Red Arrow diner in New Hampshire, those voters are not talking about the past histories of the Civil War. They're talking about current issues and their impact on them. And I think she's going to be able to put this in the rearview mirror soon. And talk about the issues that are top of mind for voters.",

I think Alice is absolutely right that you know, Haley has really built up. It -- has really played a pretty disciplined campaign up until this point. But, of course, her opponents are going to hammer her on this because she has been so disciplined. Now, but if you have a kernel of doubt in her, perhaps then your head is turned.

But the key is to make your point clearly with this message on pardoning Trump. She's telling the base that look, I would pardon him because she feels that's in the best interest of the country. But Jackie is also right, these other candidates and the challengers are going to do everything they can to throw questions at her and bring up this latest gaff because she has momentum at her back.

Helping them in that investigation is this piece of video -- this very important piece of video here.[11:40:01] So, let's give you guys a look at that video, so important to this investigation. Police believe that this video was taken near where the bodies were found -- very near where the bodies were found. And in this video, what you see is a Chevy Silverado pull-up next to a Kia Optima. The drivers of both vehicles exit the vehicle. Interact in some way. And what is important, Danny, about this video is that this Kia Optima, police believe, belongs to Matthew Guerra. Again, one of those victims. 22-year-old Matthew Guerra. But they do not believe the person who exits that Kia Optima is Matthew Guerra.

So, many more questions to answer there.This timeline here also critical. December 22 was the last time anybody saw or spoke to Savanah Soto. December 23, she misses that crucial appointment and goes missing. That's when her family alerts authorities. December 26, that's when police found the bodies of Matthew Guerra and Savanah Soto.

They lost their 28th consecutive game last night in a tough overtime battle with the Celtics. It was close. It had to be sweating but the Pistons ultimately -- they blow it. They're now tallied with the 76ers for the longest-ever losing streak. The Sixers spend over two seasons. The Pistons have managed to do it all in one season.
