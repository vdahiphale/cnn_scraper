Certainly one to keep your eye on, as we are looking at the broader race overall, the 2024 race. Tonight, you saw Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, introducing himself, as Kamala Harris' running mate. There's a lot for voters to learn about him, over the next 90 days. He grew up in rural Nebraska, enlisting in the Army National Guard. He taught high school social studies, as you heard from Congressman Clyburn. He coached the football team there. And he also served as a faculty advisor for a gay straight alliance. In 2006, he dove into politics by flipping a historically red Minnesota House seat, representing the state's 1st District until 2019. That's when he returned home to run and serve as governor. At his debut rally, tonight, Walz told his story, also highlighting how his own family was impacted, by a critical issue to voters, this year. Access to fertility treatments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is completely unprecedented, where a party has switched horses, midstream, and they've done it not out of an advantage. They did it because they just decided, hey, we're throwing in the towel. We can't win. Because President Trump was strong on the economy. He's strong on the border. He's strong on inflation and interest rates. All the things that are going to matter to voters when they go and vote this fall. And so, it's like a complete reset, today, for the Democrats, who've had to, like, throw everything out, start over, new playbook, and try to reinvent two new candidates, who both have a track record of having very California-liberal policies throughout their careers.",
