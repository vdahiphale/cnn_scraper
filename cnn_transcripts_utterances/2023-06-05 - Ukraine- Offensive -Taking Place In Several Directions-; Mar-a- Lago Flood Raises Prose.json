Forces on the ground claiming to the seizing territory from Russia, as a disturbing video tonight emerges of the Russian private army holding a Russian commander prisoner. We'll tell you about that.Plus tonight, a CNN exclusive, Mar-a-Lago employee drained the resort's swimming pool. It's flooded a room where surveillance video logs were kept, the rooms where the documents were. Is an indictment imminent? A former member of Trump's legal team is OUTFRONT. And a war of words after another dangerous encounter between American and Chinese warships. It's not just the Chinese government that's angry with the United States. Tonight, you will hear some of the hate, the anger coming from Chinese citizens. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, show of force. Ukraine's deputy defense minister telling CNN an offensive is now taking place in multiple locations across eastern Ukraine. And it's not just in Bakhmut, where the majority the fighting has, of course, taken place there. These are the locations we are going to show you here where Ukraine says operations are underway to push Russians back. One Ukrainian officer on the front lines saying about the current assault tonight, and I quote him: Today, our third separate assault brigade has resumed its advance near Bakhmut .We are gradually advancing, and taking in positions. The Russians are nervous. Well, he says the Russians are nervous, and according to the chairman of the joint chief of staff, Mark Milley, they have a reason to be right now. Here Milley is in an exclusive interview today with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: I think the Ukrainians are very well prepared. As you know very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world have provided training, ammunition, and advice, intelligence, et cetera, to the Ukrainians. We're supporting them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, you know, as I talk about what's going on in Bakhmut, and I pointed to multiple locations where we understand this offensive is now underway, there is growing confusion about what is taking place, specifically in occupied Donetsk, in the Donbas. New video showing plumes of smoke rising over the region. Russia said it was able to stop, what it claims was a large-scale offensive by Ukraine in the region. So far, we don't have a comment from the Ukraine.So, there is right now as offensive appears to be underway, a true fog of war. But there are some things we do know, and one of them is that Russians are actually still killing Russians. In a video posted to the Russian private -- by the Russian private army Telegram channel for the Wagner Group, this man who is believed to be a Russian brigade commander, so you are seeing him there on your screen. He claims he fired at a, quote, vehicle belonging to PMC Wagner while under the influence of alcohol, some sort of a confession. Now, so then, when he is impressed on why he did this, why he opened fire and other Russians, he responds, personal animosity. Now, we can't very verify when this is claimed. But the fact that the Russian private army claims to be holding another Russian commander who say shot at them, and this is a Russian commander, it is a significant development. And in a moment, I'm going to speak to investigative journalist Christo Grozev, who is a wanted man in Russia. His reporting team has been able to identify this Russian commander, and he's going to share some information with you about that. Grozev is OUTFRONT in just a moment. But first, I want to go to Kyiv where Fred Pleitgen is here tonight. And, Fred, as we understand, this defensive may indeed in meaningful ways be underway. What is the latest there?",

Well, there certainly is a lot going on in the vast battlefields here in the Ukraine, but the bottom line of things really is that the Russians don't seem to be gaining any ground anywhere, while the initiative certainly seems to be with the Ukrainians.We have that situation in Belgorod where the Russians still have a lot of problems coming to terms of things there. Also in Bakhmut, the Ukrainians really think they are making gains there. And then in the south of the country, the Russians are saying that they are also under pressure from the Ukrainians. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russian military drone video allegedly showing a massive Ukrainian attack in the south of the country. Some vehicles appear to be hitting mines, or being the target of indirect fire. The Russians claiming they are able to hold the line. The enemy launched an unsuccessful attempt at a large-scale offensive in the south of Donetsk access, the spokesman for Russian defense said. But is this already Ukraine's much anticipated large-scale counteroffensive? The Ukrainians claim they have no info. Kyiv put out this video urging people to not even talk about a counteroffensive. Their message plans love silence. But anti-Putin Russian fighters are loudly making their presence felt across the border in Russia's Belgorod region. A local governor saying hundreds of munitions have been fired at towns there just in the past day. It's a far cry from when we were in this area in February of last year when Russia invaded the Ukraine. Belgorod was one of the main staging areas for the attack on Ukraine's northeast, teaming with tanks and armored vehicles, this military hub seemed invincible. Those streets that you are seeing up there, you can see them right now, you can see more artillery rockets apparently be firing from Russian territory towards the territory, I would say around Kharkiv. I don't if you can hear this right now. Today, Russia's army appears to be bizarrely absent. This Russian military blogger dodging for cover in the Shebekino village in the Belgorod region. We are lying in Shebekino on the ground under Ukrainian Grad missiles, he says. Strikes are coming one after another. The local governor says the shelling from the Ukrainian side has been relentless, was several killed and wounded, and thousands evacuated. The leader of the Wagner private military country ripping into the defense ministry. We surrender our historic lands, he says. Today, children are getting killed. Civilians are getting killed in Belgorod, and the ministry defense is not due in a state to do anything at all as it de facto doesn't exist. It is chaos. And the Russians are also on the back for the area Prigozhin's mercenaries just left, Bakhmut in the east Ukraine. Moscow's forces struggling to fend off a strong Ukrainian military both in the occupied territories, and inside Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): You know, Erin, Bakhmut of course is a really interesting place, because the Ukrainians seem to have all but lost that place. Now they say things are going really well for them. They also say quite frankly, they believe why the Russians want to talk so much about the south of the country and the alleged advances the Ukraine's trying to make their is to divert attention from the fact that the Russians are losing ground in Bakhmut. There was one spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military who said that today was a very good day for the Ukrainian army -- Erin.",

So, where do you think we are, General? Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar today says it's not about -- only about Bakhmut. The offensive is taking place in several directions. So it's present tense. It's multiple locations. What are you seeing? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Erin, I've got to start off by first complimenting you on using the clause, fog of war, because that's where we are right now. When we are talking today, we have been talking Bakhmut for the last several months, now we are going to include Valadar (ph), Nuvogonetsk (ph), Shebekino, Belgorod, Kursk, Mulansk (ph), and about 100 other places. What we are talking about, is an offensive that won't be a massive beach landing like we've seen in the movie \"Saving Private Ryan\" where tens of thousands of forces are coming together all at once. Instead, it will likely be multiple operations at different locations, with Ukrainian probing, confirming or denying Russian weaknesses, looking for holes and shifting Russ -- of Russian forces that are shifting around, taking advantage of Russian confusion like you just saw on the face of that young shoulder in Shebekino. It's all going to occur at the time the place of the Ukrainians decision. So what we are talking about right now is a very different type of offensive, and we are seeing a building momentum for it.",

Now, Wagner is making fun of the ministry of defense or the ministry of defense has made progress. BURNETT: I mean, that is incredible. That is absolutely incredible. And, by the way, the fact that they claim that they killed 1,500 in one day, I mean, that's an absurd number, neither side has actually claimed anything at large in the entire war. But you mentioned Prigozhin being on to take that down, can we talk about him for a moment? Obviously the suit has been going on for months, and it still sort of defies any understandable logic and reason, but now that video he also put out that supposedly shows the interrogation of a Russian brigade commander in the custody of Wagner forces because this Russian commander, ostensibly, well, he admits this confession to shooting at a Wagner, at another Russian fighter.

And they try to stop these voices from speaking, and spreading the truth. They can't do this with Prigozhin because he has his own private army protecting him, but there's no private army protecting hundreds of Russian journalists living abroad.

And then, there is this incident in October where the pool is drained, and the room where the circuit is being kept is flooded for some reason, we don't know the answer to that yet. We don't know if prosecutors know the asked sort of that yet, but they're asking about it. And the reason it's coming together in this obstruction investigation is because of the timing. There was a long period of time where the Justice Department, the special counsel's office sought for surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, not just before the FBI went into look the property in August, but they asked for surveillance footage again after that, and they also indicated to the Trump organization they want to them to preserve their surveillance footage at the end of October, the same month that this flood happened.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On the streets, in the skies, and on the sea, rising rhetoric in the U.S. warns real danger of military confrontation. A growing list of U.S. China flare-ups, fueling fears, anti-American sentiment among the Chinese public. Chinese state media adding fuel to the fire, blasting the airwaves with outrage. Public perception of the U.S. plummeting. A recent Chinese poll reveals more than half of those surveyed have a very unfavorable, or somewhat unfavorable impression of the U.S. The U.S. keeps picking on China, says this man in Beijing. It feels like the U.S. is bullying China. Another making his views clear: I don't like the U.S. All bad things in the world are caused by the U.S. U.S. poll so many Americans have similar views about China. Even in polarized Washington, countering Beijing has rare, bipartisan support. From the Taiwan Strait to the South China Sea to Singapore, the U.S. and China seem to be spiraling closer to conflict. On Saturday, a near collision on the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. accused the Chinese warship of cutting off a U.S. Navy destroyer. The U.S. says both ships came within 150 yards, less than 500 feet of each other. The U.S. destroyer took emergency measures to avoid a collision. A close encounter U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called extremely dangerous. LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I'm concerned about, at some point, having an incident that could very, very quickly spiral out of control.",

They are not yet for peaceful passage, he says, they are here for provocation. Tensions already high, getting even higher. Just days earlier over the South China Sea, a mid-air incident caught on camera, a Chinese jet dangerously sly close to U.S. reconnaissance plane. The U.S. calls this an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver. China says it was just safeguarding its sovereignty, accusing the U.S. military plane of deliberately intruding into China's training area. A government spokesperson saying, the U.S. should immediately stop such dangerous and provocative actions. Washington rejects Beijing's territorial claims over nearly all the South China Sea, saying the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate safely and responsibly wherever international law allows. Tensions rising ever since a controversial Taiwan trip by former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last year. And this year's meeting in California between House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Tsai Ing-wen, president of Taiwan. China also claimed sovereignty of the self governing democracy its communist rulers have never controlled. Launching two rounds of massive military drills near Taiwan, only adding to U.S. concerns of a potential military miscalculation with massive consequences. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That derailed the whole thing, and basically both sides have not been able to communicate at a high-level ever since.So if indeed now there are these lower level discussions, perhaps that could lead to higher level meetings which could try to potentially put, you know, some sort of a pause in this escalating tension that really has been going, whether it's time one of the South China Sea, China's deepening partnership with Russia, there's a lot that the U.S. and China need to talk about to avoid a misunderstanding, Erin.",
