It is Wednesday, November 8.But after last night's election results, it's a great day for Democrats. It's 5:00 a.m. in the East, and they may still be celebrating victories they notched in elections across the country. In Ohio, a decisive vote in favor of enshrining the right to abortion in the state's constitution. The issue has been a proven a political winner for Democrats since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Ohio abortion advocates couldn't contain their excitement last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAUREN BLAUVELT, CO-CHAIR, OHIOANS UNITED FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: There was no choice. We had to win. We had to end the ban. Winning was our only option and we did it together.

In Mississippi, incumbent Republican Governor Tate Reeves beat back a strong challenge by Democrat Brandon Presley. Yes, a second cousin of Elvis. And there's new polling out for President Biden that isn't exactly great for him, showing Donald Trump narrowly ahead of Biden in a hypothetical rematch, 49 percent to 45 percent.Wrap that in with tonight's GOP presidential debate, once again minus former president Trump, and we have a panel, plenty to talk about. We've got Matt Mowers, senior White House adviser -- former senior White House adviser, State Department, former Republican nominee and now president of Valcour. CNN political commentator and former Clinton campaign spokesperson Karen Finney, and Jackie Kucinich, CNN political analyst and Washington bureau chief for \"The Boston Globe\". Welcome, everyone. Great to see you. Glad that you are up with us. So, Matt, let me start with you. You were a GOP congressional nominee. Given what you saw last night, how should Republicans running for re- election last -- next year interpret what we saw last night?",

      "sentences": "Well, first and foremost, start raising a heck of a lot more money. I mean, you can look at the political dynamics of every race and what it all means, and we will. But it's fairly tough to draw a thread between Mississippi to Kentucky to Virginia to New Jersey to draw too many conclusions. But one thing was crystal clear, Democrats outspent Republicans in every single race and by a significant margin.You look at Kentucky, for example. You actually had campaign to campaign, Andy Beshear outspent Daniel Cameron almost 5:1. Outside spending brought it closer parity, but still a 2:1 spending margin. In New Jersey races, 4:1. And Virginia, it was almost 2:1, although you had Glenn Youngkin out there campaigning and raising money for the Republican candidates. So, I tell them, get on the phone, start raising money because that is what it's going to take in election next year. The other thing, you have to keep it focused on local issues. You actually saw some bright spots for Republicans even in the Northeast. You look at New Hampshire, Republicans took control of the Manchester mayoral race. He kept it focused on local issues, crime and taxes. Actually (INAUDIBLE) farm out to national Republican saying, I don't want to nationalize this race, I want to focus on the issues that what my voters care about and he succeeded. So stay local and raise a lot of money I would tell Republican candidates across the country.",

      "sentences": "Well, one factor we saw play out over the course of this, we saw it play out in the midterms is abortion is driving voter enthusiasm, at least some on the Democratic side, and it builds on what we saw during the midterms including places like Wisconsin, Michigan, and now in Arizona, activists are gathering signatures, to put a similar question on the ballots. So, we could see that be a factor in the coming elections as well. And, Jackie, so my question to you, not that these elections weren'timportant, but they weren't part of a presidential election cycle. How big of an impact do you expect abortion ballot measures to have on voting come November next year?",

But I think that it is clear based on what we saw, it's still very much front of mind for, yeah, of course, as you mentioned, not just Democrats as far as those came out.Now, Karen, big night for Democrats, but they still have on confront a bit of reality when it comes to 2024 at least as far as polls go. It is still early, but polling does show challenges ahead for the Biden campaign. That said, could last night's results provide some momentum for Biden or do you see those two things as separate?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it gives us a view into where the voters are and what issues are mobilizing voters. You know, all due respect to Matt, I knew that he would talk about being outspent because if you can't win on the excuse, talk about how you were outspent.But let's talk about that for just a moment because in Kentucky, you know, Beshear he also would not -- not only was he contending with his opponent, he had five super PACs running ads against him largely anti- Biden ads. And look how handily he won by focusing on the issues. He didn't just talk about reproductive freedom. He really talked about what he was doing with the infrastructure money, what he had been doing around some of the hurricanes and other issues that they had in the state, around jobs, around building communities. So I think that part of what it tells us is that stay connected to the voters, talk about what they care about, and, yes, reproductive rights continues to be, not surprisingly, about the seventh time people have gone to the polls and made it very, very clear where they stand. And I also think in Virginia, the fact that Glenn Youngkin, it was a bad night for Glenn Youngkin who put a lot of his own personal political capital on the line and really came up short. So again, I think that there are some tea leaves that Democrats can take a look at and say, look, these are not great polls, but we are a year out and how do we use this time over the next year to make sure we are doing the work to win the election.",

Let's not forget that Brandon Presley, the Democrat in Mississippi, of course, was running as a pro-life Democrat and there was even a lot of coverage about how Democrat voters would respond to that.But it has to be tailor-made. We do a lot of work in New Jersey for the down ballot races. And there were a number of Republicans actually win Biden -- districts that Joe Biden won by 18 points. So it is going to be incumbent on every Republican to navigate the dynamics of their district. You're not going to see one overarching national answer on abortion. Roe v. Wade isn't going to permit for that -- overturning, Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision, won't permit for that. It will be a state by state issue. So every Republican has to navigate the dynamics of their own district that way. And look, for Andy Beshear, I give him credit. Look, he was incumbent governor who ran a smart campaign, focus on the issues and he won as an incumbent governor. There is a lot of benefits to that. Again, I'm not trying to discount some of the other issues at play. I will say that incumbent governor with a bigger war chest nine out of ten times does win re-election and that was the case in Kentucky.",
