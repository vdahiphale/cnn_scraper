A major test for the US deal to raise the debt ceiling is underway right now. A key congressional committee is set to vote any minute. We'll bring the voting to you live. Also AI researchers warn that artificial intelligence represents a threat as serious as nuclear war. And Elizabeth Holmes reports to start her prison sentence in Texas. Coming to you live from New York, it is Tuesday, May 30th. I'm Zain Asher in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. The bipartisan deal to raise the US debt ceiling is facing its first big test in Congress. The House Rules Committee is about to begin considering the bill. This step is normally a rubber stamp for the House leadership. However, Kevin McCarthy named three hardline conservatives to the panel in January as part of his bid to win the speakership that could complicate things over the next hour or so. Two of them are members of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right Republicans who oppose the deal, and they are threatening to oust McCarthy over it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): At the end of the day, the only person that would default in this town is Joe Biden, unless Republicans default on the American Dream by voting for this bad bill. That is why this group will oppose it. We will continue to fight it today, tomorrow, and no matter what happens, there is going to be a reckoning about what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, he expressed confidence that he believes that he hasthe votes to get this through the Rules Committee, but this certainly is the first major test of this compromise debt ceiling bill, and it is also a major test for the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. And the main reason for that is because of the terms that Speaker McCarthy agreed to, for this Congress in order to become speaker, and that is that he agreed to lower the threshold that just one member of Congress could come forward and call for a motion to vacate, a motion that could potentially see McCarthy lose his speakership. And so that is now what Kevin McCarthy is up against. The first test here is going to be on the debt ceiling bill, specifically. He has expressed confidence that he believes he can get through it and ultimately get this bill to a vote on the House floor. The next test is going to be what happens if the members of the House Freedom Caucus, those hardline conservatives, who are vowing to oppose this bill, if they fail to do so, what is there a next step, and we've already heard from Congressman Dan Bishop, one of those hardline conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus, who has said that if they fail to stop this debt ceiling bill, the next step that he is going to turn to, the next fight he is going to turn to is going to be over Kevin McCarthy's speakership. The other thing that we're watching for here is to see once this passes the Rules Committee, if indeed it does, how many votes can Kevin McCarthy actually deliver? Because it appears that he told Democrats and the White House that he believes he could pull as many as 150 votes from the Republican Caucus. So far, it's not clear if that's possible, he is still expressing confidence that he can get a majority of Republicans to vote for this bill, but we are already seeing this quite stiff opposition from the House Freedom Caucus and some other Republicans like Congresswoman Nancy Mace who is likely expected to be a yes vote on this coming out and saying that she won't vote for this. So there are a lot of challenges that McCarthy is going to face going forward. And of course, the question is then if he can't deliver as many votes as he has promised, how many votes can the House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the White House cobble together from the Democratic Caucus to ensure that this bill passes and that ultimately the country avoids default.",

Like that's the question ultimately is how many Democrats are going to need to make upfor the loss of support on the Republican side, and right now, it is not exactly clear what that number is. There are some positive signs in terms of getting more Democratic votes. Yesterday, the head of the new Democratic coalition, a group of nearly a hundred moderate Democrats, she endorsed this bill and is rallying her members to come and support it. So there certainly will be some moderate Democrats who are going to support this. The progressives are already expressing fierce skepticism about this, but what progressives certainly aren't doing is trying to torpedo this bill in the same way that the House Freedom Caucus on the right side of the aisle is currently trying to do. But we know that President Biden, he has been engaged on this issue. He is making calls personally to members of Congress to try and get them to vote for this bill. And we know that the White House has engaged in a pretty fierce lobbying effort over the course of the previous 24 hours. We heard that they had made more than 60 one-on-one calls to House Democratic lawmakers, with the White House chief-of-staff and others making those calls and they've also provided a lot of briefing to Democratic members to show them everything that is in this bill, but also to focus on what is not in this bill, and that is one of the main ways that the White House has been selling this by talking about the Democratic priorities that they were able to protect, the fact that there are no cuts, for example, to the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act in this compromise bill. That is really where they have focused their efforts in terms of trying to sell Democrats on the fact that they believe this is a good deal at the end of the day.",

Remember, it was back in 2011, more than 10 years ago that the United States essentially banned cooperation with the Chinese without FBI approval because there were concerns that China was going to militarize the technology shared with other countries at the International Space Station. And yet, now, China has built its own space station, and will have a permanent human presence in space potentially even longer than the ISS, which is due to retire within the decade long period that China says its own station will remain in low Earth orbit. This is the fifth manned space mission for China since 2021, and for the first time, a civilian will be one of the rotating astronauts who previously had all been members of the People's Liberation Army. This will be a five-month stint. There are three astronauts on board. The civilian is a professor at a prestigious aeronautics university in China who pursued post-doctoral studies in Canada. As I mentioned, though, all others do have a military background like other Chinese astronauts. This civilian astronaut, also making headlines in China, certainly on social media, at least because he wears glasses. It's the first time that an astronaut without perfect 20/20 vision in China has been allowed up into space. Of course, NASA also allows astronauts with glasses to participate as well. Since 2016, China has made dozens of space cooperation agreements with other countries and that is certainly expected to continue, especially now that China will have this space station and a permanent human presence in outer space where there'll be conducting experiments. But China's space ambitions don't stop here. They want to put a base at the southern tip of the moon, for example, put a telescope there with 300 times the field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope. They want to collect samples from Mars, and they want to do these things with deadlines that in some cases, or even earlier than NASA or the European Space Agency.

So what you've got here, though, is an opportunity that the Russians no doubt will take pointing the finger of attacks on civilians, which has been a characteristic of their campaign here in Ukraine. The Ukrainians have been obviously drawing attention to it, indeed, Vladimir Putin, facing indictment at the International Criminal Court over it. So they can now turn back and say, well, now the Ukrainians are attacking civilians as part of their argument that they are dealing with a regime that they claim is both Nazi and out of control. Of course, this is a government run by somebody who is of Jewish descent. So peculiar allegations made originally to try to invade Ukraine. But I think that this really should be seen as part of the ongoing softening up process, and a sign that the Ukrainians are not shy about attacking now inside Russia. We've seen those raids in the past by Russian dissidents backed by Ukraine. We've got these mysterious drone attacks on Moscow itself that the Ukrainian government says they have no direct role in, but may well, therefore suggest having an indirect role.

If such agents have intelligence that exceeds that of humans, this could lead to humanity losing control of its future. Dan Hendrycks joins me live now from San Francisco. So we are now all aware of the risks. Obviously AI has so many benefits. But there is a laundry list of risks when it comes to this. Obviously, a lot of people are pointing out that it could even lead to humanity's extinction. Based on the fact that we now know the risks, what should we be differently?",

      "sentences": "Well, so, the point of the letter was primarily just to raise attention, that everybodyinvolved or most of the people who developed and are developing the technology thinks this is a serious concern. That enables us to take us actions to mitigate the sort of risks. Because it could potentially lead to extinction. So because we're kind of in an AI arms race currently, the AI companies are racing forward, developing these technologies ever quickly. And, they are prioritizing development speed and power of these AI systems over their safety. So since they are locked in an AI arms race, we don't want a repeat of the nuclear arms race, where we got extremely powerful weapons that could destroy all of us and it puts all of us at the risk of extinction. So the way to counteract that isn't just to let the companies take care of it and do research but we also need broader cooperation between the corporations but also internationally, between different countries as well. That's the only way we can reliably ensure that we're not caught any AI arms race.",

There are many different risks, so we'regoing to need many different regulations to address some of these risks. But there are some basic ones. Like we should regulate it at least at the level that we regulate other sorts of products; before Apple releases their new iPhone, they have to submit to an agency to review whether it's safe before it's rolled out to the entire public. There is no such thing like that for AI. And so that's one of the -- at the domestic level. But like with nuclear war, what we had to do to reduce risks of that were international treaties. So that's another possibility is, international cooperation. We need the state leaders speaking to each other, so that we don't have a repeat of the previous century, where we keep stockpiling and making extremely powerful systems that could blow up in our faces. We'd like to avoid that, so we're trying to be proactive about these risks.",

      "sentences": "So, with automation, I'm not sure there is an easy way to get out of that, if there are intense competitive pressures. Basically, if thecompany decides not to automate, say with AI, if AI is much cheaper, then they'll get outcompeted. So there's some pressure for these companies to continually automate more and more, as AI gets stronger. So we're going to need to change the dynamic if we're having any hope of making sure there isn't mass unemployment. Likewise, for misinformation, there is again a competitive pressure. One company is going to use AI to create or one group is going to use AI to create misinformation, the other one is probably going to do the same. And it's going to make everybody worse off. So we have arms races at a smaller scale, in the case of using AI, to create misinformation. But then there is an arms race at a larger scale to make them have more raw power. So this is why we need to proceed much more slowly and carefully throughout its development and trying to get institutions set up, so that developers are held to a similar standard and so that countries work together to avoid this issue, just as we did with nuclear or just as we work toward with nuclear weapons.",

And it's taken to even greater heights by Team Lab with this art installation. Ah, this is way cool. Frankly, my mind is bursting. I'm being exposed to Japan's futuristic concepts. I don't think my camera is going to properly capture this. The infinite crystal universe. I love this. I love it when it does that effect. With shoes removed, room to room, these installations are designed to stimulate the senses. You can touch, you can see, you can listen. (MUSIC PLAYING) QUEST (voice-over): Everything in the end comes back to sakura, even if its digital. How does it do that? So when the fish collide, they turn into cherry blossom. That's lovely. There is a long lineage of artmaking in Japan. The country, full of contradictions, this pendulum that swings, leaving me dizzy. So much technology and then whoosh. Something as traditional and ancient as origami. I wonder, how can paper folding compete with the whizz-bang-pop of social media and digital games that go so fast? Here it does so, because they are opposite sides of the same coin, requiring discovery, patience and skill. I always look to this with wonder and awe. Growing up, anything I ever tried to do with paper always ended badly. So now I'm in Japan. The prospect and opportunity to just see how all of this is done and have a go at it, it's just too tempting. The origami master, Kazuo Kobayashi, fills me with confidence. He's not even looking at what he's doing. What age did you start? KAZUO KOBAYASHI, ORIGAMI MASTER (voice-over): Thirty years old. QUEST (voice-over): Thirty? KOBAYASHI (voice-over): Now 81.

KOBAYASHI (through translator): The secret of origami is that it does not require any words. Everyone can enjoy it without even speaking. (MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) QUEST (voice-over): It is now or never, my last day in Tokyo and everywhere I am seeing sakura. Yes, the experts say today is peak bloom in Tokyo, the moment when the flowers are at their best. They've survived storms and the blooms are, well, blooming. In the past week, I have taken what must be dozens of photos of cherry blossoms. To be honest, some of them are quite good. But none of them are truly capturing the essence of sakura. The existential, here today, gone tomorrow, nature of cherry blossoms at springtime. It's only being here really and experiencing and seeing the totality that elevates it beyond a mere chocolate box photo. I must enjoy this experience like the locals, with hanami, basically a picnic under the cherry blossoms. And all I need is a rug and a bento box and somebody, with which to enjoy.

You know, during World War II, the Japanese military use cherry blossom as a symbol, because they bloom beautifully and pass away. We think it's like our samurai's mind, you know. QUEST (voice-over): However fleeting this annual flower, the tradition of honoring it remains strong. In Ueno Park, nearly every inch of grass is covered, rugs and mats everywhere. This is the first full-scale hanami of the post pandemic era. There's something very special about having a bento box in Japan during sakura. MESHIDA (voice-over): Wow. It's gorgeous.
