After which, more Palestinian prisoners and detainees will be released from Israeli custody. This is the fourth day of these exchanges.And now, Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend this arrangement for two more days, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Very critical developments, very important developments, Brianna. Indeed, it's a critical two days right now for the families of the remaining 198 hostages and for the residents of Gaza who have seen a surge of badly needed aid entered during this entire temporary pause.President Biden just released a statement on the extension, thanking the leaders of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt for getting it all done. CNN's Oren Liebermann is here with me in Tel Aviv. We're watching all of this unfold. So update our viewers where things stand, Oren, right now. Coreln2        Wolf, today wasn't nearly as bumpy as we have seen over the course of the past several days. Everything happened a bit later. There was a bit of a delay on all of this coming through because of a disagreement on the list of hostages. But crucially, we've all heard from the Israeli military that 11 hostages are now in the hands of the Red Cross. They say they got that information from the Red Cross, and that means the transfer of this last group of prisoners in the initial 50 is beginning to be complete here. They have gone from Hamas custody into the hands of the Red Cross and will soon be with the IDF. We don't know what crossings they're coming through at this point, but that's less significant right now. What's important is that the process has begun and they are making their way to the IDF, to Israel and then they'll be transferred to their hospitals and to families where the reunions can begin. There's also a bigger picture significant meaning here, and that's that one of the senior policy advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told us that the extension of the truce, another two days, another 48 hours, would only happen once the transfer had been complete. It's not complete yet, but it's certainly moving in that direction, barring any unforeseen circumstances. And that means a number of things, first, more humanitarian aid will flow into Gaza. Still a drop in the bucket of what's needed there. It used to be 400 or more trucks going in a day. This is just a couple of hundred, if that, going in a day, but it still is significant, given the dire humanitarian crisis unfolding there. On top of that, it also means over the course of the next 48 hours, we should see 20 more Israeli hostages released, women and children, in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and children being released from Israeli prisons. Crucially, it's also shown that mediation can work. Difficult though it is, challenging though it is, especially with Israel and Hamas who have no reason to trust each other right now. But that's something the international community has focused on and has called for more of as we sit here waiting for today's transfer to be complete and for the hostages to enter Israel.",

But, of course, we are aware of the ongoing, I would say, relentless negotiations with American involvement, the Egyptians, the Qataris. Of course, speaking with Hamas in Gaza and elsewhere, where the general gist of the things are that Hamas is trying to play for time, using hostages in order to get a respite from fighting. That's the formula.And as you know, Wolf, this was part of the conditions of the framework to begin with. This is an option that is now being exercised. We understood that was what Hamas would want it to do, so there's windows for this to happen. But there's also a limit for this to happen in the future. We're not there yet. But we do understand what game Hamas is playing. They're doing psychological warfare, and they're trying to buy more time for themselves, not for humanitarian needs in Gaza, but only for their military needs and maybe to live to see another day.",

There's a tremendous amount of logistical capacity that has been completely gutted through the total siege that we've seen.And yes, a few hundred trucks on a day like today is a beautiful photo op. It makes everyone's heart sing, and you think, wow, it's carrying all these supplies. But it's not nearly enough. I mean, we still have patients in the burn unit with severe - 50 percent of the body completely burned, and we don't have the dressings that are appropriate to be able to manage a burn wound like that. It's so difficult to even imagine that in a couple of days, you are losing this brief little window to be able to go and do assessments to see who needs what, where can we add the additional support. And then all of a sudden, we're going to be in this all-out war with absolutely no limits that we've seen so far, where not only are hospitals being attacked, but also ambulances and convoys of civilians trying to evacuate are routinely being caught in the crossfire here. So even as much as you can scramble and do a few things in a few days, it is a blip compared to the needs because we are so far behind with all the devastation that's happened so far.",

But it's difficult to know for sure day to day exactly how Hamas is making these decisions.I would remind that the test pilot for this whole program was two Americans, a mother and daughter, several weeks ago. And, of course, we were able to get Abigail Edan out over the weekend, a little four- year-old toddler American. So that's promising and we're just going to - we're going to keep at it.",

In fact, it's very possible that Hamas did not take all the hostages on October 7th. And other groups, perhaps the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, for instance, has taken some hostages.Now, we know that Hamas has connections with them, has communications with these folks. And they're going to have to do the spade work to try to get those hostages in their custody so that they can be factored into these exchanges. But it does make this a little bit more complex than it would be otherwise if Hamas just had all of them in their own custody. I want to go back to one, just one quick point on the last question you asked. Just to make it clear, in President Biden's mind, you may be, if you're a dual national, you're still an American.
