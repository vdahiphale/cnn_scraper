Shortly after that during daytime mission, they were reunited with loved ones for the first time since they were kidnapped during the October 7th attacks. The former hostages relieved to be home after an enduring eight months in captivity. And now their families are demanding more to be done to save those still being held in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we heard some of the details of that mission. It happened inNuseirat in central Gaza from the IDF, we understand it happened at 11:00 a.m., A joint mission between the military, the security agency, and the police that they say was weeks in the planning. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, giving the green light for it to go ahead on Thursday. Now, they say it was focused on two buildings that they entered to try and rescue these four hostages. They say they were under fire as they went in and as they left. But you see images of those hostages on board the helicopters touching down in Israel, celebrations, relief on their faces. And we've been hearing from some of the families of those that were released saying there are more that needs to be released, 120 more. All of them that we've heard from, though, calling for a ceasefire deal. Fred? (END VIDEO TAPE)",

So you've been covering the internal debates about this war for in Gaza within Israel's Knesset. Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz delayed a planned news conference after this hostage rescue today. Have you learned anything more about the rescue efforts and about the direction or the strategy of the Israeli Defense Forces? BARAK RAVID, POLITICAL AND FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Well, Fredricka, first, this was a very, very successful operation, but at the end of the day it was a technical one. Until now since the beginning of -- since October 7th, together with the four hostages that were released today, only seven hostages were released in military operations, 110 hostages were released in the previous hostage deal. And IDF officials, even those who are deeply involved in both the operation and the negotiation, say that at the end of the day the way to release the big numbers of hostages is only through a deal.",

And I think it showed something very basic in Israeli society, in Israeli culture, how important this issue of bringing back the hostages is. This is the number one priority.Just last night there was a public opinion poll that was published that showed that 56 percent of Israelis think that releasing the hostages should be the number one priority. And they said that the support President Biden's speech and plan that he laid out just a few days ago when only 24 percent said they are against that, that they oppose that.

And he was sort of like with his back to the wall.And today Gantz gave this very complicated message on what he is planning to do next, that he said now we need to look at the reality with responsibility. You can interpret it either way, but his people say that his plans to withdraw from the government are still on. He might wait a few days, maybe after Secretary of State Blinken will arrive in Israel on Monday. He will wait to see if there are any developments on the negotiations over the hostages.

[14EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): -- what is best in both of our countries. These warm feelings born of a long and deep friendship is further enhanced by the joy today of hosting you today for your first official state visit to France, with a very pleasant feeling of deja vu. Indeed, a year-and-a-half ago, you were hosting me in Washington, in December, 2022, thus demonstrating through regular visits how close we are in the reciprocal interests of our countries. And this year, 2024, for all people who are attached to the Franco- American relationship, there is something special to celebrate because there is reciprocal sacrifice for our independence, for our freedom. Indeed, this year, we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of the farewell tour of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution. I know that he is close to the hearts of all Americans. We also commemorate the 80th anniversary of the landings in Normandy and in Cavazos. We stood side-by-side. Then as we did two days ago in Normandy for the ceremonies on June 6th, to bow our heads in the peaceful cemetery of Colleville to remember their courage on the Omaha Beach, Omaha the bloody, where so many of your countrymen gave their lives for a country they had never been to before. Never will we forget these heroes who from Normandy to Berlin, helped to free a continent and our country. Their sacrifice has cemented our friendship. Amongst his heroes, there was a young man, Harold Terens. He was 18 when Pearl Harbor happened. At the age of 20 he was a radio operator working with your Air Force. He was at his duty post on D-Day, and then the war led him everywhere in France, in Morocco, and all the way to Ukraine. Today Harold has chosen our country to marry Jeanne Swerlin. They are with us today, and they are just making their marriage vows. So let us congratulate the young newlyweds. (APPLAUSE) MACRON (through translator): We're very pleased to be here for your wedding repast. And on this foundation, so many relations have developed, from cinema to music, from literature to space, from energy to transport, agriculture, and health. So many partnerships that have served to consolidate our bilateral relationship that we have further strengthened recently. It's also this relation that makes it possible to affirm our values. Faced with a war of aggression by Russia and Ukraine, or today in the Middle East in Gaza. And once again, thank you for the initiative that you have just taken and that we support to be united in spite of our differences when the main values are at stake. This is what is our lie across the Atlantic. When it comes to defending our values, we stand together. So of course, there's something a bit special in our relationship because you are, you are American. We are French. And there's something of a mutual fascination you find from -- indeed in our respective film industries, we love the American dream, and you like the French --",

But I haven't been able establish that yet, so maybe one of your genealogists can figure it out for me. Look, France is our first ally and that's not insignificant. The fact of the matter is you were with us to help us secure our freedom, and we were with you 170 years later -- excuse me -- to do the same.

We stand together when the going gets tough. And that's a fact. We stand together to defend the values that lie at the soul, the very soul of both our nations, and I believe that to be the case today. Liberty, equality, brotherhood, generation after generation people across both our nations have upheld these ideals because they know when we stand as one, our countries are stronger and literally the world is safer. Emmanuel, you've heard me say before. We stand at an inflection point in history. The decisions we make now will determine the course of our future for decades to come. We have a lot of opportunity, but a lot of responsibility. And it gives me hope to know France and the United States stand together now and always. Or as the \"Pocket Guide to France,\" given to the invading Americans, might say we're rowing in the same boat. Ladies and gentlemen, to France, the United States, and to our people. May we continue to seek democracy, may we in both our languages, and may we always stay together. It's been a great honor to be here, and I want to thank -- I'm going to raise my glass to France.

But this is, this is about the future. And he said that. It's a theme that he returns to frequently.

And we'll see you tomorrow Biden is going to visit the Belleau Wood, another famous war site. And its one that became infamous with a visit from then President Donald Trump, who was there in 2018, and his chief of staff General Kelly later said that standing in front of the cemetery, Trump said, these people are losers and suckers for giving their life and getting nothing out of it. So the contrast, we're going to see that contrast again.

And despite seeming to be a little nervous, I think, when she was confronted with those text messages, I think overall she was a very effective witness for the defense. And I don't know if I totally agree that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time period in question that Hunter Biden was in fact using. Definitely there was lots of very compelling testimony about him having a very serious drug problem, but no one could say on that date that they saw him used drugs.
