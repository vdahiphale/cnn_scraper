It comes as Ukraine's Defense Ministry says heavy fighting continues in the eastern region near Kupyansk.Meantime, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Netherlands has pledged some of its F-16 fighter jets, adding to the 19 promised by Denmark. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now from London. Clare, the U.S. gave Denmark approval to transfer F-16 training materials to Ukraine ahead of sending the fighter jets there but tell me what is the actual timeline for these jets.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Danny, that's the critical question here, really. We're hearing from the Ukrainian defense minister that the training has already started. That the minimum time of that training, he says, is six months.They need to train not only the pilots but technical staff -- people who do maintenance. They need to upgrade infrastructure. The pilots also need to improve their level of English to be able to use all the terminology around this sophisticated weapon system. So you get a sense of the undertaking there. The Danish prime minister says that 70 Ukrainians have already arrived in Denmark to start the training, so I think you can see the clock starts now on that six months. Having said that, they may not have to wait until the end of that training to actually see F-16s in Ukraine. The Danish prime minister said that she expects some six of the 19 pledged by Denmark to arrive around the new year. Then they'll be eight more over the course of next year and then, five more the year after that. So it's a sort of multi-year process. We don't exactly have the numbers yet for how many. The Netherlands will provide but look, it's clear that this is a big undertaking. It's a really big deal. They have to fly the planes, then they have to equip them with weapons. But we are reminded on a daily basis of why they are needed. They won't make it in time for this counteroffensive. But just this morning we heard from the deputy defense minister of Ukraine that they are not expecting anything fast to happen on the southern front because Russia still has air superiority and superiority when it comes to troop numbers. That is why we see Zelenskyy on the ground in the Netherlands and on the ground in Denmark being grateful and saying thank you for all the weapons that have been provided. It critically hinges, at this stage, on the Western weapons provided and he needs to guard against the political fatigue, especially given the perceived slowness of this counteroffensive -- Danny.",

Donald Trump writing Sunday on his social media platform that \"The public knows who I am and what a successful presidency I had. I will therefore not be doing the debates.\" Eight candidates, so far, have fully qualified to take part in the debate on Wednesday. So for more on this let's bring in CNN political analyst and Washington bureau chief for The Boston Globe, Jackie Kucinich. All right, Jackie, I feel like this isn't surprising. We knew this was likely coming but that post over the weekend made it real. But I'm curious from your perspective, with such a big polling lead was there actually any incentive for the president to get on that stage? JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE (via Webex by Cisco):  Well -- so it's because former President Trump is like a moth to a flame when it comes to TV cameras. So there was always a possibility that he would decide that it wasn't beneficial for him to show up because it will give oxygen to his competitors. Now, at this point, he doesn't see that it's beneficial to go head-to- head with them, but you have to believe if after this debate you see any of these people start rising in the polls and getting anywhere close to him, that will draw him back in.",
