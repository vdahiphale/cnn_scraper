More criminal charges against former President Donald Trump appear to be imminent. It's been a dramatic and consequential 24 hours since we last saw you. We're going to have team coverage with the latest- breaking details all morning. But first, here's what we know right now. The former president says he expects to be indicted and arrested for the third time, announcing himself the special counsel notified him he's a target of the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: And new developments in the classified documents case against former President Trump. A Florida judge says she will decide on a trial date soon. She did signal, though, that mid-December, the timeline the prosecutors requested, is too soon. Plus, the first criminal charges in the 2020 fake electors scheme. The Michigan attorney general is charging 16 people with felonies, accusing them of signing certificates that falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 election there.",

And that is to delay, delay, delay.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Abby, whenever a subject gets a target letter, so the Justice Department basically is telling them you might be indicted.Typically in the sample version of this letter -- and we haven't seen it yet, but there have been some reports in some other media outlets who have said this letter does identify some of the crimes that Donald Trump is very likely to be charged with, that the prosecutors are clearly looking at. One of them, conspiracy to defraud the United States, that is a general conspiracy charge. But it's a pretty significant charge. It's used quite often. It essentially means that Donald Trump was making an agreement with other people to carry forward the acts that the Justice Department believes are illegal. It is a pretty significant thing to be charged with that. On top of that, the tampering with a witness charge. That's something that we don't have a lot more detail of exactly what crime that could be. There's a couple different ones. But it might not actually be tampering with a witness in the classic sense. It might be the way that the Justice Department has known to be investigating here and has been using in these January 6th cases, where they're saying -- they're accusing people of obstructing the congressional proceeding. And so that is something that we knew that they were looking at, at least related to some others. And then this third potential charge that's listed here, according to multiple news outlets, is that there is a deprivation of rights, possibility of a charge. That's a civil rights charge. And I've talked to some defense lawyers, some former prosecutors about it. It's actually not charged that often. But it is a charge used when someone who's in a public position uses their ability in some way that is wrong. Either it's outside of the bounds of what their role is, or they use their role in a way to deprive someone else of some sort of right. It doesn't have to be civil rights that are classically protected, but it is a deprivation of rights charge that could potentially carry some pretty serious penalties if it does have to do with violence. But you know, we don't know exactly what this case is going to be, how it's going to be laid out. In the Justice Department's own words, whenever they bring this indictment, there always could be other things that we see whenever the indictment is filed, if it is approved by the grand jury. But those three things, that is a pretty significant case that does track with what we believe the Justice Department has been investigating here for some time.",

His lawyers talked about the burden that they're currently bearing, both in New York, where the former president faces criminal and civil cases. Of course, they have one special counsel, criminal prosecution. And they made a nod to the target letter, saying, look, another one is likely coming. And they talked to the judge about how this was a lot of work, not just for them but also for their client in preparing their client for each of these cases. Now, they were using this in court to try to delay this trial until at least next year, likely after the election. But it also just makes it crystal-clear. He absolutely needs additional lawyers. His two lawyers, Todd Blanche, Chris Kise, they're working with some other lawyers who are in his orbit. But after the recent departures of at least three of his key attorneys, he's going to have to look for more lawyers. And Abby, as we know, that's been difficult for him over the past few years. Prospective lawyers have told us they're worried about getting paid, and they're also worried about the potential political blowback or alienating their current clients. So it is likely he'll find additional lawyers, but it's taken a while here in Florida, and it could take a while in D.C., as well.",

If you put them collectively together, he is facing significant jail time if convicted, particularly in the federal cases.Assuming -- again, he has not been charged yet. I think it's important to note a target letter does usually lead to charges. It doesn't always. But, yes, he is looking at this broadly as a political threat. The documents case, in particular, had very much upset them for a variety of reasons, because it was an FBI search on his home. It was a different type of thing. In this case, he is upset about it. I heard yesterday it was basically a typical plane ride to Iowa, but he was not in a great mood in portions of it. I think you're going to hear that going forward. He is going to be upset, because this is, as you say, a dominant issue in the country, even if it's not the thing that voters say that they are voting on. You are correct. That Republicans are aware that in 2022, candidates who espoused Trump's election lies ended up, basically, paying the price at the ballot box in November even if, as you note, this played well in Republican primaries where Trump's voice and vote really do matter. But, at the moment, he is seeing this broadly as a -- as a threat to his freedom. And his advisers have been in private conversations pretty blunt that they see it as he has to win the election and that is how he guarantees that he does not face jail time. Now, again, it only takes one juror in any of these cases. He has not been convicted of anything. But the fact that they're looking at an election to the highest office in the land as some kind of -- an insurance policy or an out for him really affects and, I think, colors the entire presidential race.",

For the defrauding and conspiracy-type charges, they may have enough with what they have. But again, we're talking about the facts of the case and not necessarily about the jurisdiction and the unprecedented nature of indicting a former president for acts that occurred solely while he was in office. And I think -- you know, I'm a criminal defense attorney on the federal side. And so we always want to look at just jurisdictionally, is this case going to survive appellate scrutiny? And so certainly if an indictment is issued, then the case will proceed unless and until the charges are withdrawn or dismissed or a court says that they cannot proceed. But I think that these are really bigger constitutional questions that do have to be analyzed by the prosecutor and, of course, by the defense team. That's going to be a big push from the very beginning, properly, from Trump's side.",

Clearly, they're in an end stage, and Donald Trump may very well be right that he may be arrested and indicted in very, very short order. But we know that the grand jury, they will have to meet. So it's a secret panel of people who have been listening to this evidence. And they will have to sign off on the indictment. They will do that in secret. All of their proceedings will remain secret. Their names will remain secret. But, once that indictment is signed off, the judge also will approve it, and then it will be released, hopefully to the public, hopefully not under seal. We would imagine it to be made public, just like the indictment in Florida was. And then we get to see what the Justice Department has in their case, and we move forward with having an arraignment, just like what happened in Miami. In the coming days after an indictment, a defendant comes in, enters their initial plea of not guilty. Very likely that Trump would do that, as well. And so we're just going to have to keep watching the grand jury in Washington, but we already know that there is a witness, at least one witness scheduled for tomorrow to come in there.

The group includes current and former Republican officials.Joining us now is CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider. She is live in Lansing, Michigan, this morning. Jessica, this is really an extraordinary development. What are the charges that these individuals are facing? JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Abby. They are facing multiple felonies, eight counts for each of these 16 defendants. And this is all stemming from when these 16 Republicans allegedly tried to storm the Capitol just behind me here in Lansing on December 14, 2020. They were armed with these fake certificates, falsely proclaiming that Donald Trump had won the state of Michigan here in 2020, despite the fact that Joe Biden actually won this state by 154,000 votes. Now, back in 2020, they were actually thwarted at the Capitol doors by police. But now, of course, they are being charged by the attorney general in this state, Dana Nessel. They're facing these multiple felony counts, including election law forgery. And these weren't just any people. These were prominent Republicans in this state. They included current and former GOP officials, also a member of the Republican National Committee, even a sitting mayor, also a member of the school board here in Michigan. So, many prominent Republicans, all of them Trump supporters. All of them trying to argue that Trump had won the election. They were trying to storm in to replace the Democratic electors that were inside. You heard there from the attorney general, Dana Nessel, just saying that this plan to undermine democracy was fraudulent and legally baseless.

And I think we all understand why they'd be looking at that, whether he actually, you know, realized that he had not lost or whether he was under the impression that he had and genuinely believed it. And they've been asking a lot of people that question. And the other is about fake electors. And we know that people who were involved in the so-called fake electors effort have been in to Smith's office to talk to his investigators. I believe some have also gone before the grand jury. There were basically two camps within Trump's campaign. There was the camp arguing, Let's move on. And there was the camp that was arguing, Let's install these electors, in ways that even people who were connected to it raised questions about. Now you may end up seeing that in, say, Arizona, where my colleague, Luke Broadwater, and I had some reporting last year that there were internal emails within the campaign, where one of the lawyers working with them literally described these electors as fake and then corrected himself and said, Alternate is a better word, with a smiley face in the email. Kelly Ward, a party official out there, had apparently raised questions about whether this was actually legal. So I think you're going to hear a lot more of that going forward.
