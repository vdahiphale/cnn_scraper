He was charged and indicted in this case for his role in organizing the Trump campaign's slate of fake electors. Of course, those 16 individuals tried to subvert the Electoral College and say that Trump won the state of Georgia when he really lost. So, Shafer has said in a court filing that he acted at the direction of the incumbent president, as well as other federal officials.And in addition to Shafer, we also saw Cathy Latham. She is the former chairman of rural Coffee County's GOP party. And she was charged as well for being a fake elector, as well as her role in the illegal accessing of voting data in rural Coffee County. Latham has said that she was not personally involved in that breach. And look, Sara, it is very interesting because we've been talking to defense attorneys in Fulton County who tell us that their clients in the past who have had bond, much like these defendants, have shown up at this facility and have waived their first appearance by signing that bond, or agreeing to that bond. But at best the process takes hours or at worst it could take several days. These defendants have been in and out in about an hour, an hour and 15 minutes. The Fulton County sheriff has said that he's going to treat everyone equally, including these defendants in the subversion case. We should see if that applies to the former president when he is surrendering -- or expected to surrender sometime on Thursday. Sara.",

You know, I was a college athlete and so I always, you know, say to candidates when I work with them, you know, you've got to think about -- that's game day. So, we've got to -- what are our game day rituals that, you know, whether you're - you're really fine-tuning. You're not coming up with new, big strategies.
