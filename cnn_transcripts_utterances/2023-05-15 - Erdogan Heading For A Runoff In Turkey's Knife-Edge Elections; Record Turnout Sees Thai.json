I think the biggest takeaway is that, in what was supposed to be a very competitive race, President Erdogan pulled up ahead of his opponent, Kilicdaroglu, perhaps not surprising, but not shocking given that President Erdogan enjoys a whole bunch of incumbency advantages.He's been running Turkey for 20 years. In the last half decade, his rule has turned autocratic. He's raised checks and balances and autonomy for a lot of institutions, from courts to electoral bodies to media. His control of the media, as well as especially I think gave him the upper hand in the election campaign. Businesses loyal to Erdogan control 90 percent of the media in Turkey, 80 percent of Turkey's citizens do not read languages other than Turkish. So Erdogan can curate reality for them. The media, therefore, rent stories throughout the entire campaign season. That is the reality for 80 percent of the electorate, not about earthquake and how it was devastating and whether government's relief agencies provided aid, not about inflation reaching 50 percent, not about democratic transgressions. But the fact that Erdogan had made turkey into a military industrial power. And I think if Erdogan wins the runoff, if there is one, this will perhaps be a new election and globally, in going to record. One won on what I call post truth narrative, where the leader creating a narrative that has nothing to do with reality, but narrative -- that narrative becoming reality, because it's repeated so often and so frequently.",

He's an authoritarian populace.But he's also lifted people out of poverty for at least the first decade and a half of his rule from 2003 to '18. He improved access to services, including health care, basically, people started to live under him better, and he's got a base that loves him. I think that's the main challenge for Erdogan. Economy has not been good shape for the last five years. And he's never won national elections while not delivering growth. That was not an exception. He did not win outright, notwithstanding the fact that he's got institutions and media supporting him. And the race was not fair. Although the vote was free.

This politicians name is Ogan. He got 5 percent of the vote. That's not a lot, but enough to spoil the race for either side. I think going forward, President Erdogan at about 49 percent and Kilicdaroglu at about 45 percent will both try to coat his votes. But the candidate is fairly lengthy anti-immigrant, anti-refugee. It's going to be really hard for either of the sides to not fall for that kind of populism if they want to get his vote. So I think we're going into an interesting election period in most countries elections lasts a day in Turkey that lasts from May 24 to May 28, basically, 14 days of Lomas feel like a 14 day squeeze into one day of elections, busy campaign season and this new season from Turkey, of course.",

That's because odds are in President Erdogan's favor. It's almost like a 400 meter relay race.President Erdogan ran the last 100 meters. The opposition had to run the entire 400 meters. They almost caught up with him, but could not. So, he's got institutional support for him the fact that he controls media that will help him and I think that momentum is not behind President Erdogan because his party, his alliance rather won majority in the parliament, he's going to tell the electorate, look, you don't want split government, you want to have both branches of government in the same hence, vote for me whether or not the election will go for that continuity, or they'll go for change. It is up to Mr. Kilicdaroglu now to inspire the opposition in a way that perhaps he has not done effectively. And to say you do want change, you don't want more of the same.

But from China's perspective, though, they have to do this, especially after that phone call between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy, last month. The first such phone call between the two leaders since the Russian invasion, which by the way, that's a term Chinese officials and state media refuse to use, but still, China wants to use this trip to really shore up its credentials as this neutral party. And, you know, it is really interesting here, because in a broader context, the envoy is not only visiting Kyiv and Moscow, but also Germany, France, and Poland. So, this is very much about China's relationship with the European Union as well, which of course, is increasingly a battleground for strategic influence between Washington and Beijing. And Beijing is very mindful that to have a normal, good relationship with Europe when it faces this existential threat from Russia because of this war, they have to do something on this front. That's why Xi Jinping has personally, you know, expressed his commitment to facilitating to peace talks to a flurry of European leaders when they came here in the past few weeks and months. But the -- at the end of the day, though, you have to look at this -- the Chinese playing a long game, according to many analysts, that is they are betting. At some point, the fighting will have to stop, the two sides will have to return to the negotiating table. And at that point, China's huge leverage over Russia, its close ties with Putin will give it leg up in terms of playing this prominent role of a peacemaker as they did with Iran and the Saudi Arabia just a few weeks ago.But it's also, of course, a testament to how China's self-interest and strategic goals may not always be perfectly aligned. They obviously don't want to see a defeated and weaken Putin in Russia, but at the same time, they want to have a major say and a stake in the reconstruction of post war Ukraine.

Now, the project is in its second stage and it will focus on renovating the building itself.

On Saturday, diving explore and medical researcher Joseph Dituri spends his 74th day in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Key Largo. He's been living at this lodge 30 feet below sea level since March 1. And he plans to stay there until June 9, which would be his 100th. Day underwater. Unlike a submarine the lodge doesn't have technology to adjust for the increased pressure underwater. And that's what Dituri is studying, how his body responds to long term exposure to this extreme environment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
