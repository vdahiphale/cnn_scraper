On the surface, obviously, trading someone whose nickname is the merchant of death for a WNBC star who was improperly detained is an imbalance. But American presidents, going back decades, as Max points out, have made it a priority to try to get Americans out of harm's way. That is a basic responsibility of the government and the president. And the fact that she was being used as a pawn within the context of the runup to the invasion of Ukraine, Paul Whelan is still there, he should be released.
