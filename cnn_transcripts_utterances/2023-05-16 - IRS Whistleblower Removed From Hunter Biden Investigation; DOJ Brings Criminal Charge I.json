      "sentences": "Well, Boris, that's something that Congress definitely wants to look into. But look, this is an unnamed whistleblower who we know through the course of our reporting was an IRS agent who was working on the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden.And he wrote to Congress in a letter through his attorneys saying he was removed from this case, as well as his entire team and that it came at the request of the Justice Department. Now his attorneys in this letter said that the move is, quote, clearly retaliatory and may constitute the obstruction of the congressional investigation. Now just to take a step back. We know that federal prosecutors have been looking into Hunter Biden and investigating him for alleged tax crimes for years now. And most of that investigative work has concluded. But they're still awaiting to learn more about charging decisions from the U.S. attorney in Delaware. A lot of this does come as our colleague Evan Perez has heard that some of these agents working on this case have been -- felt that they were removed from these discussions due to allegations of leaks. Then really to look at the reasoning here. I mean, there's two main ways you can look at it. One argument is that this is a whistleblower who has information that he wants to share with Congress and he's being retaliated for doing that. The other argument is that you clearly have someone who wants to speak publicly about a federal investigation but that comes as there are alleged leaks to these right-wing media outlets and you can't compromise the underlying investigation. So, we're waiting to hear more as this saga plays out. And we're also waiting to see when this whistleblower may come to Congress and speak behind closed doors with some of these lawmakers.",

The FBI did a search of his home. And the meantime, he managed to get to the airport, get on a flight to China and has disappeared.There is another man who is a Greek national who set up these companies in the Netherlands to buy aircraft parts, other types of technology that are banned for sale to Russia in part because of what they're doing in Ukraine. And according to the Justice Department, that person now is under arrest. You know, the kind of technologies that should not be making its way. We talked to Matt Axelrod, who is undersecretary at the Commerce Department about the efforts to try to stop some of the U.S. technologies from getting into drones being used in that war. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW AXELROD, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR EXPORT ENFORCEMENT: You know, it's something that we're highly focused on, which is making sure that Western parts that were able to reduce and restrict the flow of Western parts so they don't end up in missiles and drones that are killing civilians and soldiers in Ukraine.

She recorded him saying the N-word multiple times before he noticed that she was recording him. Now she and her family are challenging her punishment and demanding an apology.Jake Tapper is here with this story -- he's featuring this story on \"The Lead\" -- I should say. And Jake, several things stood out to me. First, this student faced the maximum penalty, a three-day suspension, according to the school guidebook and the teacher apparently was defending himself saying he had the right to use that word. JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR \"THE LEAD\": So, we're going to have -- the girl's name is Mary Walton. She's a 15-year-old sophomore at Glendale High School in Springfield, Missouri. We're going to have her mom and attorney on \"THE LEAD\" coming up. And I guess there are two things here. One, she clearly was in violation of school policy because she was using her phone in the on position during classroom hours. But then there's the counterargument that she honestly -- it's very easy it look at what she was doing and see her as a whistleblower. Because the teacher, the geometry teacher who -- according to some students -- had used the N-word before, was actually using it. In this context he was talking about how -- why is it OK for a Black student to use the N-Word but not him to use the N-word. But he was actually using it. It posted on social media and she's being punished. And her mom and her lawyer, they're challenging the three-day suspension. But look, however you look at whether she violated school policy, I mean, she was a whistleblower. She got a teacher who was using the N-word in front of students. She brought what he was doing to the attention to the world.",

If we can address this shortage as well as the lack of diversity, then that can help reduce health disparities that we see across communities -- Brianna.
