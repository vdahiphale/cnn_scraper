Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". We have just learned that the White House is going to announce what it says are major sanctions against Russia. Now, they come as the war in Ukraine hits the two year mark and follows the death of Alexei Navalny, a tough Kremlin critic. Now, despite a desperate plea from his mother, Russia has still not handed over Navalny's body. Lyudmila Navalny showed up earlier today outside of the prison where he died on Friday. She recorded a message to Vladimir Putin asking to be allowed to bury her son.

They don't even tell me where he is. I'm addressing you, Vladimir Putin. The solution to the issue depends only on you. Let me finally see my son. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Arlette, it was interestingbecause on Friday, President Biden was asked about comments he'd made a few years ago when he met at a summit with Vladimir Putin before the war in Ukraine, when he warned that there would be a strong response from the United States if something had happened to Alexei Navalny. Now, President Biden answered that question by saying a lot has happened since. We've leveled a lot of sanctions against Russia since its illegal war in Ukraine. And that seemed to be it. Now, we're getting word that there will, in fact, be a strong response, an additional round of sanctions. What more are we learning?",

Well, CNN Senior International Correspondent Melissa Bell is covering the latest on the death of Alexei Navalny and joins us live from Paris. Quite an emotional four days, even the past 24 hours, Melissa. We've seen his mother pleading for his body, saying they have no access to his body now. New charges have been raised and filed against his brother. And just hours ago, Yulia Navalny, Alexei Navalny's wife, had been deactivated from Twitter or X, only to be reactivated.

And what X says is thatthis was a mistake on the part of its defense mechanism aimed at weeding out spam and manipulation. So, she was -- her account, which was only created yesterday, was down for a couple of hours. Many questions about why it might have disappeared or been deactivated or been suspended. We now understand that that was a mistake. This is an account that she created yesterday in order to tweet out part of that nine-minute video message in which, for the first time, Bianna, she really looked like she intended to carry on and pick up where her husband had left off, really taking center stage in a way that she hadn't before, and asking, urging Russians to share her fury. Now, we know that she is now set to continue being outspoken. In fact, she was in Brussels yesterday urging lawmakers not to recognize next month's election in Russia, where Vladimir Putin is expected to win a fifth term. We've also been hearing, and perhaps even more remarkably from his mother, as you say, and that's a sure sign that courage is something that runs in the Navalny family. She's standing outside that Polar Wolf penal colony, which is nearly 2000 kilometers northeast of Moscow. It's frigidly cold. It's extremely dangerous for her to be out and about and making such demands of Russian authorities at a time when what we've seen over the course of the last few days are Russian authorities really clamping down on any of the outpourings of grief or of support that there have been for the Navalny family across the country. There have been hundreds of arrests, and yet there she is, nearly 70 years old, standing outside the penal colony where she knows, she says, well, we now know that her son died at the end of last week, calling, demanding that his body be released to her. Now, as you say, we've also seen on the part of the Kremlin on-going denials of any wrongdoing. We heard again from Dmitry Peskov today, and we've seen that this campaign against the family continues in the shape this time of an arrest warrant for the brother of Alexei Navalny, Oleg. Now, he'd already served time in a Russian jail back in 2014, Bianna, and he was accused at the time of fraud. Now, those charges largely believed to have been part of a campaign to put pressure on his brother. But he's done time already and now is in exile. And again, Russian authorities trying to get their hands on him are certainly putting out an arrest warrant. So, the suggestion is that even as on one hand we have the Navalny family that appears intent on standing firm and speaking loudly, even from within Russia, we also have strong signals on the part of Russian authorities that they're going to keep up their pressure on the family to try and prevent that.

And he met with Donald Trump, the former President last night at his resort in Mar-a-Lago. And remind you here that Trump has said that no more additional aid should go to Ukraine. Donald Trump already successfully scuttled the Senate bipartisan border security deal. And so, he does have a big influence in how members act over here. And you also have this hardline group of members on the far right who have threatened Mike Johnson's job and his speakership if he were to put a Senate-passed Ukraine bill on the House floor. But at the same time, we are told that Speaker Mike Johnson has said in private meetings that he does understand the gravity of this situation, especially now that he is a Speaker. As a rank-and-file member, he did vote against Ukraine aid. But he understands that he is not speaking just for himself now. And he has signaled privately that he wants to address the issue somehow. Now, the question is how he plans to do that. There is some talk in the GOP leadership team right now about potentially changing that Senate package to either offset the cost for Ukraine funding or to turn it into more of a loan structure, something Trump has also floated in the past. But as of right now, no decisions have been made. And right now, both the House and the Senate are on recess. They're not scheduled to return until next week. But certainly, this is going to be an issue that Johnson is immediately confronted with. Because right now, the fate of Ukraine aid and potentially the fate of the entire war itself now rests entirely in his hands, Bianna.",

POZZEBON (voice-over): Three days after the detention, Venezuela's attorney general confirmed that Freites had been arrested as part of an investigation into an alleged plot to kill President Nicolas Maduro. Cabrejo and her lawyer deny Freites was involved in any plot, and so far, no proof has been presented by Venezuelan authorities. Freites is a member of opposition party Vente Venezuela, and he and two other party members were detained in January. The party leader, Maria Corina Machado, who is the front-runner opposition candidate to challenge Maduro, has been barred by the Supreme Court from running in this year's presidential election. In total, 19 people have been arrested, including Rocio San Miguel, a Spanish-Venezuelan citizen and security analyst who was picked up by the intelligence service as she was trying to leave the country. San Miguel is also accused of participating in a conspiracy, again, without any evidence. And when the U.N. human rights team protested her detention last week, Venezuela expelled the local staff. The Venezuelan government claims to have uncovered several plots to murder Maduro and blames the U.S. and the U.N. of colonialism. Maduro himself vowed to unleash a campaign of Bolivarian fury against his opponents, and someone wrote exactly those words, Bolivarian fury, on the wall of Cabrejo's house shortly after her son's arrest. The United States has threatened to reimpose oil sanctions in retaliation for Venezuela's authoritarian actions.

I raise this because we've heard from leaders, from President Biden and Western leaders around the world expressing condemnation for the death of Navalny, support for his family, and laying blame with Vladimir Putin.

He wrote this. \"The sudden death of Alexei Navalny has made me more aware of what is happening in our country.\" Then he went on to say Navalny's, yeah, he called him \" -- crooked, radical left politicians, prosecutors and judges leading us down a path to destruction.\" So, he turns it to himself as usual.

Trump not only turned it to himself, but he seemed to both amplify Russian propaganda using the same phrase that the Russians have used for Navalny's death, which, by the way, is anything but sudden. He has essentially been tortured and systematically denied the conditions to continue living while being in Russian prison for the last couple of years in unbearably horrible conditions, first of all. Second of all, Trump refused to blame -- lay blame where it must be laid, which is directly at Vladimir Putin and his government. And most importantly, he perpetrated another lie on the American people. Let's be real. Donald Trump's situation in no way bears any resemblance to that of Alexei Navalny, a political dissident who was imprisoned and ultimately died, you know, for basic principles of freedom inside Russia that he has been denied. Donald Trump is on trial, multiple trials, faced of attacking our system of constitutional government. That's what he's on trial for. It's really a remarkable, remarkable statement, once again, from Trump. In the meantime, we're seeing the real life consequence of Congress' delay in passing any legislation for more aid to Ukraine. We've heard from the foreign minister today saying that that is part of the reason why Ukrainians have to retreat from another city that Russia has just gained control over.

All of the sort of the massive material that we put into space doesn't all just stay there. And when it's deorbited, it basically acts in the same way that a meteorite does. WEIR (voice-over): With special high-flying jets, a team from NOAA recently discovered that 10 percent of the particles in the stratosphere contain bits of rocket and satellite metal. And in the next few decades, it could be 50 percent, matching the amount created naturally by meteorites. Scientists worry that this could eventually alter Earth's climate.

NASA says they'll be forced to deal with challenges similar to what humans might experience on the Red Planet, everything from equipment failures to communication delays. They'll also be asked to perform tasks like simulated spacewalks, growing crops, and even exercise. CNN's Tom Foreman is covering the story for us from Washington.

And once they get them all together, what we're going to have is a four-person volunteer crew. They will live and work for a year inside that 1700-foot habitat you saw being built there. It's at Johnson Space Center in Texas, and it looks kind of like an extended dorm room, really. And the mission will start in the spring of 2025, and they'll be in there for about a year. And during that time, Bianna, they won't be able to have normal communications with people back on Earth, just as if you were on Mars now and you had even the most favorable circumstances, and you said good morning to Earth. It'll take about five minutes for the message to get here. By the time they say good morning back, another five minutes has passed. The only real-time communication they will have is with doctors who will keep track of their health.

But one of the real challenges here is they'll have tasks to do, robotic things. They have to try to grow things in the ground there. They will have what are effectively like walks on Mars that will be done in a controlled environment there. But the real thing here is to look at the sociological part of it.
