Russia's Defense Ministry blames Ukraine for donning that plane. Welcome to the show. And I want to take you first to New Hampshire where Former U.S. President Donald Trump has won that state's Republican primary, moving him one step closer to rematch with President Joe Biden in November. But much to Trump's chagrin. His final Republican primary challenger is not giving up. Nikki Haley lost to Trump by about 11 points in New Hampshire and is vowing to stay in the race with her sights now set on February's primary in her home state of South Carolina. CNN's Omar Jimenez has more from the campaign trail.

One of the questions we asked them during our coverage was what they felt about Nikki Haley talking about quote, age. And Nikki Haley has been talking about age a lot.

And we certainly saw some of that video that has come through on social media showing that plane apparently taking a nosedive out of control, seemingly also possibly losing part of the plane or part of the plane coming off before it then impacts in the ground and then explodes into a large fireball with a lot of smoke coming out, as well. As you've already noted, the governor of that region of the Belgorod region has said that nobody survived that plane crash. It happened north east of the city of Belgorod, which is one of Russia's main military hubs for its invasion of Ukraine. Now, the Russians have come out and said that it was the Ukrainian surface to air missile that took the plane down and that the Ukrainians fired it from an area very close to the Russian border, but on Ukrainian territory. And they also said as you mentioned that there were 65 prisoners of war from Ukraine on that plane that were supposed to go to a prisoner exchange. Now, from Ukrainian state media, we did hear that the defense minister of Ukraine apparently believed that there could have been weapons on that plane. However, there's no confirmation whatsoever, or any hint as to the Ukrainian saying that they actually did take down that plane, the Ukrainian so far not saying anything at all on that subject. One of the things however, that they do say is they do confirm that there was supposed to be a prisoner exchange that was supposed to take place today. And that, that prisoner exchange has been called off in other words, that that prisoner exchange is not going to happen. So, so far, really unclear what exactly happened, still also unclear who was on that plane. As you've noted, the Russians are saying that they are conducting an investigation. And the Ukrainians are also saying, look, don't believe anything that the Russians say, and that they are looking into the matter as well. So all that unclear, however, what we can ascertain is that this was definitely a major incident of big loss of an aircraft also for the Russians that took place on Russian territory north east of the city of Belgorod, which really has been engulfed into the war in Ukraine. And has also taken some hits from the Ukrainians as well in the form of drones, but also cross border raids as well, Eleni.",

But what they say is seeing from the White House point of view, one person familiar with the phone call between President Biden the U.S. President and Benjamin Netanyahu last Friday was that, that Netanyahu had said he has not foreclosing the possibility of a two state solution. So we're seeing different terminology now used by President Biden by U.S. officials, talking about the demilitarized state of Palestine, we've heard the Egyptian President type that as well. So everyone is trying to tiptoe around the fact that this will not be a completely sovereign Palestinian state. And that is really the crucial stumbling block when it comes to trying to negotiate hostage releases. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said there has to be a two state solution for the neighboring countries to want to have relations with Israel for there to be a peaceful Middle East.

It's changed its laws, it has agreed to back the Turkeys a bid to join the European Union, all in an effort to allay Turkish concerns that Sweden is sheltering what Turkey views as Kurdish terrorists inside of its borders. Now, that hurdle was cleared actually last summer when Turkey agreed to send or when President Erdogan agreed to send this issue to the Turkish parliament. But then it was delayed for months and months until this point, when yesterday, this was overwhelmingly passed in the Turkish parliament. The Turks had been holding out on one more issue beyond anything that they had to work out with Sweden, and that is the sale of F-16 fighter jets from the American, something that they have put together, say President Erdogan previously saying that he would like to sign this bill into law at the same time, as the U.S. is approving the sale of these jets. The U.S. has never put them together. Obviously Turkey feels differently. And yesterday, we heard from the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who holds a huge sway in whether or not these jets actually get sold that it doesn't seem like Ben Cardin is in a huge hurry, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD): They have indicated before that they were going to move on this. So we want to see the session documents completed. We hope that's the case today.

And we've had another measure today with Beijing saying that they are essentially looking to improve liquidity in the markets by -- having the reserves that Chinese banks need to keep that should of course improve lending. That will be key for certain issues like the real estate sector, which is still of course undergoing restructuring, like some of the high debt levels that local governments held. So that is part of the story. But I think we need to see more of these measures if they're actually going to make any kind of long term sort of impact.

Software firm SAP, a big German grouphave announced that they aren't restructuring 8000 jobs due to AI and all the changes that's going to make to their company. Now, interestingly, that doesn't actually mean 8000 job losses, they are actually looking at retraining staff as well as offering redundancy program. So that's an example of AI yes, definitely changing the structure of the workforce within a company. But possibly by the end of the year, they think that kind of headcount in terms of workforce will be about the same. \"L.A. Times\" laying off 115 journalists, this is more of a money story. This is about the financial issues that newsrooms all around the world are facing in terms of revenue streams.
