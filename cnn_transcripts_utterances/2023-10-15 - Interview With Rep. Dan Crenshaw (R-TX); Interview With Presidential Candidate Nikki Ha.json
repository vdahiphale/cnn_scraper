The Israeli government says, after eight days of a brutal air campaign in Gaza, it is now preparing -- quote -- \"significant ground operations\" in response to the devastating terror attacks, in which 1,000 Israelis were slaughtered, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, which was accompanied by the kidnapping of more than 100 innocents. Just look at these Israeli babies, reportedly hostages of Hamas, on the front page of the Israeli newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" this morning. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza, population 2.3 million, are desperately trying to flee. There are reports from inside that country that Hamas, which uses Palestinians as human shields, has set up blockades to stop its own people from fleeing, while, of course, the Israelis and Egyptians prevent access out of Gaza, all of it leading to a disastrous humanitarian crisis. From a top U.N. official -- quote -- \"Hospitals overwhelmed with patience are running out of medicine. Morgues are overflowing. Homes, schools, shelters, health centers, and places of worship are under intense bombardment.\" This morning, international officials say the only viable exit from Gaza, the Rafah Crossing, into Egypt's Sinai desert, remains closed. CNN's Sara Sidner joins me now from Tel Aviv, Israel. Sara, what is the mood on the ground there as Israel prepares for the next stage of this war?",

I have to be cautious about how much I can say about certain efforts he's undertaking, because we want to protect those efforts to give us the best possible chance of getting our people home. Now, Jake, one important point when it comes to the issue of the Navy SEALs is, we do not at this point have pinpoint location information for where the American hostages are. So, we have to continue to refine our understanding of where they are and even, Jake, who they are, because we know there are 15 unaccounted-for Americans, but we cannot confirm the precise number of American hostages being held by Hamas at this time. All we can do is to continue to work closely with the Israeli government on hostage recovery options, which we are doing, and then work through third countries to see if there are avenues for release. Those efforts are under way. Our hope is that they can produce results. We will continue to stay focused on this. It's as high a priority as the president has.",

So, they do have information to be able to go after specific targets, actionable targets, similar to the way the United States has been able to do that in other places in other contexts. The United States has taken a very clear stand. It is a stand that we don't just take in this situation, but we have taken all along, which is that we stand for the rule of law, we stand for the law of war, we stand for the protection of civilians, and we want to make sure that innocent Palestinians who have nothing to do with Hamas can get to safe areas, where they will be safe from bombardment and where they will have access to necessities like food, water, shelter and medicine.",

And we are doing all that we can to make sure that American citizens who are in Gaza can get through that border crossing. Secretary Blinken, in fact, is in Egypt today meeting with the president of Egypt. This is at the top of his list to help get those American citizens out of Gaza.

I'm Jake Tapper.As the Israeli government warns of a new phase in its fight against Hamas, brand-new polling just into CNN shows how Americans are feeling about this war. The U.S. public broadly feels Israel's military response to the Hamas terrorist attack is fully justified. But the difference by age is quite stark; 81 percent of Americans over the age of 65 feel the response by the Israeli government is fully justified. But just 27 percent of Americans 18 to 34 years old feel that way. The humanitarian crisis is also top of mind for many Americans; 71 percent of Americans feel a lot of sympathy for the people of Israel; 41 percent feel a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian people. Former U.N. Ambassador and 2024 Republican presidential candidate, Nikki Haley joins us now. Ambassador Haley, thanks so much for joining us. If you were president right now, would you consider using the U.S. special operations to rescue American hostages being held in Gaza? You just heard Jake Sullivan say that one of the complications with that is, we don't know exactly where the hostages are, but I'm wondering how much you would consider such a thing. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thanks for having me, Jake. I think it's important. You have to tell hard truths to Americans. And when you're talking about this, when you showed those percentages of what people think and what they think we should do, you have to be honest with them. This is messy, right? I mean, we desperately want to get those American hostages out. But if you saw those kids in the hands of those terrorists, like, with a mom heart, it made me sick to my stomach for all those parents having to see their children in those terrorist hands. So, of course, we want them out. But why isn't it so easy that we can do that? It's because we don't know where they are. And I have been in those tunnels that are massive, that are sophisticated, and that Hamas uses to hide equipment and ammunition and to do their dirty work and maybe to have those hostages. But where are those tunnels? They're underneath hospitals. They're underneath schools. They're in hard-to-find places. So this is incredibly tough. I feel for the Israeli families. I feel for the American families. And I feel for any other families who've lost a loved one or have someone in a hostage situation, because it's really bleak right now.

Where is Lebanon? Where is Jordan? Where is Egypt? Do you know we give Egypt over a billion dollars a year? Why aren't they opening the gates? Why aren't they taking the Palestinians? You know why? Because they know they can't vet them, and they don't want Hamas in their neighborhood. So why would Israel want them in their neighborhood? So let's be honest with what's going on. The Arab countries aren't doing anything to help the Palestinians because they don't trust who is right, who is good, who is evil, and they don't want it in their country. So they're going to come and blame America. They're going to come and blame Israel. And don't fall for it, because they have the ability to fix all of this if they wanted to.

We saw what happened to Israel when they were distracted. America looks so distracted right now. When America is distracted, the world is less safe. We can't sit there and act like this is September 10. We better get it together and remember what it felt like September 12, because we have got a lot of threats around us and a lot of chaos around us. And we need some strength. We need some stability. And, again, I will say we need a new, generational leader to right this ship.",

It's impossible for any member of our conference to get 217 true believers, 217 people who truly think you're the best, right?So, we have a democratic process for a reason. You have a race, and then somebody wins a majority. It's like a primary election. And I tell people all the time, if you don't like your primary candidate as a Republican, you don't go voting for the Democrat in the general election. Democrats, of course, don't do it either. And that's how this is supposed to run. Like I said, we have gotten away from that, from that basic principle. And that's really killing us right now. So, what I -- and what I would really recommend to Jordan's allies too is that a lot of them have mounted this -- this high-pressure campaign. They're going to -- they're going to whip up Twitter against the people who are against Jordan. That is the dumbest way to support Jordan. I'm supporting Jordan. I'm going to vote for Jordan. Like, and as somebody who wants Jim Jordan, the dumbest thing you can do is to continue pissing off those people and entrench them.

It was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And none of this was about liberating the innocent people of Gaza from the oppression of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza. That blockade began after Hamas, which the U.S. and E.U. classify as a terrorist group, after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, and refused to disavow violence and refused to recognize Israel. The people of Gaza indeed deserve to live without a blockade. They deserve to live in freedom and with democracy and human rights and without fear of their government, which Hamas denies them. If any of this were about freedom and rights, why would Hamas have slaughtered, for example, Danielle Waldman? Danielle was 24. She was at the music festival. Do you know who her dad is? Her dad is Eyal Waldman. He's an Israeli tech CEO who had employees in the West Bank and Gaza to improve relations.
