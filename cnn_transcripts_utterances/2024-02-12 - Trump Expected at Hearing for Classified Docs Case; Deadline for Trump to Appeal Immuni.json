According to the government these are among the most sensitive documents that were found in Mar-a-Lago when the FBI went to retrieve them back in August of 2022. The Trump team has been arguing that they should be able to get access -- full access to every single document that is going to be used at trial. That trial is still set for May. But what we are seeing is a lot of maneuvering behind the scenes. Part of the goal here, of course, by Donald Trump and his legal team is to delay that trial, to make sure that we don't have a trial in this case, in the classified documents case, before the election, Sara.",

The special counsel, in -- just in the last couple of days, from -- you know, has argued that some of those witnesses are getting threats. They mentioned that one prospective witness has already been receiving threats on social media. The U.S. attorney is now investigating that.

It means one-on-one with the judge, because ordinarily, in any criminal hearing, you're going to have any proceeding in front of the judge, both parties have to be there, so you can hear what arguments each side is saying. Because this case involves classified documents, there's a special law that applies, and that says that when classified documents and their contents are being discussed, in some circumstances, one, the judge can hold the hearings under seal, as Evan said, meaning, not for us in the public, in the media to see, and, two, ex parte, meaning the judge can sit with each set of lawyers and clients separately and apart.So, what this means as a practical matter, John, is that Donald Trump and his lawyers will be in a room, probably the judge's chambers, meaning the judge's offices, alone with the judge and judge's staff, which happens very rarely in the criminal system.",

Option b is Donald Trump's team can go up to the Supreme Court, say, we want you to grant cert (ph), to use a little more Latin here, meaning, we want you to take the case. If that happens, then the district court, the trial court remains frozen until the Supreme Court either reject the case or takes the case and rules on it. And then there's option c. Trump's team can go up to the Supreme Court, say, we're not necessarily asking you to take the case right now, we just want you to extend the freeze on the trial court. We want you to give us more time to decide whether we want to ask you, Supreme Court, to take the case. And it's worth noting, John, ordinarily a litigate has 90 days to ask the Supreme Court to take a case after they lose in the district court.

Individual judges have disagreed or circuits have disagreed. Here we've had unanimity between the district court judge and then the three court of appeals judges last week.I think the way Trump would phrase this to the Supreme Court is to say, this is a hugely important issue. This has to do with the scope of presidential powers and the structure of our government. We don't have any Supreme Court precedent on this. So, you, as the Supreme Court, ought to jump in and take this case. I think that's how he's going to frame it.",

We're told that these two men were being held on the second floor of a residential building in a civilian neighborhood in Rafah. Israeli forces, at 1Now, what we're told is that a minute later, after they breached that building, the Israeli air force began conducting a round of air strikes on other areas of Rafah, targeting, they say, Hamas fighters in order to serve as a diversion effectively to try and get those two hostages and the special forces who rescued them out safely. Those two hostages were then put on a helicopter and taken to a hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv where they are being listed as in good medical condition, and they have been reunited with their families. But it's also important to underscore the collateral damage and the impact of these strikes that were carried out by the Israeli military overnight in that southern most city of Rafah, where it's important to note that 1.4 million people are currently living in a city where you normally have about 300,000 residents. At least 94 people were killed in these strikes, including strikes on at least two mosques and 14 homes according to local reports. Hospitals, we're told, were overwhelmed in Rafah overnight by the number of casualties that were coming in. The Israeli prime minister, meanwhile, is stressing that this military operation is evidence that he says military pressure, only the continuation of military pressure, will result in the release of all of the hostages. Although, it's important to note, that this is only the second time that the Israeli military has successfully rescued hostages in Gaza using a military operation rather than through negotiations.

But police say that the woman showed up wearing a trench coat carrying that assault-style rifle underneath the trench coat and also came in with a young child, about four or five years old. As the gunshots fired, there were two off duty officers who were working here at the church on this Sunday afternoon, and they are the ones, according to police, who shot and killed the woman here at the scene, who was a woman in her 30s. In that shooting, there was also -- the young child was also wounded. We are told that that child is in critical condition. But it's not clear if that child is the woman's child or someone else's.

We saw it in the Buffalo shooting in the supermarket. We saw it in the New Zealand shooting in the mosque where the rifle kind of becomes the communique.
