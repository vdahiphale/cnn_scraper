The site of the Nova music festival became ground zero for thousands of unsuspecting people, who were there on the morning of October 7th.Israeli media, now reporting that many more people died there than was previously reported, citing an Israeli police report. The death toll now stands at 364. That is up from 270; 17 of those killed, reportedly were police officers. About 40 people at the event were taken hostage. Israeli authorities do not believe that the terrorists knew about the festival beforehand. Three weeks into the IDF's ground incursion into northern Gaza, CNN crews in nearby Israel reported seeing heavy IDF activity during the night. Hamas officials now putting the Palestinian death toll in Gaza at more than 12,000 people, including more than 5,000 children. Eleni Giokos joins us from Cairo, Egypt. Eleni, thank you so much for being there for us. Give us a sense of what is the view from Egypt on the ever deepening crisis in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "That death toll, 12,000 people killed, most of those numbers women and children, which is hair raising. You look at the overall injuries and we're talking about 30,000 people who are suffering through war injuries. That is what we need to wrap our head around.Along with the fact that the hospitals that are out of service in Gaza, talking about running out of fuel and food and medical supplies, having to amputate without anesthesia, making tough decisions. We know what is going on at Al-Shifa with the IDF operation there. That making it all the more difficult to save patients. From the Egyptian side, they say they want to take as many patients as possible but, of course, getting them to the Rafah border, which is the only lifeline for injured Palestinians right, now is very difficult. With the continued and incessant airstrikes, it just makes the trip very, very tough. We know the IDF is taking a lot more of an aggressive stance, specifically in the northern parts of Gaza. The other thing we need to remember about Al-Shifa Hospital -- and we spoke to doctors within the hospital who say, maybe ICU patients have now died. There is just no electricity. There are also 36 neonatal babies. And we've been talking to the Egyptians about how they've been waiting for them for almost a week now. They worry, as time passes, that number may change. But I want you to listen to what the Egyptian health minister had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. KHALED ABDEL GHAFFAR, EGYPTIAN HEALTH AND POPULATION MINISTER: You know, there are the neonates that need ventilators. They are out of electricity, they are out of gas, they are out of medication. They told me they are trying to put three neonates in one incubator. Can you believe that? They sent me photos of them because they don't have anything else to do. So they put the kids, three of them, in one incubator, because they don't have enough energy to support. Even though they stopped losing those newborns and they want to get them out, how do you call that? How do you name that? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a conversation that is happening right now. We know 60,000 liters of fuel into Gaza yesterday went to UNRWA, which is an international organization on the ground. So limited use but mostly for desalination plants to try and get water to people who desperately need it. But efforts are ongoing, negotiations are ongoing between the Qataris, as well as Israel, Hamas, the Egyptians and the U.S. to negotiate a way to get hostages out, as well as to suggest a cease-fire and a pause to make that happen. But also, to alleviate what we are seeing on the ground.",

Both Hamas and the Israeli Defense Forces are violating basic rules of international humanitarian law in a variety of ways.So Hamas, obviously, committed a number of atrocities on October 7th. They continue to hold over 200 hostages. They are firing rockets indiscriminately at Israeli civilian populations and using Palestinians as human shields. At the same time, the Israeli Defense Forces have prevented humanitarian relief from reaching Gaza civilians for weeks now. It is a clear and indefensible violation of humanitarian law. We also see the IDF engaged in targeting and attacks that seem indiscriminate and disproportionate. And we are all, of course, very concerned with the increasing military operations in and around hospitals. This is making it even more difficult for doctors, nurses and paramedics, to provide lifesaving care. So it's an extremely disturbing situation in which the law is not being followed by either side.",

Now international law also prohibits the use of armed force, except as a necessary and proportionate means of self-defense. That body of law exists to prevent war in the first place and to bring war to an end when it no longer serves a legitimate purpose or comes at too great a human cost.

But the city, still, remains within artillery range. Every day, the city has come under bombardment, authorities in Kherson telling us that, since the liberation of the city last year, over 400 people have been killed in these routine bombardments. Generally speaking, there is a concern that we could have a repeat with, winter approaching, of the situation last winter in which Russia targeted Ukraine's civilian infrastructures, its energy and power grid, in an effort to cripple the country's economy and to demoralize the population. We just saw, overnight here in the Kyiv region and around the country, a wave of drone strikes, which Ukrainians say they have been able to counter. But really, this has driven home for Ukrainians the message that they have been hammering on, which is that they need more and better equipment, particularly air defenses. But most importantly of all, they have been saying they really need ammunition for a long and ongoing war with Russia.",
