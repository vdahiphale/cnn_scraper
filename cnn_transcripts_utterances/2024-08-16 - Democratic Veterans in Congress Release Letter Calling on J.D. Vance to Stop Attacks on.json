Vance for his attacks on Tim Walz's military record. Nineteen veterans in both the Senate and the House signing on to this message, it's a letter defending Walz saying that Vance's attacks are, quote, purely politically driven, and beyond the pale. The letter comes after Vance, a marine veteran himself, accused Tim Walz of misrepresenting his service in the Army National Guard, which he served for 24 years.This week, here's how Tim Walz responded to Vance's attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ, (D) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person's service record. Anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words -- thank you for your service and sacrifice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, this letter is coming from nearly 20 Democrats across the House and the United States Senate in which they are basically calling on J.D. Vance to stop attacking Tim Walz's military record. Here's what they write in the letter, saying, quote, \"In the military, we all learned to respect and defend our fellow servicemembers. While we might disagree with their policy proposals, we would never question their motives. We would never say that person doesn't love America. Falsely maligning a fellow veteran's service for personal gain is,\" quote, \"beyond the pale.\"Now, this letter comes at a time when Democrats are on recess, so they are not here in Washington to defend him, Walz, in the hallways as reporters would be asking them about this. And this is obviously coming at a critical point in this campaign with just a few months until the election. It also comes as many of these members remember that Tim Walz was the top Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee in his last term in Congress. And this is a post that he had, and a lot of Democrats that I talked to right after he was selected were excited about the fact that he could talk about what he had done on that committee, that he could talk about his service. They really do feel like this is an attribute for him and not something that should be a detractor, as J.D. Vance has tried to attack him on the campaign trail. So it's really sort of this critical moment. And it also just comes as Democrats are just trying to defend someone that they think has done, not just in his own service, but once he was serving on this top spot in this committee, done a lot for veterans across the country.

CHRIS COONS, (D-DE) FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  Well, Kate, I think this is an important part of Governor Walz's service, his background, his character, that he spent 24 years in the National Guard. And I'm glad that there are members of Congress coming to his defense and making it clear that J.D. Vance should be respecting Master Sergeant Walz's service than the National Guard, just as Governor Walz has been respectful of J.D. Vance's service in the Marines. We've had in the Biden family during the Biden-Harris administration, a president whose son served in the Delaware National Guard and a president who respected and supported military families. I think it's important that moving forward this be a constructive, respectful, and positive debate about the issues that matter to Americans. And frankly, if we look back at what happened in the 2004 campaign, when a highly decorated veteran in John Kerry didn't respond promptly to, frankly, unfounded attacks about his service in Vietnam, it ended up being a defining issue in the campaign. So I'm glad that there's prompt action being taken here to put on the table, not just Governor Walz's service in the National Guard, but his service on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House and his record, which would continue President Biden's record of fighting hard for veterans.",

As you may remember, many times in the last few months he's gone on at great length about whether he'd rather die by electrocution are being eaten by a shark. He was talking this week about how wind farms cause bird cemeteries. It's almost hard to make this stuff -- you couldn't make this up.I think that there are many ways that this campaign can unfold. What I'm positive about is that the Harris-Walz campaign has electrified Democrats and undecided voters across the country. We're seeing record crowds. We're seeing record numbers of folks volunteer at our grassroots campaign offices, a record number of first-time small dollar donors to the campaign. There is genuine momentum and excitement about Kamala Harris. And Donald Trump just can't help himself. He keeps dragging it back into an eighth-grade levels series of personal attacks. Today, you're going to get concrete economic proposals from Kamala Harris about the situation faced by millions of Americans, whether its affording rent, buying their first home, becoming new parents dealing with prescription drug prices, the kinds of things Americans really care about rather than slinging different words back-and-forth between candidates.
