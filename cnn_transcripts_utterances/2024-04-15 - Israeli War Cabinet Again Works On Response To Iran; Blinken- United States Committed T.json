At issue, how to answer the wave of drones and missiles launched at Israel by Iran over the weekend. These were unprecedented. A five-hour wave of attack. Israel says most of the projectiles were shot down and one person was seriously injured. World leaders are urging restraint in the hopes of preventing a full-blown war. Iran is maintaining that this bombardment was legitimate. Tehran blames Israel for a strike in its consulate at the beginning of April in Syria that killed several significant senior Iranian commanders. Well, the situation is affecting Israel's war against Hamas. Israeli sources tell us that it has prompted Israel to delay the first steps of its ground invasion of Rafah. Let's get you to CNN's Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv. Do we -- have any detail on what is coming out of this Cabinet meeting so far? Any indication on how Israel might respond?",

And there is a sense that there is a lot of debate going on, essentially as to how and when, and in what manner Israel should respond. We heard yesterday from the centrist war Cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, he talked about forming a regional coalition. Then, hours later, we heard from Israel's far right, National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who called that a hollow Western catchphrase. And I think that kind of back and forth gives you a sense as to the different influences that are basically competing here. At the same time, it Itamar Ben-Gvir is not in the war Cabinet. There are three permanent members of the war Cabinet -- three observers. Of course, the other strong influence here will be from Israel's allies, particularly in the form of the U.S. The U.S. has been urging caution, urging Israel not to escalate. And that's really what we have seen across the board, from various international organizations and world leaders. So, now the question becomes, what are we talking about? What are we looking at? We have heard Benny Gantz, also, reportedly thinking that there needs to be movement or some kind of a response quickly, because there is a certain momentum, and there is a sense here in Israel, or a feeling of belief that there is more goodwill towards Israel in the wake of this Iran attack.

Talking about as well, the U.S.'s freedom to protect its forces or commitment, I should say to protect its forces in the region. But I think that privately, you can be assured, Becky, that there have been some pretty long conversations between the U.S. administration and between Israel's leadership, really urging for any response to avoid becoming an avert escalation that could really precipitate things into a direction that no one wants them to go into. As it is we're in uncharted territory. But there are a number of different ways that Israel could potentially respond here. There could be a direct tit-for-tat in the form of a direct hit on Iranian military targets inside Iran, they could engage in some kind of an asymmetric attack, potentially looking at Iran's numerous proxies in the region. They could look at a cyberattack. They could also explore the diplomatic option. At this stage, we don't know where exactly their thinking is at, although, it does seem from hearing the rhetoric coming from Israel's leaders that they believe a solid response is, in fact, necessary. And hardliners really pushing to, \"sort of reestablish the deterrent with Iran. Although, again, important to underscore that those hardliners are not necessarily hugely influential in this because they are not part of that war Cabinet. Becky.",

But again, I think we need to be focused. The issue here is not Iran. The issue here is the aggression on Gaza. The issue here is the extremely illegal and harmful measures to the Palestinians of the West Bank. This has to stop. As you said, Becky, nobody wants escalation. We all want to calm things down. But the first step towards that is ending the aggression. And we're seeing that aggression continuing. And I think one more point I want to say is that, look, the Israeli prime minister has always wanted to invoke some sort of confrontation with Iran. Now, as the international pressure on Israel, to stop the aggression in Gaza continues. invoking a fight with Iran is something that we believe he, he thinks could dilute that pressure and take attention away from Gaza, and focus on this new confrontation. What we tell all our partners in the international community, the issue is in Gaza and the West Bank, and our focus needs to continue to be on that, because unless we solve that, then the chances for regional coalition will continue.

Trump's legal team had asked for that motion the judge saying Trump was using a \"series of inferences, innuendos, and unsupported speculation to make his claims recusal, and that motion was then denied. In terms of jury selection, 12 men and women of course will determine Trump's guilt or innocence on these 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. This is all tied to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Felony counts here, because the prosecutor alleges those payments were made to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. These counts are each punishable by up to four years in prison. Looking at everything that is coming ahead here, it's important to note, the former president has pleaded not guilty. He denies any wrongdoing here. He has also repeatedly bashed the judge and the prosecutor in the case and the case itself, calling the trial rigged, and a sham. Katelyn Polantz is back with us this hour.

The prosecutors don't want people who are gathering news from alt-right sides and vice versa, but the defense attorney. So, I think they're going to try as best they can to figure out where did these people gather news? What's their worldview? Do they believe in the big lie? Do they believe in other conspiracy theories? Do they believe that Trump is a menace to democracy?

It will take a week or two, I think to do that, but I don't think Trump is going to be able to delay this trial. The interesting sub part of what's going to happen today, potentially, is what they call a sand able hearing, which is Trump has said that he may testify.

That Cabinet has wrapped up today's meeting after hours of talks on Sunday, ended without a resolution. Meantime, leaders in the Middle East and around the world are scrambling to contain the conflict. At Sunday's emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, America's deputy ambassador said Iran will be to blame if either it or its proxies act against the U.S. or Israel.

Mark Saad is the Director of Outreach and a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. He joins me now. For us, as we look at how Israel may respond. We are dealing with two realities here. First, this was a direct, unprecedented attack on Israel by Iran. At the same time, it was widely telegraphed, as we understand it, and we know it causes very minimal damage and injuries inside Israel. With that in mind, and with your ear to the ground, particularly when it comes to gulf thinking, thinking about what is going on both with a Saudi perspective and around this region where I am. What are the options on the table here? And what would be sufficient, as far as you can assess for those who are calling for real de-escalation here and profound concern about what happens next.",

That was not the case. The CENTCOM area of operations, the U.S. Central Command in the Middle East, which integrated Israel, under its umbrella three years ago, for the first time, operated jointly in an integrated fashion, to contribute to the defense of Israel. And I think leaders in Israel need to take a moment, think about that, and maybe use that as a moment to try and understand, and maybe to flip over from focusing on Gaza. There is no strategic victory to be had in the alleyways of Gaza. We need to start talking about the day after. And then we need to get back to where America's focus was before the October 7th attack, which is normalization and regional integration. If there is a strategic victory to be had. Vis-a-vis Iran, it is to continue down that path of regional integration and normalizations.

Even if you do let them return up to northern Gaza? They need to 20 -- but they need Arab buy in for that coffer. So, we need a ceasefire, we need to talk about the day after. And then there needs to be a roadmap, a pathway towards a viable Palestinian state. And the politics on either side is not clear on the Palestinian side, obviously, still with the issue of Hamas on one hand and Fatah on the other. But also, the Israeli domestic scene is very complex, and the prime minister there is looking at a maximalist right-wing coalition that might not last.

We are absolutely locked in to our positions on Donald Trump in every survey and study, more extensive than individual polls have indicated that Trump's support is solid, they are not moving. And those opposed to Trump are also solid, they are not moving. There could be some movement between the two major party candidates, Trump and Biden, and the three independent or third-party candidates. That's where there ought to be a little movement. But honestly, Erica, we're talking about three, four, five, six percent of the electorate at most, that maybe is even eligible to change their mind.",

Sources tell usthat there has been heated debate in the Israeli war Cabinet. Members have just wrapped up -- wrapped up -- let me say it again. Cabinet members have just wrapped up another hours-long meeting and have not released any details on what was discussed or possibly decided. Officials have said military options were on the table as well as diplomatic steps to further isolate Iran on the world stage. From all directions, world powers are cautioning against any further escalation and they are rightly concerned about global stability. But we do not want to lose sight of what is happening inside Gaza and the West Bank. Israeli officials reporting a second delivery of aid is gotten into Gaza through a new crossing point. That is part of a new humanitarian push to fend off a looming famine there. Meanwhile, the Gaza health ministry says 68 more people have died as a result of Israel's military operations. And in the occupied West Bank, Israeli police say a man who threw a grenade at Israeli forces during a security operation was shot dead. That's on the heels of an intense new wave of violence there. Israeli settlers going on the attack after a teenager was found dead. This report from Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For the second day in a row, armed Israeli settlers descend on Al-Mughayyir, burning homes and vehicles in this village in the occupied West Bank, when suddenly, a shot rings out. A dozen men rush a wounded man into an ambulance.",
