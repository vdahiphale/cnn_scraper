We are just hours away from the New Year and celebrations are already underway around the world as we say goodbye to 2024.And the nation is celebrating the life of Jimmy Carter and preparing to say a final farewell. What his grandson told us about what kept him going so long. And college football players and coaches dreaming about getting one step closer to this, the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy. The quarterfinals begin tonight. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. All of this and more ahead on a special New Year's Eve edition of CNN News Central. Several cities around the world have already bid farewell to 2024 and are celebrating a new year. Shouts of Happy New Year rang out in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour just a few hours ago as a dazzling fireworks show lit up the skies at the stroke of midnight. And an hour later, it was Thailand's turn. Crowds in Bangkok kicked off the New Year with a spectacular seven minute fireworks display. Take a look at Sydney, Australia. The city welcomed 2025 with its biggest fireworks show ever. It featured a golden waterfall effect cascading from the iconic Sydney Harbor Bridge. Organizers say more than nine tons of fireworks were used for the big event. And back here in the U.S. we are still hours away from one of the largest and most famous New Year's Eve celebrations in the world in New York City's Times Square. And the NYPD is making sure it's prepared for anything when the ball drops tonight. CNN's Brynn Gingras joins us now. Brynn, you've been out all morning, all day. Bring us up to speed on how it is.",

Last year, over 20,000 people came. Here, look, you're going to have music. There's going to be a DJ in true Greek style playing music until the sun comes up. I mean, Greek people, if you've ever been to Greece, you know, they do not sleep.Now, many people had gotten their presence over New Year -- over Christmas Eve. That's the big sort of tradition, I think globally. But for Greeks, it's all about New Year's Eve. And actually we have someone called Ayo Vasili, which is St. Basile. He brings gifts tonight. It is super special. And it's part of sort of this cultural experience that we have. And then also what we wait for on New Year's Eve is this, Pamela. This is called a vasilopita. And it might just seem like a normal bread or cake, but actually inside there's a coin that's hidden. And then you cut this up. And whoever gets the coin has the best luck for the year ahead. And honestly, that sort of sets the tone for the rest of the year. People and families are sitting at home doing this ritual right now. And we -- look, we've got three hours to go. Things are starting to get heated. You've got some people on the ice rink. You've got people starting to come around. It is pretty chilly, but I'm telling you, the vibe is here and you're just feeling the energy. It's so much fun. P. BROWN: It looks like it. And I love all of your sparkles, Eleni. GIOKOS: Yeah. P.

The question is whether or not it will be enough to really sway a lot of the conservatives who have said that they are skeptical of him. And as you mentioned, he can only afford to lose one Republican vote. And already Rep. Thomas Massie has said that he is planning to vote against him.Now, I do want to read for you what Donald Trump wrote with just days to go before this leadership election, he said, quote, \"Let's not blow this great opportunity which we have been given. The American people need immediate relief from all of the destructive policies of the last administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hardworking, religious man. He will do the right thing and we will continue to win. Mike has my complete and total endorsement.\" Now, the thing that was very interesting about this, Pamela, is that it was unclear if Donald Trump was going to weigh in. When I talked to Donald Trump's advisers and those working on the transition, they said it wasn't very clear until he actually pressed send on this True Social post, especially after we saw him kind of go head to head with Mike Johnson in the week leading up to the holiday recess when lawmakers returned home for the holidays. Now, Mike Johnson, for his part, I will say, said that he was honored and humbled to have Donald Trump's support. I want you to take a listen to how he responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
