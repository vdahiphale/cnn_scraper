      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, for the second time in two weeks, the Israeli military has now recovered the bodies of hostages in underground tunnels in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military carried out an operation overnight to recover those bodies in the Jabalia refugee camp where, of course, the Israeli military has been fighting very intense battles over the course of the last couple of weeks. In this case, they recovered the bodies of three hostages who the Israeli military now says were killed on October 7. Their bodies then taken into the Gaza Strip, where they have been held as hostages over the last seven plus months. Two of those individuals attended the Nova Music Festival on October 7.Orion Hernandez Radoux, a 30-year-old French Mexican national. He was actually the boyfriend of Shani Louk, whose body was found last week in a similar Israeli military operation. Both of them were killed after they actually escaped the Nova Music festival, and then were taken -- their bodies were taken into Gaza by Hamas. Hanan Yablonka is the second individual who attended the Nova Music Festival. He was 42-years-old. I've actually been in touch with his family, and they told me that Hanan made a last-minute decision to attend that music festival, rather than another one that was taking place in northern Israel. That tragic, tragic decision, resulting in his death after Hamas terrorists killed him that day. The third individual was Michel Nisenbaum, a 59-year-old grandfather and father. He was actually from Sderot near the Gaza Strip. He was rushing to try and get his granddaughter who was with her father on a military base, and on his way there he was also killed. Their three bodies have now been returned to Israel to their families for burial. I know that at least one of them will be buried in Israel on Sunday. And this is, of course, all bringing back attention once again on the plight of these hostages, nearly 130 of whom from October 7 remain inside of Gaza. At least 37 of those, according to the Prime Minister's Office, are dead. But, as we found out today, these three hostages, we did not previously know that they were dead, that they had been killed, and today, their families getting that awful, awful news.",

And I think at this stage no one expects Israel to down weapons and pull troops out of Rafah. There were other points that the judge made as well specifically that Israel should allow unfettered access of humanitarian aid and basic services for the people of Gaza. It should do that. It should allow the international investigators and people from an inquiry commission to be allowed into Gaza. This is something that Israel hasn't even countenanced thus far, certainly not publicly, and has said Israel should give a written account in a month of the steps that it has taken in, if you will, going along with supporting what the ICJ has ruled they should do. Now, of course, if you go back to the initial sort of early judgmentby the ICJ back in January, Israel then was obliged to allow humanitarian access. And one of the things the judge spoke about was that that humanitarian access hadn't really gotten going, that Israel was obliged to provide monthly written reports on what it was doing. So, I think where this is, it's a legal ruling. No one to enforce it on the ground, and Israel, and certainly what we've heard from Israeli officials, not minded at all to follow what the ICJ is saying.",

We know that the sentencing hearing is taking place as the rhetoric coming from officials in Turks and Caicos and U.S. officials here really was heating up.Yesterday, the country's premier pushed back against these allegations that were made by some U.S. lawmakers that the country was targeting Americans. The premier noted that, in the past six years, 195 people have been convicted of these type of firearm offenses. And he said that, of those 195, only seven of them, just seven of them have been Americans. And so, the premier said, look, at this point, we have to allow the judicial process here to play out. He said that judges on the islands there have the discretion. And he pointed out the fact that no American that's ever been convicted for these type of firearm offenses has ever received the minimum mandatory of 12 years in prison. Now, Hagerich is from Pennsylvania, and he was arrested back in February. He is one of these five Americans that had been arrested on these ammunition -- possession of ammunition charges in recent months. Now, Hagerich told authorities that there that he forgot that he had the hunting ammunition in his bag when he traveled to the country. And he said that since he has been on the island since February because of his court case, he has missed what he calls very important family events, including several birthdays as well as the graduation of his daughter from kindergarten. And so, right now, Fred, we're still waiting on word from the courts down there in Turks and Caicos on what the sentence is going to be.",

U.S. officials here, members of Congress, have said that if these Americans are sentenced to 12 years in prison, again, the minimum mandatory for these type of charges, they said that they would be open to calling for a \"do not travel\" advisory from not only federal officials, but as well as state officials. And so, doing that would no doubt impact the economy of Turks and Caicos, considering just the large number of Americans that visit the Caribbean country every single year.And in fact, yesterday, the Governor of Oklahoma, one of the Americans that's arrested is from that state, he also said that the U.S. should really go after the country's wallets and called essentially for a boycott. Again, though, the premier, a lot of the officials in Turks and Caicos have said, no American has ever received the 12 years in prison for these types of charges. Let's allow this to play out. They understand that a lot of these were most likely -- the decisions made here were most likely by mistake. And so, they just want folks to take a bit of a breather and allow the court system to handle it.",

You sort of lose that reflective skill.And so, this is an opportunity, I would argue, for Donald Trump to be very surgical and precise on some of those key and core kitchen table issues that the American voters are looking for, from either of the two individuals.

Good to see you, Mary. So, would these procedures have helped if they were used in the situation of the turbulence? MARY SCHIAVO, CNN AVIATION ANALYST, &amp; FMR. INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPT.: I think without a doubt, they would have helped. I mean, it's clearly documented that people, not just this flight, in many other instances in the past, had been injured by service items by carts rolling down the aisle, by not being secured and hitting a cabin roof. So, absolutely, these measures would have helped. Sure. WHITFIELD: All right. So, how does this proposed change, how does this differ from what other airlines acts such as major U.S. carriers what they already have in place?",

And already, passengers are suspicious of their airlines. Airlines not singling out this one. But, airlines who have been accused basically using the seatbelt light to punish passengers or to not deny service, etc., already, the firestorm is set off. So, right now, the pilots put the seatbelt light on for any kind of turbulence, even mild turbulence. It's the discretion of the pilot. But, they usually don't suspend service as we've all been on flights where it gets pretty rough and the pilot will come on and say, I'm instructing the flight crew to sit down.So, the issue is, at what point does it become necessary to suspend all service, stop all services, etc.? And that's largely going to be in the discretion of the pilot who is in command of the flight after all. But, it also has broad consequences because turbulence is a huge debate. I don't want to get in the global warming debate, but there is a huge debate about turbulence and it is up. Without a doubt, turbulence is up. So, we can look for longer flights with more suspended service and more seatbelt usage. And until we figure this all out, it's probably a good idea, but it will be misused.",

And the aviation nations of the world are working on that. Clear air turbulence, which is turbulence that you can't see on your radar. You can't predict. You rely on other pilots flying ahead of you to report it and then you try to avoid it. That has increased depending upon who you ask. And again, not getting into the big controversy on what's causing it. It's up as much as 40 percent in the United States, which does have some reliable data, and 55 percent over the ocean. And they have measured at the jet stream level. That's where the airlines like to fly up there in the rarefied air. It's up about 15 percent since 1979.So, we know it's increasing. We don't know if it's El Nino, La Nina. They've warned a terrible hurricane season in the U.S. We don't know if it's transitional yet. But, for now, it seems like a good idea to keep an eye out, keep the seatbelt restrictions throughout the bad weather and then see what happens. But, we really need reliable data.

So, right now, I mean, we all fly around and we've kind of gotten used to weather and those tough flight attendants, they still get our snacks or drinks out even when there is storms etc. Now, what this seems to indicate is in any weather, everything is going to be locked down. The carts will be secured, etcetera. And like I said, people on various passenger and pilot chat rooms are already at war, saying, well, this is just going to be used to further curtail passenger service.Right now, given a lot of reports of unstable air and bad weather, at least seasonally right now, it's probably a good idea. But, like everything, when it's left in discretion, it can be abused. We'll just have to see how it works out.",

The Transportation Security Administration reports it had its second busiest day ever, screening nearly three million passengers on Thursday, just as the U.S. marks its unofficial start to summer. But, not everyone is flying the friendly skies. Most of the people taking trips this weekend are on the road. AAA predicted some 38 million Americans would travel by car between Thursday and Monday. Have patience, no matter which way you go.Ryan Young, always very patient, and he gets through that Atlanta- Hartsfield International Airport out a lot. All right. So, how different does it look today? RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's such a conversation, because you think about it. You got to drive to get to the airport, and the roads are already packed. The parking lots are already full here. We know that's going to have a ripple effect all across the country, 3.5 million people are going to be headed to the airport. They're saying that's going to be the most people heading to the airport since 2019. So, forget that whole time of the pandemic. They're even -- some people calling this revenge travel. But, let's take a look behind me. This is where it's been packed all day long. They're already setting records here. Just today, they've had over 40,000 people pass through the gates here and go through TSA. Yesterday, they set a record, beating their NFL numbers of 111 passengers through the TSA on Thursday. And the reason why I brought up the NFL is because after the Super Bowl that was held here a few years ago, they had 109,000 travelers come through here. But, nine percent overall across the country, there'll be more travel for this Memorial Day weekend. We talked to people talking about how much money they were going to have to spend. Some people said they wanted to spend the money because they want to get out of town. Take a listen to some of these travelers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What we have going on right now is the first of two severe threats for the day today, and this was -- it's fortunately starting to kind of peter up, losing a bit of its punch as it moves eastward. So, it's just approaching the western suburbs of Chicago. So, in the next 45 minutes to an hour or so, you'll be impacted by this line that let's say three hours ago was producing tornadoes across eastern sections of Iowa. Fortunately, the radar returns not as impressive as what they were earlier this morning.But, needless to say, we still have a severe thunderstorm watch that's valid through about 1 p.m. Central Time. [11:50:00] And there have been a few intermittent severe thunderstorm warnings that have popped up across Central Illinois, not the major concern right now, because once we get this system to move eastward, then we start to poke through the cloud cover. The sunshine comes out. And what that does is it destabilizes the atmosphere. So, it doesn't take much for that rising motion to create more bubbly-type cumulonimbus clouds, thunderstorm clouds. And yeah, another round of severe thunderstorms possible later today. This is all part of the broader system that has brought, get this, over 85 tornado reports since Sunday. So, beginning this week, the Storm Prediction Center has this enhanced risk of severe storms across Northwestern Illinois today, and then you can also see that enhanced risk that stretches across portions of Oklahoma and Texas. Slight Risk. That's a level two of five for over 80 million Americans, extending all the way into southern portions of Michigan. But, this is our greatest probability of tornado threat today. That area highlighted near the Chicago region. And when we talk about how many tornadoes we've had to date, well, we have eclipsed the average year-to-date for the end of May. Just incredible to see what's happening. And again, this is going to continue right into the Memorial weekend. So, we talked to Ryan a moment ago. The airlines could be impacted by this. Certainly, the roadways. If we have rough weather, we start spawning off tornadoes. That's your threat for the day tomorrow. And then, for the day on Sunday, continuing through the extended holiday weekend. Look at this, Fredricka, an enhanced risk of severe storms across the lower Mississippi River Valley and into the Ohio River Valley. Once again, here is the storms firing up later this afternoon and then for the day tomorrow. This is that multi-day severe storm threat just worn in.",
