I'm John Berman at the United Nations with Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan, this is CNN News Central.All right. Happening now right behind me, the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are waiting to hear from President Biden in what could be one of his most important speeches here at stake, global support for the war effort in Ukraine. He is addressing this crowd just a few hours before Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The president of Ukraine will walk into this all for the very first time since Russia invaded his country nearly 600 days ago. Obviously, both addresses have major implications for President Biden implications here domestically as well as implications abroad. And for President Zelenskyy, as he is trying to hold on in his country, also such an important day, a dramatic moment for Presidents Zelenskyy but it will be before a diminished audience. Missing this week, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and for the second year in a row, Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping. Their absences and rising global tensions prompted alarm from the United Nations' director for the International Crisis Group who, \"the situation at the UN is now bleak. We are a lot closer to a cliff edge in UN diplomacy.\" With me here at the United Nations, CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche and CNN senior United Nations Correspondent Richard Roth. Kayla, the President will be walking in here any moment. What will he be saying?",

      "sentences": "We'll hear a lot of familiar themes from the president, John. The need for the global community to continue supporting Ukraine's defenses against Russia, the importance of democratic values in a world where authoritarian regimes are on the rise, and the priority of marshaling resources around the world for sustainable development, infrastructure and climate goals.And while all of those things are things that President Biden has talked about on the -- before and talked about on the world stage before, including just weeks ago with the G20, the backdrop of this speech is a little different. You mentioned the notable absences for many of those world leaders. That, of course, is casting a little bit of a pall on the audience here. There's some form fatigue because of the G20, COP28, APEC. Many of these multilateral summits are happening in succession in a way that hasn't really happened in the calendar before. There's also some war weariness with many countries, including those in the Global South, frustrated, that, essentially, the discussion around Ukraine they feel is taking much of the oxygen out of the room. And then, of course, there's the fact that President Biden is now a candidate for reelection. He's been on the fundraising circuit here in New York City before and after his appearances here at the UN. And he's also gotten some notable endorsements from members of the international community. I'm thinking of Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said throughout the summer that he believes that President Biden should and will win reelection. So, President Biden wants to essentially play the role of the leader of the free world when he takes the lectern here at the United Nations. That's what his advisers hope he will do and hope that he will be able to essentially retake the mantle of global leadership in the absence of many of those other leaders.",

They're primarily going to be having a discussion about how they can collectively counter the influence of China in the Indo Pacific.We also know that President Biden is going to be speaking with the Secretary General of the UN today. He'll be meeting tomorrow with the president of Brazil. They're going to be talking about labor issues. And then we'll also be meeting with the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, in their first meeting since Israel passed its controversial judicial reform laws. But perhaps the biggest meeting this week is not happening here in New York. It's happening Thursday at the White House, when President Biden is going to be hosting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Of course, they are trying to gin up even more support for tens of billions of dollars in new aid to Ukraine. We'll see if that can happen.",

This comes at a crucial moment for Ukraine as they are in the midst of this counter offensive. Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived here in New York last night. He was seeing meeting with some people here before this major speech today. With me now is former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and CNN military analyst Wesley Clark, also with me very shortly is my friend, CNN Anchor and chief national security analyst Jim Sciutto. Jim, let me start with you here. Look, talk about this moment for Ukraine. What Volodymyr Zelenskyy needs to leave here with and what President Biden wants to help him get this week? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR/CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Biden wants to continue international support for Ukraine, and that's going to be part of his message from the podium today. But President Biden knows, as do allies in Europe, as does Zelenskyy , frankly, that that is not rock solid right now that there's some, as you know, Republican opposition to continuing support at this level. It's not going anywhere, so has bipartisan support. But there is concern that the timeline is finite, particularly with an election coming up. There's worry in Europe, there's worry in Ukraine that there might be a change of leadership here that would be less friendly to Ukraine. It CNN is reporting that Vladimir Putin is hoping for exactly that outcome. And what that means is that, this next year, year and a half or so, no one is expecting one either side to get what it wants. They don't expect Russia to win, certainly, but they also don't expect Ukraine to gain back all the territory that Russia has taken. But they also don't expect either side to want to sit down at the table. Russia is waiting out the next election, and Zelenskyy does not want to give up, right, and he understandably wants to gain back as much territory as possible. So I think you'll hear a message from Biden as well to say, we got to stick with this right. I mean, that as long as it takes phrase you've heard for so long, we're going to be with him for as long as it takes. But privately, and I speak to senior US officials, I spoke to General Milley just last week, they will say, privately, we don't see a victory in this war anytime soon for Ukraine.",

But to meet in-person, to take his case to world leaders in-person that can make a difference. But he also knows that he has challenges here, right? Challenges in the US, challenges in Europe, and challenges at home. I spoke to the Canadian foreign minister last week, she made a very smart point. She said, we talked about political pressures here in the country, say Republicans who are opposed to say continuing aid. His biggest political bloc and pressure point are veterans in his country, and not just veterans but people who've lost veterans in the war.That's a powerful bloc. He's got to answer to them to say, what has this fight been for and are we going to give up where we are now after all this bloodshed and all this loss? And, of course, his answer to them is going to be no. And I'm certainly he's communicating that same message as he meets with world leaders here as well.",

And so, it's not just President Biden they're watching but they're watching what's going on in the US Congress. They're watching the dysfunction. They're watching a former president being charged with crimes. And they're looking at all of this and saying, how strong is the United States as credible as its deterrent? Can we trust the United States with the security of our country? And what about the American dollar? What if we put our faith in the dollar? So there's a lot riding on this, John.And I want to just say one more thing. I think it's been a persistent element of Russian disinformation since the President was elected, really, that he's too old. And, you know, he's only four years older than Donald Trump, and we keep making age an issue for this President. But really, both major contenders are in their 70s, going to be in their 80s if they're either one is elected in office. So, this is a time for American citizens to look at the performance. Not look at the numbers, look at the performance. President Biden's got a showcase this morning to demonstrate that. And the whole world's watching.

He, of course, is one of those Americans who had been imprisoned in Iran for five plus years and another American, Siamak Namazi, had been imprisoned for eight years. So, many of them have not spoken to their family and friends in over five years, as long as eight years. And so, this was a really emotional homecoming for them landing on US soil after so much time in Iranian captivity. Now, the President's Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens, who we just heard from there, he encouraged these Americans to take advantage of the Army's post-isolation support programs to better allow these Americans to reintegrate into society because, of course, they have been isolated and in detention for just so long. But he also said that he really encourages them to keep working, along with US officials, of course, for the release of American hostages globally, and that he knows that they won't forget about them. Now, in the backdrop of all of this, of course, there have been a lot of questions about what this means for the broader US-Iranian relationship, does this kind of reopen negotiations between the countries when it comes to other issues like the Iran nuclear deal, for example. Well, White House official, John Kirby, he spoke to this last night and he said, look, this release of American prisoners, release of Iranian prisoners in exchange, it does not signal that we are prepared to reopen talks on any other issue, particularly the nuclear deal.
