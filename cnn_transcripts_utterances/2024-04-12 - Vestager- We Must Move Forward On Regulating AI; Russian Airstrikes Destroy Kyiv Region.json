And in fact, this week, the Biden campaign announced a seven-figure ad by that includes abortion related ads that are going to be airing here in the state. All of this to try to galvanize that momentum. And the Vice President in particular is uniquely positioned to take this on. She started a launch, rather, a reproductive freedom store in January. She has been crisscrossing the country with this argument, the argument being that the overturning of Roe was directly tied to former President Donald Trump. And it's a message that she's going to bring here again to Arizona. Now, in talking to Democratic strategists, they told me, look, this state Supreme Court ruling is ultimately another data point in the ongoing Democratic argument about the consequences of a second Donald Trump term. But it is important in a state like this one, one where President Biden only won by nearly 11,000 votes in 2020. So, mobilizing voters is front of mine and they see the issue of abortion as what's going to get people to the polls.",

And this is, of course, how officials would like people to cross. And these are folks who will often go for the day and come back. And then this is the same site where they now have the CBP One registration and appointments. And those are folks who have decided to claim asylum and who will register through the CBP One app so as to get an appointment and meet with the sideline officers on the U.S. side after being screened here on the Mexican side by Mexican officials. Now, that is stepped up coordination between Mexican officials and U.S. officials. And it's all coming together as Mexican officials have also stepped up law enforcement on this side of the border. And you can see here, here's a National Guard's vehicle. We've started to notice perhaps some of the toughest enforcement on the border happening here on the Mexican side of things. And they're trying to stop things like this from happening, things that we saw play out just in the past 24 hours or so. And you can see this large group of migrants that crossed illegally, sometimes they'll scale using a ladder. Oftentimes, smugglers will even cut holes in the border wall so that they can quickly pass through. And they'll then continue on to be processed by U.S. officials so as to claim asylum in the U.S. But to stop them from even getting to that point, you've got now members of the Mexican National Guard. You've got members of the Mexican Army. You've got migration officials here on the Mexican side of things who have started posting along various points of the border wall. And even in some very remote areas, they have actually deployed troops and set up base camps, if you will, at the more popular crossing spots. And that's obviously to deter smugglers who are often backed by cartels from dropping off big groups of migrants and allowing them to enter illegally. But it's also to send a larger message to migrants in general that they should come through the more orderly legal way of doing things and that would be through the CBP One app registration. We often talk about folks on the US side who are frustrated, residents who live on properties that back up right up to the border with Mexico. Here on the Mexican side, we're seeing similar frustrations. In fact, we went to one private community where now we've seen National Guard members patrolling in a neighborhood, imagine a suburban private community that now has troops essentially going through. And that's at the request of those residents on the Mexican side who have said that they're tired of smugglers coming through, dropping off at all hours large groups of migrants using their patios and yards to then jump over the fence into the U.S. As of now, this seems to be holding. However, politics could derail this at any moment. Oftentimes, the Mexican officials can be frustrated when it comes to how U.S., either federal policy or individual states, is changing towards migration. And that, in turn, can add pressures domestically here in Mexico, a year in which they also are voting for their next president. And so, they're mindful that while right now the numbers seem to be reflecting a positive change in decline in illegal crossings, that could really change at any moment.

Think about how much more time there would be to see friends and family, run someerrands, decompress from work, and, you know, just get stuff done. Weekends might even feel more relaxing. And we do know that some companies are desperate to attract talent right now, and, frankly, keep existing talent from burning out. So maybe that's why KPMG found that 30 percent of large company CEOs in the U.S. say they are exploring shifts in schedules, like a four-day work week or a 4-1/2-day work week to address these very issues. I'm struck by just how high that figure is. And, listen, bosses, they would not need to sell workers on the wisdom of a four-day work week. Workers love the idea. A Gallup poll that found that 77 percent of U.S. workers support a four-day, 40-hour work week. That includes 46 percent who are extremely positive about the idea. It's hard to get 77 percent  of Americans' degree on much right now, but they're on board with this idea. Now, I did speak to KPMG US CEO Paul Knopp and he told me that we should tap the brakes a bit. He said it's way too early to say a four-day work week is definitely part of the future. He said, yes, companies will experiment here and there, but he thinks that widespread adoption, that could be years away if it ever happens. Still, there is some research supporting a four-day work week. Studies in the U.S. and Europe have found positive results, both for employee, well- being, and productivity. In the biggest trial held in the U.K., the vast majority of companies that tried a four-day work week, they stuck with it a year later and more than half made the change permanent.

But this debate has been around for a long time. And the reality is, according to the U.K. study, there it is, the results are in from the U.K.'s four-day study and absolutely it made sense to have a four-day working week. But it's not as straightforward as you think. You have to plan it. You don't just say to people, oh, take a four -- take a four-day weekend, what about that? No, you have to plan it. You have to work out what time people are going to take off. Is it going to be Friday's office? Is it going to be job sharing? Is it going to be some sort of annualized basis? And then you have to put in place proper plans for the person to make sure that whoever's covering them on their day off is actually doing it properly as well. So, it's not as straightforward or easy. But this study showed that when you do that, it works beautifully. When you put it in place, then productivity doesn't suffer. Employees feel better. Management is happier. It is a win-win situation. The only problem is getting people to understand this. And here in the United States, where they have a sort of a rather hair-shirt view on work is after all, you only get two weeks holiday a year and all of that sort of thing. I suspect this idea will be slacking off. Just look at how quickly the U.S. decided working from home wasn't going to be such a good idea. It's a really interesting question that deserves further experimentation and I think it'll end up going nowhere. A four-day working week. I'm sorry, I'm off. I think I shouldn't title to it.
