Ukraine's air force says Russia fired nearly 40 missiles and drones in overnight strikes on Odessa and Mykolaiv, hitting ports, piers, residential buildings and retail stores. One person was killed, dozens more were wounded. Russia has set up its aerial assault on Ukraine's southern ports since pulling out of the Black Sea deal this week. The E.U.'s top diplomat today called Russian attacks on grain storage facilities \"barbarian.\" CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Odessa with a look at the massive destruction. (MUSIC PLAYING) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT This city has ever seen anything like this since the beginning of this war. I can't overstate the terror that the citizens of this city have had to experience over not one but the last three nights. And it is no mistake that Odessa is home to Ukraine's most famous port. I want to show you some of the destruction from last night. This is an administrative building. It looks like it was around four stories high. You can see it has completely collapsed. We are told this is still a search and rescue operation. We know that at least one young man was killed. There were several people who were injured. You can see those firefighters, trying to put out the fires in this building, both in -- from among the rubble and up on that ladder up there. There are firefighters, rescue workers, there are volunteers and residents of this neighborhood, who are just trying to make sense of what we experienced last night. We are on the edge of the port, the biggest port in Ukraine, which we can't show you for security reasons. But that is almost certainly why, according to Ukrainian authorities, Russia has been carrying out these strikes on Ukraine. Now this attack started just before 2 am local time. It was a combination of drones and missiles. We could hear those drones very clearly buzzing the rooftops in downtown Odessa. I want to play you some of the video that-- sorry, we're going to get out of the way of this water. I want to play you some of the video shot by photojournalist Scott McQuinny (ph) of one of the explosions of the missiles here in Odessa, last night, take a listen.

They used four different kinds of cruise missiles. They used those Iranian kamikaze drones. Just the symbolism of what they used is sending a very large message to Ukraine. President Zelenskyy is saying it is very clearly Russia trying to target the grain infrastructure a few days after Russia pulled out of that critical grain deal. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And it is that one individual who carried out this 45-minute demonstration in front of the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm just a short time ago. He was seen on livestream in that demonstration, wiping his shoes with the Iraqi flag, at one point putting the Quran under his feet. But even before this demonstration began, it created ripple effects across the Muslim world. Hundreds of demonstrators -- and we have pictures to show you -- hundreds of demonstrators overnight stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad, setting alight a portion of the building. The Baghdad government, of course, issued punishments, legal consequences to some of those involved. But at the same time, as you mentioned, threatened to sever ties with Sweden. Those hundreds of protesters were followers of Muqtada al-Sadr, a very prominent Shia cleric in Iraq, who was outspoken on this issue. Because this same individual, the same man we are speaking of today just a month ago was involved in burning certain pages of the Quran outside a major mosque in Stockholm. And that set off a firestorm of criticism across the Muslim world, particularly because it was the Eid holiday at the time. It even looked to threaten Sweden's bid to join NATO at one point. So yes, a very small demonstration, a very singular action by one man but huge repercussions. And as you mentioned, Iraq has already taken diplomatic steps by recalling its charge d'affaires in Stockholm. It has expelled the Swedish ambassador in Iraq. Of course, we will stay tuned to find out what more happens and how this develops further.",

He took a shotgun to his place of work, a construction site in downtown Auckland, early Thursday and began shooting, killing two people and injuring several others, including a police officer. Police were commended for getting to the scene shortly after he began firing and ultimately neutralizing the suspect. He was found with a gunshot wound in an elevator shaft. Now every time that there is a case of public violence in New Zealand, thoughts immediately go to 2019, when a white supremacist terrorist attacked two mosques in the city of Christchurch, killing 50. This attack, however, was not deemed to be a terrorist incident; the killer was not deemed to be ideologically motivated by it. Police say it was an isolated incident and not a national security threat. So the authorities there in New Zealand believe that the game was OK and was safe enough to go ahead. And it did so. There are several World Cup teams at the moment stationed in Auckland, including Team USA, who was quick to state their condolences after the tragic incident, posting a statement to social media, reading, \"U.S. Soccer extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims who were killed in the shooting in downtown Auckland today. \"We are saddened by the inexcusable loss of life to gun violence and our thoughts are with the people of Auckland/Tamaki Makaurau and Aotearoa New Zealand.\" Now the games of the World Cup are historic this time around. More tickets have been sold than any Women's World Cup previously. And 32 teams will this time take part with Team USA, the favorites. We'll all hope that the shadow of this terrible incident Thursday morning will not loom too large over the competition -- Angus Watson, in Sydney, Australia, for CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We know that this soldier was dropped off at the main airport in Seoul by military handlers. He was actually set to be flying back to the United States. He was going to be removed from the U.S. Army after facing assault charges in South Korea. He was dropped off and two handlers dropped him at the airport. He then went through his gate. According to U.S. officials, he actually texted his handlers to say that he had made it to the gate, presumably to get on that flight back to the United States. But that's where his plans went awry. And as far as we can tell, that this new plan was of his own planning. He told folks at the airport that he had misplaced his passport, so that is when he was escorted out of the departure area. We don't know how he got from the airport to the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea. But he did get there. He was on a tour of the joint security area, which is between North and South Korea. And according to eyewitnesses, who, as you were saying, were on that tour with him and U.S. officials who have been briefed on the matter, that's when he sprinted away from the group and ran into North Korea. He ran between soldiers, according to an eyewitness. He was running so fast they tried to catch him but they couldn't. And when he got to the North Korean side, he went up to a building. The front door was closed. He went around to the back. And that is where officials from North Korea picked him up and put him into a van. And that's about as much as the U.S. knows at this moment in time. We asked State Department spokesperson yesterday, you know, what the U.S. knows about the well-being of this American soldier and if he's even alive. The United States really doesn't have those details right now. The Pentagon has tried to reach out to its counterpart in the North Korean army. They have not received any responses at this point.
