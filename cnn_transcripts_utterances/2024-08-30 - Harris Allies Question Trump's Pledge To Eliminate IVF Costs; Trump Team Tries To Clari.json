Also did not specify whether or not he is supportive of this ballot initiative in Florida. Would he support overturning it? How would he vote on that? It wasn't clear on that either and so it left this gray area.His press secretary tried to clean some of that up, releasing a statement saying, in part, President Trump has not yet said now how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short. But earlier today, this morning, our own John Berman tried to get some more specifics with his running mate. I want you to listen to part of that exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R, VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE): The president is simply saying he doesn't like six weeks. He obviously has said he doesn't like late term abortion. And I think he will make an announcement on what he actually wants to do on the Florida law in particular.

Big question there, one of the big questions there is how would this be funded, you know, where's this money going to come from? Trying to get more specifics on that from the campaign as well. All of this, as you may well know, is an effort to reach out to perhaps some of those people who have left the party and turned away from the former president with the feeling that the GOP is not sensitive to those who respect reproductive rights.And when you're in a state like Pennsylvania, any of the sweet, sweet states where it is simply too close to call, you've got to try to get as many votes as possible.

When Donald Trump, who was a Democrat, who donated to Kamala Harris, who donated to Democrats, who's actually have - who was pro-choice, who comes out here now and puts three justices on the Supreme Court that overturn Roe v. Wade, I mean, he's absolutely everywhere across the map, and the people that get lost in that are the women of this country. That's first.Second, there's not much for Kamala Harris' campaign to do. We're very clear. The campaign's very clear about who she is and what she stands for on this issue of reproductive rights, reproductive justice and reproductive freedom. That's not something that the Trump campaign can actually say. Let me give you two examples. One, all of a sudden out of the blue, he's going to pay for IVF treatments, right? He's going to make sure they get covered. He doesn't talk about how he's going to pay for it. And then the chief messenger that he trots out there is JD Vance? JD Vance, who had an opportunity to vote for this bill when he was in the United States Senate, and only two Republicans, Murkowski and Collins, if I'm correct, actually cast votes in favor of that piece of legislation when JD Vance did not.

She talks about making sure that individuals have a tax credit for the $25,000 down payment on their first home. She actually talks about a tax credit for those individuals that are building those homes or building 3 million new homes because she understands that we have a housing crisis in this country.And so there is a long list of policies that she talks about day in and day out on the campaign trail that she talked about last night with Dana Bash that she will continue to talk about, and she will continue to roll out new policies and plans. The irony in this whole thing is that there was a drumbeat for Joe Biden to get out of the race. And when Joe Biden got out of the race, the Republican Party, even some of their more seasoned veterans, act as if Kamala Harris is - they have a fundamental inability to deal with her as a candidate.
