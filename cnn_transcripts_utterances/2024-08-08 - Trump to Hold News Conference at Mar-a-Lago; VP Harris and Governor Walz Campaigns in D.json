      "sentences": "Hello and a very warm welcome, everyone. I'm Isa Soares.We are beginning, as you can see, the show earlier today, some 50 minutes or so, because at any moment we expect former U.S. president and Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, to hold a news conference at his Mar-a- Lago compound in Florida. As you can see there, the podium is set, is ready. We expect to hear from him shortly. Now, Mr. Trump has been absent from the campaign trail this week, sending running mate, J. D. Vance, to shadow the Democratic ticket in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan. We saw that happen live. We took a live at this time yesterday if you were joining us. Well, his week has been marked by a much talked about appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention and a rally in Georgia where he raised eyebrows within his own party by reigniting a feud with the state's Republican governor, even taking a verbal shot at Brian Kemp's wife. Meantime, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz are once again campaigning in Detroit as they try to shore up support for the Democrats among autoworkers in the state. And while we stand for that press conference, the start of that press conference or news conference, I want to turn to our panel, CNN Senior Politics Reporter Stephen Collison, Joe \t, a former U.S. congressman, a member of Republicans for Harris, and Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh. He's a former senior strategist on Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign. All faces that you recognize here on the show. Gentlemen, great to have you this evening. We are keeping an eye on that press conference. Apologies if I interrupt you in advance. But, Stephen, let's start with this, what we can expect. Because we do not know if this is a news conference, this is a remark. We know he's called a news conference, but often he calls it a news conference, but just remarks. We don't know where we can take questions from journalists. Just talk us through what we can expect here.",

      "sentences": "Well, you're right. We never know what we're going to get with Donald Trump. I think a couple ofthings to look out for, ever since there was this explosion of enthusiasm for the new Democratic ticket, the former president has seemed a little distracted and unfocused. He hasn't really hit on a good way to attack Vice President Harris and her new running mate, Tim Walz. J. D. Vance, the vice-presidential nominee, as you were speaking about yesterday, actually did launch quite a forensic attack on Harris, calling her extremely left-wing, and the economic questions that are very important in the Midwest. So, can the former president emulate that? Secondly, there's a lot of talk about whether he will reverse himself and actually agree to do a debate with Kamala Harris that he was supposed to do with Joe Biden on ABC News. Then he said he was only willing to talk on Fox. Now, we're looking to see whether the former president is willing to go to a debate on one of the big U.S. national TV networks. I think there's a growing sense that given the momentum of the Democrats, this is a debate he probably needs to take on.",

I at least have enough respect for you all and for the American people you report to, to come and talk to you, and to answer some questions. And so, I thought her reporters might actually benefit from that as well. So, had a little bit of fun I don't think the vice president waved at me as she drove away, but I'm glad to have done it.

Vance just in the last 24 hours, he's going to try to attempt to define Harris and Walz before voters critically make up their minds. Already we've heard both of them, right? We've heard them both say that Tim Walz, I think he said is -- was a crazy radical, comes from the far-left of the Democratic Party. I think he said that Kamala bends the knee to the far-left, also attacking Walz's military record. How should Democrats respond? How should they attack this criticism?",

And when we spoke the other day, one of thethings that I was talking about is the need for Harris and Walz to have a populist economic agenda, especially in those blue wall states in the upper Midwest. This race is really, at the end of the day, still going to come down to working class voters. And I think Harris has got to lean into her record, both of us as an attorney general and as vice president and lay out an agenda for the future. So, I think that's one thing you've got to do. The second thing is you've got to rebut these charges. I mean, this is absurd. The attack on Walz, it reminds me of the swift boat veterans from years ago. And it's no coincidence that LaCivita is inside the Trump camp, was the architect of that campaign. So, I think you've got to be swift and knocking that down. But on that front, I would just say the Republicans better be pretty careful. I mean, Donald Trump himself had five deferments during the Vietnam era and once for bone spurs. I mean, it's not as exactly as if the GOP has someone at the top of the ticket who served their country.",

I want to go back to our panel that we were talking to in just the last few minutes. CNN senior politics reporter Stephen Collinson, Joe Walsh, U.S. -- former U.S. Congressman and a member for Republic of Republicans for Harris, and Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh. He's a former senior strategist on Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign. And, Stephen, let me pick up with you. I mean, we don't know -- like you were saying, we don't know what to expect, but just speak to the timing of this because yesterday, I think it was Wisconsin, we saw J. D. Vance, and we've seen J. D. Vance pretty much solo for the last few days. Why isn't Donald Trump, you know, going to these campaign rallies with him? Why is that?",

I think presidential election campaigns are defined by big moments and it feels like we're in the middle of one of those with an energetic new Democratic candidate and vice-presidential nominee and an imperative for the Republicans to step back and really think about how they're going to take this on. Donald Trump has now been in the presidential politics game for a decade. There have been many occasions when it looks like he was fading and he's been able to resuscitate his campaign to push out a new profile to his voters, to inject energy. And I think this is one of those moments. Does Trump have the energy to pursue a much younger Democratic rival through those swing states for 90 days and an exhausting sprint? Is he prepared to do that? That is a big question. He's made this campaign about himself and his grievances. At this point, he really has to offer those swing voters in those states that are going to decide this election, I think a more positive vision to counter what the Democrats are now putting out there.",

So, I expect working it here, 45 minutes of complaining and whining and moaning about how he's being treated and how Kamala Harris is being treated, about how, you know, all the enthusiasm and the fake crowds and how the media won't treat her as tough as they treat him.

Well, that disciplined Trump disappeared when Kamala Harris came on the ticket. And I think they're flailing around. I mean, I can only guess he's going to come with the attacks. He's going to attack as they've telegraphed, Harris says illiberal, and there, you know, he may make -- he may make -- I think it's a huge mistake on his part.

When you get somebody elected, they're supposed to like you. He's not exactly for some reason, and you'll have to ask him about that. Yes, I'd love to see it get repaired. I think that if we don't win Georgia -- Georgia is a big -- is a big win, it's a big state. So I won Alabama by a record. Nobody's ever gotten that many votes. I won South Carolina by a record. You don't win Alabama and South Carolina by records and lose Georgia. It doesn't happen. And the people of Georgia understand that. There was tremendous anxiety and problems in Georgia. A lot of people say what happened -- and we have to -- all we want is honest elections. If we have honest elections in Georgia, we have honest elections in Pennsylvania, we're going to win them by a lot. (CROSSTALK)",

By the way, the New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice. They sent their top person to the various places. They went to the A.G.'s office. Got that one going. Then he went to the D.A.'s office. Got that one going. Ran through it. No, no. This is all politics and it's a disgrace. Never happened in this country. It's very common that it happens, but not in our country. It happens in banana republics and third world countries. And that's what we're becoming. We have no borders. We have bad voting regulations. Anytime you have mail- in ballots, you're going to have problems. France learned that lesson. You know, France had all mail-in voting and they went back to paper ballots, voter identification, voter ID. They went back to a normal system, one day voting. They don't want to be around, you know, voting for 64 days. And look, the election, I keep talking about November 5th, but the election really starts on September 6th. That's when it starts because it's early voting. We should have one day voting. We should have paper ballots, we should have voter ID, and we should have proof of citizenship. Please.",

Look at what's happened to energy. Look at what's happened not only to their cars, where gasoline's gone from $1.87, and we had moments when it was below that, but it's gone from $1.87 to $5, $6, and $7. And they take the Strategic National Reserves and they take it out, even though it's peanuts compared, it doesn't last long. But they're virtually empty now. We've never had it this low. And he's using that to keep the gasoline prices as low as possible. He's sucked all of the oil out, essentially the gasoline, to keep the price down a little bit and it's had very little impact. But you know what? We have no strategic national reserves now. He's emptied it. It's almost empty. It's never been this low. And I had it at a good level. And I would have had it more if the Democrats would have approved the deal. You know, I had a deal to buy it at $22 a barrel. And now, it's getting -- it's going to be close to a hundred pretty soon, in my opinion. And the Democrats didn't want to do that, but we bought a lot anyway. And we had it pretty good. And what they've done to the National Reserves, the Strategic National Reserves, as you know very well, because you cover it, but what they've done is incredible. They've just -- for the sake of getting some votes, for the sake of having gasoline, you know, that's meant for wars. It's meant for, like, tragedy. It's not meant to keep a gasoline price down so that somebody can vote for Biden or in this case, Kamala, who by the way is worse than Biden. And she's actually not as smart. OK.
