      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, we are seeing a series of events over the course of a few days where President Biden is really focused on outreach to the Black community. Earlier today, we saw the president meeting with the plaintiffs of the historic Brown v. Board of Education case, this case, of course, so historically significant because it deemed unconstitutional segregationist laws.And then we saw him head over to the Museum of African American History, where he talked about the significance of that case. And of course, this kind of outreach to the Black community is so important because the president is clear that this is a community that helped deliver him his victory back in 2020. And he's hoping that they will turn out again come November. And when we heard the president talking at the museum about the significance of this case, he said that as important as that case was and given its significance -- its significance just in the history of this country, he made clear that he believes that civil rights still remain under assault as he invoked his predecessor, Donald Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On Sunday, as you mentioned, he is going to be delivering that commencement address to Morehouse College, one of the preeminent historically Black colleges in this country, of course, is going to be a very high profile speech, given the discussions about the possibility of protests when he gives those remarks.And then he heads to Detroit, where he is going to be giving a speech at an NAACP dinner. Now, all of this, of course, comes as there is growing concern about the erosion of support among Black voters for the president, whether it is because of just a general lack of enthusiasm or concerns about the president's policies when it comes to Israel and the ongoing Israel Hamas war. Of course, this is something that the Biden campaign is very much hoping to turn around before November -- Brianna.",

Let's dive into the state of the race with veteran pollster and communications strategist Frank Luntz.Frank, always good to see you. We always learn things when we hear from you. Let's dive into this New York Times Siena College poll that found Trump had more than 20 percent support among Black voters in key battleground states. Now, it is just May, so he has to sustain this. But if he can, that would be the highest level of Black support for any Republican presidential candidate since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Why do you think Trump is right now doing historically well with Black voters? And is Biden in real, unreversible trouble here?",

      "sentences": "Well, nothing is unreversible because you cannot predict anything in this election campaign. I'm asked what will be the October surprise. It's that every week is going to bring us an October surprise.But specifically with Black voters, it's not all Black voters. It's younger Black voters and particularly younger Black men. I discovered this when I got off a plane at JFK when two baggage handlers came over to me to tell me that I don't get it, that they're going to vote for Donald Trump because they think they are being victimized the same way that he is. And some of these votes that have left Joe Biden over the last four years, it's because of Biden's weakness. In this case, young Black men see in Donald Trump the same kind of oppression, the same kind of persecution, the idea that Trump is a victim and they feel victimized by the system. And so they're endorsing Trump because of the fight that he's having. And I actually think it's possible that among Black voters, male Black voters under age 40, that even a third of them could end up with Trump in the fall. Make no mistake, Black women hate Donald Trump. But Black men are giving him a look, giving him a listen. And the younger you are, the more likely you are to vote for him.",

If I'm Joe Biden, I absolutely want to sit because he's at his best when he's seated and when he's working.If I'm Donald Trump, I want as short a response as possible because I'm not as well informed on the specifics. If I'm Joe Biden, I want as long a response as possible because it takes me longer to get to the point. That how these rules are determined will have a big impact. For example, are they going to shut their microphones off if Trump tries to speak over Joe Biden? That was critical in the last debate in 2020, and it'll be critical in 2024. I believe the rules are so essential this time, and what each candidate wants is dramatically different. Trump and Biden have very few similarities in terms of their debating, and they should be recognizing this. And frankly, I know that they've agreed to a debate, but I don't know how they're going to agree to some of these rules because, look, if the rules are for pro-Biden, Trump may not want to do it and vice versa.",

And that's going to be critical because we've never had a debate without an audience in a long, long time.And the other point I would make is what are the issues that are going to be discussed? If it's going to be social issues because you don't have two hours or 90 minutes on one issue. They're going to bring them all up. How much time will be spent on abortion? That's critical for the Biden campaign. How much time will be spent on inflation, affordability and immigration? That's critical for the Trump campaign.

But if his voice is not heard in these debates, and I've got to tell you something, every human being who has a television or who can get online is going to be watching. They're going to create drinking games. People who never watched politics before are going to watch this. But Robert Kennedy will not be part of that conversation.

I was just talking about what happened to him this morning. We're going to try and turn that for you.But in the meantime, what he said was his head is still spinning from what happened. He said he did not get his normal warm-up this morning. He actually stretched in the jail cell where he was taken after being handcuffed here in this video that was shot by ESPN's Jeff Darlington. He said he was fortunate to make it back out to the course where he did end up shooting five under. And he said this is all just a huge misunderstanding. He's expecting that this is going to get resolved quickly. So that is the very latest from Scotty Scheffler himself very calmly telling reporters that from Valhalla Golf Club there in Louisville, Kentucky. We'll continue to follow that. In the meantime, as a growing number of Americans sink deeper and deeper in debt, a new report finds about one in seven members of Gen Z have already maxed out their credit cards.
