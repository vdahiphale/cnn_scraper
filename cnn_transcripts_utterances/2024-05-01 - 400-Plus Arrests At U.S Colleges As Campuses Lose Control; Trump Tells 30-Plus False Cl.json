But look for words from President Biden on what's happening on these pro- Palestinian encampments, on defending the right of these protesters to exercise free speech, on the need to protect Jewish students, police arresting some students. And you won't find much.But what is unquestionably and politically painfully clear for the Biden campaign is that the problem shows no signs of going away. Tonight, CNN has obtained new body-worn camera footage showing the minute-by-minute view when officers entered Columbia University last night. And we're also watching Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where officers appear to be arresting protesters on that campus. So, where does this all go next? Joining me now to talk about this is Duke Professor Frank Bruni. He is a New York Times op-ed columnist and the author of The Age of Grievance. Frank, great to have you here, very timely subject for your book. I want to start kind of with the big picture here, because we've been seeing these images from the schools.

But I think a lot of this is about a larger culture in context and a way in which every disagreement in American life right now gets raised to or near the boiling point.And that happens because the opposite sides dig in. Nobody really wants to understand where the other side is coming from. We confuse conviction and confrontation. And then, as you saw in what Donald Trump was saying just then, you have various political actors come in to score political points, right? And they have no interest in calming the situation. They just want to exploit and inflame it. Right now, you have the right saying this shows an entire generation brainwashed by wokeness. And you have the left saying that this shows the dawn of an oppressive police state. It shows neither of those things.

I mean, of course, what's happening in Gaza is important and it's important to point out, when you have 34,000 dead, many of them children, that's notable.But one of the things about the protesters is that they don't want to talk about the complexity of the long running issues in this conflict. And you talk about how you tell your students, it's complicated. Right now, there's an allergy to complexity. BRUNI: There's an allergy to complexity, there's an allergy to nuance. It is really complicated. This is a difficult situation. We cannot condone or be silent about anti-Semitism, right? That's non- negotiable. We also do protect the right to free speech. And when protests are peaceful, that's really important. There's a grand tradition of that, and that's an important American value. Figuring out how to protect Jewish students and faculties, how to fight anti-semitism, but at the same time, how to protect free speech, that is not easy. So, we never say it's complicated. We never acknowledge it's difficult. What we're trying to do right here right now is difficult. I also think it's important to say, although this is spreading and we just saw Dartmouth and where I live at UNC, there's a big problem right now. We haven't seen this at Duke. We aren't seeing this on every campus. This is not an entire generation. This is not every college campus. This is not America going crazy or whatever. This is a particular situation.",

David is here with us. Hi. So tell us about it. Why this time and not maybe the last time?DAVID A. ANDELMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well I've been going over there to France, living there for 44 years right now. I'm nearly 80 so you know it's time for me to really look at what America is and my concern is that it's, I'm a deep believer in America, I'm a deep believer in democracy, but my concern is that the American democracy that I've grown to love over so many years may not long, may no longer be the core of the American system going forward after November. So I have to look at what is my alternative. My alternative for me is France and when I began writing this column for CNN this morning, you know the number of people I found who were really echoing the same sentiment, not only for France but all over the world, to Mexico, to Italy, to Greece, to Spain, to Portugal, an amazing number of people and even since the column ran this morning, this real estate broker we know very well in France who specializes in moving Americans to France, she got 45 requests for appointments.",

Why have these protests gotten to this point of not just tensions with the universities, but the accusations of anti-Semitism, the violence in some cases? How have we gotten to this point? STATE REP. ZOHRAN MAMDANI (D-NY): I think we've gotten to this point because for months students have been very consistent in their call, which is a call for the end of this war. They are concerned by the fact that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed and they've seen their universities as part of this war effort given the investments that many of these universities have.

The country is much more used to seeing this kind of protest than they were in 1968, when back then this was something that was really sort of the first time these kinds of big protests had occurred. I talked to my dad, who was an anti-war protester during the Vietnam War. One thing that he said that he would counsel the students who were in the middle of this to do, is they had to police some of the extreme elements that showed up at those anti-war protests. In his case, there were socialist worker party type folks who would show up and try to distribute things. They had to confront those people and move them out of the way, because they knew they were catnip for the media. If you want your message to get out, if you don't want to get tied up into some of the more extreme elements like we're hearing about right here, which I do not think are indicative of the entire protest, the protesters themselves have to police that, which will help keep the law enforcement from having to come in and deal with those elements.",
