And like all of these hearings are going to go, there's a lot of arguments that need to be made and the judge has to make some big decisions first before he ultimately decides how many years these individuals will spend in prison. And one of the things that is being argued is whether Jessica Watkins can be given a harsher sentence because these crimes amount to domestic terrorism.Now, we know that the judge found that that was the case for both Stewart Rhodes and Kelly Meggs, who were sentenced yesterday, the person at the very top of the hierarchy of the Oath Keepers, that's Stewart Rhodes. He got 18 years in prison. Kelly Meggs, essentially his deputy, got 12 years in prison. They were both convicted of seditious conspiracy, and also the judge found their crimes amounted to domestic terrorism. Now, Jessica Watkins, she is now being sentenced today. She was not convicted of seditious conspiracy but she was a person who was recruiting people to the Oath Keepers and she was also part of that military-style stack formation that moved inside the building. So, she did have a role in the planning. She was convicted of conspiracy. And so the Justice Department is going to be arguing now that they do think she should get a harsher sentence, because this did amount to domestic terrorism. The judge hasn't decided that yet but we're going to wait and see exactly what he does. And also then we will wait and whether she has to speak on her own behalf and whether she is going to express any remorse. We know that the Justice Department thinks that she doesn't have any remorse at this time. John?",

      "sentences": "At one point, Rahel, the line was to where I am standing right now. The TSA says today will be the busiest in terms of the numbers of passengers nationwide, although yesterday we saw that huge number, 2.66 million people at airports across the country, the highest we have seen since the pandemic turned down.We've seen numbers on Wednesday, numbers on Monday. Those were even bigger than the same day back in 2019 before the pandemic. So, it is likely that we will beat the TSA's estimate of 10 million people between Thursday and Monday, a bit of a conservative estimate. But the big question here is whether or not airlines are really up to the test. This is a huge test for them. After the meltdowns of last summer, the flight cancelations that were really roving from Memorial Day to Labor Day, airlines canceled about 55,000 flights in total. Airlines insist they are ready this time around. They are right sized. They're offering fewer flights, but operating larger airplanes and their right staffed. They've had about 48,000 staff members, workers since last year. And I've talked to passengers who say this is still really top of mind for them here at Reagan National Airport, and they're worried that there could be a repeat, although listen now, because they hope there isn't one.

Investigators, they're now honestly trying to figure out how it happened, how a man seemingly was able to open the aircraft door of this plane midflight. This was as the plane also was about to land. Watch.You can hear the wind just whipping through, ripping through the cabin. You can see the passengers there gripping their seats. Also, it's just oddly silent, but understandably silent, because that's how terrifying you can imagine this is. An official for the airline said that a man in the exit row appeared to open the door while the plane was 700 feet in the air. One passenger also said that she believed the man was trying to get off the aircraft and fellow passengers helped the crew pull him back from the opening. Let me bring in CNN Aviation Analyst Miles O'Brien for more on this. I mean, Miles, on several levels, this should not have happened and should not have been able to happen. What do you see here? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST:  Well, Kate, the key thing to know is these doors are like stoppers in a bathtub. They're plug doors, they're called. And when the plane is pressurized at altitude, it is humanly impossible to pull them in and push them out. They are sealed tight like that stopper in the bathtub. But when you get lower and the pressure is equalized, which it would be at 700 feet, that possibility -- it becomes a possibility for somebody to do this. So, it happened. Fortunately, nobody got hurt, and it's really part of a string of cases of passengers, they've been trying to monkey around with these doors.",

      "sentences": "So, to put a fine point on what you're talking about, this was about two to three minutes from landing. They're about 700 feet above the ground when the door was opened. If they were at higher altitude, this would not have been possible. This wasn't a mechanical error, you don't think, in your mind. This was just sheer physics, that this was possible to happen.O'BRIEN:  Whether that person knew that and waited to be that low, I cannot say, of course, but sheer physics will. I want this to be the takeaway for everybody as they're flying. This can't happen once the aircraft is pressurized. Because as it is pressurized at altitude, it pushes those doors in like a plug and you can't pull them open no matter how hard you try. So, that's the good news there. This incident happened when the pressure was equalized so you could open the door. So, I guess that boils down to passengers being very attentive of their fellow passengers, which it looks like is what happened here.",

Congressman, thanks for coming in.Real quick, since we heard from the White House today saying that right now the 14th Amendment is not even not going to be looked at, the president is not looking at as an option. Do you think he should in terms of raising the debt ceiling? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY):  I think that it was always a last option, not something that we should go forward. And I understand the president saying it may not cure the problem now because if you implement the 14th Amendment, you know that it's going to be appealed and you go to the Supreme Court and litigation would take place and so, therefore, the bills will still not get paid and our credit ratings would then be downgraded. So, it's still something that we have at the end. The best thing to be done here is for us to get a deal where both sides make compromise. I've been here 25 years, Kate, and that's what should have take place in a democracy, that both sides makes compromise, not what we heard Kevin McCarthy saying that their compromise was saying that they will raise the debt ceiling in exchange for some of their draconian debt cuts that they want to put to the budget. So, we need to make sure that we get it done. And I think plan B would be to get at least five Republicans, because everybody who is rational is saying that we cannot allow us to default on our debt. So, get five Republicans at least, and I know five of them that should be in New York that are very concerned, get them to sign the discharge petition with us so that we can make sure that we don't default on our debt and then we can negotiate the budget.",

But it comes time to put the country first, to understand the devastating effect it will have on not just Democrats but Republicans and seniors and even their people that they're trying to support, the rich, it will have deficits -- a problem and cause problems for them also.So, common sense says put country first, country first, and country first. And the Constitution says we must pay our debt. That's the Constitution. I mean, I see them talking about the Constitution on a number of other issues. Let's look at what the Constitution. Our responsibility is to pay our debt. And this has never happened before. And people ask me and some friends, am I nervous? I do have butterflies, Kate, in this situation, because.

But what I came out of the importance and the necessity of the dissent cable. Because what happened was the government did respond, and, in some cases, as was indicated in The Wall Street Journal previously, there were some things that the State Department was doing that the dissent cable was asking it to do before they even received the cable. So, there were things that were going on and I classify it as like a coach or a team. You look, you review, you watch the tapes, you have certain coaches recommending certain things, and the person who's the head coach makes a determination, ultimately, what you do and what you don't do.
