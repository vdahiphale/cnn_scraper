The Republican National Committee was considering -- I mean, seriously considering a resolution that would declare Donald Trump the presumptive nominee, and just like that. After we've only heard from -- remember, it has only been two states. We do have 50, and territories, of course. So, in essence, that would mean that Iowa, New Hampshire would get to decide who is the nominee, leaving everybody else, even those who wanted to vote totally out of luck, until the whole thing blew up in their faces, that is. Trump ally and RNC Committee man David Bossie withdrawing the resolution tonight. But here's the thing. A source tells CNN the Trump campaign had initially backed the idea, and the former president himself was, well, on board. Not surprisingly. Then all of a sudden, he changed his tune when the backlash began, posting on social media tonight they should -- quote -- \"do it the old-fashioned way and finish the process off at the ballot box.\" All caps, of course, followed by -- I mean, maybe Captain Obvious would have written that at some point in time. Of course, you follow the old-fashioned rule. It's called a democracy. But, you know, who am I? The Haley camp, not surprisingly, less than enthusiastic about the whole thing because she's still running. Quote -- \"Who cares what the RNC says?\" That's their quote. Going on is just the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, organized a debate in South Carolina. Let's go to CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten at that magical wall. Harry, look, you know the RNC was poised to declare Trump the presumptive nominee. This would really be unprecedented, of course, at this point in the race, right?",

If he has anybody running against him in a republican primary, say some crackpot who thinks that the aliens not only have been here but are coming back and bringing Elvis with them, the RNC has to be neutral unless the Republican Party in Louisiana, the two RNC Committee members and the state chair, all file a rule 11 letter.

There are Americans who are so frustrated with Joe Biden that they are willing to look at the Republican Party, give it an honest shake, after the Trump era. There are people who could not stand Trump that are willing to say, will this party make my life better? I have heard those arguments from Nikki Haley, and yet you have the entire GOP apparatus ready to act in the interests of the mafia boss.

I would say that the evidence in this case will show that Ethan Crumbley's mother, Jennifer Crumbley, didn't pull the trigger, but she is as responsible for the death of those four innocent students in that Michigan high school as her son is.It will show that even though typically a parent is not held responsible for the intentional actions of their children, there are exceptions to this rule. And in this case, the evidence is so overwhelming and so heinous that this is that exception. The evidence will show that this defendant ignored flashing red lights and waving gigantic red flags. The evidence will show that she knew her son had a very severe mental health issue. He complained to her repeatedly about hallucinating, feeling isolated, feeling alone, hearing voices, and having visions of using violence against others. It will show that despite knowing all of this, this defendant put her own selfish desires over the needs of her son. She would not take him to a medical facility, she wouldn't take him to a doctor or a hospital, but she found time in her schedule to have an affair outside of her marriage and to care for her horses. And if she had provided her son with the kind of time and care that she provided those animals, and the time she dedicated to that extramarital affair, those four students in that high school would be alive today.

In addition to that, Jennifer blame the school for failing to alert her. But what it comes down to very briefly are a few issues. One is foreseeability. Is it foreseeable that if you're this careless, that something like this can happen? And I think the jury could conclude -- could conclude that the answer is yes. It also comes down to notice. Are you on notice? Areva in her compelling opening statements quote that issue.There are serious maladies here and should you not as a parent have been aware of them and have addressed them, it's important.
