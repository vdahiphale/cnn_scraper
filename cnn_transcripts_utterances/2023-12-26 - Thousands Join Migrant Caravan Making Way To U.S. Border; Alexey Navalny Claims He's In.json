I'm Omar Jimenez in for Kasie Hunt.Thousands of migrants spent their Christmas in very tough conditions yesterday as part of a new caravan marching toward the U.S-Mexico border where authorities have been slammed by a weekslong surge in migrant encounters. This comes ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meeting with Mexico's president on Wednesday and as the administration grapples with what's become a persistent political problem for the president. So let's bring in Bloomberg national political reporter Christian Hall. We're going to talk about all of this. Christian, good to see you. So, President Biden -- he just spoke with Mexico's president on Thursday, and we've obviously got a series of meetings coming up with Blinken and Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas. What is the White House hoping to get out of this series of meetings?",

I'm sure that this conversation about border politics and immigration will be a huge part of 2024 -- the 2024 conversations.I mean, the GOP -- right now, they're really comfortable talking about immigration -- much more so than issues like abortion. I think that the large part of the Republican coalition is very unified on the issue and they've seen growth from Latino voters in recent elections. I also think that it's a little bit difficult for Democrats because they are trying to find messaging. President Biden is trying to find some type of messaging that will resonate with moderates who are concerned about the border, but also younger voters who are very critical of President Biden's positions on immigration and concerned that he might be moving too far to the right on the issue. [05:35:09] So, I definitely think that President Biden's conversation will try to give him an opportunity to find some more clarity as to how he can bring together his party on this issue.",

In Georgia, you're seeing that a lot of the president's standing on the economy isn't really resonating with voters.So he has a lot of reasons to be concerned. I think that the Biden camp, right now, is hoping that Trump becomes the nominee in 2024. And they believe that when voters get to the polls and they see it's an option between President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump the decision will be clear and they're going to go with Biden. Strategists are saying that might be a little bit of a passive strategy and that the numbers that we're seeing right now are alarming.

It was just a mix of people that were either loyalists to Ron DeSantis, outsiders, people who had worked with him in the past seemingly directionless with this very large super PAC which consisted of the same group of people, and they didn't seem to be working in tandem. All the money was in the super PAC. The campaign had run out of cash.But I think mostly, people saw Ron DeSantis for what he was -- a candidate that really wasn't ready for primetime. And there was a lot of hope placed in him, especially by the party leaders, that he might be the young, white knight who could come and take on Donald Trump. But it turns out he just doesn't really have it. Like, he doesn't have that charisma. He doesn't have that solid base that Donald Trump has. And also, it took him about -- I'm thinking about how many months it took him. Trump announced that he was running for president right after the midterm elections around November-December and Ron DeSantis waited until May and Trump just spent those months completely tearing Ron DeSantis apart. So by the time he announced his presidency -- his run for president, he was already suffering greatly. Because around the time that Trump announced, he was ahead of Donald Trump in the polls -- or at least in New Hampshire. So it's sort of just been a tumble for Ron DeSantis. But I think his campaigning skills, his lack of retail politics, a lack of defined message, a lack of charisma, his kind of disorganized campaign, a gang of rivals -- it's all created this soup of problems for a candidate that's now --",

OLIVA O'SULLIVAN, UK PROGRAMME DIRECTOR, CHATHAM HOUSE:  This is a hugely significant year for democracy and it depends how you counter or exactly what you classify as an election, but by some measures there are at least 40 national elections happening in 2024. CULLEN (voice-over):  In absolute numbers that's more than two billion people eligible to cast a ballot. Among those up for reelection, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is also expected to call a 2024 election. Taiwan, Indonesia, and Mexico are going to the polls, too, although their incumbents won't be candidates. And in Europe, hundreds of millions of voters will elect a new EU Parliament. O'SULLIVAN:  For many countries, the health of their democracy itself will be being put to the test. CULLEN (voice-over):  And the results have the potential to reshape international affairs on a scale rarely seen from international trade and climate change to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. CULLEN (on camera):  While the results of some elections are all but guaranteed others will be a genuine contest, meaning a relatively small shift in voter support could affect the outcome.

Purdy throwing a career-high four interceptions, three of them in the first half. He left the game in the fourth with a shoulder stinger. The Ravens would end up winning this one easily 33-19.
