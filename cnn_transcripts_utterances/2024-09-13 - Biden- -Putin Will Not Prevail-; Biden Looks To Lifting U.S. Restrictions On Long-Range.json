Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin will not prevail in Ukraine as he looks at lifting U.S. restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range missiles. CNN goes inside Gaza to the Philadelphi Corridor. A 14-kilometer piece of land that's crucial to ceasefire talks. And atomic ambitions. Kim Jong Un is photographed apparently inspecting a nuclear facility. And betting big. Gambling machine maker Light &amp; Wonder goes on a winning streak. We'll speak to its CEO, that conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Putin will not prevail. The words of U.S. President Joe Biden in the last couple of hours as he welcomed prime minister -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the White House. Now, one topic that's high on their agenda, the issue of allowing Ukraine to fire long-range missiles provided by the west on targets deep inside Russia. While a decision on lifting restrictions is not expected today, Russia's president has said ending those limits would put his country at war with NATO. But Biden seemed to take that in stride, stressing that the U.S. and the U.K. will continue to back Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I want to thank you for U.K. 's leadership in this front. The United States is committed to standing with you to help Ukraine as it defends against Russia's onslaught and aggression. I'm clear that Putin will not -- make it clear that Putin will not prevail in this war. And the people of Ukraine will prevail. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's a CNN military analyst and a founding member of CYFORIX, a global Cyber security consulting firm. Good to see you again as we continue to parse exactly what the Biden administration might do here. You know, this is both a political and a military decision. I want to get to the military decision first and something that I know you heard that Secretary of Defense Austin said a few days ago that, in his words, there's no one capability in and of itself that would be decisive for this campaign. So, in other words, it wouldn't be a game changer. Do you agree with him there? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, I do, Paula. It's great to be with you. There are certain factors, of course, that play into all of this. One of them is the weapon system itself. So, what you're talking about, the ATACMS system, which is the American system, or the Storm Shadow system, which is the British French system, those weapon systems would definitely take care of things within the 300-kilometer range, depending on the specific weapon system that you look at. But when you look at other factors, you know, as President Zelenskyy just mentioned in his interview with Fareed Zakaria, there are other areas that the Russians are using as bases that are beyond the 300-kilometer range, and that is really evidence of what Secretary of Defense Austin was saying that there are multiple capabilities that are needed to counter the Russians and to do these kinds of things. Now, what the other side of this is, of course, that the weapon systems that could have been deployed to Ukraine were not deployed in the way that they should have been in the timed manner that they should have been. So, the time frame here is definitely off when it comes to deploying western weapons, but deploying something with adequate training is definitely key to at least allowing Ukraine to maintain its capabilities and to maintain, frankly, its sovereignty.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. And that's precisely the key, Paula. One of the other things to remember about this is that the Russians believe that they arealready at war with the west, looking at the cyber activity at the sabotage operations that they've conducted in Europe, especially the targeted assassinations, they see the west as being a major enemy and they are conducting themselves basically using alternative methods, using asymmetric methods to go after western societies and western institutions. And part of that, of course, is you know, in addition to the cyber piece, the disinformation campaign that is targeted at elections, like the U.S. election, like the various European elections. So, when you look at the way the Russians are putting everything together right now, you see that they are gearing up for a prolonged conflict with the west. That is going to happen whether or not we provide ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles to the Ukrainians. But in this particular case, in order to safeguard Ukraine, it becomes essential that we provide them with the types of weapons that they need in order to survive.",

At the beginning of this conflict, at least the February 2022 phase of theconflict, I would have said probably the reverse that the United States was kind of leading things in at least part of that. But in this particular case, I think you're right. I think that, you know, as things have evolved, it's very clear that the Europeans have contributed a lot in terms of financial and military aid quite a bit more, actually, than the United States by itself. I -- and that is a significant aspect to this. The Europeans see this, I think, as a major threat to see the Russian encouragement into Ukraine as a major threat. The invasion has really changed the way they perceive all of the security arrangements. And what they are really trying to do is make sure that the United States doesn't leave them high and dry in during this period. They want the United States to be involved in NATO and to lead NATO, quite frankly. They also want to be able, from a military industrial base standpoint, to have the kind of military industrial base that will allow them to respond to the Russians. And that has proven to be a bit of a difficult situation because our industrial basin, by our, I mean, the western world's industrial base has not really kept pace with the demands of the Ukraine war. And that is something that is going to, I think, impact your defense budget. It's going to impact, of course, the overall defense fiscal health of both the European Union countries as well as the United States. So, this is, in essence, a major European country, although, outside of the E.U., Great Britain, saying to the United States, we need you to be involved and we need to work in concert from a strategic perspective to get the kind of -- achieve the kinds of goals that we need to achieve when it comes to stabilizing the eastern front of NATO. Meaning, at this case, stabilizing the war in Ukraine so that it ends in a way that Ukraine can stay and into the nation.",

We're going into the south bit of the Gaza Strip, which the Israeli military say they have under full operational control. But it's not entirely secure. They brought us to this place called the Philadelphi Corridor. It's emerged as a sticking point in the negotiations to get a ceasefire and to get the hostages released. As you can see, it's right up against the Egyptian border. And it's important because the Israelis say this is an area which has been used over the years as a way of smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip. Some of the smuggling has taken place over land, through presumably holes in the fence and through other border crossings. But a lot of it has been taking place right under our feet. OK. Well, this is one of those tunnels. It's right on the border with Egypt. And you can see, it is absolutely huge. Wide enough to drive a car right the way through it. The Israeli military say that this tunnel, because it's so close to the Egyptian frontier, has been used by Hamas and other militants to store weapons in and to fire rockets from. You can see here, the back of the wall, it's completely collapsed down. Apparently, it was closed for some time now. We're driving now through the neighborhood of Tel Sultan.
