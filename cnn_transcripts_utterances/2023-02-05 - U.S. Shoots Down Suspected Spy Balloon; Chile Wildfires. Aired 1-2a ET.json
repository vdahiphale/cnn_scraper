The balloon was so high up, nearly 12 miles or 20 kilometers, that it took a few seconds for the shockwave to reach the ground, have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES (voice-over):  The shoot-down happened Saturday off the coast of South Carolina near Myrtle Beach. It was a sensational landing to a saga unfolding for days, as the giant craft drifted silently above the American heartland. China is loudly protesting, accusing the U.S. of overreacting. Beijing continues to insist it was merely a civilian scientific balloon that blew off course. After studying its movements and patterns for several days, Pentagon officials say they are confident the lumbering craft was conducting surveillance. For now, many answers will have to wait until the balloon and its payload are recovered and analyzed. At last report, we're told the wreck along is lying on the ocean floor some 50 feet down, about 15 meters, and salvage efforts are starting to get underway. Oren Liebermann explains what the U.S. plans to do with the balloon's remnants. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Chinese official reaction to this has evolved.On Friday night, the Chinese foreign ministry expressed regret and said that this was a research aircraft that had gone off course, had been blown off course, and it was working with the U.S. to help deal with this. Now after you have an F-22 shooting the balloon down right off the coast of South Carolina, the Chinese foreign ministry is suddenly protesting this, saying, quote, \"China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and protests against the U.S. use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft. \"The Chinese side has repeatedly informed the U.S. side after verification the airship is for civilian use and entered the U.S. due to force majeure. It was completely an accident.\" Now as the Chinese government has argued, that this was a research meteorological balloon, the question is, which branch of some Chinese company or the Chinese government could it be from? We haven't heard any real explanation about that yet. We also know that China is very jealous about its own territorial sovereignty as it has made claims into what international courts of arbitration have argued are international waters, such as the South China Sea. China has accused other governments of infringing on its own sovereignty when, say, the U.S. sails warships in the South China Sea or flies planes there. So it doesn't seem to have a very steady leg to stand on when it is arguing that the U.S. shooting down a Chinese balloon over U.S. airspace infringes on Chinese property.",

WATSON:  Yes, I mean, there are so many unanswered questions here because not only have you had this balloon flying over the entire U.S. but now you have Costa Rican aviation authorities and Colombian air force saying, we're seeing something that looks an awful lot like the same balloon flying over our own airspace. There's been this statement from the Colombian air force, saying they're seeing an object at an altitude of more than 55,000 feet -- which is similar to the balloon that was flying over the U.S., at a similar altitude -- saying they're following it, that it doesn't pose an immediate threat. And we're also starting to see images emerging from people on the ground in Central and Latin America. And guess what, it looks an awful lot like the same balloon that the U.S. warplane just shot down over the U.S. A lot more questions about this. And you know, Michael, it brings another question. If, as the Americans have said, this balloon had solar panels and had equipment on it the length of three buses, why would China be sending such equipment, such technology, flying around the world and not have a way to reclaim it? It would just seem to be throwing away resources, throwing away money. So many more questions that, perhaps, we'll get an answer from Chinese government officials on Monday when they do their routine briefings.",

So it can actually spend a long time over a particular region. And with signals intelligence and electronic intelligence, or SIGINT and ELINT, it's about scooping up radio transmissions, radar emissions, microwave transmissions, everything that could be happening electronically in the air around those sensitive U.S. military sites, including significant numbers of nuclear missile ICBM silos. So this is an important area for the U.S. military. That Chinese balloon would have been gathering intelligence on SIGINT and ELINT emissions and it would be a useful way for that intelligence to then be sent back via satellite to the Chinese.",

So it would have hit the water fairly hard. We don't know just what shape the payload would be in.

They can presumably achieve many of the same goals. This was a provocative act. It was not something that they had to do. You know, they can argue they're responding to our own spyplanes and so forth. But the reality is that, in a context in which we have seen both parties move away from where they were, under Bill Clinton and certainly even Barack Obama, toward believing that we could coax China into becoming more of a model -- or at least a kind of participant in the international system or a responsible participant. Both parties are extremely skeptical of China. We see it in all sorts of ways. Even the Inflation Reduction Act and all efforts to move critical materials and production of EV batteries out of China back toward the U.S. And I just think this is something that is going to give more momentum to that cooling toward China, which really now has become almost a fully -- there's still a difference of degree between where Republicans and Democrats talk about China.

      "sentences": "The Federal Aviation Administration has now ended its temporary flight restriction, the restricted airspace that it put in place it says at the request of the Department of Defense, because apparently, of this shoot down of this Chinese spy balloon as it wafted over the coast of the Carolinas.This huge piece of restricted airspace twice the size of the State of Massachusetts, five times the size of the restricted airspace that's been in place post 9/11 over Washington, D.C. What was very telling about this one, this went into place about 1:30 pm on the East Coast on Saturday was that this was up to 60,000 feet, which the Pentagon says was the altitude that this balloon was floating at. That is very critical because the FAA simply wanted to clear out the airspace below and make it so there would not be a hazard to airliners which fly at roughly half the height of this balloon. The FAA put in place a ground stop as well because of that restricted airspace at three airports along the Carolina coast -- Wilmington in North Carolina, Charleston in South Carolina and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. Those airports were paralyzed for about an hour as the shootdown took place. It wasn't long after that all of these restrictions were lifted, although, this would likely go down in history as one of the largest pieces of restricted airspace ever. We have never seen something like this put into place and the FAA says, it was all at the request of the Pentagon -- Pete Muntean, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

All day, I've been watching my friend here, Jamal (ph), who is running this hot dog cart here. He had a hard time this morning trying to get it set up because his generator had actually frozen. The oil and gas inside of it. He had a hard time getting it set up. And he told me that business is a little bit slow today. Right? Not so good. Not many people out here in these cold temperatures. And just take a look. This bottle of water frozen solid. It has been frozen all day. That should give you an idea of just how cold it is here.
