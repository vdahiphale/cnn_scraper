And as you just heard there, also from the deputy Prime Minister, of course, also still those injuries or those wounds very complicated that those teams were facing. But, all this really was apparently on knife's edge for an extended period of time. We saw some of that video yesterday of Prime Minister Robert Fico being rushed here to this hospital in the northern part of Slovakia after being shot, being taken there by a helicopter.And what we're hearing now from the hospital here on the ground but also from the authorities, is they say that he required around five hours of surgery and that there were actually two teams who were involved in those surgeries, one of them being a specialized trauma team. Of course, one of the reasons why he was brought to this hospital specifically is because this is sort of the main hub hospital of this entire region of Slovakia. They do have an array of specialists who are capable with dealing with some pretty traumatic and some pretty complicated wounds, and certainly the ones that Robert Fico suffered, we're hearing from the authorities here, were extremely complicated, as they said, multiple gunshot wounds, requiring him to remain an ICU right now. They do say that the condition has stabilized somewhat. But, of course, it is still a very delicate one and a very difficult one, as the authorities have been saying. Fredricka.",

Reaction and condemnation of the assassination attempt is pouring in from around the world, including Russia. President Vladimir Putin calling the attack on Fico a quote \"monstrous crime.\" Fico, a Kremlin sympathizer, won a third term as Prime Minister last October after running a campaign that criticized Western support for Ukraine. CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is with us now covering that angle from London. So, what kind of reaction are we hearing from within Slovakia and around the world?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The Slovakia reaction has been very, very clear from the senior politicians, and that is there are political divisions in this country. Don't manipulate them. Don't put out fake information on social media or in the media, and don't act in anger. We can have political differences. That's a message that's emerging.Look, Fico had done sort of a foreign policy U-turn when he took over. Fred mentioned their decision not to send weapons to Ukraine. And so, that could have been one of the first sort of stump up and send fighter jets in the very early days of Russia's invasion. So, this is a monumental shift in foreign policy, but it's some of the domestic ways that the Prime Minister Fico had been trying to take control of the country, undermining the authority of the judiciary, removing the special prosecutor, removing that position completely. The special prosecutor was overseeing high level corruption and bribery cases of which some members of Fico's party are implicated, and remembering that he stepped down from office under a cloud and was later charged with allegations of corruption himself. So, there are elements here that really divide the population, the idea that the government should be wanting to try to take -- Fico's government should want to take more control of the public broadcaster. These are the things that officials are now citing were the reasons why this 71-year-old man from southern Slovakia actually shot the Prime Minister. So, I think in the country, the reaction is recognition that this is a Prime Minister who is divisive. There have been peaceful, big protests over recent weeks on the streets, and in the minds of government officials, and I think look to the President and her replacement. The President is sort of politically the polar opposite of Fico. The new President, incoming, is from Fico's party and really kind of cements that party's grip on power. But, both of them standing side by side and talking about, again, not rising up in anger, but the sense of frustration and anger on this -- that has existed over these changes, I think that's the root of what we're hearing more broadly coming from Slovakia.",

They have already signed a joint declaration to deepen their strategic partnership. Mr. Putin says he welcomes Chinese car production in China. The comments coming after the U.S. says it will hike China's tariffs. The two leaders are hoping to show the world that China and Russia are very close and are only growing closer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (Interpreted): Over the past 75 years, China and Russia have joined hands to build a brand new road of neighborly great power, mutual respect, harmonious coexistence, and win-win cooperation. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): For the past five years, despite the aftermath of the pandemic, there were some actions from third-party countries directed at containing our development.

We've seen so much military pageantry, but the photo op alone is a way for these two men to show the world that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are not only friends but that China and Russia share this view of a \"no limits\" partnership between these two nations. But, beyond that, it's also a snub of sorts to the West and to the United States.Let's talk about how this could evolve, how this relationship could evolve, especially when it comes to the war in Ukraine. We've noticed that Xi Jinping is taking a lot of care to not take a side in this conflict, saying that China is an impartial neutral party. We have seen Xi Jinping call for peace talks. We've also seen Xi Jinping, despite accusations by the West of providing military support, indirect military support to Russia, he has made these denials. There is a school of thought at least from one analyst I've talked to here in China that perhaps Xi Jinping is going to try to take this relationship to China's favor and perhaps even trying to broker a peace deal between China and Ukraine. Let's listen to some remarks incurred from Xi Jinping from earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JINPING (Interpreted): The Chinese side looks forward to the early restoration of peace and stability on the European continent, and will continue to play a constructive role to that end.

If we look back to 2018, before the pandemic, when we look at Russia-U.S. trade in U.S. dollars, about $107 billion. Well now, last year, that has more than doubled to $240 billion, and a lot of it is because Russia has been cut off from the West. So, what's happening is that Russia is buying key Chinese consumer goods, things like cars, like phones, and Russia in turn -- or I'm sorry, China in turn is buying things like fuel and energy from Russia. So, it's very much a mutually agreeable relationship in every sense of the word, strategically, militarily, philosophically, and of course, economically.",

The Israeli military spokesman Colonel Nadav Shoshani said that the soldiers were operating in a quote, \"dense and very complicated area\". This is an incident that the Israeli military is indeed expected to further investigate.All of this comes, of course, amid very intense fighting in the area where these soldiers were killed. That's the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. And what's especially significant about the fighting there is that Israeli troops battled Hamas there in the early days of the war, some of the most intense fighting, but after they believed that they had defeated Hamas in that area, the Israeli military withdrew from there. And now, months after that withdrawal, Israeli troops being sent back in there because Hamas has sought to re- establish a foothold. General \"Herzi\" Halevi, the top Israeli general, saying that the Israeli military is increasing pressure on Hamas in Gaza, in particular in Jabalia, and he said that the Israeli troops will not allow Hamas to rebuild itself.",

The United Nations will be receiving the assistance on land in Gaza and handling the distribution of it. And we'll see the number of trucks that they can work up to. We're told that this could be around 90 trucks a day at the beginning of this process, and perhaps even rising all the way up to 150 trucks per day. That is very significant in terms of the kind of aid that could get into Gaza, particularly at a time when we have witnessed that the Rafah border crossing between Israel -- or rather, between Gaza and Egypt has been closed for the last week and a half now. That reopening of that crossing is being stalled amid ongoing negotiations between Israel and Egypt following an Israeli military offensive that captured that crossing last week. And so, there is no question that this is a moment where more aid crossings need to be opened, more aid needs to be getting into Gaza, and certainly this pier and this new maritime route will certainly contribute to upping the aid at a time when it's most needed.
