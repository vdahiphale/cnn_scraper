Deadly strike at least 10 lives lost, dozens injured after a Russian missile attack in Eastern Ukraine. Russian shelling intensifying is Kyiv claims its counter offensive is making progress. We've got the very latest coming up. Plus, flight fright, wicked weather in the U.S. northeast triggering travel chaos coast to coast. More than 9000 flights canceled on Tuesday alone. Dense smoke from Canadian wildfires once again not helping either, today's flight outlook just ahead. And then the central summit Central Bank heavy hitters, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and European Central Bank Head Christine Lagarde sit down for a panel discussion at a conference in Portugal, later this hour. We're on - - surprise watch looking for comments on things like interest rates of course, and the inflation outlook. And as investors wait for signals, U.S. stock market futures are softer after Tuesday's broad based rally the S&amp;P 500 in fact notching its best session in two weeks, and the DOW closing in the green for the first time in seven sessions. Although U.S.-China tensions creating a chip dip this Wednesday amid reports that the U.S. is mulling export curbs on sophisticated artificial intelligence related chips to China. Industry Leaders in video and other chip names like AMD lower in pre-market trade and a mix at the stock markets over and across Asia amid weaker Chinese data industrial profits. That's company's profits sinking almost 20 percent year over year, Beijing perhaps needing to show a friendly face to overseas business amid the economic uncertainty. And well, President Xi Jinping pledging today that China will protect the rights of foreign investors. We discussed the outlook and the opportunity with the CEO of HKEX which owns the Hong Kong stock exchange. Later this hour a busy show coming up as always. We do begin though in Ukraine and the country's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling the deadly strike on Kramatorsk, \"a manifestation of terror. Two Russian missiles struck the Eastern city on Tuesday one hitting a busy city center, the other village nearby. Among the victims a baby and these teenage twin sisters who had just graduated from the eighth grade. Ben Wedeman is in Eastern Ukraine for us this morning.

      "sentences": "Well, two different accounts of events. And I think this is part of what's fueled the flames of the angeras quickly as it has is the existence of that video that you just showed Julia. Over the last few years there have been several high profile cases here in France of a traffic stops or identity checks leading to violent confrontations between the police and often unarmed civilians. As was the case here young Nael was just 17 years old. He and two other passengers were pulled over that police check, moments later, he was fired on. And there seems to have been some discrepancy with what police sources were telling us earlier in the day. And what then emerged from close examination of that video now. One of those police officers is now in police custody and solid suspicion of voluntary homicide. We understand that his questioning has just been prolonged. But even as that investigation begins, this suspicions the fear of the people who came out on the streets last night. As they have when there have been incidents like this in the past is that the hope of the police had been that their version would be police believed and the video would not exist. In fact, what we are expecting here in France tonight is no doubt even more unrest. Certainly, Julia, that is what officials are preparing for 350 policemen were deployed to Novatel that suburb to the northwest of Paris, where the incident took place and where the unrest then followed over the course of the night. What French authorities are preparing for tonight is the deployment of some 2000 police officers in several suburbs across Paris in anticipation of what they expect will be more anger at this incident. And again, in the context where there have been far too many examples of overzealous police brutality or indeed lethal police intervention when those involved have been unarmed. And it has happened all too often in those suburbs of Paris that are least well off. That video is certainly what's driving that anger as is of course the age of the young man just 17 years old, Kylian Mbappe the French soccer jar so are weighing in with that tweet and speaking of his sadness for his country, others for elder French actors calling for justice for this child. He was just 17 years old. His mother is calling for a march tomorrow in his name, Julia.",

But the question now is whether or not the airlines can piece itback together by Friday, when they're expecting so many people to travel by air here in the U.S. The TSA anticipates 2.8 million people to pack on their commercial airliners on Friday. It's the highest number we'll likely see since the start of the pandemic. But we know that when the deck of cards, comes tumbling down and that really started to happen on Saturday at airports on the East Coast. It takes days for them to piece it together. So what we're watching right now is really the recovery. Just check flight aware 696 flight cancellations nationwide here in the U.S. more than 1200 delays. That's only about a third of what we saw yesterday, but the day is still pretty young. In fact, those three ground stops at the New York area airports yesterday really incredible. In fact, at one point at LaGuardia, they had no space to put planes at gates. It was almost gridlock on the ground, according to an FAA alert, putting planes in pretty much any nook and cranny of taxiway that they could find. The delays and cancellations today look a lot like they did yesterday, Newark, LaGuardia, JFK, Boston and Chicago O'Hare. Those are the top airports. Right now United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby says this is simply the FAA's fault. It's mostly because of air traffic controller shortages, he said really snowballing on top of weather. And that started on Saturday, continued into Sunday. And then we've seen what's happened on Monday and Tuesday. So we'll see now if the airlines can pull out of the dive but it's United Airlines, but has really taken it on the chin so far about 300 cancellations by United for its flights nationwide. Today, we're talking about 1 in 10. But they still pretty young here, Julia could rise even more. And by the way, this is having an impact on international flights. We heard from one passenger who was simply trying to get from New York to South Africa. That's a big route for United Airlines had to sleep on the floor to wait for her flight to finally come in. It's really having a snowball effect here, Julia.",

The launch of a new platform that will allow investors to trade Hong Kong listed stocks, like Tencent and Alibaba, in both Hong Kong dollars and the Chinese Renminbi.

Then, by the beginning of the second quarter, what we started seeing that the manufacturing sector was having a bit of a slowdown, and that cooled down some of the expectations. And now I would say that most of the analysts fall in the range of 5 to 6 percent. Of course, as you might expect, geopolitics play a role into what's happening. And depending on the day, there is some announcement one way or another and that moves the market. Then, when we combine that also with what's happening around the interest rate environment than the expectation at the beginning of the year that interest rates were going to continue going down.

Historically, Hong Kong was a market where mostly international investors would go to invest in mostly Chinese companies. And as of March of this year, the regulatory bodies in the Mainland, what they did is they are allowing investors from China, from the Mainland, that this huge set of investors, as I mentioned, that's like 1 trillion Renminbi per day to invest in international companies. And international companies, the only condition is that they need to be listed in Hong Kong. So that opens a whole world for that investor base from the Mainland, to be accessible to any company around the world. So a company that lives in Hong Kong can not only have all the investors those international investors that traditionally invest in New York, in London, or in Hong Kong. I mean, they're all you know, available, but also the domestic investors that can only invest in the Mainland and in Hong Kong, so you get the best of both worlds. And you can do this in one international market with like common law and the entire regulatory environment that international investors and issuers are very used to.

If you've not heard of ChatGPT or Generative AI in the last few months, well, well dodged, but mostbusinesses just can't avoid it, whether small or large. The question of how to harness and utilize it to get to competitive edge with clients is key. Step forward, Databricks. It's data storage and management startup that's now doing lots of deals that it says will enable clients to build low cost language models trained on their own data, rather than perhaps taking it from somewhere else. The idea is that it will make the process easier, cheaper and quicker. The company says it serves over 50 percent of the Fortune 500 companies today. And that includes the likes of AT&amp;T, Shell, and Walgreens and Warner Brothers discovery, of course, the parent of CNN. And this week, it organized a special data AI summit in San Francisco to discuss the lightning speed of recent developments, among a few other things. Ali Ghodsi is the Co -Founder and CEO, and joins us now, Ali; you've clearly been very busy. And we have lots to discuss. But I want to start simple. And then we can add the layers. What does Databricks provide to its clients today? ALI GHODSI, CO -FOUNDER &amp; CEO, DATABRICKS: Yes, it's very simple. So this world of AI really only exists, thanks to the data that you feed it. But believe it or not, the world of data and AI has been separate. So big, large enterprises, they would have to buy separate data software called data warehousing, and separate AI software called data lakes to make this work. And what Databricks has done has been able to unify these two so that you can get your data and your AI in one place. And that's all the rage now. Everyone wants Data and AI together because everybody wants to build their own; you know generative models, large language models and these kinds of things.",

Why is it so simple for you to do this, when we see big companies outsourcing some of the data training and the models to other people? Why are you able to do this and allow smaller companies and big companies to use their own data to train AI?",

The AI technology came out of companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter. And the folks that started Databricks, my co-founders, we were researchers at UC Berkeley, which receives a lot of its funding in the 2000s, from Silicon Valley Tech Company. And we got to see what they were doing in the early days. And what they were doing is they were combining the data with the AI and that's how we're doing these magical things. So we want it to simply just take that, democratize it, bring it to everyone. So it's just you know, we had slightly different routes, we were sort of rooted in Silicon Valley Tech. Whereas this old, old school data warehousing comes from, you know, much more older technologies that Oracle, actually frankly had invented.",

But also then starting to train your own models, and then start asking them questions about the future. And it turns out, if you want to do it for specialized tasks. So a lot of large enterprises, they have a specific problem, they want to solve really well. Then the off the shelf model to ChatGPTs and those things don't work as well. So they have to build their own specific model for that use case. And that's what the latest acquisition is about. So we're very excited about that.",

If something goes wrong, we'll have all the millions of researchers around the planet that don't understand that. And for that, we have to democratize this data, and this AI, so that's why we frankly did this acquisition of MosaicML, because they really democratize so that everyone can build their own. Every organization will be able to build their own machine learning models and understand what's going on with them. And then researchers can go in and delve in and see why is it answering it this way? Why is it doing that? The better we understand them, the better we can deal with it.
