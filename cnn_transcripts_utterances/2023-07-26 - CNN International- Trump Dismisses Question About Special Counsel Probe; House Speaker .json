He's directly threatening President Biden with impeachment. CNN's Melanie Zanona explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, House Republicans are inching closer to an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Speaker Kevin McCarthy this week issued his most explicit threat yet against Biden claiming that he was engaged in a foreign bribery scheme to benefit his son Hunter Biden. These are claims that the White House has furiously denied and in which Republicans have yet to provide any evidence of, but it has fueled new momentum on Capitol Hill. Let's take a listen to Kevin McCarthy. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: The word of this continues to unravel. It rises to the level of an impeachment inquiry. What that simply provides is that the American public has a right to know. And this allows Congress to get the information to be able to know the truth.",

Sources told me and my colleague Manu Raju and Annie Greer that in recent weeks Kevin McCarthy has been hearing from top Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill that he should be prioritizing a Joe Biden impeachment especially over the impeachment of a Biden cabinet official.Republicans have really been all over the map with their calls to impeach. From calling to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. But in recent weeks Republicans have started to realize that they're going to have the political capital and the time to do multiple impeachments. And so, the thinking goes, according to top Republicans, is that they might as well just go after their top target which is Biden. But nonetheless, not all Republicans are still sold on this idea. There are still moderates in the party who are deeply concerned about how this could backfire in the midterms. In fact I'm told that issue was raised in a private leadership meeting between McCarthy and some of his team on Tuesday evening. So if and when Republicans decide to go down the route, it's going to be a complicated sales job. Melanie Zanona, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Let me set the scene for you.The property that I'm on belongs to the Orbina family. They have 352 acres and there are gates like these that give them access towards the river. But take a look, they are barricaded, they claim by the state of Texas. You can see concertina wire. This is a burn that was created, according to them, by the state of Texas. Now beyond that, there are several layers of border barrier before we get to the buoys. These buoys are at the center of this legal battle between the U.S. DOJ and the state of Texas. The U.S. DOJ filed suit against the Lone Star state saying that these buoys were deployed unlawfully. That the state of Texas did not get the proper permits from the Army Corps of Engineers and that it could create a diplomatic situation with Mexico. Mexico's top diplomat complaining to Washington saying that this violates two treaties between the two countries. Well, Governor Greg Abbott digging in his heels saying that the state of Texas has sovereign authority based on the Texas and U.S. Constitutions. And the office of the Texas Attorney General saying that they are ready to duke it out with the U.S. DOJ in federal court. Now one of the concerns from the U.S. DOJ is the humanitarian risks, the public safety risks. Take a look at this video. We were on the Orbina's property when a woman was being tended to by paramedics. Now you look at that video, that woman is being rendered aid. The Orbina's told us the story. They say that this woman was by the Rio Grande and asking for help. Law enforcement had to cut two layers of concertina wire to bring her towards the paramedics. They also had to cut through chain link fencing. Now the property owner says that they witnessed as migrants have died on their property and they want the dying to stop. In this federal lawsuit between the U.S. DOJ and the state of Texas, the U.S. DOJ is asking Texas to remove the border buoys. Well, the Orbina family is also asking the state to remove the concertina wire from their property. And they say that Texas so far has refused. Now CNN has reached out to the state of Texas for comment and has not heard back. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt perhaps to reach out to the opposition again, said that he was open to dialogue and there shouldn't be a problem in reaching agreements ahead of the next kind of legislative onslaught which would be expected around October/November.The opposition believes that there is no point really in negotiating with this government because it hasn't done so in good faith on this part of the judicial overhaul and therefore in any way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the opposition leader Yair Lapid, is not really in charge. He's beholden he says to the more extremist elements in his coalition. So, yes, plenty more scope for more laws, for more protests and more potential damage to the economy -- Max.",

Every summer the dollar amounts go up and up, but this year the numbers being discussed are absolutely ridiculous.Could it be that the French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe is off to Saudi Arabia where he will be paid over $700 million? Maybe. So how did we get here? Well Mbappe was already a rising star when he made his debut for Paris Saint-German at the age of 18 back in 2017. He was a world champion with France the next year. Since then, he has won five league titles and numerous cups, but PSG have never won the European cup. And at times his relationship with PSG and their fans has been rather uneasy. Two years ago when he was yet to sign a new contract, he was heavily linked with a move to Europe's most successful team Real Madrid. And this is what he said to CNN's Becky Anderson back then, she asked if he regretted saying that he wanted to leave. KYLIAN MBAPPE, PARIS SAINT-GERMAN STRIKER: I don't even know because I was honest. I gave a feeling. I gave what I have in my heart. And I think nobody can say something about it because it is a feeling, it is personal. But of course I'm happy to stay.",
