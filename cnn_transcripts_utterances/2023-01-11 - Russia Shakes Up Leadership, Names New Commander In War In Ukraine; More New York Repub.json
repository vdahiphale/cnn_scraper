      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, Putin's purge. The Russian president suddenly replacing the general overseeing his war in Ukraine, just as the Russians appear to be on the verge of seizing the town of Soledar. Why the major shake up?Plus, resign. More Republicans tonight calling for Congressman George Santos to step down after he lied about his resume. But McCarthy won't show him the door. Is this a big issue for the GOP? Republican Governor Chris Sununu is OUTFRONT. And is Trump about to get back on Facebook? Our Donie O'Sullivan has new details from Facebook insiders on how the company is making this decision. It is a story you'll see first here tonight OUTFRONT. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Putin's mysterious shakeup. The Russian president suddenly putting in a new general to oversee his war in Ukraine. And there is a huge question tonight which is why what is this all about? Because it comes as Russia claims its forces are on the verge of seizing the town of Soledar. CNN is there, has heard the heavy artillery fire. We're going to show you in just a moment. It is artillery fire that has decimated an entire town. Let me just show you some new before and after pictures just into our field team on the ground. Here you can see a neighborhood with homes and apartment buildings. Let me show you now. Look at that. Nothing there. Only the outer shells of buildings remain. And let me show you another one, homes and a school to the right. A small town, now gone. Everything has been destroyed. And the fate of this town that you're looking at right now, Soledar is at the heart of this mysterious move in Putin's military command. Here's what we know happened. The head of the brutal Wagner group Yevgeny Prigozhin posted a picture on telegram along with the claim that his forces, this private paramilitary group have taken control of the, quote, entire territory of Soledar. Now you'd think that the Russian military would be happy to hear that. But, no. They denied Prigozhin's claims. A top Kremlin's spokesperson saying this morning Soledar is not yet in Russian control, that there's only a positive trend. It is an odd, conflicting message in a time of war. It's a mystery, a sign of something much deeper. And it appears to be at the center of Putin's general shakeup, because the man that Putin has now picked to run his invasion, General Valery Gerasimov, is backed by the Russian military establishment which has failed so miserably in so many parts of this war, backed by Putin's minister of defense Sergei Shoigu. And the man that Gerasimov he is replacing, General Sergei Surovikin, has the backing of Yevgeny Prigozhin of the Wagner Group. So, tonight, in this play, this chess game, it is advantage Shoigu and this duel between him and Prigozhin for the ultimate power in Putin's -- military power in Putin's regime. And as they duel for power, the battle on the ground in Soledar rages, and Russians are dying, a lot of them. It is a grim death toll taking a major toll on the Russians alive still fighting. Listen to this. Here's a new intercepted call that Ukraine's defense intelligence says is from a Russian soldier. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Well, word on the street is they're shipping us back to Russia to be reshuffled into new formations. They're saying that after that, they ship us to the Kherson area. I think that, (EXPLETIVE DELETED), if everything works out there in Russia, then I'll (EXPLETIVE DELETED) never come back. I'll try to dodge, I'll take my (EXPLETIVE DELETED) to Pechenga, for (EXPLETIVE DELETED) sake. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

And, General, I appreciate your time. You know, when we were showing those before and after pictures, one thing that I hope stands out to people is the size of Soledar. This is a small town. This is not a big city. It is a small town. It is a town obviously almost entirely destroyed, I would go as far as to say it is completely destroyed in terms of being able to live there. Is there strategic advantage to controlling it? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  There is no strategic advantage to this. This is a personality class within Russia. The Ukrainians realize that in order to take back territory in the Donbas, they cannot allow any further advances by the Russian army, or in this case the Wagner Group under Prigozhin. But one of the lessons they teach you in the war college, Erin, and it's true in any organization, personalities matter. And when you have the kind of clash of personalities you see in the Russian army with Gerasimov, Surovikin, Prigozhin, Mr. Putin, they are having problems getting advances all along the front that they sought to obtain from the beginning of this war. Soledar is not a strategically important town. Bakhmut to the south of Soledar is also not strategically important. The Ukrainians have defense all around those areas. They don't want to give up an inch of ground. So they are going to fight. And, truthfully, this may become a tactical victory. Prigozhin's Wagner troops may eventually gain the town of Soledar. But if they do, it may be a tactical pyrrhic victory and it's a strategic success for Ukraine holding for so long, much like Mariupol.",

And Prigozhin actually showed his teeth. He showed that he wants a piece of the action, wants to be in power. But Putin ultimately had to take the side of the anti-Prigozhin establishment, which is the military establishment team, the Shoigu team, the Gerasimov team.

And Donald Trump is a voice of the party. He has an influence in the party, there's no doubt about it. But it ain't getting any better, right? So, that's why you're going to see more people jump into the race. He announced he was running for president at his weakest political point. He then made a bunch of horrible missteps with, you know, having dinner with Kanye or Ye, whatever we're calling him now, and the white supremacist.

Ron DeSantis as of now -- look, he's got a record in his state -- but there's one thing he seems to be emphasizing. And it is this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  I view the wokeness as a form of cultural Marxism. This wokeness will destroy this country if we let it run unabated. Unfortunately, the woke mind virus has infected a lot of institutions in our country. We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the schools. We fight the woke in the corporations.

But I'm a free market guy. I don't think the government should be here trying to fix everything. If a business wants to be woke, I don't agree with it. I completely disagree with it. But it's not up for the government to come in and punish a business or penalize a business, because now you're setting a precedent for Democrats to come in. And when they take the reins of leadership to penalize a business for being too conservative, that's crossing a very, very slippery slope. So, I think Ron is good governor. I think -- you know, we agree on a lot, but we have very different styles. And this issue, we both very much agree that we have to push back on this woke stuff crossing a lot of different boundaries. In public institutions, absolutely, that's my charge in terms of managing government. But when you start penalizing individuals or businesses, I think the free market will take care of that. If people don't like what Disney's doing, they're going to stop going to Disney. If people don't like what Blackrock or Bank of America is doing, they're going to stop utilizing those types of services. Let the free market rein.
