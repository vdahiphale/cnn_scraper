So, the $6 billion that's currently Iranian currency that is in South Korean accounts, the expectation is that it would be moved to another restricted account in a different location. Essentially where it would be more accessible to the Iranians. Still limitations on them only using that money for humanitarian purposes.But then there's also the expectation that there is going to be a prisoner swap as part of this deal with the Iranians saying that there are five people in U.S. custody who are expected to be released. We haven't seen that yet. That's one of the aspects that we'll watch for. But it's very clear that there are a series of agreements that are expected to pay out -- play out in the coming weeks. And the National Security Council is saying that these ongoing next negotiations remain delicate. But, of course, there is a hopeful tone from the Biden administration with the secretary of state saying just yesterday that this ongoing nightmare he believes is beginning to end for these Americans who have been imprisoned in Iran.",

They want him to make the case about the strategic benefits of sending that support to Ukraine. Now, we have heard from President Biden repeatedly over the last year and a half really making the case that it is necessary to defend Ukraine's territorial sovereignty, to deferred Ukraine's democracy. But what these lawmakers and what these congressional aides want is more for him to dig into the fact that providing support to Ukraine is possibly something that could deter China from invading Taiwan. Providing the support to Ukraine is something that's allowing the Ukrainians, without the Americans even having any boots on the ground, to decimate Russia's military, which is hugely significant to the United States. So, they're making this case privately and publicly.Now, the White House, for their part, says that President Biden is going to continue making the same case that he has. But, of course, this comes amid concerns of the possibility of a drop off in public support from the United States, from the American people, in terms of this continued funding. White House officials say don't pay attention to just one poll. There has been a trend in continued U.S. support for Ukraine over the course of the year. But the folks on Capitol Hill are watching these polls incredibly closely.",

This is where it gets really interesting, though, because there's so much demand for international travel. U.S. to Europe, the average round trip, $813, a lot higher, and not as much of a dip, only down about 2 percent. So, here are the factors. A lot going into this. Jet fuel has gone down. Competition has gone up. Capacity has gone up because the airlines have added more flights. They've rebounded from the pandemic.
