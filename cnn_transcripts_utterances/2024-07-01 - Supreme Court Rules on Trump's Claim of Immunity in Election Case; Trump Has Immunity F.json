That is a win for the Trump team, whether or not it actually affects his case, they can at least politically say that this, to them, is the DOJ overstepping, it's Biden's DOJ.But when you look at the fact that Amy Coney Barrett was the one who was dissenting an opinion there, that kind of changes things. What does that actually mean for the immunity case here? Now, the other person that they're looking at very carefully, Justice Kavanaugh. He is somebody who has spoken at length before he was actually brought to the Supreme Court about the separation of powers. And so, they're looking to see what he does in this case. Well, he had a lot of questions. And he sounded actually skeptical on the other side.",

      "sentences": "We have. Of course, this is not a thumbs up, thumbs down. This is a complicated decision. We just got it here. It's an opinion from Chief Justice John Roberts finding that former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for official acts, but not for unofficial acts.So, what does that translate to? Well, this is something we saw that was sort of signaled in oral arguments. Because what this means is that the former president cannot be prosecuted for anything that was officially part of his job when he was in office. And that's significant because even his own lawyers conceded during oral argument that not everything that is alleged in this indictment was an official act. So, now, the question is, what does the special counsel do here? He could potentially try to cull down this indictment to a more narrow one, just focusing on unofficial acts, and then try to proceed with this case. Still an open question, though, about whether even a slimmed down case could go before the election. Three reasons for that. One, the judge overseeing this, Judge Tanya Chutkan, she has a signal that the lawyers should get some lead time on this. I mean, we're a couple months out from the election. The idea of putting the candidate, the Republican candidate, for the presidency on trial, where he would have to be in court, months, weeks before the elections, that's something that would likely have us right here again before the Supreme Court. Also, the attorney general unlikely to allow something to go ahead that quickly, but we'll see. But right now, this decision, the Supreme Court finding that former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for official acts, but not for unofficial acts. This opinion very, very long.

It says here, to enable the president to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution.However, even the president's lawyers, as we were just talking about, acknowledged that some of the things that he was charged with were not official acts. And so, it's clear here that there's at least some part of this indictment that he is facing from Jack Smith's case that even his own lawyers would not argue are official parts of the president's duties. COOPER:  The Supreme Court could have ruled -- and again, we're still reading this, but could have ruled determining, OK, this act was official, this act was not official, it sounds like at this stage, and again, we got to read this whole thing, that more than likely, it's now just going to be pushed down to a lower court.",

He says, we conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that a former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office, at least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for remaining official actions, he's also entitled to immunity. So, at this stage of the proceedings in the Trump case, they say, we need not and do not decide whether that immunity must be absolute or instead, whether a presumptive immunity is sufficient.So, they are leaving a little bit of wiggle room, saying that there's absolute immunity for anything that is connected to a president's core constitutional powers beyond that, though it may just be a presumptive -- a presumption of immunity. So, here the headline, former presidents are entitled to some immunity. The Trump team telling me this is \"a major victory\" for the former president.",

She's acted differently than any other judge overseeing any other of the Trump cases and how swiftly she has moved, maybe with exception of Justice Merchan in New York. But they're basically saying it's up to her to decide when it comes to his conversations with Mike Pence and his efforts to influence him about -- to stop the certification of the Electoral College certification of the vote, whether that was official or unofficial, because they're saying, obviously, conversations between a president and a vice president are official acts of the office.But when it comes to Trump's pressure campaign on Mike Pence, what I'm reading here is that the presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances. They're saying it's the government's burden to rebut the presumption of immunity. And that they're remanding to the district court to assess in the first instance whether a prosecution involving Trump's alleged attempts to influence the vice president's oversight of the certification would pose any dangers on the intrusion of authority and the functions of the executive branch. And regular people speak, that's a big decision for Judge Chutkan to decide here.",

Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court back in December to weigh in on this question that is being decided right now. So, this case could go before the election.The fact that the Supreme Court has opened the door, though, for further proceedings, for further litigation makes it unlikely that this will go before November. And the reason that is significant is because if Trump is re-elected, he can make this case and the classified documents case go away. So, when it comes to the immediate future, the reason they're framing this as a major victory is because they're going to be able to litigate this for several months and possibly push this off until after November, then all he has to do is get elected and the case goes away. So, I believe that is why they're thinking of this in terms of a major victory. And even a judge like Tanya Chutkan who has moved so quickly, so aggressively, who has agreed with the special counsel that there was a public interest in pushing this case before the election, it's not clear that she's going to be able to get through all of these issues and put on a trial before November.",

The text of the clause provides little support for the absolute immunity claim that Trump asserts. So, they're rejecting that.But in essence, all of the details as to the allegations made, the accusations made in the Jack Smith indictment of Donald Trump, not all of them, but many of them, the court is saying, we are sending this back to the district court. They have to decide whether Trump's communications with the American people, calling them to rally to the Capitol on January 6th and everything that happened after that, the disruption of the counting of the electoral votes, the sham electors' scheme, all of that, whether or not that's an official act, has to be determined by the U.S. District Court. And, Elie Honig, you were saying, what's most significant about that is the U.S. Supreme Court could have said, we're remanding this to the district courts or the lower courts and whatever they say goes, and we will uphold that.

We're sending it back to the district court and -- and this is an important detail, the court says several times, whatever the district court finds can be appealed before trial.Jack Smith had made an argument of, well, maybe the district judge, the trial judge can work it out and send it to the jury and then the jury can separate official from unofficial acts. Several times in this opinion, the Supreme Court, the majority, says explicitly, whatever the judge decides about what's official or unofficial, what's immune or not immune, that can be appealed back up.

I expected part B to be, and I find, having reviewed the record and reviewed the documents, and I find that even if there is such thing as immunity, he was outside the scope.And by the way, that's what the court of appeals did on their ruling. The problem is, as Jim was saying, the court of appeals and the Supreme Court, they're not fact-finders. This can only be done at the district court level. And so, I suspect Judge Chutkan is feeling some regret. It wasn't like it was some leap of logic that she should do that, this happens. There are hearings, for example, in the Georgia case, Mark Meadows is trying to get his case moved over to federal court. The question there is almost the same thing. Was Mark Meadows in or out of the scope? You know what the federal judge did there in Georgia? He held a hearing. Mark Meadows testified.

It's one of the reasons they liked him on the bench. They're not fans of Donald Trump. Donald Trump wins in this decision today because of John Roberts is the chief justice back from the Bush days.But to Jamie's point, here's where we just get into this horrible place we are as a country. In my travels, there are a lot of voters who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, voted for Biden in 2020 are completely tormented about what to do, Republicans in 2024, because they're Republicans. They don't want to vote to re-elect a Democratic president. They don't like Joe Biden's policies. Some of them are wrestling with this January 6th question. Can I forgive him? Did he learn any lessons? So, yes, there would be immense value in airing all this out in a courtroom so that voters could listen to Mark Meadows, listen to Mike Pence, listen to people around Donald Trump, which then, you know, puts a stark contrast on Donald Trump's argument that this is all people out to get me, right? No, these are loyal people who worked for him. In every single one of these cases, the most damning evidence comes from people on the right hand of Donald Trump, people Velcroed to Donald Trump, people loyal to Donald Trump.
