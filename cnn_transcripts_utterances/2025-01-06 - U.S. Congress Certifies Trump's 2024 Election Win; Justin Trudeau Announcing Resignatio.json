Freeland added that the government needed to start pushing back against America First economic nationalism. A former high school teacher and the eldest son of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada's most well-known prime ministers, Trudeau was elected three times. He became a poster child for the country's progressive agenda on the global stage, seen as an antidote to Trump during the incoming U.S. president's first term. His government pursued policies on alleviating child poverty, gender equity, cutting middle class taxes, and the legalization of cannabis.

I suspect many bathroom cabinets are filled with expensive products that don't work. And I can speak from plenty of experience. And to L'Oreal, which says it's come up with an analysis tool which can spot issues and recommend corrective products. It says it can even pick up on skin issues that aren't visible to the eye. The device is a result of a partnership with the Korean start up NanoEnTek. It's been unveiled at CS Tech Show in Las Vegas ahead of a rollout into stores in Asia later this year. And joining us now from Las Vegas, Guive Balooch. He's the Global Managing Director for Augmented Beauty and Open Innovation at L'Oreal Groupe. Guive, fantastic to have you on the show. I'm all about augmented beauty. Explain to us how the technology works, first and foremost. GUIVE BALOOCH, GLOBAL MB, AUGMENTED BEAUTY AND OPEN INNOVATION, L'OREAL GROUPE: Thank you so much for having me. We're very excited to be here at CES unveiling our L'Oreal cell bioprint technology. And as you mentioned, it's really about how to take the guessing out of skincare. Today, what we see on our face has already happened, but it's the biology that will help us predict the future of our skincare and also allow us to be able to get the precise products individually for us. And so, this technology uses really a groundbreaking kind of tech that is miniaturized, allowing us to measure protein biomarkers underneath the skin where the cells are, and it can help us predict and also know exactly what are the right actives that would work for our skin without having to audition anymore. And it's using this lab on a chip type of technology that goes straight into a little tabletop device. And within five minutes, you'll understand a predictive analysis of what skincare is right for you.",

But one of the other things that interested me was the idea that you can look atsomebody's skin and say, look, you're more likely to get larger pores. You're more likely to get age spots the sort of darkening on your skin, even if you can't see it at this stage and find ways to prevent it, it's more -- it's about being preventive in terms of skincare versus reactive, which I think most of us generally are.",

And like today you could see pores or dark spots on thesurface of the skin, but this technology will tell you in the coming months, in the coming year, what you're the most risk for having. And so, this way you can be more proactive and not only treat what you see on the surface, but to treat what your biology will predict will happen in the future. And that way people don't really need to guess anymore when it comes to their skin care. It takes time and compliance for skin care to work. So, we want to give people that empowerment and that information so that they can pick the right product for their individual biology.",

Do you think people end up buying less products? I'm sort of thinking of this holistically for you as a business. And it's not just about the technology, it's also about products.

And that's going to be good for the bottom line, as long as people get the right product for them. Today, nine out of 10 women are frustrated with their skin care. It's unbelievable that nine out of 10 are frustrated. So, it means that we need to give people that biology information so that they can get the more precise product. And then, you will have products that are serums and anti- aging and moisturizers, but you'll be able to know whether or not actives are biological responders for your biology, and that precision is what we're really trying to aim for so that we can take this kind of guessing and auditioning out of the process.",

We're going to have the precise information of everything for our future skin care, our hair care, our hair color, all more precise for our biology, because I think in the end of the day, that is what people are demanding. And this is -- they want to have the right products. They want it to be right for them. And they want to achieve their dreams and desires and beauty without any barriers.
