And that issue of Ukraine badly dividing the House Republican conference. Being part of what Marjorie Taylor Greene, the conservative firebrand who has called for the ouster of Mike Johnson, citing that move in particular for why she believes he should be out of the speakership. Marjorie Taylor Greene still has the power.One, any individual House Republican does to essentially call for a vote seeking the ouster of the Speaker. Something we saw done last fall when Kevin McCarthy became the first ever House Speaker to be pushed out of the speakership by the hands of his own colleagues. She is still continuing to threaten that, but she did not come to Capitol Hill on Monday for a vote. She didn't reveal her latest thinking. I did catch up with several Republicans, including one of the Republicans who supports her efforts. That's Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky. He made clear that they're, quote, undecided about when to call for such a vote. The other question is, how many votes does she ultimately have? Because a lot of Republicans, even some of the more conservative members of the conference who have been critical of the deal-making of Mike Johnson, are not there yet and believe the timing is wrong. In the middle of the election year, she tried to push out the Speaker and lead to turmoil, further turmoil, within the House GOP.",

Ukrainian officials say the attack targeted one of the most popular places in the city, where people go to walk their dogs and play sport. The strike also damaged several buildings, homes and businesses, including the students' palace at the Odesa Law Academy. Officials say two children and a pregnant woman are among the wounded.

Stoltenberg admitted that NATO allies hadn't delivered what they promised.

Pedro Sanchez says he'll continue to lead the Spanish government, quote, with more force if possible. Last week, the Prime Minister told the country he was considering stepping down after a court opened a business corruption probe against his wife. Mr. Sanchez says his wife is innocent and that those complaints are part of a deliberate smear campaign by his far- right opponents.Over the weekend, thousands of Socialist Party supporters marched in Madrid, urging the Prime Minister to stay in power. Barely a year into office, Scotland's first minister has resigned, plunging his ruling Scottish National Party into chaos. Humza Yousaf's government fell apart unexpectedly after he scrapped a coalition agreement with Green Party lawmakers following differences over climate policy. The move backfired as the Greens said they would vote against him in a confidence motion. The SNP will now hold a leadership contest to replace him. As Paris gears up for this year's Summer Olympics, one of the fiercest competitions might not be the Games themselves but finding an affordable place to stay. Rent is sky high, while available rentals have plummeted. It's especially a problem for many locals already struggling with the high cost of living, which is why Paris is pushing for more rent-controlled, government-owned housing, as CNN's Melissa Bell reports.

The online backlash is growing against South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem after her shocking revelation that she shot and killed one of her dogs. She's now being trolled by former U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who repurposed an old tweet from 2021 which read, quote: Don't vote for anyone you wouldn't trust with your dog. The criticism stems from an excerpt from Noem's upcoming book in which she describes killing her dog and a goat on her family farm. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Facing intense backlash, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem defending herself after bragging that two decades ago she shot her puppy named Cricket dead. Given that Cricket has shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did. Noem's newest statement about the incident, her second explanation in three days, coming after bipartisan uproar and horror, mocking her for what many see as animal cruelty. Noem scrambling to reframe it in a good political light. Quote: Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it's hard and painful. In her forthcoming memoir, Noem describes her 14-month-old white- haired pointed puppy that she tried to use for pheasant hunting, a hobby that she has talked about in the past. GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): You know, I loved it from the time I was little. And we ran a hunting lodge for many years. We started a hunting lodge, so I spent years guiding hunters. SERFATY (voice-over): Noem says her puppy Cricket was untrainable, dangerous, and worthless as a hunting dog, according to excerpts obtained by \"The Guardian.\": I hated that dog, she writes. After Cricket attacked her neighbor's chickens, Noem says she got her gun, took Cricket to a gravel pit, and shot him. It was not a pleasant job, but it had to be done. In that same incident, Noem then went on to kill a goat she owned because he was nasty and mean, that the goat smelled disgusting, musky, rancid, and had knocked over her children in the past. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have a very special woman who's hot as a politician. She's a -- she's doing an incredible job in South Dakota. She's the governor, Kristi Noem. SERFATY (voice-over): All this comes as Noem is being considered as a vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump. Seth Tupper has been covering Kristi Noem since she first ran for Congress over a decade ago. SETH TUPPER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SOUTH DAKOTA SEARCHLIGHT: Probably the thought before it came out was that this would help her with Trump, that, you know, it makes her look like this sort of gun-toting, you know, strong Western figure who's unafraid to shock people.
