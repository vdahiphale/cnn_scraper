      "sentences": "Breaking news out of L.A. Clashes breaking out between rival protest groups on the UCLA campus. These are pictures from moments ago. According to the L.A. Times, the violence began hours after the school said a pro-Palestinian encampment, the one you can see there with the tents, is unlawful and that students taking part should face suspension or expulsion.The Times reports that counterdemonstrators, you can see them in the foreground, arrived just before midnight local time and tried to pull down the barricades around the encampment. They're still trying to do that. We've seen people throwing scooters and setting off fireworks. Campus police say they are responding to the situation, although we haven't seen it yet. UCLA is one of many U.S. colleges and universities seeing protests grow over what's happening in Gaza. The mayor of Los Angeles has spoken to the chancellor of the university, according to her office. Also the police chief and the LAPD is responding immediately to Chancellor Block's request for support on campus. Some police have been seen arriving, but they're not here at the epicenter, really, of the tension, which feels pretty fraught right now. And the encampment on the right, protected by barriers. The counter-protesters are trying to pull those barriers down, but they're being forced back by some sort of spray. We think it's pepper spray. That's what the LA Times has suggested. With us now, Dylan Winward, an editor with the Daily Bruin at UCLA. Dylan, thank you for joining us. Can you explain what we're seeing in terms of these pictures?",

We've seen tear gas thrown, obviously, as well on the UCLA campus.There's a complicated relationship with police. There's a very small campus police force. But historically, the LA City police need to be invited onto the campus to be allowed to come onto campus. That might be one of the things that has been causing the delay this evening. We know now that UCLA has requested a wider police presence, but they had previously stated that they weren't going to do so proactively and were only going to do so in reaction to significant violence on campus.",

They arrived at the scene today and they left very, very shortly afterwards. It was only one squad car with about four policemen. So the reason that LAPD have to be invited in is because it's considered state rather than city land.",

All the statements we've had from the university have said that people inside the encampment would only be arrested if they were obstructing police or paramedics. However, the university earlier today threatened to arrest any outside actors who came to campus.We believe that many of the counter protesters who are on campus now and who are throwing those fireworks aren't members of the university community as well.

We don't know from whom on Sunday morning.Clashes that were, by the most part, peaceful as well.
