The Senate says it will take up the $95 billion of foreign aid package on Tuesday. That was just passed by house lawmakers just hours ago in a special session on this Saturday. The package includes billions in military aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as billions for humanitarian aid. We have reporters covering reaction from Washington to Ukraine and Jerusalem. Let's start with CNN's Lauren Fox live on Capitol Hill. So Lauren, how did this get pushed through? And what does it mean for Speaker Johnson's job?",

Despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for this series of supplemental bills, what you saw from conservatives was frustration, a sense that they had been let down by the Speaker.Now the question remains, if Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been leading this effort to try to oust the Speaker, if she will take action when they return from their week recess. She would not say what her definitive plans were. We had been waiting to see whether or not she would try to force a vote to oust the Speaker, or at least begin that process today. That didn't happen in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, you have some conservatives who are expressing frustration and concern with the Speaker, but also laying out that they don't think this is the moment to have a fight over the gavel arguing that it could put Republicans in peril as they face reelection in November. On the side of defense hawks however, you had a lot of celebration for Speaker Johnson today. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee Mike McCaul, walking through the process of how this came to be saying that he really watched the Speaker evolve on this issue over the course of the last several months. When you become the Speaker of the House you take on new responsibilities. You also get new classified briefings that you did not get as a rank-and-file member. He said that he really watched Johnson come into his own, realized what was at stake, realized what was at stake not dressed for global security, but for security here in the U.S. And he said that he was really applauding the Speaker's steps knowing that this could have an impact on the Speaker's own future, Alex.",

CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and our senior diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is joining us from Jerusalem. Fred, first to you. This aid has been long-delayed by the House, was passed by the Senate back in February. Now, you've got these thanks pouring in from Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy.

And certainly if you look at the way some of the things have been going on the battlefield for the Ukrainians, especially in the last couple of weeks, but also in the last couple of months to an extent.You do see that right now the initiative is very much on the Russian side. The Russians are pressuring the Ukrainians on many of the front lines. They haven't achieved any strategic successes yet the Russians, they haven't really broken through any major front lines. They haven't been able to put pressure on any of the sort of capital cities of some of the regions here in this country. But certainly right now you do feel that the initiative is on the Russian side. And the Ukrainians have been saying that the fact that they don't have enough ammunition, the fact that they don't have enough weapons has certainly been something that's been holding them back. And especially over the past, I would say about two, three weeks since the Russians have started a major aerial campaign against a lot of the energy infrastructure here in this country. That's when the Ukrainians were saying they simply don't have enough air defense missiles. And so you had the president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy come out really seconds after the aid package was approved, thanking Speaker Johnson personally, but the U.S. and the House of Representatives in general. And saying that air defense missiles are important, that this once again shows the U.S.' leadership as far as defending democracy in the world was concerned. But definitely the Ukrainians also saying that this has already done a lot of damage to them on the battlefield. We were also speaking to some front-line troops actually, who are currently fighting on the southern and on the eastern front lines and both of them have said that this has had a major psychological effect to how this aid comes through now, or at least passed through the House of Representatives saying that it really is something that lifted morale tonight and morale has certainly been very difficult for the Ukrainians as the Russians have also managed, Alex, to bring a lot more very heavy firepower to bear on the front lines. They've become a lot more effective at using their air force and using some pretty heavy bombs that they're dropping on the frontline positions, making life very difficult for the Ukrainians, Alex.",

      "sentences": "Yes, very quick and swift reaction. The president of Israel Isaac Herzog saying that this shows that Israel has no stronger ally than the United States. From the prime minister, an interesting message saying that this shows bipartisan support for Israel.Of course, that's an important domestic message for him to make as well as thanking the United States because many people would perceive the prime minister here because of the way that he's is fighting the war in Gaza so many Palestinians killed, more than 34,000 now, and that is felt that it's alienating some of the Democrats within the United States. And therefore his comments, bipartisan support, we heard it from other Israeli officials as well. But when the prime minister characterizes it like that, it has a message and a resonance here. The defense minister pointing out that Israel is facing seven different enemies. He said this shows this aid bill being voted through shows that there is strong -- United States stands strong with Israel. The foreign minister talking about strong ties, strategic partnership between the two countries. But comments made by the speaker of the Knesset, I thought were particularly telling because he said this. He said this shows all of Israel's enemies the strength of support and the relationship between the United States and Israel. And why is that important at the moment to say? Well, there's a perception here that Iran decided that it could strike at Israel in a way directly, 350 missiles just a week ago. Now, in a way that it's never done before for because the sense here was that Iran perceived that Israel support from the United States, Prime Minister Netanyahu's support from President Biden wasn't a strong as it once was. That was a point of weakness and Iran thought that they could exploit that. So the Speaker of the Knesset being very clear. So besides having the weapons to continue to defend and attack enemies as well, and as well as the money coming in for humanitarian aid on top of the defense money, this really is signaling that strength and I think part of that is what's vital to Israel, vital to the prime minister to say that he isn't the one that's broken this unshakeable bond with the United States.",

With the dysfunctional politics basically argue culture with pernicious polarization, I think this was a reminder however temporary and brief it may be, that in fact the United States can lead and it can support its allies.For the Ukrainians, I think it's absolutely critical. They -- they're short of men. They're air defense, they're sort of artillery and munitions and this will at least give them the capacity through most of 2024 to hold their own with the anticipation perhaps in 2025 of launching the renewed offensive against -- against the Russians to acquire, to take back some Ukrainian territory. For the Israelis. I think Nic laid it out pretty well. I mean I think there was a perception clearly and understandably given the Netanyahu government's behavior, both with respect to the judicial overhaul, the pursuit of settlement policies on the West Bank, there were annexation is name only and the difficulties and the divisions between the Biden administration and Netanyahu over Gaza that in effect, the United States (INAUDIBLE) is waning. I don't know frankly where this is going to heal all the breaches that exist now between the Netanyahu government and the Biden administration. But it demonstrates still a degree of bipartisanship, even with a lot of progressive and even mainstream democrats objecting or wanting to condition U.S. military assistance that there's still a very strong current of bipartisanship across the aisle for for the state of Israel.",

And number two, I think the Iranians are terrifyingly aware of Israel's technical mastery. They're going to have to figure out when it compensate for the vulnerability, either by moving precision guided missions closer to Israel, relying on Hezbollah if tensions arise because there's no proximity, there's no proximity problem there. Or they can do an enormous amount of damage to Israel. And finally, I'm concerned, as is everyone I think about the prospects of the Iranian nuclear program being ramped up.

In court, a handful of prospective jurors became emotional. One was excused after she told the judge she had anxiety and was worried as the trial goes on, more people could know she's part of the jury saying, \"{I might not be able to be completely fair and not emotional so that concerns me.\" Another was dismissed after she began crying, saying, \"I'm sorry, I thought I could do this. I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case either. I don't want you to feel I've wasted anyone's time. This is so much more stressful than I thought.\" A third was sent home after noting she was feeling anxiety and self- doubt as she listened to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses. At the defense table, Trump sat flipping through papers with charts, photos, and graphics. He whispered and passed notes with his lawyers and at some points was hunched over with his elbows on the desk. Prosecutors Susan Hoffinger (ph) started off questioning potential jurors, telling them this is not about Mr. Trump being a former president. It's not about his being a candidate for the presidency. It's only about whether the evidence proves he's guilty. During her presentation, Trump leaned back in his chair, at one point his eyes closed. Trump attorney, Susan Necheles focused on bias against the former president she told those in the jury box, you all bring biases and you particularly bring biases about someone who is as publicly and outspoken as President Trump. There's nobody that doesn't know him in this room. In the afternoon. The court moved to a routine hearing to determine how much of Trump's legal history the prosecution will be allowed to ask him about if he testifies, which he said he plans to. Prosecutors argued they should be allowed to question Trump about the findings in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case among others despite Trumps attorneys' strong objections.

That is the only way I can put it.I can't believe they actually passed anything in the House. And it's going to be probably passed and signed into the end -- signed into law by the president soon enough. Look at this. Up until this point, there have only been 47 bills and resolutions signed into law. That is by far the lowest&amp; the last 50 years. The prior low was 100. So were at half the level of the prior low. Most Congresses -- you know, you go back 30, 40 years, we're talking 200, 300, 5000 bills and resolutions signed into law at this point. We are at a dramatic low. It's no real surprise, Alex, that the congressional approval rating is down in the gutter. The disapproval rating is up near a decade high. It's because Congress doesn't do anything. Let's see if the Congress can actually pass something today, or at least the House and then the Senate will later this week if that approval rating could go up. Because the truth of the matter is, Alex, it just can't go any lower. MARQUARDT: Less than half, that's incredible.

Once Mike Gallagher resigns, which we expect to be later this weekend, we're going to have a majority that is as small of a majority in the House of Representatives when the Congress was in session, the lowest and over a century. You have to go back to 1917 to get a majority as small as we're looking at coming this upcoming Monday. You know, I'm not necessarily the best at math, Alex, but if you have to go back more than a century to find a majority as small as this one, well, I think that tells you that we're in a very interesting time. And it wouldn't be surprising to me if Mike Johnson has to continue to rely on Democrats to pass things going forward, especially considering that ultra -conservative flank that he's dealing with.",

So you know, I like looking at the betting markets on this sort of group conventional thinking, right, to give us an idea of what's cooking. So the betting markets, the chance that Speaker Mike Johnson is forced out before May, 90 percent no. This is significantly up from where we were in the beginning of the week when a significantly higher chunk said yes. Now the vast majority say no. I don't think there's really much of a chance. You just heard Ana Navarro in the last segment essentially saying, at this particular point, Mike Johnson's job looks pretty safe. The conventional wisdom agrees with it.

She's celebrating her 25th birthday. I've been told she's a huge Taylor Swift fan. So my conspiracy theory, if I'm allowed to believe in one, is my conspiracy theory that Taylor Swift put out these two new albums, including the surprise album, in order to give Brooke a happy birthday.

EMILY PIDGEON, CLIMATE SCIENTIST: So as we know, are we searching for the solution to climate change and there's multiple pieces to this. You know, we've all talked about the need to reduce emissions, there's various technological solutions. But the solution that is right in front of us that we can act on right now is nature. Nature provides some of the most immediate solutions for addressing climate change. And about 10 to 15 years ago now, we discovered that coastal wetlands systems, these mangroves, seagrasses and the salt marshes that are highlighted so beautifully in this film, are amazing at taking carbon out of the atmosphere and the ocean and then burying it in the soil below them as we saw in that clip there, that black mud -- muddy soil. The mud that we think of when we think of coastal swamps. It's this amazing long-term storage of carbon. And it's kept there for millennia. And so we are beginning to appreciate now, we're beginning to see countries really understand how important their coastal wetlands systems, these salt marshes, seagrasses, mangroves, are, as part of their full climate solution.",
