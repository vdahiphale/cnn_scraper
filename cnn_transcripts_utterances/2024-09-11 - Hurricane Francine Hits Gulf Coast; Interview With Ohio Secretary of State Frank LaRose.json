They were very one-sided in their treatment of Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris. Everybody knows that. I think if there's going to be another debate, it should be a FOX News debate. We have done one with CNN. You know that, Wolf. ABC had their shot last night. It should be FOX News. It should be, in my view, held in an HBCU in a FOX News debate. If that's the template of how this thing goes, I think that could work out. But we will see what the Harris campaign wants to do and where the Trump campaign wants to land on this. At the end of the day, who has a message for the American people? Kamala Harris dodged the most important question last night. Are the American people better off today than they were four years ago? She didn't answer that question, Wolf. She dodged it, because she can't answer it, because it's an indictment of her failure as vice president and of Joe Biden's failure as president.",

He always takes debate and Ms. Harris set the trap, so he spent much of the debate talking about the past and about Joe Biden or about immigrants eating pets, but not how he'd improve the lives of Americans in the next four years.\" I wonder -- I wanted to think of your response to that editorial in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" which is usually very, very conservative.",

But what Kamala Harris didn't do was talk about policy to impact the lives of the American people. Through that debate last night, Donald Trump talked about the terrible job on inflation, the terrible job on the border. I believe the most strongest points last night were his conversation, his points on foreign policy, which has been a disaster under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, and that he wants to end the conflict in Ukraine, so millions of people stop dying, how he wants to make sure that Israel is around, can defend itself and actually has the tools and the abilities to do that. Kamala Harris didn't really address that at all. She tried to turn back in terms of attacking Donald Trump. So if you take a step back and look at that debate, she attacked Donald Trump. Donald Trump was focused on what matters to the American people, which is securing our border, getting an economy thriving and rising again for all of the American people, and getting out of these conflicts that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris has gotten the United States into.",

But when you take the totality over the last four years, Wolf, and everybody knows this is how it truly works, prices are up well over 20 percent for every man, woman, and child in the United States of America.Looking at the year-over-year changes one thing. And, by the way, prices are still slightly up over where they were a year ago, but making -- getting your car fixed, potentially going on vacation, buying food, renting a House, buying a house, that is massively up because of the inflationary policies of Kamala Harris. She was the tiebreaking vote on the American Rescue Plan, on the Inflation Reduction Act, and that did not help the American people.

FRANK LAROSE (R), OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, we should always hold our election officials accountable. That means questioning the work that they do.

We have been out here in this lakeside park now for several hours.Francine, we know, is going to remain a Category 1 hurricane. It's not going to convert into that Category 2 status, which we had initially thought, but that doesn't change the fact that the dangerous flooding, storm surge and wind damage is off the table. That still remains unchanged. Behind me, you can see some of these waves here, a lot of whitecaps beginning moving in. Those strong winds are picking up a little bit more. Right now, Francine is about 150 miles away from where we are packing sustained winds around that eye of 90 miles per hour. So that's a big concern coming in here, even though we're still talking about that Category 1 status. And, Wolf, behind me, there's a small marina, several boats right there over my right shoulder. We have seen people coming up, maybe getting supplies out of their boats. We spoke with one man who said that he lives full time on those boats right there. He didn't seem too concerned about it, saying that a lot of the flood walls and levees here around Morgan City will do a lot of work to try and keep that damage sustained. But one thing that is concerning is the rain that's already fallen due to other storms last week, non- tropical storms. So it's not going to take a lot for this area to begin to flood. And that's been a big concern here from officials as well. Now, there was a voluntary evacuation order took effect yesterday evening, a lot of people we saw going to gas stations, filling up their tanks and heading out either north or west out of the trajectory of this storm. But for those who did decide to stay and ride it out, officials have been very clear they're not going to be able to get to them during the heat and high of this storm, mainly power outages. If the power goes out, they have been clear as well they won't be able to get to those power outages to work on them until the hurricane passes. We also are watching very closely how this rain continues falling and the flooding increasing in this area. And to give you another sense of where we are in this lakeside park, we're sort of in a hole in a way. We're standing actually on the highest level, one of the highest levels of this park on this little hill, and it all sort of dips down here to my left. And a lot of these underlying areas are things that we see throughout the city as well. So, Wolf, a lot of people who stayed are paying close attention to that as well. There is a lot of concern with flooding. A lot of sandbags have been placed in front of homes as well, but now we're minutes away as well from a curfew here in Morgan City. That's going to last until 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. So the city is going to be very, very quiet now for the next several hours as this hurricane comes through.",
