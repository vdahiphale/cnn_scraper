And what exactly is at stake? I'll ask an all-star panel. Also, the electric vehicle revolution. Europe and China are far ahead of America. Can the U.S. catch up? I'll talk to Bill Ford, the executive chair of the Ford Motor Company. Finally, the Supreme Court. It's supposed to be the final check, the ultimate safeguard to preserve America's bedrock values. But is it now itself a danger to democracy? A new book says just that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The real purpose of the counteroffensive is to create a political change in Russia, by which I don't mean regime change. There has to be a moment when the Russians decide that the war is not worth fighting anymore and they take their troops and leave. It's kind of decision that the French made in 1962 when they decided to pull out of Algeria. You know, the British made that decision a number of times in their empire.There is a moment when the empire ends. And the Ukrainians will use both military tactics as well as political tactics to convince the Russians to leave. And remember, the war is over when the Russians go home. They don't have -- the Ukrainians don't have to occupy Moscow. They don't have to get anybody to surrender. All they need to do is get them to leave. And so what you're going to see over the next few weeks is both, you know, the kinds of shaping operations we see now, attempts to cut off railway links and so on. You may see some bigger military moves but you'll also see more events like this small group of Russians who went over the border, Free Russian Forces calling themselves. You'll see drones in Moscow and other Russian cities. That's also part of persuading the Russians to go home. ZAKARIA: I think that's a very good way to think about it because -- and I think the analogy with France and Algeria is exactly right, which is the French tried and tried, and at some point they realized, after by some estimates killing one million Algerians, that the Algerians were just not going to -- you know, they were going to get their independence.",

I think they really have to be defeated, and the Russian senior leadership and political elite will have to understand that this is just costing too much.And what we're seeing right now even with President Zelenskyy announced as the start of the counteroffensive, the main battlefield, battalions, and we're prepared over 40,000 men, they have not been deployed yet.

Of course there are military reasons for that but those are also signs to Russia that we aren't going to stop.In other words, you could keep your war going, and we're also going to keep the war going.

Most people will have thought particularly if you go back 20 -- 30 years, that the court is sort of the savior of American democracy. What do you think has changed?MICHAEL WALDMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NYU'S BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE: I think we have to rethink and understand the role the court is playing right now. [10:50:03] It is very unusual thing to have a Supreme Court with nine unelected justices with lifetime appointments making such big decisions every June. We only give it that kind of power because we trust it to be above politics, to act like a court. Right now, the Supreme Court is controlled, is dominated by six very conservative justices, a super majority, and they've begun to make very, very radical, extreme and activist rulings that are remaking society in basic ways. It poses a threat, I think, to our notions of democracy. It is changing the country in ways people are only beginning to understand and I think it is going to lead to a pretty big backlash at the same time.",

Even on guns which you've written a wonderful book about the Second Amendment.You know, it's -- most people don't realize that the Second Amendment did not prevent 200 years of gun regulation or maybe at least a hundred, suddenly going back to the 1850s. And that it was a series of decisions really starting with Heller, Scalia's opinion that completely transformed the legal landscape for guns, right?",

      "sentences": "You're exactly right. It is sort of hard to imagine, but the Supreme Court never said the Second Amendment protects an individual right to gun ownership until 2008, that was the Heller decision. But it still left room for gun laws even though it was now seen as an individual right.And Justice Scalia was asked, what is the difference between you and Justice Thomas? And he said, well, I am an originalist, but I am not a nut. Justice Thomas wrote the opinion more recently, the Bruen case. And that case, one of the really extraordinary decisions at the end of the last term in June of 2022, basically said you cannot consider public safety when you're looking at whether a gun safety law is constitutional. You can only look at history and tradition by which they mean some law from the colonial era or from the founding era. If they had that law then, then maybe we can have it now. This is a very unusual way to rule. ZAKARIA: And at the heart of all this is this idea of originalism and original intent. And you say in the book that it is fundamentally misconceived.

It's the idea that the only legitimate way to interpret the Constitution is to ask what did it mean at the time it was ratified to the founders.The court ruled that the meaning of the Constitution is -- quote -- \"fixed.\" In a very literal way what this means is that the social views, the social mores of property-owning White men from the late 1700s or maybe the 1800s has to govern us now and that is whatever the justices think they could find to bolster their argument. Sometimes it is terrifying. In the Dobbs case they actually cited in the opinion, Justice Alito, six times a judge named Matthew Hale who is a British judge who sentenced women to death for witchcraft in the 1500s -- (CROSSTALK)",
