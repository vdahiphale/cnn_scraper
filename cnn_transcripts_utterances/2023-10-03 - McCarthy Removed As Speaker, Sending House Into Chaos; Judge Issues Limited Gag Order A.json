So, that means the House will be closed for business, and they don't even have a Speaker. Meanwhile, McCarthy, who lost that speakership gavel today, well, he said this tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So far more -- over 200 Republicans in our caucus were favorable to Kevin McCarthy, myself included.
