I think it's 18 dead now and 111 injured, this is what the Russians are claiming. They're saying the Ukrainians used a multi-barreled rocket launcher that they intercepted some of the rockets, and they're blaming the Czech Republic for supplying some of the ammunition for this rocket launcher, which they say there was Ukrainian ammunition. The Czechs have, in part, been summoned by the Russians as well to account for the use of this ammunition that the Czechs are saying blanketly saying, you know, no dice, we're not going to play ball with Russia on that one.It just points to the sort of not only the escalating military tensions, the escalating death toll, but the sort of overspill, international diplomatic tensions as well that are in the background all the time, but they come to the surface at moments like this. This particular attack hit businesses, it hit apartment buildings, it hit cars, according to the Russians, more than 20 -- more than 100 cars were damaged in this particular attack. And the governor there has now said that there's an effective curfew on people gathering in the streets. President Putin is concerned. He's sending his minister of health. That's rare for him to do. He's sending a delegation from their emergencies ministry. So, he's taking -- President Putin is taking this seriously, and we've heard from the defense ministry saying this will not go without a response.",

I expect we're going to hear from perhaps the United States, perhaps from the British as well, pointing out Russia's transgressions through all of this. It will be interesting if Russia finds itself getting enough support to try to in some way censure Ukraine.It would be a change -- it would be a change in diplomatic fortunes for Ukraine if that happens, it would be significant, and I think it's going to be nothing more tonight than a throwing around of angry words by Russia, trying to make its point. And I think it has to be said in a situation like this, Russia is not only trying to score military points against Ukraine, but we are not able to independently verify everything that they claim, particularly in Belgorod where the attack took place. So it's hard to substantiate their claims, the extent of the damage and who they say is responsible.",

If that were to go away, then the fortunes -- Ukrainian fortunes on the battlefield I think, would be reversed, unfortunately. What it would result in is probably a Russian takeover of larger portions of the country and the potential collapse of the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian state, and then, of course, we would see a terrible outcome with the Russians trying to limit Ukraine as a nation and as a people as well.",

The Israelis have said that they were going to move to a more low intense phase of conflict, and they certainly have a lot of pressure from the United States and from world opinion to do just that. However, the way of war so far has been one in which they have used a lot of ordinance against not only the Hamas targets, but civilian targets within Gaza as well.And I don't really see that going away, unless the Israelis are convinced not to do this, and, you know, right now the government, the Israeli government's way of war seems to be to ramp things up as much as they possibly can. This has probably been the most intense air campaign of the 21st century, and that is something that they are going to have to do something about in order to minimize civilian casualties and provide aid to the civilian population, which is on the brink of starvation and, of course, diseases, also, a factor there.

While the Biden administration grappled with how to handle the migrant surge, mayors for cities nowhere near the Mexican border shared how they are feeling the impacts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: The meeting with the White House, I think much more could be done with all of our national leaders, from a decompression strategy, to making sure the cost of this is not falling on the laps of everyday taxpayers in our cities. It's not just New York City. It is all of these cities that have been impacted, from Brownsville, El Paso, Houston, Chicago, New York, Denver. This is really an issue that you're seeing play out on the streets of our cities. MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON (D), CHICAGO: We have infrastructure in our local communities that are not designed to carry such a burden. Local municipalities are not structured to be able to carry the weight of a crisis like this. And I've sent a delegation to the border to see firsthand what our bordering cities are experiencing, and what we have said repeatedly is that there has to be better coordination. And without a coordinated operation, this is going to crush local economies because there's a financial responsibility that we have all taken on. MAYOR MIKE JOHNSON (D), DENVER: Part of the challenge, we need federal resources and that's where I think the supplemental budget the president has pushed is being held up in Congress right now. You know, the breaking point is when you're talking about 10 percent of the budget to allocate for cities on this, that's unsustainable. When we have every single hotel room in the city of full of migrants that arrived, that's unsustainable. And so, the federal resources are the what the Congress has held up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Police say this video is absolutely critical to the investigation, and they're hoping that someone out there knows who these two people are in this video. So, let me describe it for you and what police are really keying in on. There are two vehicles in this video, one is this pick up truck, a Chevy Silverado, the other is the silver Kia Optima.What you see is two vehicles pull up alongside each other, the driver of that pickup truck and driver of the Kia Optima seem to interact. It seems that the driver of the pickup appears to wipe down the side of the Kia Optima. It's not clear exactly what they're doing, but that is what police are keying in on right now. The timeline and the location of this video is absolutely critical and here's why. The video was taken near where the body were found. Police say they believe the bodies had been in that location for a few days. And then further, this video shows this Kia Optima that police believe belongs to Matthew Guerra, that 22-year-old victim. Police say that Guerra died of a contact gunshot wound to the head. What this means is they believe the firearm was placed directly on Matthew Guerra's head when he was killed. Asked whether or not this was a murder/suicide, police say that that's possible, but at this point it seems unlikely. Police are also combing over more surveillance video as well as social media to try to figure out who killed these two people and why. And when we go back to the timeline here, that's part of what makes this case really perplexing for police. For example, December 22nd is the last day that police say that anybody heard from Savanah Soto. She was just 18-years-old. She was nine months pregnant. December 23rd, she missed a critical appointment with her OB/GYN. She was supposed to be induced to give birth, but she missed that appointment. And her family told police that she was missing. December 26th, that's when police found the bodies of 22-year-old Matthew Guerra and 18-year-old Savanah Soto. This is now being investigated as a capital murder case. Again, San Antonio police urging the public to come forward with any information. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
