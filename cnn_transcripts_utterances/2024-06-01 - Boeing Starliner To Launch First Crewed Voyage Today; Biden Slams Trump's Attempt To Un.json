This is a test flight, right, and test flights are the most risky type of spaceflight. There's only been six first crewed test flights in American historySo, this is a big one and it's a very big deal for the two astronauts that are going to be sitting inside that capsule. You have the commander, Butch Wilmore, and the pilot, Suni Williams, both very experienced NASA astronauts, both Navy test pilots. They each have two space flights under their belt, tons of space walks. I mean, these are about as experienced of astronauts as you can possibly get. And for the last month or so, they've been essentially in a modified type of quarantine because that first attempt back in early May scrubbed. And so, they've been in quarantine at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas ever since. They have been allowed to see their families, but still it's been a modified quarantine for them ever since. And so, what Boeing has been doing is they've been trying to troubleshoot some of the issues that they found. First, there was that issue with the rocket, the Atlas V rocket that propels the Boeing Starliner into space, a faulty valve, they fixed that. And then, Boeing found a very small helium leak, which they say they're just going to let ride, essentially. They believe there's not a big issue with that. So, now, here we go, after years of technical delays, we are now just hours away from this second attempt at the first crewed test flight. And you know, Victor and Amara, the whole goal here is to get these astronauts to the International Space Station and provide some redundancy, a different option to SpaceX, the primary competitor, and then your only other option, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, which comes with all sorts of complications, given what's happening in Ukraine.

Now, sources tell me at this point it's unclear if they're going to try to get that pushed back or if they're going to let it stay. That date is just a few days before the Republican National Convention, and some of his advisors believe that could be a political advantage.But they'll be discussing that over the next few days, and then proceed accordingly. Now, before that date, the former president, like any other defendant in Manhattan, is expected to be interviewed by trial services, and he can even submit references, words of goodwill on his behalf to help the judge as he contemplates his possible sentence. We also expect that the Trump team will ultimately appeal this criminal conviction. That has always been the expectation. They have been planning for the possibility of a conviction and the need to appeal. So, they've been pursuing this strategy of death by a thousand cuts, constantly filing motions, raising objections, trying to preserve any possible issue for an appeal. The idea is to throw anything at the wall, see if it can stick, to try to overturn this historic conviction. But that is a process that will take many months and could even last until after the November election. But it's interesting. You see the team behind the scenes kind of shifting from purely legal thinking with the New York case to more of a political strategy. Now, that November election, not only, something where the former president could once again be in the Oval Office, but it's also an opportunity for him to protect himself from the two most significant cases he faces. Those are, of course, the two federal cases brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. If Trump is re-elected, he could make both of those cases go away. And if he's reelected, it's unclear what would happen to the criminal case down in Georgia. Again, lots of legal developments in Trump world, probably leading right up to election day and beyond.

Now, Secretary Austin, he did meet with his Chinese counterpart for the first time on Friday, face-to-face for the first time really since 2022, when China cut off military-to-military communications with the United States. According to a Pentagon readout, he was firm, but he was professional, and they discussed a number of topics.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This was a highly qualified lawyer. Now, I'm not allowed to use his name because of the gag order. But you know, he's a sleazebag. Everybody knows that. Took me a while to find out. But he was effective. He did work, but he wasn't a fixer. He was a lawyer. You know, they like to use the word fixer. He wasn't a fixer. He was a lawyer. At the time, he was a fully accredited lawyer. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is appears to be nothing he can do, no conviction that can be leveled against him that will cause fellow Republicans to abandon him. They have rallied around him. They have decided they want to run on this issue to motivate the base with anger for turnout and donations. And so far, it appears to be working, at least in terms of donations.

That could continue to chip away at support among moderate and independent voters who both candidates need to win in order to become president. What the Trump campaign is hoping for here is to have a base motivator issue in terms of anger. They know Democrats are very motivated because of Roe versus Wade being overturned, to come out and vote in large numbers for President Biden. And they know the Democrats want to motivate the base on that issue. They are hoping to do the same thing with Republicans and Trump here. If they -- if they can get Republican voters so angry and so mad about this, they come out in large numbers and empty their cheque books for Republicans. (CROSSTALK)",
