New York and Connecticut getting absolutely slammed by torrential rain. Up to ten inches soaked parts of Connecticut just over a period of hours, causing a flash flood emergency. Crews worked through the day and night, continuing with water rescues. Connecticut's governor says that they evacuated at least 100 people in the midst of all of this.CNN's Derek Van Dam is tracking this for us. He's back here now.

Look how this is stressing some of the dams in Connecticut as well. Some of them kind of overtopping some of their dams there.Now, look at this, rainfall totals have just approached that ten-inch mark. So that's a significant amount of rain in a short period of time. Now, the good news is, the hardest hit areas over western Connecticut are currently dry. But we do believe that things are going to change into this evening. The first initial round of storms that moved through yesterday, moving off the eastern seaboard. They produced a significant amount of rain. I want to draw your attention to northern sections of Long Island and into western Connecticut. That's where some of these rain - rainfall rates were quite impressive. And that's where we saw some of the highest rainfall totals. That's why we have our flood warnings still ongoing across that area. The others have been allowed to expire. But I do believe that this could start to - at least the activity could start to rekindle later this afternoon and evening, just about dinner time, the rush hour back home from work as another round of showers and storms develops this afternoon. The weather prediction center has this area under a slight risk of excessive rainfall that could lead to flash flooding. And, by the way, this whole story of flooding across the northeast, very consistent in a warming world. We've seen the increase and frequency and severity of these heavy rain events since our world continues to warm. Kate.",

Obviously, things changed a month ago and they have been very quickly scrapping together things.But what's interesting here is that we don't have the usual poll tested, message tested campaign from a president, or presidential candidate. We have someone who was putting together lines for a debate prep that was going to be the running mate debate, that has now been quickly transformed into a stump speech. To the point that a week ago there was finally a call between Harris' top advisers and the campaign pollsters, who had been the Biden campaign pollsters. And what I heard is that the message that the pollster said is, I'm not sure you should be saying we won't go back. And I'm not sure you should be saying weird so much. It's too negative. Won't go back is like backward looking, not about the future. And Harris' aides and Harris herself said, hey, we are hearing what they're chanting at the arenas. We're going to go with that.
