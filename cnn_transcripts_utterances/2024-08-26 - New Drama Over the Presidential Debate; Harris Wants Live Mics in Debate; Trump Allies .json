We're going to have the new reporting on Trump's shifting campaign strategy. And new this morning, the death toll is now rising in Ukraine after Russia unleashes one of its heaviest strikes in months. Hundreds of drones and missiles launched.

Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, scheduled to face off September 15th on ABC, but now a battle over debate details may have put that a bit up in the air. At issue, the microphones. The Harris team wants mics live for both candidates during the entire debate, but the Trump camp says that's not what they agreed to before. Trump now putting the whole event in potential doubt, questioning on Truth Social why he should go through with the debate in the first place.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez and Alayna Treene are joining us now. Priscilla, first to you. What are you hearing about this debate drama?",

      "sentences": "Well, that the dispute is really those microphones. That's the only remaining issue that I'm told about this debate right now between these two campaigns. Of course, it sort of stems toward the pains of switching from one candidate to another because these debate rules were agreed upon by then candidate Joe Biden, now, of course, it's Vice President Kamala Harris. And the Harris campaign believes that the mics should be on over the duration of the presidential debate next month.And they say in a statement this from a senior campaign official, Brian Fallon, quote, \"our understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.\" He goes on to say, \"we suspect Trump's team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit they don't think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.\" Of course, the former president taking to social media over the weekend talking about this debate. But clearly the Harris campaign needling him a little bit here. And of course, the Trump campaign has suggested that the Harris campaign had wanted the candidates to be seated for there to be notes. The Harris campaign is pushing back on that saying that really, again, this is a feud about whether the mics should be on or off. Now, the vice president is doing a lot of debate preparations ahead of that September 10th presidential debate. She already started this earlier in the month. That's expected to continue over the next two weeks. She's supposed to double down on that with some travel here and there. That includes this week going to the battleground state of Georgia. Of course, that's a state that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes. So, it is one of those battlegrounds that is going to be closely watched by everyone, especially these campaigns. And so it's fitting that the vice president, her now vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, will be kicking off their bus tour there this week and then concluding that with a rally with the vice president. So clearly, as they try to sort out these debate preparations behind the scenes and these issues over the mics, they are also still trying to keep a focus on the battlegrounds.",

You're going to - you're kind of seeing that today with this visit to Arlington National Cemetery. But that will also be the message that they have when he addresses that National Guard Conference.And I think as well, remember, a key line of attack from both Trump, as well as his running mate, J.D. Vance, has been against Harris' running mate, Tim Walz's, military record and some of the comments he has made about seeing military combat and then walking those comments back. That is something as well that I think you should definitely keep in mind when you - when you see that visit to the National Guard summit because, of course, Tim Walz was in the National Guard for 24 years. Vance, for his part, also served in the military. Though he was deployed abroad to the Middle East, he did not actually serve in combat. There's going to be some of that comparison as well. And as we know, a lot of the talk around some of these military records has become very nasty, very personal. Many people telling Trump to move away from those attacks. But as we know, he sometimes can't help himself. Sara.",

At least this whole debate season. And now it's Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump, obviously.

Donald Trump has gained a lot of momentum over the past year, being able to beat up on Joe Biden for his age, for the style, you now, the way that he talks. And so this is a totally different race now because of the candidate. And I think that that's factoring into some of the hesitancy, some of the back-and-forth.But let's be honest, Donald Trump has been boasting. He's been saying, you know, any time, any place, right? So, if he's really confident, then he should have no problem going toe to toe with Kamala Harris. What's the concern? What's the fear if he's so confident in his policy positions, if he's so confident in the fact that, you know, his critiques of the Biden-Harris administration our strong enough for the American public to support him. So, I see this as just another excuse, frankly, for a campaign that is anxious, that they're seeing the momentum that Kamala Harris has and they haven't quite figured out how to attack her, how to engage with her. And so they're trying to use this as an excuse to sort of delay and say that, you know, this is a matter of the Harris team changing things, when really if they're so confident, then they'll just show up and have the debate.",

And, look, he has gotten himself into some trouble over his description, over - over military veterans, over description of at least reporting around those that were actually captured and even killed in some cases.

And so I think that regardless of political party, taking the time to honor and to remember those who sacrifice for our freedoms, that's something that should happen. Again, this - that should not be a political thing.But I do think voters should look at the long record of Donald Trump, not just what he says in this moment, not the way that he defends, you know, these recent comments that have come up around the Congressional Medal of Honor versus, you know, another award. I think they should really think about the way that he has talked about service members, of the call that he made to, you know, that one family where he almost didn't remember the military service member's name. He didn't say it out loud. All those things. They should look at his long record as they think about their decision when they go to vote in November.",

Joining us now, Republican Congressman Mike Kelly. Thank you so much for joining us today. You know, Butler, Pennsylvania, your hometown. You were also the Chairman of the Congressional Task Force investigation of the Trump assassination attempt. Thank you, sir, for coming in today for us. First of all, I know you were there in the audience with three of your grandchildren when this shooting happened. Can you just give me a sense of what your experience was on the ground that day? It gives you even better insight into the investigation now that you are head of that. REP. MIKE KELLY (R-PA): Yeah, Sara, thanks for having me on here. I appreciate it. I think that that particular event, for whatever reason, there was more chaos. It just seemed to me that things weren't organized. My wife and three of my grandchildren, plus my oldest son, were there. And so for me, when this all started, it was almost so realistic. You hear the shots go off. You see the president grab the side of his head and go down. And behind me in the grand stands, a lady is talking about somebody's hurt, somebody's hurt. And I'm trying to find my wife, my grandkids, and my son. And sitting beside me was Marc Fogel, the diplomat teacher who was in Russia. I'm trying to shield her. It was just one of those things, everybody's yelling, get down, get down. It was just like total chaos until the president stood up and put his hand in the air and said, fight. And it just like, all of a sudden, things came back together again. But this whole unwinding from whoever made the decision to come to Butler, and that's fine. I get all that. But I want to follow through on what happened from the time the decision was made until 11 minutes after six o'clock that afternoon when the shooter tried to take out President Trump. There was too much in between there that's chaotic, and trying to put it together now is going to be the biggest effort for the task force.",

And both Jason Crow and myself, we've requested that.I think we've gotten partially what we were looking for. But we don't have the transparency that I think in this case, and I think there's one thing that everybody should be concerned with. This has happened in the past, and people have walked away from either be the Kennedy assassination, or things that have happened after that, with never having a clear picture of what happened, who was in charge that day, and how do we make sure it doesn't happen again? The transparency is going to be the most important thing. We have the duty more than anything else. I know there's a lot of people trying to rush to get something out there. We have the responsibility that when we're done with this, the American people will then have the faith, the trust, and the confidence that they have to have on these type of task force and on these different agencies that were involved that day. I think when we stonewall and when we don't get things back right away, it starts to make you think, wait, what is it that they're trying to hide? Now, I have great faith in all our law enforcement people. I want to make sure people understand that. The local law enforcement people were on the ground that day. They were willing and able and just ready to do anything they could. I think that when we look at this and we go past it, it's still at the end of the day, it's how did we prepare for that day? How did we understand what it was going to look like from safety and security? And if there was a problem, what was the exit strategy? Because all those things come into play right now, and that's where I think when we're done with what we're going to do, we are going to have a very clear picture for the American people what happened, whose responsibility it lies on. And at the end of that, so what takes place now? What are -- what are the results of that? And what happens to those who did not carry out their job that day the right way? I think the American people are owed that, they deserve that, and we have the responsibility to get those answers for them.",
