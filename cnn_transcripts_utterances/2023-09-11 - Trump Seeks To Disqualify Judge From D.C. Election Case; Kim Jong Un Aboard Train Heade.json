Plus, Donald Trump wants the judge, overseeing his federal election case, out, now calling on her, to recuse herself. But it is up to the judge to actually make that call. And we'll tell you how she just responded. And tonight, two beams of light, remind us of what happened, 22 years ago, the deadliest attack on U.S. soil. But as the nation remembers 9/11, families of the victims are still asking why are they waiting for justice? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, House lawmakers are set to return to Capitol Hill. And it is time to prepare, for drama, potentially lots of it. There is a new feud that is brewing, within speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republican Party. His far-right flank is demanding an impeachment inquiry, into President Biden, or else he may not get their support, on a lot of really important deals, that could end up leaving the government shut down. Eight months, after the hardliners relented, and struck a deal, to give him the Speaker's gavel, McCarthy is now facing his biggest test yet. And those members have the ability, to oust him, from leadership, with just one snap vote. McCarthy is also facing pressure, from outside Capitol Hill, from former President Donald Trump, who is now openly previewing what a second Trump term could look like. And it includes enacting revenge, on his political opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: But remember, it's a -- it's a Democrat, charging his opponent. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. That means that if I win, and somebody wants to run against me, I call my Attorney General, I say, \"Listen. Indict him.\" (CROWD CHEERS)",

Do you support launching an impeachment inquiry, into President Biden? REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): Well, I mean, it's hard to say, at this point. I think there's a difference between an impeachment vote and an inquiry. The inquiry would give us another tool, in the toolbox, specifically, to look at Joe Biden's bank records. Everyone's screaming about the evidence, \"Where's the evidence?\" The bank records hold all of the evidence. And if the American people, Kaitlan, if you could see the Suspicious Activity Reports that I have seen, on the Biden family, you would too would probably support an impeachment inquiry, just as a tool, to get more information on, specifically the bank information, bank records, of Joe Biden, and his family members.

Or if you're him, or Putin, it is a meeting, for a good reason, they believe. Russia desperately needs to replenish its war arsenal, after a year and a half of bombing Ukraine. In return, North Korea desperately needs food and energy supplies, and also advanced weapons technology. Putin plans to roll out the red carpet, for this visit, as both strongmen are trying to project a sign of strength, as global critics say, it's really an act of desperation. Either way, for much of the world, it is a nightmare alliance, in the making.

I mean, is there anything that the United States can do, besides the White House issuing these warnings, to stop what appears to be this arms deal, in the making? REP.

Obviously, China is the dominant partner. Vladimir Putin is a junior partner. But it includes North Korea. It includes Iran. It includes countries, like Venezuela. And so, we don't have the luxury of sort of ignoring certain parts of the world. We need to have a global strategy, and we need to be engaged. We need to be in the business of recruiting our own allies and partners, because we actually have the luxury of having capable, competent allies and partners, and network of alliances that we've built, painstakingly, over the last few decades.

GALLAGHERSo, what we need to be signaling, in no uncertain terms is that an attempted PLA invasion, of Taiwan, A, would fail, and B, would be met with a united response, from the West. The consequences of taking such a destabilizing action, the consequences of undermining peace and stability, across the Taiwan Strait, would be catastrophic, for Xi Jinping. And that's another lesson of Ukraine, right? Obviously, deterrence initially failed in Ukraine. The cost has been enormous. We need to ensure that Taiwan's future doesn't become Ukraine's present, by doing things like arming Taiwan with Harpoon missiles, replenishing our stockpiles of long-range, precision fires, and doing what we tried to interrogate, earlier today, which is, what are the financial and economic levers, we can pull now, in order to put ourselves in a more advantageous position?

I think even the asset managers, or bankers, on Wall Street, who have a more dovish position, on China, than I do, or we do, recognize, they could live with a more aggressive set of restrictions, so long as there was predictability, so long as we legislated a solution that transcended this administration, or the next.So, we're not ping-ponging back and forth between different executive orders, or different regulation. And then, if there was an appropriate transition period, a glide path, to the new rules, I think, even people who don't have the view of the CCP threat, that we do, could live with that reality, which is why it's up to us, to step up and legislative a solution. And the final thing I'd say is the reasonable people can disagree, about where to draw the line, for economic engagement, with China. I don't think anyone can defend the idea that we should be allowing American retirees, to invest in Chinese military companies, that are building things, designed to kill Americans, in a future conflict.",
