They have not yet released a percentage, for example, of just how many of the Houthis' assets were degraded or destroyed in this operation, nor have we gotten a reliable count from the Pentagon just about just how many Houthi militants may have been killed in this operation if any. But for now, the U.S. says that they are reserving the right to again attack the Houthis if they continue to launch these attacks on Red Sea shipping. Now it's unclear if the Houthis can actually regroup quickly. The U.S. has said at this point they have not seen signs of any retaliation by the Houthis but the Houthis have emphasized that they do intend to retaliate. They are calling this an active barbaric aggression. We shall see whether Iran, which backs the Houthis, gets more involved in this in a significant way as well -- Becky.",

Security Council resolution to protect the free flow of commerce. So we'll see what the battle damage assessment is here of the actual strikes. I think the Pentagon and our allies are still taking a look at that to see exactly how much was destroyed but we have no doubt that the targets chosen or targets that were meant specifically to degrade the Houthis' ability to launch drones, to launch missiles, to store them and other capabilities that they would have, including, for instance, the radar sites to be able to guide these missiles into targets.

Frantic scenes haveemerged from a hospital in Khan Younis after a number of airstrikes. There are warning the video is graphic showing children among the injured. A spokesperson for the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza called the Israeli attacks massacres all across the enclave. He reported more than 100 deaths within 24 hours and more than 200 injured. CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, joining me now from Tel Aviv to discuss that and these strikes on Houthi targets because I've just had John Kirby on. Let's start with these attacks on Houthi targets. As John rightly pointed out, the Houthis have cloaked these attacks certainly at the outset on shipping in the Red Sea as attacks on Israeli ships or ships bound for Israel. They said this was in response to Israel's war on Hamas. Since then, of course, we have seen this escalate beyond attacks on Israeli ships. What do you make of what you just heard John Kirby say?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the idea that this will be followed up by other strikes if necessary, depending on theHouthis' actions really seems to encapsulate where we're at at the moment. It does seem to be on the Houthis and they're indicating that they will respond and it seems quite likely that they will. How they respond, and of course, it's some of their smaller boats that they use out on the Red Sea to try to target the shipping as well as the drones, which is an escalation, because, you know, if you go back a few years the Houthis were targeting shipping there in the Red Sea and they were using small speedboats packed with explosives or small fishing vessels with fighters, with RPGs, and slightly heavier weapons to try to target the shipping there. And that's the sort of response that the Houthis might be turning to now given that their heavier armaments may be damaged, maybe not all of them, but maybe a significant amount. So their ability to continue to harass shipping I think hasn't gone away because their intent is still there and I think it's also worth remembering that at the beginning before they were attacking the shipping in the Red Sea, they were actually firing long-range missiles at Israel that both U.S., British and other ships, other naval ships in the Red Sea were intercepting. The Saudis also were intercepting some of those missiles that were fired by the Houthis to Israel as well. So I think at this moment it really is what are the Houthis going to do next. And interesting as well to hear from the internationally recognized Yemeni government that's displaced from Yemen at the moment, but saying that the Houthis bear responsibility for dragging Yemen into the conflict because the Houthis are framing this and their partners, erstwhile partners really, in Hezbollah and Tehran and Hamas, framing this as an international attack on Yemen. Not on the Houthis specifically, but the Yemen government drawing attention to the fact that the Houthis are drawing Yemen into a confrontation, that this is about the Houthis and not the whole of Yemen.",

There are no international journalists inside Gaza. The 15 judges, International Court of Justice judges who heard the case, plus the two, one from Israel, one from South Africa, are faced with two extremely well- argued cases about what is and is not happening inside Gaza. In the end, the most urgent decision before them is going to be the request from the South Africans that they demand that Israel pause their activities in order that the court and the wider world can get access to Gaza, can determine whether or not these genocidal acts have been committed, that this court can continue its case of the substantive points made by South Africa. The question of whether the courts can make such a decision is of course the one that we're looking to here. It could come a little bit quickly.
