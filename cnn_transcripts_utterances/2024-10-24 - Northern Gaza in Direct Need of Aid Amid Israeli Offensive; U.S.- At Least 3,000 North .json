Now, images like this are absolutely going to send shockwaves across Turkey. It is no stranger to terror attacks, but it hasn't seen one like this in recent years. Authorities say that two assailants, two attackers were killed, a man and a woman, and that a judicial investigation is underway to identify those who are behind this attack. Now, the location is extremely significant. This aerospace firm is state-owned. It also provides military supplies, drones, airplanes to Turkey's military. One analyst described it as the crown jewel of Turkey's defense industry.

PKK has had an on again, off again peace process with Turkish government, which ended a decade ago. And since then there have been a number of attacks. But it's not been doing too much inside Turkey. Instead, it has consolidated in Syria and Iraq.Of course, this is an organization that goes back to the 1980s. It started out as a guerrilla movement fighting for an independent Kurdish homeland, but has been over the past few -- past decades seeking more of an autonomy inside Turkey. They run a very strong powerful organization in Syria, inside Syria, affiliated with anti- ISIS forces, fighting ISIS affiliated with U.S. Military inside Syria, partnering with U.S. Military in the fight against ISIS. And that has been a huge cause of tension in Turkey's relationship with its closest ally, the United States. So at this point, we're talking about an organization that isn't just in Turkey, but also in Syria and Iraq. Perhaps a very big movement. And Turkish government and PKK have been fighting an on again and off again war basically since 1980s, early '80s.",

When Erdogan is away, perhaps PKK is saying that a peace process without its own involvement simply with the leader of the organization who has been in jail for decades, would not work, that it needs to be the primary interlocutor or perhaps it's an offshoot inside the PKK, a more radical element that is wanting to sort of boycott, sabotage the peace process.

On Tuesday, he sat down with the Israeli prime minister for over two and a half hours, trying to convince the Israeli prime minister that now is the moment in the wake of the killing of Yahya Sinwar to end the war in Gaza and strike a deal to bring the hostages home.But the tone and the wording from the Israeli prime minister and his office in the wake of that meeting was very different from what U.S. officials would have hoped. The prime minister's office putting a lot of emphasis on the ongoing fight in Gaza, the potential for Israeli strikes against Iran, and only offering really just a fig leaf to this idea of ending the war in Gaza in the wake of Sinwar's killing, saying in the statement that Sinwar's killing, quote, \"is likely to have a positive influence on returning the hostages and achieving Israel's goals in the war in Gaza.\" Not quite a firm commitment to getting back to the negotiating table. We also know that the secretary of state pressed on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. And the reality is that we are watching that despite these efforts by the United States, they say that Israel is taking some steps to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. But it's clear from on the ground that we are nowhere close to that situation getting resolved. Instead the Israeli military is stepping up its military offensive in northern Gaza, where we are getting reports every single day of civilians being killed in in these strikes, killed by gunfire, and also, of course, that very little to no aid is actually making its way there as hospitals are also facing very dire conditions. In Lebanon we are also watching the Israeli military continuing to carry out heavier strikes, not only in southern Lebanon, including in the historic city of Tyre, but also in the Lebanese capital of Beirut once again. And so it's just clear that for now there is no real sense that things are going to de-escalate in this region for the moment. But nonetheless, even as the secretary of state tried to press on these kind of immediate term goals, he also is looking longer term. And that's what he was doing in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday as he sat down with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to talk not only about this opportunity to end the war in Gaza, but also to think about the day after the war in Gaza. And there's no question that Saudi Arabia is likely to play a strong role there. The question now, though, is when will we actually get to that day after the war. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.

The first family photo of the expanded BRICS alliance, a group now representing some 45 percent of the global population, as undeniable proof that the West has failed to isolate it. That is already a clear deliverable for Moscow. But whether the BRICS will succeed in its practical goal of coming up with new sanctions-busting payment systems that reduce the power of the U.S. dollar is a different question. But for Russia, the most sanctioned country on earth, this is urgent. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We do not refuse. We do not fight the dollar. But if we are not allowed to work with it, what should we do? Then we are forced to look for other alternatives, which is what is happening. We, while striving for cooperation, must still understand that the longer we live and work by someone else's rules and on someone else's platforms, the longer this transition to a new and more just economic and financial system will last.",
