The president uses the global stage to warn the rest of the world that failing to protect Ukraine means no nation is safe.Plus, consider the gauntlet thrown. Now speaker issues a challenge to conservatives whose demands could lead to a shutdown on first gavel, and you best not miss. And reasonable doubt, new CNN reporting undercuts a key narrative as told by a whistleblower is central to the Hunter Biden investigation. Testimony from other people inside the room, captures a different story. I'm Manu Raju, in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines in Inside Politics. Up first, the eyes of the world look toward the future. Whether the president of the United States has the power to write it. Today Joe Biden addressed the United Nations at a time of high-tension, tension with Iran, with China, with Russia and here at home. On Iran, Mr. Biden renewed a promise to make sure they never acquire nuclear weapons. On China, the president offered a familiar olive branch that competition does not have to mean conflict. And on Russia, he forcefully took aim at Moscow. Mr. Biden also put the rest of the world on notice that failing to rise to the challenge in Ukraine now imperils everyone's existence later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: If you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure. I respectfully suggest the answer is no. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But saying more broadly, that history does not have to predict what the future looks like.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. BIDEN: But our history need not dictate our future, with the conservative leadership, careful effort, adversaries can become partners. Overwhelming challenges can be resolved, and deep wounds can heal. So let us never forget that. When we choose to stand together and recognize the common hopes that bind all humanity, we hold our hands, the power and that power to bend that arc of history. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, thank you guys all for joining us. This morning the very newsworthy morning for the president's speech here for the United Nations General Assembly. Director Clapper, you know, the president is using this big stage at a time to send messages to really three people who were not there, China, Russia and, you know, Donald Trump, to some extent.

Of course, President Biden represents normalcy, continuity tradition, and espousing traditional values and policies that the United States always has, regardless who's in the White House.So, I think, for me, I couldn't help but wonder what they're thinking. And as far as the absences are concerned, well, Putin couldn't be there because if he were, he'd be arrested. And, you know, the others are there at least their representative. What that does prevent. Possibly it would be a sidebar meeting. I don't think even if Putin were there, I don't much sure the president meet with him. But so that's the sort of thing you lose.

So that's what the president is doing.He's also of course trying to turn it the conversation away from the economy, which he has struggled to break through on and other things. This is very reminiscent of what he said right before the midterm elections. I remember being in Philadelphia when he was giving a speech, about democracy, about the importance of democracy. So, he's trying to take the focus away from him, if you will, a criticism of his age or how he's handling the economy and give the wider stakes here. The 30,000-foot view about what is at stake on the ballot and what the Director Clapper was just saying, what the audience was wondering, everyone around the world is wondering. He said Americans back, but for how long? And can this really be happening in the U.S.? So, I think that is why the president is drawing this contrast right now.",

And we can't allow China just to speak for them. And so that's what a lot of the speech was about. But then he pivoted to the end to really cap it off, I think in, you know, kind of the crowd pleaser for the majority there, which is that Ukraine matters. It matters not just for Europe; it matters for the world. And I think that that really focusing on sovereignty, territorial integrity and human rights, you did not hear him talk a lot about democracy in this setting, because that puts off part of the global south. So again, he's kind of threading this needle, where he has to talk about democracy, but he also has to appeal to the Global South, which really is much more focused on sovereignty and like what about us.

There's a lot of disagreement on display today. During that closed door party meeting, hardliners stood up and said, they want more spending cuts. Others stood up and said, they need to pass something anything to fund the government, so they don't get jammed by the Senate.

MATT GAETZ, (R-FL): Right now, my full effort is assembling a large enough coalition to defeat the Donald's continuing resolution, but we're certainly heading in that direction. REP. MIKE LAWLER, (R-NY): The clown show of colleagues that refuse to actually govern does not want to pass the CR. I will do everything we need to make sure that a CR passes. REP.

They can't reach an agreement on among Republicans. If they don't reach a deal, even on a short-term bill to keep the government open.

And then Kevin Cramer, who is a senator from North Dakota, a conservative senator. Bacon, more moderate than Cramer, but Cramer also expressing his frustration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

And what frustrates me the most about it that leads to this kind of dysfunction is that as a conservative, it doesn't result in more conservative outcomes.

And then there's a question about the speaker's job. Matt Gaetz continues to threaten to force a vote, seeking the speakers out there, one member can call for that vote, Gaetz threatens to do that. It sounds like, he probably will this week, maybe next week.

But when you're in the majority, and occasionally, you have to vote yes. And, you know, sort of be a pragmatic as Senator Cramer would say, I don't know. I'll be a little skeptical here and saying, I've been in this town a long time, and we always seem on the cusp of a shutdown. And we've been there a few times, this certainly feels like it. But one thing Republicans know, I was talking to someone who's very close to former speaker, Newt Gingrich. And he's talking to a lot of members, and he said, they know that a shutdown and an impeachment, not necessarily good politics for the party. So, I'm optimistic that wiser heads can prevail.
