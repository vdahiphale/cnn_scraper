Sunak and Starmer went head-to-head on Wednesday in their last debate before the July 4th election.Starmer says his Labour Party is best suited to lead the country out of a cost-of-living crisis and soaring inflation. Sunak accused his rival of not being straightforward about his plans for taxation, women's rights and illegal migrants. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And that is the choice for you. Do not surrender our borders to the Labour Party. KEIR STARMER, U.K. LABOUR PARTY LEADER: Why are record numbers still coming under your watch, Prime Minister? How on earth can you say it's working? You put the scheme in place, the flights could go off. I noticed you called the election, by the way, before any flights could actually get off, but it could be tested. Interesting timing. But if this was such a deterrent, why is it obviously, obviously not working? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER (on camera): Be sure to watch CNN's special coverage of the U.K. elections on July the 4th, starting before 10 p.m. London time, right here on CNN. We're just hours away from the biggest event so far of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The 90-minute face-off will take place at CNN's world headquarters in Atlanta. It's the earliest general election debate ever and the first between a president and a former president. It's also the first with a convicted felon. There's no clear leader in CNN's latest presidential Poll of Polls and there's been no shortage of voter dissatisfaction with both candidates. There will be some important differences tonight from previous debates. First, there will be no live audience. Second, the candidates' microphones will be muted when their speaking time has ended. CNN's Phil Mattingly and Victor Blackwell have details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF U.S. DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to the set of the CNN presidential debate. We want to give our viewers a sense of the rules of the debate so that when they watch it, they can understand how President Biden and President Trump will be engaging with each other. Just after 9:00 p.m. Eastern, President Biden will enter from the right side of your screen. President Trump will enter from the left side of your screen. The podiums are eight feet apart. Directly across from them the moderators, CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Now, a reminder that this is a television studio. There's no audience. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and one minute for responses and rebuttals. At the moderator's discretion, there may be an additional minute for follow-ups, clarifications, or responses. So how does a candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidate's field of view or the timing lights. When the light show yellow, there are 15 seconds left and candidates answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are five seconds left, and when the display is solid red the time is up. At that point, the candidate's microphone will be turned off and the other candidate will have their microphone turned on. My colleague, Victor Blackwell, has more on that.",

They involve the production of the 787 Dreamliner jet at a supplier facility in Wichita, Kansas. The whistleblower is a former mechanic who says he was fired months after raising the red flag about the issue. He says he saw workers drilling holes too big for what's known as forward pressure bulkheads on the 787s. According to the whistleblower, the problem may affect at least 10 airplanes and could lead to, in his words, catastrophes.

He, his employer and the U.S. government all vigorously deny the spying allegations against him. But Russia appears determined to press ahead despite official U.S. objections. A new statement from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow says Evan did not commit any illegal acts and should not have been arrested at all. This trial isn't about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We're talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals, the statement adds. With the conflict raging in Ukraine, Russia began a crackdown at home on free speech, silencing dissidents or forcing them into exile. It's against this backdrop that Gershkovich was arrested on a reporting assignment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. This is video from the website of the tank factory there, where Russian prosecutors allege Gershkovich acted, quote, on the instructions of the CIA to collect secret information, although no evidence has been made public. The trial will take place in the city, which is about a thousand miles from Moscow, amid an outcry.",
