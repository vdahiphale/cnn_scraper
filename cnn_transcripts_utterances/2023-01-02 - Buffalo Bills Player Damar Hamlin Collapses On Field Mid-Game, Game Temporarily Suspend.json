It is incredibly disturbing to watch what has happened.We don't yet have all the information on his current condition but we do know that an ambulance was brought on to the field. And according to the ESPN broadcast, Hamlin received CPR on the field before being driven out of the stadium in that ambulance. Bob Costas joins us now on the phone. Bob, so scary to see that, to watch consecutive breaks from the game, players, on the field, huddling together, crying. We don't know all that is happening or what has caused the injury exactly, or what the nature of it is, but have you ever seen anything like this tonight? BOB COSTAS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice over):  Well, there have been circumstances in the past, Darryl Stingley, a receiver for the Patriots, was paralyzed from the neck down after a hit in the game against the Raiders in the 1970s. There have been players who collapsed on the field because of cardiac difficulties. A player named Chuck Hughes with the Detroit Lions, back in the 70s died on the field, J.V. Cain, who was the receiver for the then-St. Louis Cardinals now play in Arizona, a similar thing during training camp, but nothing exactly like this. The play did not look that out of the ordinary. People might think if they weren't watching the game that there was some sort of helmet-to- helmet contact. The young man, Damar Hamlin made the tackle. Tee Higgins, the receiver for the Bengals, actually hits him in the chest. Nothing dirty about the play, according to the rules. This kind of contact happens all the time in football. But Hamlin, actually, although he made the tackle, took the brunt of the collision squarely in his chest. You wouldn't think, if you watch a lot of football, that there was anything that unusual about that. But he got up, took a couple of steps, wobbled, and fell backwards. As you said a moment ago, Laura, they came out on the field, they administer CPR. You could tell by the expressions on the faces of players from both teams, his Bills teammates, and the opponents on the Bengals, that something very serious had happened here. And they have suspended the game, and from all indications, this game is not could be played tonight. They had shots of some of the players and the tunnel leading to locker room, they'd already taken their uniforms off, some of them walking around in skivvies. And the Bills being the visiting team, they'll have to travel back if they don't play the game tomorrow, for example, in Cincinnati. And it looked at the Bills equipment people were loading up some of the equipment, as if there would be no more football played tonight because we don't know what the outcome of this is going to be. It could very well be. Well, you don't been an alarmist. I'm certainly not going to speculate with such sketchy information, but it could very well be that the young man's life is in the balance. So, nobody has any appetite to play football after what they saw happen on the field tonight.",

      "sentences": "And, Bob, we are learning right now that the game has officially now been postponed. In fact, there had been some footage earlier before the game. Remember, this just happened in the first quarter, everyone. This is the first quarter of play. And there was photos of him greeting his family members before the game, embracing them, taking selfies, hugging. This is, I think, a 24-year-old man, young man, who was only drafted in 2021, so a very, very new player to the professional leagues.But I want to bring in for a second -- please stay on the line, Bob. We need to talk to you soon. But I want to bring in CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner. Dr. Reiner, I'm so glad that you are talking to us today, because when you are looking at this and you are seeing what transpired. And we're all, I mean, myself, a layman, is looking at this as a fan of football and watching an injury transpire, not quite understanding what could have caused somebody to stand began and then collapse and have CPR administered. Do you have any insight when you saw this played? What was your instinct telling you? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST:  Yes, hi, Laura. First of all, my thoughts are with Damar Hamlin. This is a life-threatening event. Almost certainly what happened to Mr. Hamlin is something called commotio cordis, which is basically a cardiac arrest caused by a sharp blow to the chest at precisely the wrong moments. The heart is governed by electrical impulses. And if the hearts is struck at basically the wrong millisecond in the usual cycle of these electrical impulses, it can cause a catastrophic arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation. And that would take about six seconds for the person to pass out. And when you look at the tape, Mr. Hamlin made the tackle. He got hit in the chest. He got it right over the heart. Let's start at the chest. That was the blow. He got up one or two seconds later, and one or two seconds later, he collapsed. And that's how long it takes for your to pass out after your heart fibrillates.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, the heart beats in a coordinated fashion. When the heart fibrillates, when the ventricle, the big thick pumping chamber of the heart, fibrillates, instead of squeezing rhythmically and hard, it quivers. And when the heart muscle quivers, it can't pump blood. And when it can't pump blood, the blood pressure drops to zero, and that takes about six seconds. And that is almost exactly a timeframe for Mr. Hamlin to go down again. And that can be resuscitated.",

      "sentences": "The way to resuscitate a person that has this event is you need to defibrillate them with an AED, with an automatic external defibrillator. And until one is provided, until one is made available, and every NFL stadium has several of these devices, there's almost certainly one on the field level of every NFL stadium, one would do CPR. And CPR basically gives you the time to defibrillate a patient. But the clock is ticking.And every minute the chance of resuscitating somebody with a cardiac arrest either from this event, what are called commotio cordis or from a heart attack-induced event like this, every minute in delays to defibrillation reduces the likelihood of survival by about 10 percent. So, time is of the essence. Now, you can lengthen that time a bit with affective CPR. But the only way to reverse this is with defibrillation. To me, it seems pretty clear that that is very likely what happened to Mr. Hamilt.",

Just hearing from Dr. Reiner and the expertise that he brings and just watching, as you mentioned when we were speaking earlier, about this wasn't something that people were hearing about this as a helmet-to-helmet contact or what you're accustomed to seeing in terms of the form a concussion and beyond, the idea of this arrhythmia, this millisecond that would disrupt the electrical impulses and what would happened, I mean, do you have a sense of how long Damar Hamlin was on that field? The doctor is talking about every minute reduces a 10 percent reduction in one's ability for it to survive.COSTAS (voice over):  I don't have an exact timeline and I wouldn't want to put something out there that would be irresponsible. I'd actually begun watching the game casually and then I turned away from it and I got a text saying something has happened, and I came back to it. But by that point, he was down on the field and the ambulance had already arrived. So, I can't give you an estimate between how long, how much time expired between the administering of CPR and when they might have been able to defibrillate him. But as Dr. Reiner has said, every NFL stadium has that medical capacity on hand. So, there is little doubt that he was defibrillated, however, we don't know what the outcome of it is. But they have all the necessary medical expertise there but every situation is different and we'll just have to see how this one turns out.",

And still with us is CNN Contributor Bob Costas. He's still with me. Let me begin with you, Dante, on this, because you were actually watching this game live and you saw this play happen. And you initially thought it was just a routine hit, nothing to worry about until you saw him fall. What went through your mind? DONTE STALLWORTH, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  Well, it was a routine play. It was a catch and tackle and players both jumped up. And I'm always watching the players after the play because I like a little trash talk, and that's what kind of what I was expecting from both players. When I saw Damar fall back to the ground after standing up for a couple seconds, I just knew that it was something wrong. And after they delayed for a while and he was lying down on the ground, and then you heard the announcers say that they were administering CPR, that's when it became concerned. Because I -- more concerned, because I knew that -- I played in the NFL for ten years, coached, and I've never seen anything like that before in my life on any level, high school, college or pro.",

      "sentences": "Nausea was going to my gut. My heart is still racing. It hits home for me. I played six of my seasons in Buffalo as a safety, in the same position as Damar. I have a titanium plate and four screws in my neck. I was knocked unconscious several times. One, I didn't remember what happened until the next day. My teammate at Buffalo, Kevin Everett, we were covering together. He was paralyzed.The ambulance came on the field, players crying, same sort of scene in college when I was playing for Stanford. Our running back made a collision with Curtis Williams of the University of Washington. He was paralyzed from the neck down. Two years later, he passed away. The scenes are haunting. The thing I think we need to take away from this is one that's a reminder of how precious life is. Two, it is a reminder that there is progress being made. All the talks about safety, players' safety, all the lives that have been lost, all the lives that have been altered from players who have played this game, perhaps they are not in vain. Because you know what, Laura, a year ago, five years ago, certainly not ten years ago, they would not of stop the game. Donte will tell you the ambulance would come out, take you off the field, take some smelling salts, and you say, buckle up, let's go, next snap mentality. That's what the players have, that's what the coaches have, that's what the league always had, disposable players, you put them in a next man up mentality, right? We are not seeing that right now. So, if there's something positive that can come from this, the ultimate positive is obvious, the more Hamlin is going to be healthy, safe again. But it is also that players' safety are personal health is now more important than it used to be. And that is a trickledown effect. That is going to be important to the college level. That is going to be specifically important to the high school and to the youth levels, where these coaches, they can't just throw the kids out there and tell them, toughen up, get out there, buckle up, let's go, we are understanding this is a different world that we are living in now because there's been a paradigm shift in terms of player health and safety and how precious our lives are and that the game is not worth it in the end when it comes to serious issues like this. I would like to just say, hopefully, we can get some collective thoughts and prayers together for Damar Hamlin because that can be powerful. You saw the players doing it immediately when they saw how drastic the situation was. He is in critical condition. That has been last word. But we hope that he can make a full and speedy recovery.",

Then at 9.18 p.m. the game is temporarily suspended, 9.25 p.m. the ambulance leaves the stadium, 10.01 the game is officially postponed.

I mean, this is somebody who grew up in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, went to Pittsburgh for college, was named a class four A defensive player of the year, has been in the league for two years, just 24 years old. I remember seeing earlier today him greeting some of his members of his family today who were at the stadium. I think you also mentioned, Bob, I believe his mother may have ridden in the ambulance with him. As a mother myself, thinking about how I don't want, I'll be honest with you, I don't want my son to play football for the reasons that Christine has spoken about. I know that that is probably an unpopular position to have, but it's one that this mama bear has.

It appears apparent to them that this is some sort of cardiac event, which was triggered by a blow to the chest as Hamlin made the tackle and collided with T. Higgins.Most of the focus of what we've been talking about concerning the nature of football has been on CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and the inherent danger of concussions and even sub-concussive hits over a long period of time. And the rather substantial percentage of players who report some sort of neurological or cognitive difficulty at some point down the line, often in early middle age, or even sooner in some cases. Some of the most famous players in football history have reported that, with early onset dementia and whatnot as a result of having played football. It took a long time for the obvious to be recognized. If fighters could be so-called punch drunk from blows to the head, well, why wouldn't football players who take blows to the head, even though they're wearing helmets, take repeated blows to the head? But this particular situation doesn't fall into that category. Football is a violent game and what happened tonight falls under the broad category of that violence. But something like what happened to Damar Hamlin is not nearly as chronic a situation as by percentage as frequent a circumstance as CTE is, not even close. That doesn't lessen the severity of it. And what all of us are feeling having watched something so terrible unfold and fingers crossed that he survives, and is able to carry on with his life, if not his football career. But just as a matter of fact, this may fall under the broad heading of the violent nature of football, which I am not here to justify.
