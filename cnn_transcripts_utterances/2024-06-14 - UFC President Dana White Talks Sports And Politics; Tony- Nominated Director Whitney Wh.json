Look, it's as much about raising money as it is about trying to get people excited for Biden's re-election campaign, which I have to tell you has been quite a challenge, at least according to the polls. Now, there seems to be two types of celebrity supporters for Biden. One, shall we call the raging bull type that is vocally brawling against Donald Trump and all of his supporters.

They're actually more than 300 female fighters in the UFC. And so, I wonder when you're watching the WNBA and other organizations building, what would you say to them to promote, to elevate women in pro sports? D. WHITE: Well, I have season tickets to the aces here in Vegas. So I'm, I'm a supporter of the WNBA and of a lot of, you know, I'm friends with many women who play in the WNBA. And I think it's great. All the controversy, all the smack talk, all the bickering and all that stuff, it just, it just all helps build the sport. It's good for everybody. It's not bad. And the UFC, I mean, once I met Ronda Rousey and started to bring women into the equal pay, equal rounds, I mean, everything is the same for the men and the women here at the UFC and always has been since the door was open to women. And I think what's going on in the WNBA right now is great. Even all the negativity and the bad talk, people eat it up. They love it. It's basically like a, like a daily soap opera that people can't wait. And everybody has an opinion and everybody, Caitlin Clark, you know, it's all good stuff. It's good.
