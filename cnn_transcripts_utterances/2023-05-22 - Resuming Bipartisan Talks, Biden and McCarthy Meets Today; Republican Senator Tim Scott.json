On Capitol Hill, negotiators picked up their conversation, but it's really unclear if any progress has been made. Both sides said that the talks on Sunday went well, but timing is clearly running out. The United States could run out of money to pay its bills as soon as June 1st, which is 10 days from now.The next hour, South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott is expected to officially launch his 2024 presidential campaign. That announcement is set to take place in his hometown of North Charleston. Scott launched a presidential exploratory committee back in April. He filed the paperwork necessary with the FEC last week. And his announcement comes as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is also expected to jump into the race sometime this week as well. John.",

Tim Parlatore who played a key role on the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation says he left because of infighting in the group. He singled out one particular member of the legal team, Boris Epshteyn. Parlatore claims that Epshteyn prevented the rest of the lawyers from doing what they could to defend the former President.CNN's Paula Reid had a fantastic interview with Parlatore over the weekend. It really was revealing. Just give us the headlines, Paula.",

And it was fascinating because he pointed the finger directly at Boris Epshteyn. Saying that Boris was making it impossible for the former president's legal team to properly represent their client. But I'm going to let Tim explain in his own words what was going on. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIM PARLATORE, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY:  Well, sure. I mean, there was -- he served as, kind of, a filter to prevent us from getting information to the client and getting information from the client. In my opinion, he was not very honest with us or with the client on certain things. There were certain things like the searches that he had attempted to interfere with. And then more recently, as we are coming down to the end of this investigation where Jack Smith and, ultimately, Merrick Garland is going to make a decision as to what to do, as we put together our defense strategy to help educate Merrick Garland as to how best to handle this matter, he was preventing us from engaging in that strategy.

But it's clear, he's raising the suggestion that his now former colleague may have tried to interfere in this investigation. Now, some of the other things I wanted to talk to him about, John, were things that his client may or may not have done, especially, did he actually declassify these materials that ended up down at Mar-a-Lago.By my count, we have at least four different public explanations for what happened to the documents. Some associate to the former president has said, he had a standing declassified order. The former president has said, he declassified them with his mind. At least one of his attorneys has suggested that he followed to a process to a point then at the end, just stopped following the traditional process. And Tim had Congress that all of those materials ending up down in Florida was just the result of the chaos at the end of the administration. So, we went through each of these explanations, and I was not able to get an answer of the how, when and where Trump may have declassified these materials. And the other big thing I wanted to get an answer on is you may remember at our town hall, our colleague Kaitlan Collins, asked the former president if he had ever shown classified materials to anyone else? And his first response was, not really. Well, I followed up with Tim on that and he said that there was no evidence to suggest that the former president showed classified documents to anyone. But again, a lot more questions than answers there.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, John. And you know, Harlan Crow, you know, he's this billionaire who doesn't like that he's been dragged into this issue. And it's an ethics issue with the Supreme Court but also a potential conflict of interest. So, let me just cut to the chase and give you the best line from the piece. As you said, very extensive, in \"The Atlantic\". I have never, nor would I ever, think about talking about matters that relate to the judiciary with Justice Clarence Thomas. It's not realistic for two people to be friend and not talk about their jobs from time to time.So, that's the knot (ph) of it, John. But I would say, stepping back, the main thing he wanted to make clear is that he has admired Clarence Thomas. His relationship with him is purely born of friendship and admiration. He talked a bit about the money that he had given to the Thomas family as he bought a home that Clarence Thomas' mother had lived in, in Georgia. He talked about meeting his mother, having many deals with the Thomas family. And the way he cast it, again, John, was one of, you know, deep dear friendship, and one where he really wanted the make clear he was not trying to influence the justice. You know, obviously, Harlan Crow has been invested in many ways in trying to -- in conservative causes and trying to move the judiciary to the right. But he said the conversations he had with Clarence Thomas were not of that nature. If they talked about work, they would do it in a casual way. You could feel throughout this piece that he did with a very prominent writer from \"The Atlantic\", who happens to be from Dallas where Harlan Crow is based, he mainly wanted to sort of explain himself and explain the roots of his friendship with many prominent public officials, including someone like Clarence Thomas. He did not answer questions, I should say, about other financial transactions or benefits he might have bestowed on Clarence Thomas other than the ones that have already come out. And he also did not want to talk about anything else he had done for other justices. And just to refresh everybody's memory, this all started when \"ProPublica\" did these pieces about Clarence Thomas taking these trips with Harlan Crow on his, you know, mega yacht, super jet across the globe.
