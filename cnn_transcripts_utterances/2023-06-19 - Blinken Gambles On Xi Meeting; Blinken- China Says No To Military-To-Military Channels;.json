Plus, reckless, a security threat, a consummate narcissist, two former top Trump officials warned that another Trump presidency would endanger the country, but only some of his GOP rivals showed they're willing to confront him head on. And a debate from afar over race on this Juneteenth holiday, the first black President and the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate disagree on how much progress America has really made on race. I am Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and inside politics.Up first, the American Secretary of State takes a big trip and a big risk. Today, Antony Blinken stood shoulder to shoulder with China's Xi Jinping, that a handshake in a 35-minute meeting was even possible. That sends a signal that China and the U.S. are serious about taking the teeth out of tough talk these past few months. Listen to the U.S. Secretary of State as he strikes a realistic but generally positive tone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, you'll recall that this was actually supposed to be a meeting that the Secretary had planned to make earlier this year in February. But, there was that Chinese spy balloon that traversed over continental U.S. The Biden Administration shot it down. The Secretary had to postpone his visit. The Chinese were very angered by that. They said it was an overreaction. And so, that is where we are today. Finally, that rescheduled meeting four months later is happening.So, it is interesting that this is happening while President Biden's campaign is gearing up. But, it's really a coincidence that this is happening at the same time. And frankly, a meeting with President Xi, a visit here to Beijing is going to open up the Biden Administration to some criticism from Republicans. We have already seen that from Republicans on Capitol Hill leading into this visit, saying that it wasn't worth it for the Secretary to just be going to Beijing without making sure that there were some victorious things that the United States got out of China on this visit. But, when you listen to the Secretary of State today, he was very clear in saying that this was a critical meeting for the two countries, because this is the first time, first of all, that a Biden cabinet official has visited Beijing at all during the Biden Administration, two and a half years in. And he believes that it was important that they agreed on the need to essentially reduce tensions between the two countries to keep open dialogue to make sure that competition doesn't veer into conflict. Now, one thing that they set out to accomplish was to set up military- to-military channels of communication. There are not regular military- to-military channels right now between these two superpowers, and that is a major issue. But, they are not leaving with a victory on that front. Here is what Secretary Antony Blinken told me earlier today when I asked him about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That doesn't mean that they're not going to get worse over time. And it shows that the Biden Administration is willing to do things for China, like go and send the Secretary of State to Beijing, without getting really anything in return, no American citizens back, no real substantive progress on things like fentanyl or climate change, or any of the other things we're supposed to be working on together. So, that's not good. But, at least, we stopped the fall of relationship, which is better than nothing.I think what you're going to see now is the economic officials are going to come in. Here comes Janet Yellen, the Secretary of the Treasury. Here comes Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of the Commerce, possible 2028 presidential candidate. And that's what Beijing really wants. They don't like Tony Blinken. They don't like Lloyd Austin. They want the Econ people to come. And of course, there is a huge lobbying effort going on in Washington now from Wall Street and the Chamber of Commerce, as the elections get near to both Democrats and Republicans to say, hey, do you want your campaign coffers filled? Well, we'd better get rid of some of these tariffs, better to get back to business with China. You don't want a Cold War. And Biden and Democrats and Republicans are affected by that.

And this wasn't necessarily a traditional bilateral visit, given the fact it had been cancelled before, given how things have been on a downward trajectory for the better part of really the President's entire time in office, but certainly over the course of the last couple of months.I think when you talk to White House officials and national security officials, they acknowledge, a, that's the reality, and b, that in their view, particularly when you look at what else the administration is doing on the economic side related to how they've addressed China with trade, how they've worked on export restrictions in technology, specifically, but also in some of their military alliances that they put together, and how they've kind of driven Europe more towards their position on China, that they felt like this was a moment where speaking, having relationship, reopening lines of communication and setting the groundwork to have the economic officials go over as well, was more important than trying to secure major deliverables. I still, to Josh's point, the most fascinating thing is the military- to-military contact or complete lack thereof. But, I think there are some inside the administration who feel like maybe people assume that China is a monolithic entity where the PLA and President Xi, while he is certainly the leader of the country and has underscored that 10 times over by the fact he once again is in power, one or anybody else in a very long time, that there are differences there --",

We saw that over the course of the last week as he spoke to climate groups, gun safety groups, and also held that first rally with the unions which has been a very mainstay group for him as he has run for office in the past.
