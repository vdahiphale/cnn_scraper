In return for the freed Israeli hostages, Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners.Videos obtained by CNN show the crowd waving Palestinian and Hamas flags and carrying the newly released prisoners through the streets of the West Bank. Other former prisoners hugged friends and loved ones. The released Palestinians included women, girls and male teenagers. A 150 Palestinian prisoners, again including women, girls and male teenagers, they are set to be released during the four-day truce.",

However, the Israelis also confirming that some trucks have made it today. This is the second day of this humanitarian pause, but they say that included four fuel trucks and four gas trucks. CNN is aware of the discrepancies in these numbers. We're trying to figure out exactly what happened, but that's part of this ramping up in the number of, in the amount of aid coming into the Gaza Strip. It was part of the condition of this temporary truce, and it's an important one because so many people badly need this food, this medicine, this cooking gas in the Gaza Strip. 1.7 million people displaced, and this is how serious it is. Listen to this one individual who's been waiting just for something to cook with. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EZZEDDINE ABU OMEIRA, GAZA RESIDENT (through translation): Gas cooking is essential for everyone in Gaza. Nobody can cook or do anything without gas. We hope that they will provide us with some gas in the next two days. So, all the people are hoping and ready for it to make their lives easier. (END VIDEO CLIP) MADOWO: And this is still seen as a success by the Egyptians who say that part of the reason why this aid can go in is because Israel agreed to stop this drone surveillance flights over Gaza. At the same time today, this Egyptian official is telling CNN, Becky, that 17 injured Palestinians have crossed over into Egypt for medical treatments.",

And this deal is very specifically carved for Israelis and dual nationals. Of course, many of those Americans who are held hostage are actually dual nationals, so can be included in the body of this deal and that is what the U.S. administration who I'm told have worked very, very closely with the mediators here in Qatar are hoping to achieve.No word yet as to whether Americans would be involved in today's releases. What we are hearing from Israeli officials is that the number of hostages released today could be as many as 14, although diplomatic sources that I've spoken to here are slightly nervous about putting that number on what we may see today. But as I say, we got a proof of concept yesterday. This thing now needs to happen again today. With the same process, actually, you know, went to a certain extent relatively smoothly yesterday. What we have heard, of course, from the hostage families who have been extremely angry with the Israeli government about the fact that not everybody is involved in this deal. We have heard from those who have soldiers held captive that the fight will still go on. This is a temporary truce to allow for the release of some civilian hostages. But at the end of the day, the Israelis have said, the fighting will continue and could continue for at least two months. What does the U.S. administration make of that threat? The restarting of this conflict after this pause and what's the talk behind the scenes about the relationship between the U.S. and the Israeli government at this point?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is certainly a very delicate and complex choreography. But we did see yesterday that it was able to work. And that was such a critical element of yesterday. Beyond the joy and the relief that so many of these families who got their loved ones out yesterday felt, there was also the hope that it offered for the families of the other hostages who still remain in Gaza.And that's because it showed that this whole complex system that has been the result of weeks of negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the Qatari government as well as the United States, it showed that this process that has been built out can actually work, that Hamas was able to deliver on its end of the bargain to deliver these hostages to the Red Cross, who then took them to the Rafah crossing, who then took them to Israeli officials at the Karim Shalom crossing. And that crossing is right behind me here, where you see those lights in the background, that is where that Karim Shalom crossing is, where those 13 Israeli hostages made their first steps back onto Israeli soil. From there, they were able to take this road that you see behind me here. We saw them actually go by, and they were taken to a nearby Air Force base. And so, we saw this whole process unfold before our eyes yesterday as it was going on, and it does present the opportunity for the future. Now, I'm told that today an Israeli official telling me that the Israeli government expects that 14 hostages will be released by Hamas in exchange for 42 Palestinian prisoners as well as of course the continuation of this very fragile truce between Israel and Hamas in order to facilitate this release. We don't know for sure where exactly they will come through but there is a very strong suggestion that it will be once again through this Karim Shalom crossing. This Karim Shalom crossing is just less than two miles from the Rafah crossing and then you have another option which is the Nitzana border crossing between Israel and Egypt. That one is significantly further away but it is also an option that Israeli officials have told us exists as a possibility between in order for these hostages to get from Egypt into Israel.",

We have our own, of course, political issues here, it related to the support for Israel, and what's happening in Gaza, and the divisions that you're seeing, in particular, within the Democratic Party.They are putting pressure on the Biden White House, to push the ceasefire aspect of this. So, the Biden administration certainly wants to focus on not just the hostage exchanged, but what came with the hostage exchange, which is, of course, the movement of humanitarian relief, and the ceasefire. If you can extend it past the four days, that is actually good news, in particular, for the Palestinians. So, our focus on the limited number of U.S. hostages is not going to resonate at the table, so to speak, as much as Israel's voice will be to get there, in particular, women and children out. For Hamas, their strategy is, the more that we remain engaged in negotiations, the better off they are, because they are getting more out of this than the Israelis are. So, if we get our hostages back, they may -- they may incorrectly perceive that we will be less interested in this fight. So, unfortunately, these people are our pawns. It's immoral, what is happening, I don't want to pretend otherwise. But they are going to have to wait out some calculation by Hamas, that it's worth releasing the U.S. hostages for limited political gain on Hamas's part and the risk in Hamas's calculation that the United States may lose interest in promoting the ceasefire if we get our -- if we get our hostages back.",

I mean, this is what's so hard for people to realize. People are clamoring from the outside, we need to do more, we need to do more. Actually, lots is being done. You just don't want it to be public less the party that you're negotiate -- negotiating with gets upset or walks away from the table, because of something that was said. So, the clamoring on the political side makes no sense to me. Anyone who's been involved with hostage negotiations knows that quiet may mean a lot is going on. And they're going to vote first of all, we don't know everything about all of our hostages yet. So, part of it is just information, trying to find out where everyone is and who is still alive. I suspect that some of the people that have gone missing are not alive anymore. And then, second, see where we can prioritize the release of these hostages in this wave that we're expecting, and then, whether there is more ways. Remember, yesterday was just proof of concept.
