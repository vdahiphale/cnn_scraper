Good evening.We begin with more devastation inside Gaza, as Israel's military pushes further into the south, expanding its ground fight against Hamas. The Israeli Defense Forces are now telling civilians in parts of southern and northern Gaza to evacuate as it carries out hundreds of air strikes. The U.N. estimates that more than 1.8 million people, nearly 80 percent of the population of Gaza, have had to leave their homes for safety since October 7th. CNN's Matthew Chance is on the ground in Tel Aviv and has the latest on the fighting inside Gaza.",

There are dramatic images of another Israeli strike on the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza after strikes there on Saturday killed dozens, according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry.Israel, which is, of course, vowing to destroy Hamas and secure the release of more than 130 hostages still held in Gaza, says that it's identified and destroyed hundreds of Hamas tunnels. It's also started focusing its strikes on southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people have fled in recent weeks to escape the intensive military operation in the north. In a bid to limit the mounting civilian casualties, estimated at more than 15,000 people by Palestinian officials so far, Israel has issued these maps dividing the Gaza Strip into what it calls evacuation sectors, multiple blocks, each assigned a number from which Palestinian civilians are ordered to leave ahead of an Israeli military action. But poor internet and communications in Gaza means it is unclear frankly if the warnings are getting through. Amid international concern, Israel has also been allowing aid trucks carrying humanitarian relief into the Gaza Strip with essential supplies of food and water and medicine. But the Israeli military is vowing to keep up its pressure on Hamas, saying it will wage its campaign as strongly and as thoroughly in southern Gaza as it did in the north. Back to you, Jim.",

Israel claims one of those strikes killed a senior Hamas commander, who helped plan the 7 October attacks. He was, perhaps, one dead among many, many others. This woman lost her daughter and grandchildren and names them all. And may God judge those watching us die, she cries. It's a similar scene in Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza. More wounded. Many of them children. And more dead. Many of them children. They bombed an entire street, says Saad. He pulled his brother Mohamed (PH) from under the rubble. But his brother, Mohamed (PH), was dead, says Saad, let me say good-bye to him. My father has been killed, cries this boy after a strike on the Jabalya refugee camp Sunday.

So there's a pretty good overview.And as you know, Jim, we've had forces, we've had special operators in Yemen in that area for the last several years. They left about a year ago. But I'm sure there are some pretty good targeting data, and also, our capability to do signals intelligence, and overhead imagery to find where some of these launches are coming from, and there will be strikes against proportional targets, as we always do, to send the message to try and get them to stop.

But you have a constricted battlefield, if you will, and there's no relief valve, there's no capability for the civilians to leave. So Israel is trying to do the best they can to get Palestinians into those so-called safe zones.But as Ben reported, you know, it's hard when the internet is out, when there's not the capability to communicate, to push them into different sectors. But from the very beginning of this campaign, you know, it started in the north because those were the tunnels that Hamas was using to launch missiles. Those are the ones with the closest ranges to places like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. But there are certainly tunnels throughout the country. And what you're going to see, we've been talking about Gaza City in the north. Below that is a city called -- an urban area called Deir Al-Balah, below that is Khan Younis, below that is Rafah. And Israel has portrayed in each one of those four urban areas the amount of underground tunnels, the subterranean activities. And as the Palestinian population move from north to south to get out of the way, guess what, so do the Hamas terrorists. You know, they blend in with the people and it's a different phase of their campaign to go to these three other cities. So, yes, I believe and I believe from the very beginning, we're going to see Israel go into those three other urban areas because there are tunnels underneath, they've confirmed that, and they know there's terrorists and perhaps the hostages are in underground tunnels beneath those cities as well.",

I know the Biden administration is pushing continued negotiations, but you know, it's from the very beginning, Israel has said that time is their enemy. They've got to continue because they know that the world public relations is going to go against them. It always has in these operations. But I just go back to what you said at the very beginning, Hamas is the organization that's using these Palestinians as shields.And Hamas is the one that attacked over a thousand Israelis and brutally murdered and raped and used sexual assault as a weapon, so it is a requirement, I think, for the Israeli government and that's their strategic objective to rid themselves from Hamas. It's not going to be easy. It's a battlefield that's constricted and there's not any way out for the citizens of Palestine.",

They didn't want anything to do with it. Because they lost that fight, they got brutalized by it. It's not a popular issue for them. The fact that DeSantis is jumping in reflects his campaign strategy, which is a failed one, trying to be sort of Trump -- you know, Trump A-plus-plus.

We've been working on this for about five years, and we've interviewed both loads of Israelis and Palestinians, over a hundred people actually, and the premise of this documentary is to truly understand this conflict, and to get into the real essence, to understand the history, the passions, the interest that so many people around the world have, but also actually understand where this comes from, from both Israelis and Palestinians.We've interviewed people who have been prime ministers, presidents, everybody across the discourse in this issue and we were coming towards the end of this project, in fact, and then the tragedy on October took place. And so we've actually extended our post production now to include this, which in some ways was foreshadowed by various people that we had actually interviewed across the board. With respect to that, I mean, the Hamas-Israel relationship is fascinating, and in some ways, it's -- you know, this conflict is very nuanced and it is very complicated, and it can't really be distilled down into soundbites and I think obviously, it's incredibly emotional as well. But I can sort of give you some background in terms of this fascinating interaction between how Hamas actually is funded via Israel and Qatar, which is pretty extraordinary. Some of these open secrets. And so essentially, after Hamas took over in Gaza, in 2007, in the coup, the Palestinian Authority, which was in charge of providing funding to Hamas, essentially to the Gaza Strip, stopped giving that money to Hamas due to this internal conflict between these two political parties, mainly Fatah and Hamas. And Israel, rather than allowing that to potentially, you know, change and allow for the Palestinian Authority to put pressure on Hamas, they intervened and effectively allowed money to come from Qatar, arrive in suitcases on private planes in Israel. This cash is then counted in Israel, is then repackaged into suitcases, driven down to the border and thrown over in suitcases over to Hamas. Now, the Israelis will say they did that to avoid any humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians that we've spoken to say that this was just an attempt by Israel to essentially avoid any reconciliation between these parties thus to avoid any potential two- state solution down the line. So, it's pretty complicated.",

And obviously, the Palestinians felt very much that they, you know, were being ignored. And I think the Israelis because of the success of doing these deals, specifically the idea of a deal with Saudi Arabia as well, there was this idea that perhaps maybe Hamas are not as impressive militarily, and that this intelligence was more aspirational rather than, in fact, a reality.
