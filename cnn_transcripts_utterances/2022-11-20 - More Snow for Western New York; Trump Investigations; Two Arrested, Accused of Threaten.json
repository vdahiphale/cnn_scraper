They signed in droves onto his account after the platform's new owner, Elon Musk, restored his access.It was suspended after the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol according to Twitter because of the risk of further incitement of violence. But on Saturday Mr. Musk wrote the people have spoken, Trump will be reinstated. This comes after a poll posted late Friday showed 52 percent of 15 million votes favored reinstatement. Mr. Trump doesn't plan to return but will continue to use his Truth Social platform. On Saturday Mr. Trump made his first major appearance before Republicans since announcing his third presidential candidacy, appearing virtually before the Republican Jewish coalition in Las Vegas. The former president received a standing ovation. But Mr. Trump's quest for the nomination faces serious headwinds, not least of which is the special counsel, who has taken over two key investigations. We get those details now from Katelyn Polantz.

One is whether there was an illegal attempt on Trump's side to block the transfer of power after the 2020 election.The other is about the mishandling of federal records after Trump left office. Attorney general Merrick Garland said there's a need for this because Trump's now running for president again. And the investigations have created, according to Garland, have created a particularly sensitive situation. To do the job, Garland is looking to Jack Smith. He is a long-time public servant, a prosecutor, former DOJ section chief who was at the table when the department was deciding charges against several public figures in the past, both Democrats and Republicans, in political corruption accusations. In recent years, he's been living abroad, working as a prosecutor at The Hague, focused on war crimes. In a statement Smith said he would be independent and emphasized, quote, \"The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch.\" In response, Donald Trump reverted to his tested playbook, calling this the latest in a long series of witch hunts. The special counsel will be putting together more evidence and decide if the Department of Justice should charge top political advisers or even the former President of the United States himself -- Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

Instead, you already have acolytes of Trump, saying on Twitter or publicly, this is terrible. Trump himself trying to rally support, saying this is rigged, that this is completely unfair, that they should be prosecuting people like Obama and Clinton. And we've seen that Trump has been effective in the past in ratcheting up support against a special counsel. Look at what happened to Robert Mueller, who was investigating him before. His approval rating was 68 percent. But by February 2019, at the very end, his approval rating had dropped 17 points. So we see the effectiveness of Trump in picking apart anyone that goes against him. That's why you might see other Republicans coming to his support now.",

But we see that Garland is trying to bring back the prestige of the Department of Justice, which has faced many criticisms, as I mentioned. He's trying to, with the appointment of a special counsel, have someone supposed to be completely unbiased in this incredibly unique situation. We've never had a president's appointee then hired to investigate someone who is then running for office. This is unprecedented. Where would you have a presidential candidate facing not one but two federal grand jury investigations and a state-level criminal investigation? And because all of this is so strange and new, Garland is doing his best to make it impartial. But he's facing criticism from the Left and the Right. From the Right I spelled out. From the Left, they're worried this is going to slow down the investigations. But the special counsel, Jack Smith, says that's not the case.",

More importantly, Vladimir Putin sees winter coming and believes that plays to his advantage, that the Ukrainians will freeze, given the infrastructure that Russia has destroyed, particularly in recent weeks; that the NATO nations will begin to crack and divide as the cost of heating oil and gas rise. Now he may be getting this wrong and he may decide at some point to negotiate. But right now we've seen no indication that the Russians are prepared for a serious negotiation.

The other problem that the U.S. runs into, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, back in the spring, uttered a real truth when he said the U.S.' objective is to make sure, whenever this is all over, the Russians are not in a position to launch something like this again.

It was of Russian make. But it appeared to be a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile that went awry. One of the indications that this was in fact not a full-on Russian attack is that there was only a single missile. You would have expected multiple ones, had it been a real attack on a NATO country. And so far Putin has been cautious not to go outside of the boundaries of Ukraine, at least with his physical attacks. There are some indications he's done it with his cyberattacks.

Very disappointing to climate activists and others that they were not able to strengthen the language around cutting emissions and, crucially, unable to agree upon a specific mention of transitioning away from fossil fuels to more green alternatives. That shows that at least some countries were able to lobby, probably countries rich in oil and gas, away from that language.
