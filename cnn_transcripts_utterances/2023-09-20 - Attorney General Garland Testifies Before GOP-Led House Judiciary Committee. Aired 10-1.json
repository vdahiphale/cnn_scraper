It's officially billed as a standard oversight hearing, but it has turned into so much more than that, even before they all entered the room.Attorney General Merrick Garland getting ready to face a House Judiciary Committee stacked with some of his harshest critics in Congress, some even openly calling for Garland to be impeached. His testimony today is the first in the wake of four indictments against former President Trump and so much more.",

It's a forceful rebuke of the political bias accusations from those very Republicans that John and Kate were speaking of. Excerpts of Garland's prepared remarks show he plans to make at least two things very clear. One of them, quote, I am not the president's lawyer and I'm not Congress' prosecutor either.CNN's Melanie Zanona and Evan Perez are following all of the latest as we wait for this hearing to begin. We've been watching it. A lot of members of Congress are there, Garland, not there yet. Melanie, let's start with you. Give us a sense of what the temperature is going to be at the hearing expected to be hot.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's safe to say temperatures will be boiling. This is going to be a crucial moment for Garland and the DOJ but it's also going to be a crucial moment for Republicans who are under pressure to convince the public and even some of their own members that they need to convince them that this impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden is warranted.You see, Garland has now just entered the hearing room. He is sitting down getting ready for this crucial meeting. Hunter Biden and the criminal case surrounding him is expected to be a crucial part of that impeachment inquiry. So, Republicans are really preparing for battle here. They are going to ask a lot of questions about the Hunter Biden criminal case. And they want to have a lot of questions about testimony from some IRS whistleblowers who have claimed that the U.S. attorney in the case said he did not have ultimate charging authority in that case. They claim that the case was mishandled and the case was politicized, something Garland has denied, but no doubt will be a huge focus of their line of questioning today. But they're also going to ask questions about the appointment of David Weiss as special counsel, the plea deal with the DOJ and Hunter Biden that did fall apart, as you mentioned, and also those criminal indictments into Donald Trump. So, a lot of questions, a lot of fireworks and the stakes couldn't be higher.",

The America is the greatest country ever, and we on this side I know are very concerned about the equal application of the law you talked about in your opening statement.With that, we will move to five-minute questions and we will start with the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Johnson. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  Thank you. Mr. Weiss, the rule of law does distinguish our country, but you have not upheld that. You have allowed the rule of law to erode. And that is why 65 percent of the people in this country have no faith in the Department of Justice under your leadership. They do not trust it. They do not trust you. The reason is because they are witnessing every day a politicized Justice Department in a two-tiered system of justice. For example, they see the DOJ, of course, aggressively prosecuting President Biden's chief political rival, Mr. Trump, while at the same time they see slow-walking and special treatment given to the president's son. That's just a fact that everybody can see with their own two eyes. I want to focus on that investigation of the Biden family. We have many important questions for you today about that. Let me just get right to the chase. Has anyone from the White House provided direction at any time to you personally or to any senior officials at the DOJ regarding how the Hunter Biden investigation was to be carried out?",
