Never in modern times has a leadership contest taken so many votes and so many days to resolve.Out of 222 Republicans in the House, it only took six hardline conservatives to derail McCarthy in the 14th ballot on Friday night, a vote he believed was in the bag. Right wing firebrand Matt Gaetz, who had sworn to never vote for McCarthy, cast the deciding vote which doomed him on that ballot. The House was stunned. As one Democrat said later, wow. What followed was extraordinary political theater rarely seen on camera. Tempers flared among Republicans. One member, Mike Rogers, had to be restrained as he moved toward Gaetz. But McCarthy was not done. He and his allies made a beeline to the key holdouts. In the end, on the 15th ballot, all six rebels, including Gaetz, voted present, assuring the gavel to McCarthy. Here is what the new speaker had to say afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: A commitment for a future built on freedom where children come first and are taught to dream big. In America, dreams can still come true. A commitment for our government that is held accountable where Americans get the answers they want, need and deserve. Our system is built on checks and balances. It is time for us to be a check and provide some balance to the president's policies. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The House was about to adjourn until Monday until the deal was struck. Donald Trump called some of the members on the far right block of the conference. And some of those members changed their mind and decided they were going to vote present also. And by voting present it effectively lowered the threshold of the now amount of votes that Kevin McCarthy needed to become speaker, ultimately allowing him to become speaker with 216 votes. And he has secured the job after going through that 15 ballots that stretched from Tuesday until early morning Saturday to finally get the job. Now it will be up to him to put the -- to govern this narrowly divided institution and badly divided Republican conference, put together a policy agenda and go up against the Senate Democrats, who control their chamber across the Capitol, not to mention the Democrat in the White House. They will have the power of the purse as well as the Senate but they also have investigative powers in the House. I expect them to wield subpoenas very early on in their new majority. For Kevin McCarthy, he is relieved that after this very, very tense several days he finally has claimed the Speaker's gavel -- Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The former president congratulated his fellow Republican after what he called a crazy selection process.In the meantime, Senate leader Chuck Schumer thought all of this could be a sign of more gridlock to come, saying, \"Speaker Kevin McCarthy's dream job could turn into a nightmare for the American people.' Presidential Biden said, \"I am prepared to work with Republicans when I can and voters made clear they are expecting Republicans to work with me as well.

Some truly remarkable and extraordinary moments we have witnessed. Put this into context for us. RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, if you look at the big arc here, Kevin McCarthy did what John Boehner and Paul Ryan, his two predecessors as Republican Speakers of the House, would not do. He essentially gave a veto over the party's direction to the hard right, far extreme of his conference. And the perfect symbol for what happened tonight was, after the vote, what was the first thing that happened to Kevin McCarthy? He took a selfie with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is the very white wing member from Georgia, who Democrats stripped of her committee assignments because of her history of promoting conspiracy theories and making remarks that seemed to promote or condone violence. Then Kevin McCarthy went out and thanked Donald Trump for getting him over the top on the second anniversary of the January 6th investigation. This is the reality. He won this position he has long sought. But he has not only given away a lot of the power of the speakership, perhaps more importantly, he has ceded enormous leverage over shaping the party's image and setting its agenda to its most militant members immediately after an election, in which the image of extremism significantly hurt Republicans in competitive districts and competitive states.",

Again, that is something that is going to be very popular on FOX, very popular with the most conservative members of the base.

In the election in November, in competitive races, almost all of the election deniers were beaten, particularly for posts where they would have control over the 2024 election.But there were still, I think, something like 160 or 170 Republicans who were elected, who refused to acknowledge the results in 2020. Many of them were in the House. They voted to deny the results in 2020, including the incoming speaker, Kevin McCarthy. As I said, the end of this process, Kevin McCarthy was repeatedly making concessions to election deniers. Even then, he needed Trump on the second anniversary of the riot to come in and make calls to help push him over the top. That just shows you how deep this ideology remains. The roots of this ideology remain within the mainstream Republican Party. And the challenge going forward, I think, is going to be whether this House majority wants to govern or whether it has been sent to Washington primarily to have a series of culture war and other confrontations with the Biden administration. After watching the last week, you would have to bet more on the latter than the former. But we will see.",

This is despite the fact that we are now many hours into this unilaterally declared cease-fire that Russia floated earlier on in the week. It was rebuffed by President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, saying this was just a ruse for Russia to regroup and rearm and also to get Ukraine to temporarily push the pause button so that they were able to do that. Ukraine has continued to fight to reclaim this territory. Even despite this cease-fire, they have witnessed one missile attack and various if not 12 attacks by rocket launchers. They say that 19 civilian settlements were hit in one direction. We also saw another 15 civilian settlements hit the near the area of Bakhmut. That has been a pressure point over the last few weeks. There is no sign of letup in the battle, despite this week, which has been dominated by talk of a cease-fire, which was rebuffed.
