      "sentences": "At a court hearing happening right now in Phoenix, a judge has set a 2026 trial date for some big names in Trump world that includes Rudy Giuliani and former Trump chief of staff, Mark Meadows.They're among the defendants accused of trying to use fake electors to steal Joe Biden's 2020 election victory in Arizona. The stakes are very high at this hearing. That is because the judge will also decide if the defendants will be treated as first-time offenders or multiple-time offenders, which could mean prison time. Let's talk about this now with CNN legal commentator, Attorney Tim Parlatore, who represented former President Trump in the classified documents case. First off, Tim, this trial date, January 2026, perhaps not surprising, it is later than the prosecution wanted. What do you make of this timing?",

But essentially, as I understand it, it's kind of like the three- strikes rule, except you can get multiple strikes on the first pitch.",

We do see that incentive regularly in all kinds of cases, not just January 6th-related cases or election-related cases. Do you see anything different than the usual here?",

It's organized crime cases, it's everything.Because the more that they throw at the wall in the beginning, the more defendants are going to be likely to plead guilty, whether that's you have to cooperate against their co-defendants or just simply to plead guilty to minimize their exposure. So, yes, that doesn't really surprise me. And it's -- I don't think, in and of itself, it would even be the subject of emotion. But for this unique aspect of that the Arizona law is stacking them up to make them a multiple-time offender on a single case.",

I mean, that's the same deal that she cut, essentially, in Georgia, although she did take a conviction to a lesser offense there.And so, you know, really, it's a matter of the first one in the door to cooperate is the one that gets the best deal. And the more people that cooperate to help them take down the people that they really want to, is something the government looks for. But there is a certain point where they say, OK, we have enough cooperators and so everybody else, you missed the train and so you're going -- you're going down for the full plated on. So I do think that this is going to, you know, at least put some pressure on people to consider whether they want to cooperate.",

I think that it's an interesting issue to be brought up on an appeal after sentencing, if the sentence greatly outweighs the severity of the offense because of this unique aspect. But in a pretrial stance, I don't think that the judge is really going to say, you know, that the Arizona state sentencing scheme is improper.
