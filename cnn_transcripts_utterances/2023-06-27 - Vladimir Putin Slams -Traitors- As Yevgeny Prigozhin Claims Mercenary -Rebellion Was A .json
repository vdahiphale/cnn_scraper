He called the leaders of the Wagner Mercenary Group traitors and enemies of Russia.Hours earlier, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin also made his first public statement, defending his march on Moscow as a protest, not an attempt to overthrow the government. Putin appeared angry during his address to the nation. And while two days ago, the Kremlin said charges against Prigozhin will be dropped. The Russian president now says the leaders of the rebellion will be brought to justice for their crimes. This uprising marked the greatest challenge to Putin's 23-year long rule, but he appeared to play down the threat posed in a nationwide address.

You know, there was disquiet on the streets in the week -- in the weekend throughout Russia, no question and of course, many are very happy that any kind of bloodshed was averted. Having said that, the absolute vacuum of power or direction that they're left with is also equally unsettling. You know, the Russian newspapers and media in general have been very careful in their push to make sure that they do not unsettle the Kremlin. We have seen anybody who speaks out at this point in time, threatened with fines or worse, imprisonment. But it is interesting that when you start to see the cracks, you too see them in some areas of the media, and I've been basically monitoring it the last few days. But here is Andrei Kolesnikov in the Columnist with this line, and when he had a comment after Putin had spoken, the rumors were he writes, in short, one better than the other and most importantly, all believable, no matter how absurd they may be, because the last days have confirmed that the more absurd (AUDIO GAP).",

And then all of a sudden, he turns around and goes home and sends troops back to the barracks.

Here, the red, white and blue are Russians in disarray and surrendering. The hope is more will follow as word spreads of the failed rebellion and morale and discipline falter. It was near here Ukraine proclaimed Monday progress on the front lines with room for hope elsewhere. To the south, another Donetsk front near the heavily contested Marinka, it appears some Kremlin loyal Chechen fighters were pulled to Moscow for his defense at the weekend. Here, they are strutting along an apparent highway near the capitol. Bakhmut and Marinka opportunities for Ukraine in the east, but also further west near Kherson, on the Antonivs'kyy Bridge, the scene of intense clashes captured by this Russian drone, as Ukrainian forces claimed to cross over to the Russian controlled eastern bank, opening another front perhaps. It is too early to tell whether or if Russia is crumbling. And Ukraine's progress has been incremental still. This, a familiar scene when their fighters declared they'd captured another small village in the South Rivnopil on Monday. None of this yet the strategic sea change in Russian collapse. The weekend's madness that Zelenskyy visiting troops in the East Monday as well will hope follows. He faces anxious choices even with all the Kremlin's intimate ugliness so exposed. Move now or wait for more in Moscow to unravel. He must be sure to make no mistakes of his own, or interrupt the torrent of them in Moscow. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN Kyiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And so, as I've said, the government here is almost sort of stigmatizing and blaming migrants for a sort of an out of control cost that is somehow impacting the existing cost of living crisis in the U.K., that when you actually look at the sort of the demographics here, the fact is that the majority of these asylum seekers and migrants attempting to enter the U.K. are from countries like Albania, and Syria and Iraq.

Total net costs per person per asylum seeker, 63,000 pounds, those savings are based on 85 percent of future illegal immigrants needing accommodation support for an average of four years, at a cost of about 85 pounds per night.

I mean, this in terms of, you know, the sort of the math here, it's just sort of unconscionable how they're playing around with this.And yes, you can say we can talk about the economics and ignore the human rights aspect. There's also the international law aspect and the cost of that. What we do know thus far and it's important to look at the language, is this is a deal between the U.K. and Rwanda that is framed as a migration partnership and an economic partnership. And I don't think there's been enough discussion yet as to what the sort of either economic sort of, you know, stakes are in this particular relationship. What we know thus far is that 140 million British pounds have been promised to the Rwandan authorities, which is an extraordinary figure. And I think the irony of this as well, which feeds into this question of instrumentalizing immigration is now that the U.K. is no longer a member of the European Union, it no longer participates in the European Union's coordinated asylum, and migration policies. And so, there's a tremendous cost there of administering this. But ultimately, at the end of the day, we're looking at an economic argument versus a human argument with the math and the numbers around the economics based on something that has essentially got very little sort of background and experience in terms of how this has been used before, with no certain outcome as to with all these different variables as to whether or not those savings will be an actor, John.",
