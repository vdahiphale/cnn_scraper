Obviously, President Biden is the highest profile. We started to get a sense of things yesterday as we started to hear about security measures and see those security measures being put in place and they did appear to be tighter than anything we'd seen, and there had been some speculation as you know, Richard about the potential for Biden to come here to Kyiv. Now, he is only able to come here because of the successes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the past year. This time, last year, right after the war started, this was a completely different city. People had fled, people were hunkered down in their homes and underground. There was an expectation that Russia might take the city, might be able to topple the Zelenskyy government, forcing him to flee or even killing him. Of course, the Ukrainians very successfully repelled that attack. So this was an incredible moment that came as a complete surprise to those of us who watch the story carefully, those of us -- those who live in this country, and it was hugely symbolic, not just because this is the week of the first anniversary, but it certainly served to remind Ukrainians and the West and Russia in particular that the US has really supported Ukraine over the past year and plans to continue to do so as we enter the second year of this war -- Richard.",

So normally, when energy prices are high, Russia's economy is doing well and this was not the case this time. This is direct consequence of the sanctions. One can of course discuss that West was relatively slow to impose sanctions on Russia's oil like EU has imposed oil embargo, like G7 has imposed oil price cap and more recently, now oil products price cap.

Two weeks later, a series of eruptions will reverberate around the planet and be visible from space. Tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific, and the next afternoon, a series of waves hit the island country of Tonga, some as high as 15 meters, killing three people and leaving mass destruction in their wake.

Every volcano has a different trigger in terms of when it might erupt, and by mapping Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha?apai and then comparing that to other volcanoes, we can begin to build up a better image of what these triggers might be or what they might look like on the seafloor.
