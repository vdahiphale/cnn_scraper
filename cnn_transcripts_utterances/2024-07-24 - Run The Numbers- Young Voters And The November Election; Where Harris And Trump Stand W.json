That's what she says here. We've seen all these internet means over the last two days as well. So, is it real? One man knows the answer, CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten. In this case, they say you know the answer. What you've done is you've looked at the numbers since Sunday. What do they say?",

It's whether or not you'd come out to the polls. And this, I think, is rather interesting. Do Democrats say they're more motivated to turn out after Biden left the race? Well, we do see a significant portion of Democrats who say yes, 39 percent. The thing I was interested in was it disproportionately younger voters who said that they were more likely to turn out or more motivated to turn out. And what we see here is its 42 percent, not a big difference between 42 and 39 percent. So, this idea, again, that the Vice President has unique potential to dig in and get young voters to turn out, John, it's just not there in the numbers, despite all the internet memes that are going around.",

Voters under the age of 35, go back to 2020, this is the Pew Research study. This is one of the best studies that we have. And look at that, 56 percent of young voters said that, in fact, they were Democrat, they identified as Democrat or lean Democratic. You look down at 2024. It's 49 percent.Look at the Republican, John, from 39 to 49 percent. So, when we say that Harris is doing worse than Biden, it's not that she's uniquely bad. It's rather she's fighting uphill. She's trying to fight against a wave that is going against the Democrats among young voters. And Harris may be unique in some ways.

Which is that Democrats normally do much better with young people, and that has just not been true. It is one of the things that set off the panic that led to a lot of the discussion about why Biden needed to step down. He was doing better with older voters. Unusual for Democrats, but they are, in fact, the most reliable voters. And so, they're going to have to see if this is a realignment. Is this a reversion to what normally happens, or is there something else going on? And that something else, again, goes back to the pressure, the reports that were coming from the field, the strategists that I've talked to keep saying something huge is happening and we have to do something about it.

What they don't want to tell is the story is what does she work on in terms of addressing recidivism, but they don't want to talk about is how there was actually a pathway for those that wanted to get jobs afterwards. What they don't want to talk about is that she actually ensured that they weren't pursuing the death penalty when others try to do so.So, when we talk about justice, I would rather have Vice President Harris, who has clearly had a record of justice. That's not for the people rather than the alternative of a man who had 34 times where people demonstrated that he was breaking the law. And so, the comparison is that they're afraid. Deep in -- digging deeper than that we talk about a black job. A black job was a black prosecutor, a black AG, a black United States senator, a black vice president, and she will become a black president. He just hopes to have a job. He's afraid that he's running against Black woman. And so, the reality is that we see that they only have distractions similarly, the disastrous campaign has happened for JD Vance. People need to understand they're saying these things because they have someone who is anti-DEI, they have a -- a Project 2025. All of these things are trying to make sure to deflect. And so, for all the Black men that want to hear the truth mobilize with us, One With Black Men, our next call is Sunday, 7:00 p.m. Eastern. Go one with blackmen.org. Follow our different efforts because we're focused on this. And -- and -- and the reality is we can't be divided. My mom, a two-time breast cancer survivor. God bless you for what you have gone through as well. It is important for us to say people are saying these things because they want to divide brothers from the sisters. That's what they're talking about. Maybe Donald Trump, if he had a record that actually was good rather than his own criminal record, he wouldn't have anything else to talk about.
