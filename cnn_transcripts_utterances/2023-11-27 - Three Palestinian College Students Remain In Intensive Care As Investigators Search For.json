After more than 50 days held captive by Hamas, 11 more hostages are freed tonight as Israel and Hamas agreed to pause fighting another few days, meaning even more hostage releases to come. And, the only Israeli man released by Hamas so fire has a dual Russian Israeli citizenship. Why him? And how did he spend four days on the run in Gaza? Was his release a Hamas favor to Vladimir Putin? Plus, the Palestinian prisoners who Israel is letting go, and the two tiered justice system for many of them that led to so many of them being held without trial in the first place. (MUSIC)",

The suspect was in court today. The college students were speaking English and Arabic at the time of Saturday's shooting, wearing the traditional Palestinian Keffiyeh scarves. A shocking apparent hate crime. New details in that case ahead. But we start with breaking news. A fourth group of hostages freed by Hamas now back safely in Israel. The spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces says all 11 citizens are Israeli, about is not clear if any of them are dual citizens. The hostages and missing persons form says the freed hostages are 12-year-old Eitan Yahalomi, Sharon Kunio and her 3- year-old kid Emma and Yulio, Karina Engel and her kids 18-year-old Mika and 11-year-old Yuval, 16-year-old Sahar Kalderon and 12-year-old Erez Kalderon, and 16-year-old Or Yaakov and 13-year-old Yagil Yaakov. I spoke to the mother of Or and Yagil on October 8th, the day after the attack. She was listening to her sons on the phone when they were kidnapped. You might remember that horrible story. It's so great that they're back with her. Now that this group of hostages has been released, the Israel Hamas pause will be extended by an additional two days under the same conditions. That means another 20 hostages are expected to be freed. He's nearly free hostages during 58 others who have been released in recent days, that includes 40 Israelis, and 4-year-old American Israeli Abigail Edan. She was orphaned in the October 7th terrorist attacks, when Hamas murdered her parents in cold blood, Roy and Smadar Edan. Let's get straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's that the Kerem Shalom border crossing at the intersection of Israel, Gaza, and Egypt. Jeremy, what are you seeing where you are right now?",

We have a statement, also, from the head of the Nir Oz kibbutz who says that the news this evening brings a sigh of relief to our community. However, we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage. And that is, of course, a reminder, Jake, that for every hostage who is released, there are still hostages who are still remaining in Gaza. And that will be the key, Jake, as we watch how this develops over the coming days, with this truce not being extended by an additional two days. Hamas set to release ten civilian hostages for each of those days. How much further can they keep going? We know that Hamas does not hold all of the hostages inside of Gaza. In fact, several are being held, dozens are being held, in fact, by other militant groups. In fact, tonight, the Israeli military confirmed that Kfir Bibas, that ten month old, the youngest Israeli hostage being held in the Gaza Strip, is being held by another militant group. So, a lot of questions about Hamas's ability to wrangle these hostages and to return them to Israel as part of this agreement -- Jake.",

From what we're hearing, the same sort of issue -- who was on the list, who is not on the list, that caused the delay today. Still, this isn't on par with what we saw over the weekend, where there was risk of the deal collapsing. It wasn't that grave danger to the overall deal, but it obviously shows the friction taking place and these exchanges, and is part of this truce, and how fragile this all can be.

At least as of the numbers released earlier today from these really prime minister's office, there are still, and this is before today's release, I should note, 52 women and 14 children.So, there is at least, in principle, enough hostages under this agreement to keep this pause going for a few more days. It's also worth noting that when Israel put out their list of hostages held in Gaza, the number was 300. That's twice the initial agreement for 150, which means at least that Israel is paying for the possibility of an extension as well. Still, Qatar announced, and we only heard from Hamas, Egypt and others, 48 hours of extension right now to keep that going. And probably will take another massive diplomatic effort.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER (voice-over): It was a particularly excruciating weekend for the families of the hostages being held by Hamas. Once the temporary pause between Israel and Hamas began, many of them hoping, praying, that their loved ones would be the ones released. Among the first wave of hostages freed, nine-year-old Ohad Munder seeing his father for the first time in this emotional video. He was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz with his mother, Karen, and 78-year-old grandmother, Ruth, as well as his grandfather. Another emotional moment. Nine-year-old Emily Hand reuniting with her father, who previously thought she'd been killed by Hamas. All weekend, many Americans were holding out hope that four-year-old Israeli American Abigail Edan would be released. But her parents had been murdered by Hamas in a kibbutz Kfar Aza. And son Sunday, she was finally freed in the third round of hostage releases. Also included in that third wave, the Brodutch family. Hagar Brodutch was kidnapped from Kfar Aza, along with her children, Ofry, Yuval and Oria. A few weeks ago in Tel Aviv, their father told me he was eager for any sort of swap with Palestinian prisoners. Do the swap. Whatever swap they want, do it.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:32:25] TAPPER: We're back with our worldly, 33 more Israeli held Palestinian prisoners are expected to be released today in exchange for Israeli hostages. That's on top of the 117 Palestinian prisoners who have already been freed in part of this pause between Israel and Hamas. Some of these individuals were convicted in a court of law for criminal acts, such as, for example, 38-year-old Ezra Javez (ph) in 2015. Israel sentenced her to 13 years in prison. She had been convicted in the courts of law of attempted murder, when she drove up her car and with gas canisters, her car blew up at a checkpoint and the explosion wounded a police officer. She was accused of yelling \"Allahu Akbar\", she denies it, but the police officer was wounded. But then there are also a host of Palestinians who have been freed who had been denied even basic due process, such a 17 year old Wasam Tamimi (ph). He was arrested by Israel defense forces in June, accused of offenses including possessing a weapon, but he was never even charged. He sat in prison for five months. And as CNN's Nima Elbagir reports, Israeli law actually allows Palestinian prisoners to be detained indefinitely without a trial or even a charge.

Two vertebrae were damaged. They replace them with titanium. I cannot feel my legs or standup. They also removed five centimeters from my liver and one kidney.",

She did not go to trial, she was not given any opportunity to defend herself, and this is a story we keep hearing again and again from released prisoners, that they aren't given due process, and yet, this crime exists alongside their names.The Israeli prison service responded to these allegations saying: National security prisoners who are released from Israeli prison during the past two days were serving time for serious crimes, such as attempted murder, assault, and throwing explosives, all prisoners in custody are held according to the law. That's not true. CNN broke down the numbers in a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners, identified by Israel as eligible for release, 80 percent are listed as just detained, which means, they have not been formally sentenced. Israel operates two systems of law in the occupied territories, Palestinians under the military, Israelis under civil law, creating a low bar for the arrest of increasing numbers of Palestinians. As Israeli hard-liners like Ben Gvir and others in this far-right government seek to characterize every Palestinian as a terrorist. That number is rising every day. (END VIDEOTAPE) ELBAGIR (on camera): The Israeli Defense Forces not respond to our request for comment. But, numbers speak for themselves, Jake. That was just a very small sample that was released by Israel's Department of Justice, but the number of Palestinians who have been swept up in Israeli jails within the last 23 months are almost 9,000. And if Fatima and Malak are any -- give us any kind of insight into what those other thousands of Palestinians are going through, there's a real concern that there is no distinction between a Palestinian and a terrorist in the way that Israel chooses to apply its laws to them. It is martial law -- Jake.",

His release was possible following direct intensive contacts between our diplomats and Hamas representatives, Russia's ambassador to Israel says. After Hamas's October 7th assault on southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, and leaving more than 200 in captivity inside Gaza, much of the world condemned Hamas, but to not Russian President Vladimir Putin. Instead, the Kremlin invited a high-level Hamas delegation to Moscow for talks. Putin has ripped into Israel over its military response to Hamas's raid, which has killed and wounded many people across the Gaza Strip. Putin even comparing his invasion of Ukraine to Hamas's war against Israel. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I understand this war with Ukraine, death of people, must be shocking. But what about the bloody state coup in Ukraine in 2014, which was followed by the war of the Kyiv regime against their own people in Donbas. Is it not shocking? Was that the elimination of civilians in Palestine, in Gaza?",

However they have said that the Russians that are still being held are also dual Russian Israeli citizens. So, in this case, those good relations that the Kremlin has with Hamas is quite beneficial for Israelis.
