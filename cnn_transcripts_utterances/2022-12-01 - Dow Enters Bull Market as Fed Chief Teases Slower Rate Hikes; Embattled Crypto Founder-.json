I mean, they have raised rates more in  the last -- since March than -- you'd have to go back to, like, the early '70s, late '70s to see something similar. They have done a massive amount.So put it this way. Let's say your auto loan rate was, like, 5 percent in March. They've raised rates 4 percent since then. So suddenly now, you have an auto rate of 9 percent in just that short period of time. Now, interest rates aren't one-to-one with what Powell does, but what I'm saying is they have done so much in a very short period of time. So to your point, why he's doing it now is because they have to wait and see. They have to see how this is being really felt in the economy, because there's a lag in terms of what they do and when it's really felt in the economy.",

We're going straight now -- Max Foster is live for us in Boston on this side of the pond this morning. Max, controversy following the couple across the ocean. Good morning to you. MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's been really -- Don, it's been one thing after another. They had this racism scandal back kin the U.K. just breaking as they landed. Then they went to their first ceremony, and it was pouring with rain. And the other special guests, John Kerry and Caroline Kennedy, couldn't make it to that. Then they turn up to the game last night. I was there. But just after the booing that you heard there. But there was booing, and there were chants of \"USA, USA!\" But by the time I arrived and was asking people about it, I think it had more to do with, you know, that Boston sense that they are the cradle of the American Revolution, the Boston Tea Party. It was a really spirited event. So I'm not sure that was personal. But it does seem to be one thing after another for this couple during this tour. But of course, everyone is hearing about it. Lots of publicity around the event, as well.",

She kept on saying she was British, but this aide kept on asking where she was from, where in Africa she was from, where her people were from, when she arrived in the U.K. I mean, it was a really offensive conversation. The palace did recognize it straight away. She has stepped down. There's an investigation ongoing. And Prince Williams' team had to address it here, saying there's no place for racism in society.",
