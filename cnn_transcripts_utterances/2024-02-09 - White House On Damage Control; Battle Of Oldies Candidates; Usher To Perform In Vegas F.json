Even on election day, it was just 29 percent. So he had about a three in 10 shot at winning, yet Donald Trump was able to go on, win that campaign, despite a lot of people, especially that post Access Hollywood tape, there were people asking him to leave his campaign, not just independents, not just people in the press. But Republicans in his own party were asking him to leave the campaign, yet he was able to go on and win despite the odds being against him. How about Harry Truman in 1948, right? Thomas E. Dewey up by five points in the final Gallup poll. Harry Truman won the popular vote by four percentage points. He won easily. He held up that newspaper essentially saying, I believe it was that Chicago Tribune essentially saying that Dewey had won the election. But Truman had won the election, and now it's on election eve, and the poll deficit that Biden faces at this point, significantly smaller than that five points.
