Josh, police, as you well know, have arrested hundreds of protesters, students, professors, activists across the country. Do police need to have a tactical game plan when they wade into these protests on college campuses?",

And regardless of what side protesters are on and how righteous their cause might be, there is no First Amendment right to protest on private property. And that's where the police have often been brought into some of these universities to try to clear them of trespassers.But as you mentioned, of course, Wolf, it's important for authorities to have a game plan. You know, there's a big difference between crowd management and crowd control. In crowd management, you have officers that are there on standby just in case something happens. Sometimes they'll facilitate First Amendment activity. And crowd control, you're trying to get the protesters to do something that you want to do. And when these dispersal orders go out, when the campuses want their campuses clear, that's not time for debate in the view of the police. But of course, it's important for them to do that work. Optics are obviously very important to do it in the way that requires the least amount of force possible, Wolf.",

She came up to that officer and, quote, lightly tapped him to try to get his attention. That, of course, objectively unwise. And it's certainly a crime in Georgia to touch a police officer in a provoking way, as it's a crime, you know, in most states across the U.S. Of course, the big question here, that forceful takedown to the ground, was that warranted? Was that necessary? Was there another way that they could have done that in a way that de-escalated the situation while still getting her into custody?But we have seen instances, Wolf, where police have done just that, including last week here in California at the USC. There was this really volatile situation where a protester was put into a squad car, believe we have video of that. That squad car surrounded by other protesters, resulting in this very tense situation. Our friend Nick Watt was right there on the scene as this was happening. What authorities ultimately did was have that person released. They made the decision, the on scene commander, that that was the way to de-escalate. And you actually see that individual as he stepped out of the crowd, actually helping push people back, telling the crowd to go away. That obviously a good resolution. There was a question about whether that could then, you know, look as capitulation to this crowd. But of course, for authorities, their job is to try to reduce the tensions in this very volatile situation. We will, of course, continue to see more of these protests, Wolf, and the police will certainly be under the microscope.",

Josh Campbell, thank you very, very much for that update.Also happening right now, the secretary of state is in Saudi Arabia with a potential ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel now on the table. This morning, Antony Blinken said Israel has presented the militant group, and I'm quoting him now, with an extraordinarily generous proposal, adding that Hamas is the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us live from Jerusalem right now. So what are the details of this latest proposal, Jeremy?",

The fact that they're holding 133 hostages, six Americans for now over 200 days, that they have control of ending this if they return the hostages and they surrender.And on college campuses, the reason that Jewish students are at risk is because the protesters, so many of the protesters aren't calling for the release of hostages. They're not making demands of the butcher, Sinwar, who slaughtered over 1200 people on 10/7, they're calling for more 10/7. They're taking -- they're calling for action against Zionists. They're calling for intifada and more terrorism. We need to get to a point where the hostages are released. Hamas needs to do that. That's a significant step forward. And on college campuses, these protesters need to be held to account. When they violate the codes of student conduct on their campuses, universities must hold them accountable. And putting Jewish students at risk and targeting one group for harassment and intimidation is a violation of any student code. And there has to be accountability.",

But when these students, and let's be clear, they're not all students, a lot of them are outside agitators as well. But when anyone takes a position that puts an entire group at risk, that calls for terrorism, that applauds what happened on 10/7 and applauded literally, there was applause heard when the announcement was made that Iran was launching close to 350 missiles and drones at Israel, when they're learning to say death to Israel in Farsi, when they are celebrating the Houthis, a terrorist group, and they don't spend a second calling out Hezbollah or the Houthis or the militias in Syria, the Iran back militias or the militias in Iraq, and they don't say a word about the genocidal regime in Iran that's bent on real genocide, which is the destruction of Israel and Hamas, which caused all of this, which exists, Wolf, for the sole purpose of destroying Israel and slaughtering Jews.When they are silent on all of that and they seek to encourage violence against Jews. That is not the tradition of free speech that we celebrate on college campuses. It's anathema to that. And it does great harm to all of us who believe that college campuses must be safe for everyone and speech by every group must be heard.",

Jean Carroll, the civil -- the fraud case from the New York attorney general, just underscores the difference between his potential vulnerability in the legal world and in the political world. I mean, in the political world, you know, there is -- there, in his electorate, there is essentially no consequence for lying.In the legal world, there can be, you know, there obviously is kind of a fog of misinformation that surrounds him that will make it more difficult in any case. But ultimately, there are consequences. And by the way, that's why, you know, if you ask me, one of the most important thing that happened last week in Trump's legal, it really was this incredible spectacle of five Republican appointed justices on the Supreme Court giving every indication that they will protect him from going to trial before the election on the case that American voters have made clear is the most serious in their eyes. You know, the argument -- the allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 election. So, you know, we have multiple, as always with Trump, there are multiple things going on at the same time.
