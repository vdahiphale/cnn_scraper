There you see the Dow being dragged not just by Boeing, but also by health stocks. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up this moment being buoyed of course by Meta, and by some of the tech shares. Those are the markets. These are the main events for you. Shares in Facebook owner Meta soar after Zuckerberg promises a focus on efficiency. We are not out of the woods yet. Europe's Central Bankers say the inflation fight is far from over. And record sales for Ferrari. The luxury carmaker CEO joins me live. Live from London, it is Wednesday, February 2nd. I'm Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest and I too, mean business. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, strong tech earnings are fueling a market rally. The S&amp;P 500 is up about one percent, almost one percent and the NASDAQ is also doing very well, up almost two-and-two-tenths of a percent and it comes on the back of yesterday's Fed meeting where Chair Jerome Powell said inflation is on its way down. Well, today's moves are largely driven by Facebook owner, Meta, though. Shares are up around 22 -- almost 23 percent on track for what could be its strongest day -- get this -- in 10 years despite announcing lower profit and revenue. The company also announced a massive stock buyback and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will focus on efficiency. Clare Duffy is in New York. So what does that mean, Clare? Focusing on efficiency? Because there was no talk about Metaverse. It was really a return to core business, right? So tell me what he means by efficiency here.",

The company is so known for talkingabout these ambitious investments that it wants to make, but instead, last night, Mark Zuckerberg said this is going to be the year of efficiency. He really sort of acknowledged that the company's core business is both maturing and going through a really challenging time right now. Advertisers are pulling back their spending because of all the economic uncertainty. And so you hear Meta talking about this plans to cut costs. The company in November announced plans to lay off 11,000 employees, and it said that in the upcoming year, it is planning to cut capital expenditures. It has a hiring freeze in place right now. It is pulling back on some of its real estate footprint. And so it seems like the company really is sort of changing its tone here and it wanted to reassure investors, and clearly it worked.

But today, they did say that the recession will be shallower than initially expected, so 50 basis points, taking the main rate to four percent, and now, the market is pricing in that it will peak around four and a half percent in June. That is coming down from over five percent just a few months ago. So in terms of the rate cycle, it feels like the Bank of England is certainly nearing the end of that, and the economy is slowing and they are very concerned about inflation, which is still over 10 percent. The line from the Bank of England was interesting when they said, events may not unfold in the way that they hope with inflation coming down sharply. It's above 10 percent. It's uncharted territory. It's all to do with energy prices, if they don't fall fast enough, that could keep going, and that's the risk for the BoE. They need to keep the economy going so they can't keep raising rates as they were for very long, but at the same time, they have to get inflation under control.",

So while it is over 10 percent in the UK, it's over eight percent in the Eurozone. So it's still pretty high, and as you heard from Lagarde there, headline inflation is coming down, but the risk is core inflation is still really sticky and that is a major concern, I think, for the ECB. So, 50 basis points this time. But look, I'll be very clear that they will raise rates significantly at a steady pace and at levels that are sufficiently restrictive, and that starts with another 50 basis points in March.

It was a huge missile that the Russians shot right into the center of town there. There was a big search and rescue operation that was still going on because the Ukrainians believed that there are still people and were still people trapped underneath the rubble. So we went to that area to film there and we had just arrived on the scene, had parked our vehicles and gotten out of those vehicles when another missile struck in the exact building that we were parked in front of. So we heard a loud bang; there were a lot of civilians there on the street, many of them then trying to take shelter. We did the same thing. We then went toward another building to try to take shelter there. And as I looked up, I saw another missile that then hit almost the exact location, causing a huge explosion there, leading to even more people trying to flee the scene. We tried to run for cover, went for shelter. And after a while, tried to get out of there. But I think one of the things it is very important to point out is that there was a big search and rescue operation going on, on the ground, and the Russians targeted exactly the area where that search and rescue operation was going on in the city of Kramatorsk. This was not some sort of military facility; we saw no military facilities in the area. We saw a lot of civilians, however, who were in that area and this was right in the center of town. Certainly, we later got word from the Ukrainians, who said they believe that these were S-300 missiles that were used in these strikes by the Russian military. Now those are normally missiles that are used to try to take down airplanes at high altitude, very powerful missiles. They also have a ground to ground configuration but when they're used against surface targets, they are extremely inaccurate, which means if they are used against surface targets in densely populated urban areas, you have the potential to cause extreme harm amongst civilians. So far, the Ukrainians are saying it is still fairly fresh and there are several people wounded in this one. Obviously, several people were killed the night before. So certainly, a lot of carnage there in the center of town, as we do see some of those population centers are really, right, now under attack from those missiles launched from the Russian side.

It's part of theadministration's efforts to make the airline industry more competitive. Some of America's biggest carriers say the move would drive up the costs. It comes as airlines fall out of favor with customers. Even before this winter's meltdowns, remember those, Gallup said 37 percent of Americans had a negative view of airlines. Here to discuss all of this is Simon Calder, correspondent at \"The Independent.\" It's great to have you on the show. That seems like a fair measure from what we heard from President Biden. These unfair fees, he said, add up. Letting parents sit with their children seems fair, although some parents probably want to sit far away from their children at the moment. Why such a big fuss about this? SIMON CALDER, \"THE INDEPENDENT\":  Because it wasn't previously an issue until the ultra low cost carriers came along. So airlines such as Frontier, for example. Of course we will seat you together but there is going to be a charge for it. And it really depends how far you go along the road to the idea that you are only buying the flying. If you are going to pay 50 bucks for a Frontier flight, then absolutely everything on top of that you are going to have to pay for, including sitting next to your 4-year old. Now in Europe, certainly in the U.K., that simply wouldn't happen. Yes, the airlines can invite you to pay extra to choose your seats in advance. But if you've got a 4-year old and you turn up, they have to see you next to that child. The Department of Transportation in the U.S. says you should do that, the airlines should do that but not all of them do at the moment, although I need to stress that American, United, Delta and Southwest all say they do.",
