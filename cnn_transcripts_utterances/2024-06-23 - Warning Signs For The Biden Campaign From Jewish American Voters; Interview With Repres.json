The two men are staying out of the public eye as they prepare for their first debate matchup of 2024, which is only four days away. The candidates are taking a very different approach to how they prepare. Last night while Biden pored over research and discuss possible debate questions with a close team of advisers at Camp David, Trump was on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I look forward to Thursday. I know he's locked up in a log cabin some place. You can imagine what he's doing. There's a lot of interest, tremendous interest in the debate, and, you know, when you say prep, I think this is prepping. These people know better than anybody what they want, right?

So, Isaac, can you -- what are you learning? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, when you look at the continuing fallout from what's going on in Gaza and the conflict there and feelings that are coming from that, it is creating a lot of problems among Jewish voters, as well as the pain and anxiety over the rise in antisemitic attacks that have been going on in the aftermath. Particularly on the left the rhetoric has been getting a lot of people upset. That has led to some concerns that in these key battleground states where the Jewish population is larger than the margin of victory, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, that this could be yet another place where Joe Biden will have to work to pull together and hold together this very fragmented coalition that he has.",

ISIS has recruited over the years thousands of Muslims from these Russian republics like Chechnya and Dagestan, which we're seeing on the map now here on screen.You know, and also, we just saw in March that four Tajik recruits to ISIS carried out the attack on a Moscow concert venue that killed 145 people. Now, we don't know if this is ISIS. There has been no claim of responsibility so far. After the Moscow concert venue attack in which 145 people were killed, ISIS relatively quickly claimed responsibility on Telegram. That was ISIS-K which is the ISIS affiliate that's mostly based in Afghanistan, and it obviously has some freedom of movement in Afghanistan and elsewhere to carry out these kinds of attacks because of course the U.S. military presence is gone as of August 2021. So, you know, we'll see, but I mean this appears to be a jihadist terrorist attack. There is a terrorist investigation ongoing. You know, if it's not ISIS that claims responsibility, it could be other similar Islamist groups that exist in Dagestan or Chechnya, or these other predominantly commonly Muslim republics in Russia.",

One is Russia has long supported Syrian President Assad, who was a mortal enemy of ISIS, and Assad and ISIS have been fighting war for a long time.And, you know, so, they -- and also Russia has, you know, of late have somewhat close relationships ironically with the Taliban which is in a war with ISIS.

He suppressed a lot of that concern with a strong State of the Union performance.But that was really -- you know, that's somewhat tennis without a net, even though, I mean, there were some pushback from Republicans in the audience. I think political professionals in both parties believe the most important outcome of this debate is going to be the verdict that Americans make on Biden after watching him for 90 minutes. But Trump, you know, Trump faces, you know, serious challenges also. He doesn't have the burden of convincing Americans to fire the incumbent. And that way he's kind of like Reagan in 1980 or Bill Clinton in 1992, where you have a majority disapproving of the incumbent president. And so it kind of -- it lessens the burden on the challenger to make a case against them. What the challenger has to do is convince voters that he is an acceptable alternative. And on that front, Trump's challenge I think is greater than Reagan's and greater than Clinton's because voters have watched him for four years. And there are a lot of doubts about, you know, the kind of presidency that he would bring. And Trump can either alleviate those doubts or contribute to them by behaving in the way that he did in that first debate in 2020.

Now if that in fact works, and people in the -- you know, in the audience don't hear interruptions, to some extent it will protect Biden from Trump and it will protect Trump from himself because I think Trump's biggest challenge in this debate is feeding into the narrative from the Biden campaign that a second Trump term, whatever you think about the economy when he was president, would be chaos and division and confrontation and so forth.And you know, left to his own devices, Trump might easily wander into performance that reinforces that narrative. Having the mic -- having his interruptions of Biden not heard by the audience, if Biden doesn't respond to them will allow Biden to make a more coherent argument, but will also in some ways, as I say, protect Trump from himself by preventing him from repeating the hectoring, belligerent, you know, almost unhinged performance in that first debate, which seems to encapsulate all the concerns about the chaos that swirls around him.",

Hagar said that one of the four fatal victims identified as 23-year- old Callie Weems died after she began using her training as a nurse to render aid to a gunshot victim, and unfortunately and tragically became a victim herself. Among the four people killed is also Shirley Taylor. She would have turned 63 on July 1st. Her daughter, Angela, actually confirmed her identity to CNN and said that her mother, who loved her family and children, was the hardest working woman she knew and a great person, adding that her family is now completely lost. In addition to Callie Weems and Shirley Taylor, 50-year-old Roy Sturgis and Ellen Shrum, who was 81, also died in the shooting according to the Arkansas State Police. A total of 13 people were injured by gunfire in the shooting Friday, including two law enforcement officers and 11 civilians. Hagar also called the shooting a completely random, senseless act, and officials say Posey, the suspect, is expected to be charged with four counts of capital murder. He's expected to have his first court appearance on Monday. It is unclear, Omar, if Posey has retained legal counsel at this point. Police also said that at this time the suspect's motives are unclear. Now back to you.",

A great game. Reese putting the Sky ahead with a layup off the glass. In the final minutes, she had 25 points. Clark had 17, but passing up the shots in the closing set. Aliyah Boston missing it. Chicago comes back from 12 down with seven minutes left, and they win it 88 to 87. A highly dramatic and emotional finish.
