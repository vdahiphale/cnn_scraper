We're live in Central Ukraine as the war grinds into its third winter. And the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be largely holding. I asked the head of the Middle East program at Chatham House, Sanam Vakil, what it means for Gaza, and I speak with Ryan Crocker, the former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Syria, and Pakistan. Plus, the potentially devastating impact of Ghana's gold rush. We have the first look at a report from inside that country. And lifting the veil on how the Catholic Church selects a new pope. I speak with director Edward Berger about his new movie, Conclave. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we start with the latest missile and drone barrage across Ukraine overnight, targeting the country's energy facilities just in time for the winter deep freeze. Air raid sirens sounded across the country, pushing people to take shelter inside Kyiv's subway system. This is also a warning Russian President Vladimir Putin's form of politics. He says the attack was in response to strikes inside Russia with U.S. weapons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Last night, we carried out a comprehensive strike using 90 missiles of similar classes and 100 drones. 17 targets were hit. These were military facilities, defense industry facilities, and their support systems. I repeat once again, on our part, these strikes took place in response to the continuous strikes on Russian territory by American ATACMS missiles. As I have said many times, there will always be a response from our side. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is largely holding. Yet the Lebanese army says Israel has breached the agreement, quote, \"several times\" since taking effect on Wednesday. Israel says it carried out a strike on, quote, \"terrorist activity\" in Southern Lebanon. Still, the deal has brought a respite after more than a year of cross border attacks. And two months of intense Israeli strikes inside Lebanon, they say, against Hezbollah, but more than 3,000 people have been killed, including civilians, according to the Lebanese government. And a million people, at least, were evacuated. But now, thousands of those displaced residents are returning. The U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN that the U.S. brokered truce, along with France, presents an opportunity to, quote, \"drive forward a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.\" Sanam Vakil is head of the Middle East program at Chatham House, and she's joining me here in London. Sanam, can I just first start by asking you whether you see with the arrival of Trump in about a month or so, do you see any crossover between what's happening and what might happen under Trump in Ukraine, and similarly, what Trump might bring to the Middle East?",

Also, Iran seems to be -- or you tell me how you're reading it, seems to be realizing that it and its partners in the Middle East have been weakened.

He claims and so do part of the incoming administration that the goal is a new, better, stronger, more robust deal with Iran that would constrain Iran's nuclear program. But this time there would have to be a regional element to it. I think this is where the past 14 months of Israel's effort against Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran also very much matters. The groups have been degraded. Iran certainly looks back footed and weakened, and the Islamic Republic has, over the past few weeks, been messaging unity, but perhaps also an intention to come to the negotiating table.",

One that will ultimately see the imposition of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 hopefully be implemented. Hezbollah has to move back beyond the Litani River. The U.N. and Lebanese Armed Forces are going to have to patrol this border area. And so, it's a lot to put on this Lebanese institution that is underfunded and has been under pressure.

So, this is a very dangerous and explosive situation. Can we get to a ceasefire in such a short time?

They will be playing to their population and trying to make sure that they are protected in some way, at least in terms of providing food and aid and security, which is, you know, difficult to think about right now. And more broadly, beyond that, they still hold all of these hostages. And that's, of course, their card that they are going to play in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
