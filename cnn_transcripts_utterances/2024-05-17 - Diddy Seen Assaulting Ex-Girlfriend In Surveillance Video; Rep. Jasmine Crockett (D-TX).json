New tonight, video exclusively obtained by CNN offers a direct contradiction to Sean Diddy Combs' claims that he did nothing wrong. The rap mogul insisted back in December that people were assassinating his character, destroying his reputation with sickening allegations for a quick payday. Quote, I did not do any of these awful things being alleged. But it turns out he did do precisely what his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, alleged in a lawsuit that she has since settled. Ventura claimed that in that suit, the rapper followed her around in a hotel hallway that was back in 2016. He yelled, grabbed her, threw a glass vase at her. The surveillance footage from that newly shuttered intercontinental hotel in Los Angeles mirrors exactly Ventura's words in horrifying detail. Representatives for Combs have not responded to that video as of tonight and the hotel says it doesn't have access to any footage or incident reports. But the silent and shocking surveillance video of the rapper beating and kicking and throwing his partner tells an undeniable story of abuse. I want to warn our viewers that what we're about to show you is graphic. But it is also the dictionary definition of domestic violence. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "It's true. First of all, with the video, word is that Sean Combs, or P. Diddy, purchased that video for $50,000 from the hotel. Now, that's a little odd because when a lawsuit starts, both sides have subpoena power to gather evidence, and it can be subpoenaed -- surveillance video can always be subpoenaed into a lawsuit.But it is very unusual, like you pointed out, that this lawsuit was settled so quickly. Usually there's time -- things don't go that fast in civil court. You know, there are allegations made, there are responses, there are attempts to settle their attempts to get the plaintiff who's asking she was asking for $30 million to get the number down, to see if there can be a settlement. It is very unusual how quickly it went. As to the video, which is obviously disturbing, the thing that I see in the video, which had this gone to a criminal court, and right now the statute of limitations, she didn't press charges in criminal court, Ms. Ventura, she brought the civil lawsuit, the statute of limitation in Los Angeles would have run to bring criminal charges. But had she done that, and you watch that video, I see at least three counts of assault, one for the first punch, two additional counts for the second, the two kicks that followed, then I see a count of potentially unlawful imprisonment for when he grabbed the back of her jacket, what it looked like, and pulled her along the hallway. He restricted her -- unlawfully restricted her ability to move. And then I see even another crime when he picked up her belongings and took them with him, that could potentially be a threat -- sorry, a theft charge. It could be even a robbery if he intended to keep the property unlawfully or retain it. So, he would have been in serious trouble had she gone a law enforcement route.",

What he did was unacceptable and is not what a real man, a black man, any man should do to women, period, full stop.Now, we can talk about the legal aspect of it. There is a statute of limitations thing that we have in place that's three years. Sometimes there's a way around it if a crime is recently found out, or if there's an assault victim who was afraid to come forward. So, there is a possibility that they could still move forward and advance this case, even though there is this three-year statute in California. The other part to this, though, is, as you, as, Kierna, you were talking about it's very difficult when you have someone who has high standing for victims to come forward because they don't think they're going to be believed. I would hope that with this video, it empowers anyone who had any similar experiences with Sean Combs to speak up. And I think I would hope that people would believe them, back them and try to get justice on their behalf because that's what they deserve, and there's no good in this video at all. But if it empowers people to come forward knowing they're going to be believed, you would hope that that's something that they can do.",

We'll discuss that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:32:32] PHILLIP: The real MAGA housewives of the Supreme Court of the United States. Today, more explanation from Justice Samuel Alito about how this upside-down American flag and symbol of election deniers across the country ended up flying outside of his home just days after the insurrection. Now, Alito claimed, again, in a conversation with a Fox anchor, that his wife was the one who hoisted the flag. He explained how the incident was the result of a neighborhood dispute, and he also says that his wife was called the C word by a neighbor. The justice said his wife flew the inverted flag in response to another flag put up in the neighborhood bearing the words F Trump. Joining me now is former lieutenant governor and columnist for \"The New York Post\" Betsy McCaughey, Coleman Hughes, author of \"The End of Race Politics\", Associate Professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, Leah Wright-Rigueur, and Donte Mills is back with us. Leah, what do you make of the second bite at the apple by Justice Alito about explaining how this insurrectionist symbol ended up outside of his house?",

The point that I think is important here is that it actually doesn't matter what explanation he comes up with, because there is no mechanism for holding anyone on the Supreme Court accountable other than the mechanisms, the actual guardrails of this other Supreme Court justices. So, they have a code of ethics that they instituted in 2023, but it actually doesn't mean anything besides they all sign on to it and they say, we will try and be ethical in our jobs.

GOVERNOR: That's right and let's -- let's look at the setting of this because ever since the Dobbs decision regarding abortion, the neighborhoods surrounding Justice Alito's house, Justice Alito wrote the majority decision in that case, has been swarming with neighbors who are very angry and outside protesters, as well. And it culminated one day in this very angry argument when some of the neighbors called Mrs. Alito the C word. And according to the justice, Mrs. Alito went home and flew the flag upside down, which is a symbol that would cause many people concern. But let's put this in perspective. There is so much push from the left to convince Americans that the court is in Donald Trump's pocket. But if you look at the facts, four cases have been decided by this court regarding Donald Trump. Four already. He lost three of them. He lost the two cases in 2020, Trump versus Mazar and Trump versus Vance, right? In 2021, he lost the Pennsylvania election case about how votes were counted in Pennsylvania during the presidential election. He's only won one case, the Colorado ballot case decided this March, and that was decided unanimously. Even the far left jurists on that court decided that it was farcical.",
