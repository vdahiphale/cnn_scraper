Actually, she has probably been working on it before that, because she was going to deliver a speech at this convention, no matter what. Obviously, she will have had to tweak it somewhat. She has s been rehearsing with the teleprompter at her hotel. She has been practicing in other places over the last couple of weeks.When you talk to her officials, there are a couple of themes, or three themes, I think, that she is going to strike, one is to try and introduce herself to the American people, which has been a theme throughout this convention. But, she'll rely on her background, as a working class background, as a prosecutor, and try and present that as a case for why she should be President. She will, of course, make the contrast with Donald Trump and try and present herself as a President for the future, as opposed to some of the darker themes that we have heard from the Republicans. And she will try and evoke this patriotic message that she'll be a President for all Americans. She does have a tightrope to walk somewhat. She wants to be the changed candidate and the candidate for the future, but of course, she is also the sitting Vice President. So, she'll have to manage that somehow. This isn't going to be a policy speech. These convention speeches are not designed for that. So, we're not going to hear a laundry list of what she would do as President, but certainly thematically, she is going to talk about what kind of President she should be, really trying to turn the momentum that she came into this convention with into a movement that will propel her into November.",

As we just talked about there with Kevin, I mean, the whole week was a pretty big buildup to this moment. Viewership, I imagine, will continue to be high. The stakes could not be higher. What does she say to meet the moment? RACHEL PALERMO, FMR. DEP. COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR TO VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: It's really important for her right now to tell her story to the American people. She often talks about how those first words when she ever stepped into a courtroom as an attorney was Kamala Harris for the people, and she is going to talk about her story and how her life has informed the way that she is fighting for people. And as a part of that, she is going to talk about her record as District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California, U.S. Senator and, of course, Vice President. But, she is also going to talk about the way that she was raised. She was raised in a middle class household, raised by a single mom, and a lot of those experiences has informed why she wants fighting for the middle class to be such a defining part of her presidency.",

I think the challenge is really going to be, can you then ignore the record that Governor Walz has had as governor? There was not much discussion about that last night, as your reporter mentioned. So, I think the big defining question in these next several weeks is going to be, to what degree is Walz put in the frame of a sort of Midwestern coach dad, all the things that I think would make him appealing, versus a governor who has had a quite progressive record, probably to the left of where most swing voters are.

And so, the way that I see it, Donald Trump is trying to be a distraction here to point out the fact that he views his vision of this country as something that should move us forward. But, the reality is, Donald Trump wants to take us back.

And they're searching under very extreme circumstances there because they're underwater. This giant yacht is filled with sort of electric cables and debris inside the yacht. So, they've got to navigate that to try to figure out where this young girl is, presumably in one of the sleeping suites inside the yacht.As they go back and forth, though, we've just seen different types of divers going back and forth. Whether they're trying to bring in extra different types of specialists, is a bit unclear. Before, there were cave divers, people who were expert in underwater rescue. Now, we've seen a kind of -- it what looks like a different contingent of divers going out.

SZUPLATAgain, just to bring it back to what we heard last night, that's exactly what Tim Walz did. He shared stories from his own life, and look at how it's resonated with people. We can connect with that. A lot of people here I've been talking to were surprised to hear that Kamala Harris worked at a McDonald's as a young person. That's a great little anecdote, a great little story, because millions of Americans have worked at McDonald's or had some. Millions of Americans eat there. It's a great little anecdote that really humanizes people and reminds us what we have in common. So, great speakers are great storytellers.",

Let's not forget that, with the exception of this year and 1968, there was a nominating process, and during that process, the winner, the eventual winner, defined his or her message to the party and won the party over. The convention was their time to speak to the nation. It was really the first time they'd spoken to the nation as the leader of the party. Kamala Harris is the leader of the Democratic Party right now. So, the speech she gives will not only define her, for many Americans who know she is famous but don't really know her at all, it also defines the campaign that follows.We've already heard elements of the themes, change, hope, freedom. She is going to tie them all together as previous candidates have done in one speech, and that'll be the basis for what goes forward. She and Governor Walz will be repeating these themes over and over again for the next 70 odd days. So, it's really important tonight to see how she frames it all. We've had hints. We've never seen the framing, and that's what the speech is about tonight. And the successful ones, they're the ones who etch words like the New Deal and the New Frontier and the fair deal, putting people first. Yes, we can. They will etch that on our history.
