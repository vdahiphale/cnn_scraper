      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. All right, happening right now, President Biden is on his way to the southern border ahead of the North American Leaders Summit in Mexico City.Moments ago, the President boarded Air Force One and departed from Joint Base Andrews for El Paso, Texas, where he will eventually assess the situation along the border for himself. And this will be Biden's first visit to the border during his presidency. His administration is under fire from Republicans and some Democrats over the migrant crisis along the southern border. El Paso, Texas has seen a record level of migrants and asylum seekers arriving in recent weeks hoping a Trump era law blocking border crossings would be lifted. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. So Arlette, this trip comes just days after Biden unveiled a new immigration plan. What more can you tell us about the President's visit and his goals?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, President Biden will spend roughly three hours in El Paso, Texas, a city that has really been at the center of the immigration debate for years now. And it is there where officials say President Biden will get a first- hand look of border enforcement operations, as he tours the bridge of America's port of entry with customs and border protection officials, as well as lawmakers from several border districts down in Texas.Additionally, while the President is on the ground there, he will also visit a migrant services center which has been critical to supporting the migrants who have come to the United States over the course of the past few years. But as the President is making his first trip down to the U.S.-Mexico border, it's also important to take a step back to talk about the political conundrum that the President has been facing when it comes to border issues on multiple fronts. First, the President has faced plenty of political heat from Republicans and some Democrats who have been frustrated with his lack of ability to address the record number, record level of border crossings that have occurred in the US. The President has argued that the way to fix these border issues is through comprehensive immigration reform. And he's placing the onus on Republicans to try to work towards that. But at the same time, the President is unveiling some migration proposals that are putting him at odds with his own party with allies within his party and also running counter to some of the very campaign promises the President has made. Most recently, the president on Thursday, announced that new policy which expands a humanitarian parole program, but it also expedites the removal of migrants who are trying to come to the United States outside of the legal process. He would be doing so under that controversial Title 42 policy that was put in place during the Trump administration. Several allies, groups as well as Democrats have been quite critical of the President and the administration for unveiling this policy. And as the President heads down to the border today, it certainly is putting this political liability of the border issue in the spotlight in the White House trying to show that they are trying to do something to address an issue that has really become very intractable.",

So I think that this visit of the President has already pushed forward another movement, another -- a group of people wanting to work towards a solution. And we all know we need to work together in order to get something done. And so I'm hoping really for possibly a McCain-Kennedy immigration bill that comes out of it. Make sure that we get more border security. We update the antiquated visa system, and that we really create a legal pathway for all the migrants that currently are here and that are contributing to our communities, but also the ones that are going to be coming as well.",

So when the Rosewood movie came out, and I was about 13, my dad sat me down. And advice, people may ask questions, you may hear about this, your grandfather was involved. But he's not going to answer questions. So he's not going to talk about it. And that was it. And it wasn't until I was in college at Morehouse, and I watched the movie, that I had a better understanding of what transpired.

And in both courses, I make sure students understand that different communities and different types of Americans are treated differently in the courts, their claims are considered differently. And so, I stressed that point, especially in the trial skills course. In the social justice course, I help them understand that it's not just voting rights. It's not just police violence, there's all kinds of ills that are intersecting, and happening to various community. So I focus a lot on.

Some of my students come from conservative backgrounds, and they've shared in the reflections with me, that has made them reevaluate how they engaged or have engaged at every level of their life or with their community, with their friends, with their schools. And it's also led some of them to share harms that their families have suffered. Even the non-black or I guess you would say white families have suffered over the years. So, they get it, they appreciate it. And they come back and tell me that.",

And I think we also need to recognize when -- even the things we do have, if you read the legislative history of those reparations, that they were hard fought for, and they were begrudgingly given in some respects. And others, I think it's just not enough. So we need to be creative of what we think about this, how to repair the harms to impacted families, not just for Rosewood, but for Ocoee, and for all the other massacres, and riots and violence done during Reconstruction in Jim Crow.",

I was someone, you know, who grew up in public schools in Maryland area, never heard anything about.And it's not an indictment of, you know, where I grew up, and where I went to school and all the great, you know, teachers who taught me, but I didn't learn anything about it. It was only after, you know, high school, that I would learn about it. And so many people to this day are just hearing about it for the first time. You know, so I wonder what your thoughts are about these very important powerful pages of history, that are just people, are just now being enlightened of so much of it. And what that says about where we are, how much further we have to go, what kind of work we need to do. BARRY-BLOCKER: It's very concerning. So many of the living witnesses to those eras are dying or have died. So we're losing access to important information, important perspectives. I, too, grew up in public schools in Central Florida, never learned about Rosewood, never learned about Ocoee, never learned about Tulsa. So I would love for that information to be taught, in fact, then we can teach reconstruction. And we see how critical that is in light of January 6. But I also think it's important upon parents and family members to take this opportunity to self-instruct, to give their children the books that touch on these topics, to broach it at family reunions, to take them to landmarks and places and have these conversations and you can have it at age appropriate levels. I grew up in with my dad's 1970s Black Power books and black history books surrounding us. So there was always an interest there in the background. But I would encourage families now. Even if the government or the state, in your area won't do it as they should, I encourage families to go ahead and teach that information just like I'll be doing for my girls.",

First, they must pass a new set of House rules as every new Congress does. And this tops their priority list once they reconvene tomorrow, as it formalizes some of the many concessions McCarthy agreed to in his quest for Speaker.Among them, allowing a single member to bring a vote to the floor to try to oust the speaker. Also establishing a special committee to investigate the Department of Justice and FBI, a key target for House Republicans. And earlier this morning my colleague Jake Tapper asked Congressman Chip Roy, who was a key holdout if he would vote to oust McCarthy as speaker if he failed to carry out promises that he made on the debt ceiling.

One soldier in a separate video also asks whether the town of Izium in the Kharkiv region was liberated from the Russians. That town was liberated in September, which goes to show you just how little information, how little access to information these troops actually had.

You've got more than 15 million people here in this green color showing you where they are under flood watches because of how much rain and snow is expected with this next round of showers moving in. Here you can see that next round starting to make its way in as early as this evening across northern and central portions of California. That wave pushes in and then again, by the time we get to Tuesday and Wednesday of the upcoming week, an additional wave of moisture is set to push into these exact same areas. Because of the prolonged nature and basically having one storm after another with not much of a break in between, you're looking at multiple days of what we're talking about the potential for excessive rainfall. This red area you see here having a moderate risk for excessive rainfall and the potential for flooding over the next few days. Widespread, you're looking at 4 to 6 inches of rain, especially along the coastal regions. When we talk about snow, it's going to be measured in feet. Most of these areas 1 to 3 feet of snow but some of these areas could exceed 5 feet total. You're talking about a tremendous amount of snow. It's why you've got these winter storm warnings, watches and advisories set in place, but also some wind products too, Fred, and that's important too because it takes that snow and blows it around causing that visibility to be basically at zero for pro-longed periods of time.",
