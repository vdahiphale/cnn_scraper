Hicks, the former White House communications director, testified through tears, leaving an emotional impression that may pierce Trump's defense.The jury has already heard from multiple other big-name witnesses. It leaves a one-time Trump confidant, as well as the adult film actress at the center of the alleged scheme as the only two main characters who have yet to make an appearance, Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. The pair are no doubt important, but has the defense done enough to make the jury question their credibility, or has the prosecution done the equally important task of convincing the jury that Donald Trump attempted to keep these stories hidden because he wanted to help his election odds.

It was an historic decision when the judge decided that he had violated it the initial time. Prosecutors argued he did so four more - on four more occasions. And now, the minute that Donald Trump walked into this courtroom this morning, the judge said that, yes, he had violated it. And he said, going forward, if Donald Trump violates it again, he will consider jail time.I've got CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, and Karen Friedman Agnifilo, the former for chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan DA's Office, here with me. And, Paula, this is really notable because the judge is saying, I don't want to have to put you in jail, but you're walking up to that line essentially.",

Now, this contempt finding, this comes after last week, prosecutors argue that Trump had violated his gag order four additional times. The judge had already found that he had violated it nine times. And based on today, he says, I'm finding you in criminal contempt for the 10th time. It appears, again, based on these live updates we're getting from inside the court, that the judge only found him in contempt for one of the additional alleged violations. Now, the judge saying to Trump, your continued willful violations of this court's lawful order constitute a direct attack on the rule of law.

And the judge did leave the door open in one of the previous proceedings to saying, yes, look, you have a point. And interestingly here the judge says that with two of the referenced alleged violations that had to do with Michael Cohen, the judge said the court cannot find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant's statements referenced were not protected political speech in response to political attacks by Michael Cohen.So, here the judge is giving Trump somewhat of a win that two of these alleged violations, comments he made directed at Michael Cohen, were protected political speech because the judge has acknowledged that Michael Cohen repeatedly, consistently, attacks the former president. Now, he's the defendant. It's a different standard for him.

Which is part of the reason many were so concerned about the idea, well, why did you wait so long to have, one, the hearing about these issues, and, two, to make your decision because conceivably he could have had other dates he violated as well.

They would certainly know that he had been locked up for some reason or other. But I think the timeline is crucial here, as Laura was pointing out, because while I share in the criticism of the judge for taking too long to hold these hearings and to issue these rulings, it sort of looks like it's working a little bit, right? Ever since the judge came out last week and said, if I have to, I will lock you up, Trump has not violated the gag order. Now, he doesn't deserve a gold medal for that or anything, but it's been a solid week and change since Donald Trump has actually violated the gag order.And he now seems to understand what he can and cannot do.

But it's interesting, as McConney took the stand, he described how Trump was, quote, the brains of the Trump Organization up until, though, 2017, which is, of course, the year that all of this alleged criminal conduct occurred.
