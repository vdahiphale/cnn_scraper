It was so relatable. I absolutely heard that last line of hers where she says, you know, if you're going through this, you're not alone because she understands that exactly what she's going through, even with all of her wealth and fame, as you so rightly say, and privilege, it's still something that millions and billions all over the world are going through themselves too.

You've got King Charles getting treatment for cancer, and at the same time you've got his heiress, an heiress to the crown by marriage, also getting treatment at exactly the same time. It's rare to happen in any family whatsoever, and one really thinks about them as a family now.The immediate response in the U.K., and, in fact, all over the world, has been shock and surprise, and at the same time, a kind of immediate respect and discretion. So, I think what will happen this year, maybe this year going into the next year for six months or so, is we will not expect to see all those great big shows of pageantry that we're so used to with the royal family. There will be a certain amount of diplomacy and discretion. I don't think anyone will be calling upon any other less famous royals or less prominent royals to somehow step into place. I think maybe the demands of being a royal will lessen. And, frankly, I think that's a good thing. If you looked at the late Queen Elizabeth II's schedule, it was extraordinary. She was out at engagements every single day. She was inexhaustible. She could do that. But I'm not sure it's fair to demand that of everyone all the time just because they're famous, just because they're royal, that they should be absolutely exerting themselves, particularly at a time like this. PHILLIP:  And, of course, it comes at a time when this has been perhaps decades in the making, there have long been questions about just what does the modern monarchy even look like, and now it will be a little bit more in the backburner, as you just noted. As all of this is happening, Prince Harry and Meghan released a statement about Prince Harry's brother -- sister-in-law, I should say, saying that they wish for health and healing for Kate, and for the family, and hope that they are able to do so privately and in peace. This is a relationship that is not on the best of terms, let's be honest. The statement needed to be made, what do you hear in it?",

The privately and in peace are two very loaded phrases.Having said that, I think that is actually what every side of the family wants at this time. You mentioned how we haven't really heard from Kate Middleton since January or so, and this is why so many people were speculating in such a lurid way. It's a very tricky bargain. If you are so prominent and you are so privileged and you come from literally centuries of hereditary privilege, people do feel as if they own a part of you. They feel almost justified in gossiping or wanting to know a little bit more. However, that must never overstep the mark and it must also be sensitive to the time. This isn't just some sort of latest chapter in a soap opera. It's a family like any other where you've got the patriarch, the king, but also the heiress to the throne, both very ill and receiving treatment, even though they are both very reassuring in the sense of telling people we're getting the best care. I am well. We are moving forward. But, yes, privacy and peace are to be hoped for, and I think it's gracious of Harry and Meghan that they did at least release a statement very, very promptly.

Rachel, this is something that's very understandable on a human level, that Princess Kate and Prince William would want to handle this privately. At the same time, they are royals there in the public eye, and the palace made a lot of choices over the last few weeks that really fueled all of this.

I thought it was particularly interesting when Kate released the statement today that it was her talking to camera. That's completely unheard of in the scope of medical news that we've heard from the royals in the past.

But it is a shutdown nonetheless, and this has been such a tortured process to get here. Remember, they were supposed to have funded the government back in October, but they kicked the can down the road, passed stopgap bill after stopgap bill. And when they finally released this massive package, they only did it yesterday at 3 A.M., giving themselves very little time to read the bill and get it through both chambers. So at this point, it does look like Congress is on track to shut down the government. Abby.",

These are states that flipped from red to blue in the 2020 election. The latest CNN polling shows a dead-even race between Biden and Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, with 46 percent of registered voters planning to vote for each candidate.Meanwhile, Biden trails in Michigan, with 50 percent of registered voters saying they plan to vote for Trump. That's compared to 42 percent who say they plan to vote for Biden. For more on this, I want to bring in Michael Moore. He's the filmmaker and author and host of Rumble with Michael Moore, the podcast. Michael, good to see you again. Since October, no poll has shown Biden even close to winning Michigan. That's the reality. Are you worried that Biden could lose the state? MICHAEL MOORE, OSCAR-WINNING FILMMAKER:  Well, sure. Hillary lost it in 2016 by about 11,000 votes, or approximately two votes per precinct. So yes, there's a way to lose Michigan. And I'm sad to say that Biden is playing a game here, where he doesn't understand. And it's not just in Michigan. It's, you know, also you said in Pennsylvania, but Minnesota. After 13.5 percent of Michigan in the Michigan primary voted uncommitted, you know, mostly people who would have and probably did vote for Biden in 2020. Minnesota, 20 percent, two weeks later, voted uncommitted. You can't have that many people not willing to commit and possibly staying home. Now, I mean, the uncommitted people are not going to switch from Biden to Trump. Nobody wants Trump in there. Everybody needs to do whatever we all can do to make sure he doesn't win in November. But if you don't understand that your support and your funding of this war in Gaza, the slaughter of 31,000 plus people, mostly the majority elderly and children, that you've lost young people. Look at the poll numbers for just young people in terms of who's turned away from Joe Biden.",

The chance of a lot of those people staying home because they're seeing people that they know, people that look like them, that are them being killed -- why are you risking losing those voters? Why aren't you listening to young people? You know, young people, you know who he really hates for the most? Young people, because they're the ones sent to war. So, whenever they hear that we're doing saber rattling again, invading countries or in this case funding --funding this war. This war, Abby, could end tomorrow simply by the United States pulling the plug on the war machine. Not, you know, not pulling the plug on supporting Israel, protecting anybody who's being slaughtered in Israel. Well, nobody wants that.

But -- but to personal -- I'll just say what I personally think Biden needs to do about this particular issue of the economy.He needs to get rid of some staff. His campaign staff is going to cost him this election. He has got to get people that can get the message out, can speak clearly. He can -- he can do that. That State of the Union was incredible, you know. So, he knows how to do that. But if he doesn't have the people that understand and especially understand Michigan, you know, as Michelle Goldberg said in \"The New York Times\" a couple of weeks ago, Biden's going to lose Michigan. If you lose Michigan, he's going to lose the election. We can't let that happen. But Biden has got to do a few things to stand up against war, a war that he and the United States is funding. And, you know, he's got look, he's done -- so, I've said this on your show before. He's done so many good things as President, so many things that he stood for, walked the picket line. No president has ever done that. He just this week, \"Wall Street Journal\" reported two days ago that he's got somebody over there from the DOJ in England, in London, negotiating an end to putting Julian Assange on trial. They -- they've decided somewhere in the Justice Department that this is crazy. [23:00:00] It's time to just let this guy go. They've had him, you know, he's 14 years as incarcerated one way or another. That is a way if you're trying to speak to the progressive left, the person responsible for telling us the lies that led us into the Iraq war and that and that the Biden administration essentially is done with trying to wanting to extradite him to the United States.
