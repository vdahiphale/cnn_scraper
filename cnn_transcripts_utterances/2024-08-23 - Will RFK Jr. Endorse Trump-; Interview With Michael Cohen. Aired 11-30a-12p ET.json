And when Kamala Harris came in, she brought back some of those soft Democrats from RFK. So you can see why the Trump campaign really wants him out of the race, because the thinking is that, if he gets out of the race and endorses Donald Trump, those soft Republicans are hopefully going to come over to his side. And, obviously, in a close election like this, you desperately need every vote you can get.",

So we kind of have a sense of where we are with or without him in the race. Now, if he tells his supporters to go support Donald Trump, maybe they go that way. But I actually think this is a larger liability for the Trump campaign, because it kicks the weirdness factor up to 11 with them. I mean, the question kind of is, what is he going to get out of this? Is he going to be at HHS, the guy who says Wi-Fi causes leaky brain or vaccines cause autism or there's no link between HIV and AIDS? The question is, what does he get? And I think it's a big question, too, as to whether or not he would even appear on stage with Donald Trump or whether or not they endorse and just kind of back away from it quietly.",

And if he's directing his voters where to go and they have nowhere else to go and they're going to Donald Trump, I don't think it's the worst thing in the world. I get what he's saying.

So look, Donald Trump is somebody who talks to anybody and everybody, as we all know. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

I think, a month ago, she was just hoping to secure the nomination. But -- so we do know that, a strong speech, a very strong convention. What we don't know is how this is playing in America, how this is going to settle in, and sort of what -- she goes from here.

He was the one that said, any time, anywhere, anyplace, he debates him. And they spent over a year developing this campaign to take on Joe Biden. Now he has an opponent that is 20 years younger, that has shifted the message, that is basically presenting herself as not an incumbent, but the candidate of change, a way to turn the page.

The Harris message of joy, this is something that -- this joyful warrior was something that was really a through line for everything.
