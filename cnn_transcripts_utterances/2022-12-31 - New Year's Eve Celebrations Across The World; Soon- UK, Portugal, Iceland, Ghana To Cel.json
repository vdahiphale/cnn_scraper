Thousands are on hand here.I can see about, I don't know, we're reckoning 80,000 or 90,000 people here down the banks of the Thames ringing in the New Year's celebrations. My goodness, it was something we haven't seen before, I can say that much. An army of drones also accompanied the fireworks this year, wishing the crowd a very happy New Year. And with it, we heard the voice of our late Queen Elizabeth II ringing out over the airwaves here, as was the voice of King Charles. We also heard Ukraine mentioned during these fireworks celebrations. We heard the song Stefania by the band Kalush Orchestra. We knew Ukraine was going to be recognized as part of tonight's festivities. And it was pretty special to hear Stefania ringing out here live tonight on New Year's Eve.
