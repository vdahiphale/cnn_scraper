Up late as always because I love it at the CNN Political Grill. Cheers on the right, gloom on the left. America's two political parties could not have a more different night.At this very hour, President Biden is recovering from COVID in Delaware. Yes, COVID. He is effectively now sidelined from his campaign and arguably the worst possible time that goes came out just as penning Democrats are trying once again, possibly to have conversations about him stepping aside and out of the race. Stand reporting tonight that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has privately told Biden that polling shows him he simply cannot win. And now we're told there are signs that Biden might be slightly more willing to hear his critics out. But of course, it's his choice in the end, they say. All the while in Milwaukee, there's no hand wringing in sight just fists pumps and applause. Republicans cheering for a third straight night as Donald Trump made his way to his perch in the convention call. Trump in attendance to watch his newly minted running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, take to the stage. His speech was part introduction, maybe reintroduction, part phrase, a lot of it praising his new boss and their share of view of America. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: President Trump represents America's last best hope to restore what if lost, may never be found again. A country where a working class boy born far from the halls of power can stand on this stage as the next vice president of the United States of America. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a, as he said, it's -- it's about a -- a nation as a collection of people and a piece of land. Some critics even would say blood and soil as opposed to a document or a set of ideas, as he said in his speech.And so this is about, you know, it's about restricting immigration, pulling back on foreign adventurism. It's not about free trade and free markets, like we've heard so many Republican vice presidential nominees talked about in the past, very different from a Mike Pence vision, for example.

Vance can come in as a young whippersnapper that like I'm going to change the country and could potentially try and make a trope out of Kamala Harris as the Republican Party like Nikki Haley has tried to do making this threat that this woman might come in.Now I had an adjective thrown at me tonight that I was angry and I'm not I just am passionate about my views. And so I could see a J.D. Vance trying to get a Kamala Harris in a position where he could be like, don't be so angry. Kamala Harris is smarter than that. She's savvy. She's a prosecutor. She can handle on her own. And so I think that matchup could actually pair very well. The reality though, is J.D. Vance has to accept the vice presidential debate invitation first.

You could either argue was 1984 with Fritz Mondale and Gary Hart or I think the better argument is 1980 with Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy. Well, either way, the result coming out of that convention in 1980, as well as a result in '84 was a Democratic Party that got totally annihilated in November that were easy wins for Ronald Reagan. And honestly in both really 84 and 88 as well, you had a united Republican Party.

Because the reason that conventions are contested is because the party is in a panic because they think they're going to lose. So the division in the party has already happened.

But it would be a little harder. Here's one thing I'll just say and I'm going to give some advice to my Democratic friends. Black voters are potentially -- I don't believe the polling that I'm seeing. I'm seeing some other polling where the whole sample are only black voters and the numbers aren't matching when like you have just a smaller portion of the sample and polled being black folks. Black folks are saying deliver for us. Don't take us for granted. And right now, we have a Democratic Party where black voters are telling them just leave the ticket as it is and if you don't, support Kamala Harris. And so if Democrats do something else than that, that's actually heeding the narrative Republicans are trying to say that Dems aren't listening to them.
