Politicians grapple with how to oversee Artificial Intelligence. The EU lawmakers spearheading new AI regulation joins me live. And Rome's Colosseum begins offering visitors a hands-on way to engage with history. Live from Abu Dhabi, it is Friday, April 21st. I'm Eleni Giokos. I am in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Great to have you join us tonight. Elon Musk is ushering in a new era on Twitter where status is a gift and verification must be paid for. Well, he is stripping blue checkmarks from celebrities, journalists, as well as government agencies that are not paying for Twitter Blue. Not even the Pope, Paul McCartney of all people, Kim Kardashian have been spared, but some of Twitter's most high profile users have been, Musk says he is personally paying to ensure that LeBron James, Stephen King, William Shatner remain verified. It is almost as if he sensed the chaos that would ensue from unverified users, which is exactly what is happening right now. Here is one example. An impersonator trolling New York City's official government Twitter accounts over who is real. Clare Duffy in New York standing by for us there. Clare, we spoke about this as the news broke as we were -- we all saw our blue checkmarks, you know, evaporate last night. It has been messy. He is personally paying for a few people. I don't know what metrics he is using, and who is important to him personally, but this is messy.",

I mean, the bottom line here is that there is no clear policy about what the rules are, who is getting verified, who is getting unverified, and when you don't have any clear policy, it just -- I think it risks creating a lack of trust in the platform. People don't know what the rules are, they have a hard time telling what's real and what's not, and I think that's really the big risk that Musk is taking here with this change. He is betting on the fact that people are going to pay $8.00 a month for this verification, but I think there is also a world in which these high profile users who in a lot of ways have brought benefit to Twitter by tweeting and bringing an audience say, you know, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to participate on this platform where a bad actor could easily impersonate me and make me look bad. There are lots of other platforms where they will verify me for free, and they might even pay me for creating content, and that's sort of the opposite of what Musk is asking them to do here.",

For people like me who are journalists, who use and share credible information on Twitter that that credibility is now gone because any other malicious person, a bad faith actor can use the free verification to mislead, to misinform, to impersonate, and to run scams and frauds there. So, the problem here, Eleni is that, if unchecked, Twitter could easily become an impostor's paradise, a scammer's paradise, a fraudster's paradise because of this chaotic sea that's been created by Elon Musk, and I think it appears to be that this chaotic design, this de-legitimization of the media, this de-legitimization and devaluation of journalist voices, credible voices on the platform, is a feature, not a bug.

In South African rand, where I come from 145 rand a month, that's basically a day's wage for many people in the country.

But that also is consistent with Elon Musk's inconsistency about every policy change as Twitter. And here's the problem, for instance, we've been covering this whole week the conflict in Sudan and the war between these two Generals, and Twitter is one of the main tools that people are using to organize, to share credible information. And already even in Sudan, a fake account has been created for one half of this conflict, the Rapid Support Forces that's already claiming and sharing fake news so to speak. So that is a problem. When you see the conflict situations around the world, we've covered the Tigray conflict in Ethiopia for a long time, social media is a big tool. If people, malicious actors take advantage of that to mislead people to incite people to violence, this could have real world harm in ways that I don't think has even been imagined at this time.",

And I think a lot of the actions that Elon Musk has taken over the past, well, the past six months since he took over the company really just takes away from that and devalues the product, what it was at its heart. And I gather there is a lot of Elon Musk fans who agree with him, who think that those of us who were legacy verified, just don't want to pay $8.00 because we don't like the democratization, but I think that's a fundamental misunderstanding of why some people are verified -- emergency services, government agencies, and law enforcement, for instance -- and once you take away all of that, there is a lot of harm potentially that could befall everyone.",

Okay, so as blue checks disappear from Twitter, some are worried the platform will be more likely to spread false information generated by Artificial Intelligence. Elon Musk has called for a pause on AI development in order to manage the risks. Some European lawmakers say they agree in principle with this warning. Twelve of them signed a letter citing the need for significant political attention and they are urging US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, to hold a Global Summit on AI. Dragos Tudorache is one of those lawmakers. He's a Romanian Member of the European Parliament. He joins me now live from Brussels. I mean, to say in the least that people are worried about AI, its capabilities and what the regulatory platform would look like, is an understatement.

The technology is always neutral, it is how you use the technology that makes it good or bad. So therefore, what we do is to look at the potential risks that the technology might bring, and then we categorize the different applications of Artificial Intelligence into applications that could simply be too risky, too harmful to our interests, to the interests of our society, and that will be banned. Applications that will be high risk or low risk, and then depending on that, there are various levels of compliance that developers or deployers will have to go through. And as far as generative AI, because right now, everyone is hyped, and I understand about generative AI and generally about foundational models, again, we have been looking into them for a couple of months already, already before December when ChatGPT became known by everyone and we are taking very seriously the writing of rules, also with respect to this kind of AI. That is why, we chose to reply to the letter signed by so many business leaders and experts into AI because we think that here in Europe, we look responsibly on how to deal with these models is the way to go, and that is why we're also making this call to our leaders to take very seriously the need to seek convergence at the global level, and have a conversation about the impact of these models on our societies.",

But I think, again, if we look at some of the effects of AI lately in our societies, I think it's clear that we have gotten to the stage where self- regulation is not enough because you do have companies that are diligent, companies that are responsible that will choose to basically, be very careful about how they put products on the market. But there will also be companies who choose not to, and I think we also have a duty as policymakers to create a level playing field for companies so that they rather than racing to the bottom, and then again, induce risks in the society, that are not good for our citizens and for the health of our democracies, but rather actually raise up to a standard that is considered acceptable.

So Raab resigned Friday, but said the report was flawed and in setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry is a dangerous precedent. He said that Ministers must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accepted the resignation and responded in a letter writing. As you say, you had rightly undertaken to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever.

But you're worried about them being far too aggressive in the way that they're hiking rates. You know, policymakers, it's difficult for them to actually make a decision. We saw what happened when they missed the opportunity to start tightening. And now we've really got to go aggressive into this. What would you say the best method is for the Fed going forward to ensure that they don't, you know, over -- that take too much money out of the system at this stage?",

Instead, Communist Party supporters are turning attention towards banking woes in the U.S. Selina Wang has this report from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In China's central Hunan province this month, demonstrators chant, give me my money back. One poster reads, America's Silicon Valley Bank customers got their money back in three days, but China's Hunan village banks customers haven't been given a cent in a year. These protesters are victims of a banking scandal that started last April when several small banks in Hunan froze depositor funds, impacting an estimated 400,000 customers according to a state-run magazine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Some depositors, myself included can no longer survive. Because all of our money is stored there. Some people may commit suicide, some depositors may hurt others. Everyone has a tipping point.",

Last summer, police violently crushed peaceful demonstrators demanding their money back. Then, weeks later, authorities blamed the scandal on financial fraud, arrested hundreds of alleged suspects and promised to start paying depositors back. Chinese media has reported that the government has the crisis under control. But has ignored the stories of these bank victims. Meanwhile, pro-Communist Party social media influencers have been zeroing in on the bank failures in the U.S. This one says, explosive news, the U.S. is facing a catastrophe. Another says, it might be the end of the U.S. if they fail to handle this well. And state tabloid Global Times published this dramatic infographic, but the U.S. government quickly stepped in to pay back the depositors in full. WANG (on camera): Have you received any sympathy, any response from the authorities? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): No, I have not. The government's attitude is that as long as they've suppressed the people with problems, there is no need to pay back the money. It is completely different from how Silicon Valley Bank was handled. WANG (voice over): This depositor from Zhejiang province went to the protests last summer and says he was beaten by the police. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): If I can't get the money soon, then my children and I can only live on the streets. WANG (on camera): Do you have hope that you're going to get your money back? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): People like us have been robbed of money. Yet we are treated like criminals. If my money cannot be withdrawn, only one option is left for me, which is death. WANG (voice over): Back in Beijing, the lawyer says his relentless legal efforts may be their only hope. WANG (on camera): If you do get the money back. What is your plan? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Leave the country with kids and parents because I want my children to grow up in a democratic, free and rule of law country. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.

But nonetheless, one container, it contained about $15 million -- U.S. dollars-worth of gold and other valuables. We don't know what the other valuable are. About 20 million in Canadian dollars. They say it was transported to a cargo holding area and they're making a point to tell some outlets that this cargo holding area was under contract or leased by another company. So, they're trying to say wasn't necessarily under full airport security. But then this thing just vanished. They're not saying whether or not there was any video involved. They're not saying if it was an inside job. And when people say, was this the work of professionals? I'm going to kind of waffling on that too. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What do you do with 500 roman-era coins? With limited space in the site's new museum, the Colosseum is trying a new hands-on approach. Warehouses and storage facilities brimming with artifacts are currently open to visitors. These former shops and market stalls have been converted into temporary museum space to hold the leftover artifacts that didn't quite fit into a new museum that opened in 2021. Until the end of July, eight visitors at a time can reserve a special tour guided by an archaeologist, who will let them hold these important historical finds. Many of which have not been on display in 30 years. In this way, the people have direct contact with the ancient culture and materials, archaeologist Roberto L. Terry (ph) says. After that, their fate is unknown. The popular pieces will upgrade to the museum and the rest will go back to collecting dust in the warehouse. Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, says she hopes the project gives people a better understanding of daily life in ancient Rome. These artifacts tell the story of daily life, how they carried out activities and above all, to bring these objects that would otherwise have remained hidden in our warehouses. She also hopes other historical sites open up their warehouses to let people see all history has to offer and to bring the past into focus. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
