And there was one man at the scene that had a connection to 911 and he was having trouble describing to them where he was at and what he was doing.So I just kind of jumped in there, gave some directions on where the shooter went. He gave me a description. And then I started trying to take care of victims. And sadly, the first individual I went to was -- and I don't want to be too graphic, but she was not able to be saved. I couldn't save the second guy. The third guy actually expired while I was trying to do chest compressions. The child came out from under, what I believe was the mother, it might have been a relative, I don't know how the relation is, but started to wander around asking for help, saying mom, mom, mama, mama. So I just scooped the child up and took him about 15 feet away so she couldn't tell what was going on. There was so much blood on the child, I couldn't tell the sex. I just asked are you OK, checked for wound. The first Allen police officer pulled up and said, good God almighty. I take the child. Is he hurt? I said, I don't know if he's hurt or not, take him, because he doesn't need to be here. So thankfully, the Allen police department, this was a Uvalde situation.

I asked the director, based on what he witnessed in this tape, was it an intentional act? And he said \"no.\" back to the driver. Police say he's not cooperating.
