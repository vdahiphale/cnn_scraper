Just ahead, as a Paris conference kicks off, Ukraine's leader has a message for the world, help us survive the winter.Crypto's former king under arrest. And during court this morning, the latest on the charges against him. And a CNN exclusive will hear from a U.S. oil executive who was falsely imprisoned for five years and tortured in Venezuela. Ukraine's President is appealing for critical winter aid as Russian strikes continue pounding key energy targets throughout the country amid subzero temperatures. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is asking for more than $840 million from dozens of allied nations and institutions gathered at a conference in Paris focusing on the needs of Ukrainian civilians. It comes as fighting rages across the front lines. Heavy shelling was reported overnight in the southern region, and a key transport bridge was targeted in Russian occupied Melitopol. CNN's Will Ripley joins us live in Kyiv. So it's really tough conditions to be fighting in and tough conditions to be living in.",

      "sentences": "It's certainly tough conditions to be living in if you don't have power, which is the situation for millions of Ukrainians every time there's a Russian airstrike. In fact, the air raid sirens just went off here in Kyiv a short time ago. Although it seems as if for now, things are clear. It might have been the presence of Russian fighters detected in the air in Ukraine. Sometimes they sound these alarms preemptively nationwide.That's a reality of daily life. You hear the alarms and you go on with your life. But in certain areas that have been the target of constant bombardment and also areas that are being hit hard with shelling on the front lines in the south and in the east, it truly is incredibly difficult for regular people to hold on to any semblance of normality in terms of living for days on end, in some cases without electricity, even as crews raced to restore the energy grid. So for the vast majority of Ukrainians, it's not necessarily bombs right now, but the lack of power and also in some cases, interruptions to the water service. And people that don't have heat during these outages are particularly vulnerable, especially the elderly and those with young children. But people are trying to do the best they can. There has been intense fighting and some real counter offensives happening from the Ukrainian side. Certainly on the southern front line from the liberated city of Kherson, Ukrainian forces are continuing their onslaught on Russian held territory across the Dnipro River. And it is a situation where there are reports that are coming in that are obviously difficult to confirm without being on the ground. But these are officials that are, you know, either sharing on social media. Sources, you know, speaking on various platforms, or speaking directly to CNN that Russian targets are being hit. And there may be a situation where Russian forces, now that Ukrainian intelligence seems to know where they're being held, they're having to scramble and try to find new places to house their soldiers. That was certainly not only just the situation in the south and Melitopol, one of the cities that has been getting hammered by Ukrainian artillery, but also a situation happening in the east, Russian occupied Luhansk region. The city of Kadiivka was hit with a strike that was reportedly incredibly deadly. Talking about huge losses on the Russian side when Ukrainian missiles launched with U.S.- made equipment hit a hotel. And the hotel was reportedly headquarters for those private mercenaries of the Wagner group out of Russia. These are the civilian, you know, fighters who essentially are hired to do the dirty work that the Russian Army doesn't want to be officially connected to. They've been linked to alleged human rights atrocities and conflicts around the world. And it is possible that members of the Wagner group who were sleeping in that hotel suffered heavy casualties, Max. So, the Ukrainian military continues to call for more weapons. They call for patriot missile defense systems as the number one item on their list. As the defense minister told us over the weekend when we spoke to him down in Odesa, of course, that southern city has been hit particularly hard by power outages, even though the war has not come to their city. The impact of the war in terms of the loss of electricity has been a huge factor in the lives of nearly everyone who lives in the Odesa region, Max.",

But this seemed to have come together very fast. And we're expecting Bankman-Fried to appear in the Bahamas court around 10He was arrested last night at the request of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. And that office will be unsealing charges today. They have not yet put that public, but we have a glimpse into what this investigation has yielded by the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil charges which were announced this morning. As you say the SEC is alleging that this was a house of cards built on deception. And according to the SEC, that Bankman-Fried and others have defrauded investors. Those are people that invested in FTX as a company and also those who use their platform for trading. Among the many allegations is that Bankman-Fried had taken customer funds that are, you know, supposed to be used for one purpose and then diverted them to a hedge fund that he was also running. Now, this hedge fund that they say -- the authorities say was then using -- Bankman-Fried used the money that he diverted in the hedge fund to fund other ventures, to also purchase luxury real estate for himself, his family and other executives in the Bahamas, and also to take out personal loans and make political donations. Authorities say that Bankman-Fried had taken out $1.3 billion himself in loans. Other executives had taken out loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars. What they say was basically using this hedge fund and customer funds as their personal piggy bank. And then we're also expecting charges from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, that's another U.S. regulator. Those will be announced today. Big question will be, at today's hearing in the Bahamas, what will be the course? How quickly will he get back to the U.S.? And whether he will fight extradition. Max?",

And I think that is part of the frustration that we've heard express from Kenny DeLand's parents. Also the fact that for the time being, what we are hearing from prosecutors down in Grenoble, Max, is that they are looking into the possibility of whether he left voluntarily because he'd been telling friends, people in the south of France where he was, that he'd come under prepared. They were hearing that he'd been having trouble making friends, that he was planning to go to Marseille before heading back to the United States. And then there is, of course, CCTV footage that has now been found of him in a sports shop on the 3 December, several days after he cut off contact with his parents or certainly gave them no more news. Looking well and certainly under no duress, that is, for the time being, what we're hearing from the French prosecutors. From the part of Kenny DeLand's family, though, a great deal of frustration and just disbelief that this might be possible. They say it's completely out of character. Their son never went more than a couple of days without speaking to them. And there is also what he left behind with his host family, Max. Things like his computer, his train passes, his phone charger, exactly the kind of things that you would take with you even if you were planning a short trip. And of course, all of this is playing out, Max, as the clock continues to tick down towards the holiday season. Kenny DeLand was due to fly back to the United States on Thursday, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they are pushing back against the IDF explanation for what happened. What we understand is that this took place on Sunday evening as the Israeli military was carrying out an arrest raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank. These types of arrest raids, Israel calls them counterterrorism operations have become a regular occurrence, especially this past year. Israel says they're going after militants.But as we've seen, there has been a rising death toll, especially for Palestinians in the West Bank, as a result of these military raids. Now, the IDF says most of the people who are killed in these raids or in these operations were militants who were clashing violently with their soldiers. But as we're seeing, especially with this case now, as the IDF themselves say, innocent bystanders are being also killed as a result. So what we know is that this raid took place on Sunday night. Jana's family said that as they heard this sort of heavy gunfire, she decided to go up to the roof of their building to get a better look to see what was happening. And then after the raid was over, about 20 minutes later, her family went looking for her, and that's when they found her on the roof and said that she had been shot four times. Now, the Israeli military says that during the raid, they came under a heavy gunfire. There's exchange of fire. And they say that their soldiers were aiming towards gunmen that they say were on roofs near Jana. They say that under the initial inquiry, it was determined that the girl who was killed was hit, they say, by unintentional fire aimed at armed gunmen on a roof in the era from which the force was fired upon. Now, the IDF, the Defense Minister, and the Israeli Prime Minister, Yair Lapid, as you noted, have expressed sorrow and condolences to the family, but they say they still stand by the Israeli military and how they carry out their operations. But the family, Jana's family, her uncle, in particular, is pushing back, telling CNN that they say there were no militants on the roofs around them. And they say -- and this is a quote -- \"There is no way this is a mistake. You can be mistaken with one bullet, but not with four.\" We are also hearing from the Palestinian Authority Prime minister, who is urging the United Nations to investigate this incident. And they say to put the Israel on the blacklist. And we're also hearing from the U.S. State Department, the spokesperson for the State Department, Ned Price, saying yesterday that they send condolences and they hope to see accountability in this case. Now, this has been a very violent year for both Israelis and Palestinians. We're seeing record levels of deaths that this region has not seen in years. And there's a lot of concern, especially from the international community, about what will happen in the next few months, as a new government, which is being seen as one of the most right-wing governments in Israeli history, is expected to take over any day now.

He's set to appear in court in just a couple of hours, and he's already facing charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.This is the man himself. He's going to become very recognizable if there is an upcoming trial. This is what we know about him. He's only 30 years old, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX. He says his bank balance now is $100,000. He denies knowing or knowingly committing fraud. Crucially there knowingly, he's not denying fraud as it was. Now this is a sense of how much money he's actually lost. Between November the 7th and November the 14th, he lost $16 billion in his net worth. Let's bring in CNN's Anna Stewart.

He's been very much the poster boy for cryptocurrency for many years now. The legitimate face, he was a regular on financial and crypto summit stages, irregular immediate interviews, a regular actually, on congressional panels. He was a man that could explain crypto. Now, of course, in recent weeks, he's become a complete pariah. There have been, Max, as you sure we know, many dodgy crypto exchanges. We have had scams, we have had scandals. The list is pretty long, but I don't think anyone expected it to come from FTX. This was the biggest exchange in the world. At one stage, it was valued at $32 billion. Investors included BlackRock, Sequoia Capital, and this has rocked the entire community. It means that trust is very thin. And for those that do think crypto and Bitcoin specifically are the future in terms of currency, decentralized currency, digital currency, this is really, really damaging.",

I'd say central to this issue is the fact that FTX, which was an exchange, looks like it used customer funds to support Alameda Research. That is, a hedge fund, a misuse of customer funds, a commingling of funds, essentially exposing customers to huge losses.But there are also other elements I'm seeing in written comments. For instance, allegations of loans and other payments to FTX insiders in excess of $1 billion. And I think the comment I'm most looking forward to sort of hearing in person, is this comment. John Ray is saying, \"Never in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever.\" SBF himself has not stayed quiet. I can't imagine this is the lawyer's dream. He has given countless interviews. He has tweeted, DMd. He even appeared recently, virtually on a stage, talking about what he's done. As you said earlier, he is convinced that while he's made mistakes, he did so unwittingly. He says essentially, that he's not as competent as he thought he was.
