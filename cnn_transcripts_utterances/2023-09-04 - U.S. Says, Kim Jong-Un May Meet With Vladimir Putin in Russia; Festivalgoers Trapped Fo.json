Of course, this comes as we have heard from U.S. officials over the last week or so that there are active pursuits between North Korea and Russia right now of an additional arms deal between the two countries. And we don't know exactly when this meeting between President Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could actually come, but The New York Times, which first reported on the possibility for this engagement, said that their reporting is expected to happen this month. Now, we have seen some, what would be potential legwork for this meeting in recent months. We should note that the Russian defense minister, Shoigu, traveled to North Korea in July. According to the NSC, that was an effort to try and convince North Korea to sell artillery to Russia. We know that there was a follow-on meeting by Russian officials to North Korea following that meeting. And according to the NSC, Kim Jong-un and President Putin have also exchanged letters over the course of the last few months committing to deepening their relationship. Now, when it comes to what could actually be in this potential new arms agreement between the two countries, here's what NSC's John Kirby said about that to reporters last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A year ago, there were reports that they would provide millions of ammunition rounds. That number seems high unless it includes small arms rounds, but it most likely would be 122 millimeter and 152 millimeter artillery rounds and multiple rocket rounds that they have a lot of and which is compatible with Russian equipment. And we've also seen Ukraine captured some of that ammunition and then using it to fire back at Russia, although it was fairly unreliable. So, it's a worrisome development, both for the continued operations in Ukraine, but also now if it seems that Russia may be providing technology to improve North Korean military capabilities, that is also very worrisome for the U.S., as well as critically important allies, Japan and South Korea.",

And I do believe, and I've been saying that Kim Jong-un was preparing to make this reemergence on the world stage after he got done with his big celebration, Korean War celebration in July, that he was going to set the stage to reemerge.So, he is resurrecting and strengthening this traditional relationship, this traditional alliance with Russia at a pivotal time. This is a way for him to reassure his people that they may have been isolated for three years, but they have not been forgotten by this superpower. But also remember that because of those border closures, they are in desperate need of food, supplies, and perhaps some of that technological know-how to help them get their military, their nuclear program to the next level. And there isn't often a time that North Korea, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, can offer something to Russia but here is a moment where Russia, where Putin has very few friends, and North Korea has something that he needs, which is munitions. It comes at a time when they are standing together in opposition to a U.S.-led coalition at the U.N. Security Council, where they are facing sanctions for their provocative behavior. So, it's very interesting for me. I'm not completely surprised, but like Bruce, I am very worried, because this clearly has patients that go beyond the Korean Peninsula.

But if you look at the Wall Street Journal poll, it's not just the primary results that were interesting. He's tied with Joe Biden in the head to head, and he was ahead of Joe Biden when you throw in the minor candidates that are also looking to be on the ballot. So, obviously, there is a world where this race is moving towards being over and that Joe Biden is in danger of losing to Donald Trump.

But here's the thing. I'd love to take a step back, if you don't mind, to go back to The Wall Street Journal poll. Here's what really matters. It's way too early to overinvest in polls. There was never a poll that said that Donald Trump was going to win in 2016. And, remember, the polls in the midterm election predicted a wave that never actually materialized. Here's a number that should matter most to Republicans. And that number is three. Donald Trump has lost the last three cycles for the Republican Party. Once the American people figured out who he was, they decided they didn't want any more of it. So, I think for them to overinvest in these polls is a fool's errand. I think they need to take a step back and really assess the situation. They could have a situation where, according to the most recent political poll, 50 percent of the country thinks that the president is guilty of trying to overturn the election.

And, Marcus, another question that has emerged, and we've heard this from legal scholars in recent days, is whether or not the 14th Amendment already disqualifies Donald Trump from running for president again based on a lot of what you looked into during the January 6th investigation.Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator, weighed in on the possibility of this. Let's listen to this and talk about it on the other side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): I thought actually it might have been a more productive way to go than the second impeachment to do a declaration under that section of the 14th Amendment. So, I think there is a powerful argument to be made. My sense is it's probably going to get resolved in the courts. I'll let the lawyers worry about the 14th Amendment. My colleagues and I are focuses on winning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Congressman, thanks for joining us. Happy Labor Day. Appreciate you coming on. What is your reaction to this potential meeting between Pyongyang and Moscow to discuss an arms deal? That sounds pretty concerning. What would the ramifications of that be? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Well, happy Labor Day and yes, it is concerning. It appears that North Korea has wanted to violate various U.N. Security Council resolutions an sell arms to the Russians for some time now, but the price they demanded, namely important technology for satellite launches as well as nuclear submarine technology, has been viewed by China and Russia as very steep. I think quite frankly, both sides are more desperate right now. On the one hand as you can see in Ukraine, you know, the Ukrainians have taken the initiative, breaking through front lines near Zaporizhzhia and the Russians are running out of artillery and then, of course, in North Korea, the famine goes on and has become even more acute.
