Now the Celtics have. Much more of our special live coverage of the 18th banner shortly. But, first, let me put this down. We are standing by for President Biden to make a major announcement on immigration. He will unveil a sweeping new executive action that impacts hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants. This provides legal protection for about half a million spouses of U.S. citizens and roughly 50,000 children. It comes just two weeks after a different executive action on immigration severely restricted the asylum process, and it comes a little more than a week before the historic presidential debate right here on CNN.

For months, police have been searching for her killer.Friday, this man, Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez was arrested at a Tulsa bar. Investigators say he is a suspect not only in Moron's murder, he's also wanted for multiple other crimes here in the United States and in El Salvador as well.

The DNA from Los Angeles scene led them to family members in El Salvador, and that led them to identify the suspect. Now, Rachel Morin, who you mentioned, she was 37 years old and a mom to five kids. She was raped and killed last August while hiking near her Maryland home in Harford County. That's just north of Baltimore. Her mother, Patricia, attended the press conference announcing the capture of her daughter's killer. She was giving up hope that he would ever be found. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICIA MORIN, RACHEL MORIN'S MOTHER:  Just because I am so grateful that they have brought us to this place. Because at some of the points during this process, I didn't think that we were ever going to have an end, that it was going to be a cold case. So, I would like to applaud them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's a suspect of a murder in El Salvador in January 2023 and multiple crimes in the U.S. since he crossed here illegally. Authorities say he came to the U.S. to try to escape the El Salvador murder. Martinez-Hernandez was arrested at a bar in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and by their own account, officers say they found the suspect casually sitting at the bar and place him under arrest. Initially, the suspect lied about his true identity and denied any knowledge of the crimes for which he was wanted. Martinez-Hernandez has waived his right to an extradition hearing and is expected to be moved to Maryland in the next couple of weeks to face first degree rape and murder charges.",

      "sentences": "Right. The unfortunate part is the wind. That's really been the big component driving both the fire in California as well as the fires in New Mexico. You've got 25 total active wildfires across the country, wind being the big concern.Now, note today that we do start to see some improvement across areas of California, especially the latter half of the day and going into Wednesday. But New Mexico, it's going to be quite a different story. You're still looking at those wind gusts 30, 40 miles per hour today and about 20 to 30 miles per hour tomorrow. That's going to be a big concern for the firefighters for this South Fork fire still at zero containment. The concern is how much improvement can they make in those containment numbers while battling the strong winds at the exact same time. That area is part of a good chunk of the state of New Mexico that is under that elevated fire risk for today, those strong winds, but also very low humidities and above average temperatures will be a concern. Other areas also looking at above average temperatures, and that's a pretty wide swath of the country. Now also, too, we're keeping an eye on the tropics. This is the system we're talking about, potential tropical cyclone one. This is going to be a concern for Texas and Eastern Mexico. Again, you can see the main system itself is likely going to slide in across portions of Mexico as a tropical storm. But notice you've storm warnings newly issued this morning for portions of Southern Texas, that's because we do still anticipate very strong winds with this. It is forecast to get to tropical storm strengths either later today or very early Wednesday. But the biggest concern with this one is going to be the potential for flooding. Now, it's a twofold. It's not just the rain, but also the storm surge. But look at some of these numbers from Houston all the way south. You're talking widespread four to eight inches of rain. Some of these spots could pick up more than a foot of rain before this system finally clears. Because of that, you have a moderate risk for excessive rainfall for Houston for today, and then Wednesday, starting to see more of that shift a little bit farther down to the south. But this is talking about that flooding potential there. The other thing to note, too, is the storm surge that we talked about. The greatest risk, this two to four feet area right here, this does include that area up around Houston and especially around Galveston. So, this is going to be the main concern here, areas a little bit farther east, including Port Arthur and into Louisiana, and then also areas further down to the south, including Corpus Christi and Brownsville, you're looking at about one to three feet there. So, this is also going to be a concern, especially really for about the next 48 to 72 hours, guys.",

And this is the why we care factor, right, because, you know, this is a critical American ally that we're talking about on the southern side of the DMZ, South Korea. There is the wellbeing of 26 million people here in the greater Seoul urban area. And I should mention, Sara, almost 30,000 American troops who are based within an hour's, two hour's drive from where I'm standing.So, the point is here, that as these two countries, North Korea and Russia, get closer together, there is more of a feeling of wariness between authorities in Seoul and Washington, D.C., that that closeness could upset security ties and the security situation here on the peninsula. But, you know, they're not getting closer because they're inherently friends. They want something from each other. So, what North Korea wants from Russia, it's a pretty long list. Now, at the top of it, it's better missile and satellite technology, which Russia can certainly help out with, in addition to food aid, energy aid, the, quote/unquote, prestige of standing with the leader, Kim Jong-un, standing on the same stage in Pyongyang with somebody like Vladimir Putin, who they see, again, from their point of view, as very strong on the world stage. What Russia wants? They want more ammo, bottom line, from North Korea to help prosecute their war against Ukraine and another ally to stand against the United States with. But, you know, Sara, we're hearing from a lot of North Korea experts lately that they anticipate maybe will get more economic ties rather than military ties when this meeting is all said and done, but maybe not so much even economic ties, because China is involved in all of this and they don't want a stronger North Korea, they don't want to change the status quo.

There are tensions along the DMZ. Earlier today, 8:00 A.M. local time, there were 20 to 30 North Korean soldiers who crossed over the median line. South Korea fires a warning shot and they all kind scattered back to the north. There's new photographic evidence of new construction that North Korea has done, most likely to harden its defenses along the DMZ and to prevent people from defecting to here in South Korea. So, we're going to be watching what each side gets. We'll know by the end of the day, local time tomorrow. And, Sara, if I can hard turn, since we're done talking about that, we just wanted to say here in the Seoul Bureau, We are so glad to see you back. I know you've been back for a couple days. We've been bouncing around between here in Seoul and the DMZ, but you are amazing. You have friends worldwide. We are so glad to see you back on T.V. So, we're going to wrap here.
