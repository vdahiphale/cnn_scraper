I'm John Vause at the CNN Center in Atlanta where it's just gone 1U.S. President Joe Biden will make his second visit this year to an active warzone. Traveling to Israel Wednesday a dramatic show support, which comes at a crucial moment. More than a week after a surprise attack by Hamas militants who murdered more than 1,400 people in Israel and Israeli ground offensive in Gaza is believed to be imminent, and eight days near constant Israeli airstrikes have left Gaza facing a humanitarian crisis like never before. And White House officials are increasingly concerned about a regional escalation. U.S. Secretary State Antony Blinken announced the President's visit during a marathon diplomatic mission across the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: He's coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region. And for the world. The President will reaffirm the United States solidarity with Israel and our ironclad commitment to its security. President will hear from Israel what it needs to defend his people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not stop until Hamas's military and government capabilities are destroyed. Meantime, Israeli authorities believe nearly 200 people are being held hostage in Gaza. While Hamas representative says they may have between 200 to 250. The group has released its first hostage video, 21-year- old Mia Schem. CNN has made a decision not to show that video, which has Schem talking about an arm injury and that she was taken to Gaza. It's unclear when the video was recorded or if she is still alive. Schem's mother says she is grateful though to have seen that video is what she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's Salma Abdelaziz has more now on the growing desperation inside Gaza, and a warning some images in her report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This is what life looks like in places Israel told families to flee towards for their safety, where constant bombardment has reduced homes to rubble and wiped out entire families, this survivors say. I lost all my relatives. 15 people, this man says. We were not on the front line or anything. We were just sitting at home. What have we done wrong? The U.N. warns there are no safe places. About half a million people fled here to southern Gaza after an evacuation order by the Israeli military. But families desperate for refuge are still trapped in the war zone. The dead and injured flooding a healthcare system on the brink, civilians are caught in the crossfire with the death toll mounting just over a quarter of those killed or children, according to Palestinian officials. And a week-long siege is strangling the Enclave. The U.N. says amid fears food, fuel, water and medical supplies be soon run out. Some two million people are crammed into this 140 square mile territory. Now many of them pushed into an even smaller corner of the Enclave. About half the population are children. There are not enough shelters to house the sheer number of civilians, and even those who do find spaces in overwhelmed schools turned refugee centers. It is little comfort to the youngest victims. There is no one to protect us, this little girl says. There's no one to come save us. How are we supposed to live? How? Answer me. Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas after a terror attack by the group left 1,400 killed in Israel.

The head of U.S. Central Command has arrived in Tel Aviv to meet with the Israeli military's Chief of Staff and a U.S. Marine rapid response force has also been deployed to the region, but of a show of force intended to bolster U.S. presence in Middle East. CNN's Oren Liebermann reports now from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): A Marine rapid response force is headed towards the waters off the coast of Israel. According to a U.S. defense official familiar with the plans as the U.S. commits a growing number of military assets to the region that are converging near Israel, even as the Biden administration is trying to avoid becoming directly involved militarily in a very hot conflict. The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently on the USS Baton, an amphibious assault ship in the Gulf of Oman, according to Navy officials, but according to that U.S. defense official, it's moving towards Israel. It's unclear if it'll join other Navy assets in the Eastern Med or if it'll remain in the Red Sea, off the coast of southern Israel. But again, there are a growing number of military assets there. USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group is already in the Eastern Med. And the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group will arrive in that same area within just a couple of weeks here, it's already moving that way. According to CNN reporting from over the weekend. The key here is that as the U.S. is trying to show support for Israel, and offer a strong message of the terms for Iran and Iranian proxies in the region, in particular, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the U.S. is still trying not to become directly involved in this conflict trying to walk a very fine line there. At the same time on Sunday night, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued orders for a group of about 2,000 troops to prepare for the possibility of deployment directly to Israel, offering another option for President Joe Biden as he considers how much support how to offer that support, and whether the U.S. should become directly more involved. Now, it's crucial to note here that those 2,000 troops that might be preparing for the possibility of deployment, Israel would not be combat troops. Instead, they'd be support. So logistics, planning as well as perhaps medical assistance. We're looking for more details from the Pentagon here in the coming days there. But all of this as the U.S. becomes more and more involved here in a conflict as Israel promises a prolonged perhaps difficult campaign and the next stage of Israel's operations expected here with a growing force on the border of Gaza.

So there's a balance here between achieving a military objective and minimizing civilian damage.And in this case, which is very evident, and you cannot argue with it, we have chosen to, you know, that the sanctity of life and helping Palestinian civilians to go south and not be stuck in an area that there will be significant combat activities, there is a risk. And we will have to mitigate this risk with the tactics, the weapons and the time that we use when and if will operate.

What's your response to that? CONRICUSAnd if they decide so then maybe they would want to throw more of their proxies towards Israel. That would be unwise, and definitely not something that would serve the interests of the people of the region. Maybe it would serve Iranian interests, but definitely not the people of the region.
