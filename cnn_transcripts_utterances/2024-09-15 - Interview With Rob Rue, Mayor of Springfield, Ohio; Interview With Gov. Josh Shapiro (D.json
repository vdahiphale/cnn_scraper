We are 51 days from the election, and together with their runningmates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing on the states that will decide the next president, with the race apparently deadlocked after what could be the only Harris/Trump debate. But Donald Trump is also doubling down on a baseless claim that he made at the debate, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people's pets. Local officials and the state's Republican governor say there is absolutely no evidence of that claim, and they are warning it is actually hurting their city. Springfield, Ohio, is facing a fourth day of threats over the claims that have forced a college, hospitals, and schools to lock down. Meanwhile, Springfield police say they received two calls about Proud Boys marching through the city. Here's how Donald Trump responded to the controversy over Haitians who, I want to note, are in the U.S. legally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They only identified two instances of people alleging Haitians were taking geese out of parks. They found zero evidence to substantiate those claims. Also, other evidence that you have talked about, even you have retweeted, alleged evidence, are unsourced social media videos from a different city, apparently no connection to Haitians. And this is from a conservative activist who offered a $5,000 reward for such things. And then going just back to the schools and the hospitals and so forth being overwhelmed, nobody is disputing that the town of Springfield, Ohio, needs help. But you're not just a bystander. You're the senator from Ohio. So instead of saying things that are wrong and actually causing the hospitals, the schools, the government buildings to be evacuated because of bomb threats because of the cats and dogs thing, why not actually be constructive and helping to better integrate them into the community? Because there are a lot of employers there who say that the Haitian workers are helping fill jobs that they need desperately filled. VANCE:  Dana, first of all, let me just respond to a couple of things that you said. But I want to start with something you said, which I think is, frankly, disgusting and is more appropriate for a Democratic propagandist than it is for an American journalist. There is nothing that I have said that has led to threats against these hospitals. These hospitals, the bomb threats and so forth, it's disgusting. The violence is disgusting. We condemn it.

They're talking about 12 Proud Boys marching in Springfield, Ohio. They're talking about the, frankly, fake debunkings of a lot of these stories that are out there.

The hospitals are overwhelmed, Dana. The schools are overwhelmed. The local services are completely overwhelmed. You have people who can't afford housing. Homelessness has gone up. Murders are up by 81 percent because of what Kamala Harris has allowed to happen to this small community. I'm going to keep on talking about that. Now, of course, we can criticize violence.

It's, by the way, Dana, one of the reasons why we have cut taxes four times in Pennsylvania for seniors, for families who are trying to afford childcare, for small businesses. We understand the importance of cutting costs and putting money back in Pennsylvanians' pockets. And I think if you listen to what the vice president laid out in her debate and in her commentary since and prior to that, she's got an economic plan to put money back in people's pockets as well. She's talking about cutting the costs of childcare. She's talking about cutting taxes for small businesses. She's talking about opening up the doors of opportunity to more Pennsylvanians, more Americans by eliminating the college degree requirement that opens up the doors for more jobs to more people. By the way, Dana, that was the first executive order I signed as governor here in Pennsylvania. And it's worked. It's created more opportunities for Pennsylvanians. So, I think the vice president clearly understands the need to put money back in people's pockets, the need to cut costs, the economic anxieties people are facing. And she's put forth plans to do that. Donald Trump has put forth no plans to actually do that, except cutting taxes for people who are at the very top of our income brackets and actually increasing the burden through his tariff policies on the middle class.

And while here in Pennsylvania, I'm continuing to defend that right and protect women across the commonwealth, we are seeing right here in Pennsylvania the effect of Trump's abortion bans.

Just a couple of days ago, she was in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and then in Wilkes-Barre a few hours later. These are communities that oftentimes feel ignored by national Democrats. She's showing up and, by the way, getting great crowds. And I'm feeling real enthusiasm. There's something to be said for the person who not only votes for the vice president, but is willing to put that sign on their lawn, willing to wear that T-shirt or maybe even that Taylor Swift friendship bracelet. It sends a message to their friends and neighbors that they're for Kamala Harris. They like her positions. They think she's the right person to lead us forward. And so I think what I'm seeing more and more of is not just the folks who are lining up to vote for her, but those who are enthusiastic about her candidacy in communities that oftentimes are not enthusiastic about Democratic candidates and encouraging their neighbors to be for them as well.
