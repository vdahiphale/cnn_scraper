But when I talk to people close to the Florida governor -- people involved in the campaign, people close to the super PAC, there's this overwhelming sense of resignation and sort of well, we're going to just go down with the ship mentality.And I think that's a really bad sign for people close to you. When donors are saying that when some of your most ardent supporters are sort of privately saying that, that's a warning sign when we haven't even reached the state where you're supposed to do your best in. And as The New York Times reported, it is not just one or two issues that Ron DeSantis has struggled with. It's a multitude of things from when he launched his campaign, he launched a very online campaign and he tried to bypass much of the media. That ended up being a mistake. He launched his presidential campaign by hiring 100-plus staffers. That ended up being a mistake. He spent a lot of money on private jets and now he's relying on his super PAC. So it's all of these different things. And if you talk to one person they'll blame the super PAC. If you talk to another person they'll blame the presidential campaign. It's a multitude of issues combined with the fact that he's also running against Donald Trump.",

When he was really ahead in the polls it was when he was focused on being Florida's governor, and he was focused on freedom. He was focused on creating opportunities for people in the state. He stayed open, getting government out of us -- you know out of decision-making. And then when he ran for president he decided to focus on woke wars. The war on Disney and Mickey Mouse and then putting a six-week abortion ban. And a lot of people say that's antithetical to who he was and what made him so popular. What made him so popular was that he was all about freedom. Getting government out of our decision-making, keeping businesses open, creating a thriving economy. And yet, he focused on something totally different as soon as he ran. And I think it was a little bit of hubris. Maybe it was arrogance. And maybe it was just a lack of understanding was what really drove the American people. He promised to be Trump without the chaos and I think it was absolutely the opposite. I think he created a whole lot of chaos with some of the positions that he made. And I think it made Republicans ultimately less popular.

Sometimes you can change the packaging but the dogs just don't like the food. And it appears -- and it appears that -- it appears that Ron DeSantis, as a candidate, just isn't working for people. And I think about what he did -- what he's done as a candidate. Donald Trump's PAC spent $15 million defining Ron DeSantis in the very beginning and DeSantis didn't respond to it. And basically, everything that we think about him as being uncharismatic. We kind of know from that $15 million that was spent. Number two, why was he debating Gov. Newsom on Fox News? Like, what's that about? It's like I want to be a heavyweight champ. I'm not going to fight Ali, I'm going to fight Bundini Brown. Like, no. Ron DeSantis -- I mean, Newsom is not running for president. Why are you going after him? And now we hear he's attacking staff. And I've got to tell you.

And so, no matter what it is -- that you might say I'm tired of hearing all of this, it's -- he's got something very emotional, very visceral that no one else has. There's no one else tapping into the sort of cord that is getting so many people rallied. And Nikki Haley's running a really great campaign right now. She's got the momentum.
