But while in Glendale, Arizona, Harris reiterated her plan to sign the bipartisan border security bill that failed to pass Congress earlier this year, accusing her Republican rival, Donald Trump of torpedoing the bill for personal gain. Trump is expected to attend fundraisers in Wyoming and Colorado in the hours ahead. He made his first campaign stop since the Democratic ticket became official in Bozeman, Montana. Now none of these Western states are considered battlegrounds, raising questions about his campaign strategy. So we will have more on Trump's Montana rally. But first let's go to Eva McKend in Glendale, Arizona, with the latest on Harris' campaign stop. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  The Harris campaign continuing to enjoy a surge of momentum, this arena packed to the rafters. The vice president addressing ceasefire protesters directly, saying that she, too, wants a ceasefire and the hostages to be returned home and that she's working in concert with President Biden toward that effort.

And one thing I can tell you, at least for Donald Trump's part on this, when I talked to his team, is that he has been increasingly frustrated with the Democratic enthusiasm surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris. You know, she's sustained this enthusiasm for several weeks now. And you've heard him attack her, crowd size attack her for having celebrity performers.

This election is about two belts, the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt. And Kamala Harris' selection as the nominee has put both in play for the Democrats in a serious way.Harris, I think, puts the Sun Belt -- key Sun Belt states of Georgia, Arizona and Nevada back in play for the Democrats. Because she can appeal to core constituencies that help put those states in a Democratic column, particularly turning out both African Americans but also suburban voters, who are becoming increasingly important in states like Arizona and in Georgia. And then Tim Walz has been chosen to help strengthen that appeal in the Rust Belt states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and also, I'd say, Kamala Harris has an important appeal there. African American voters are important in those states as well. And suburban voters are also important there. So I think this is quite a strong ticket. And one of the reasons why the Trump campaign I think is foundering at the moment is they weren't anticipating confronting a ticket like this and they're having to recalibrate. And their machine is not clicking into gear quite as quickly as it needs to. Now the Democrats shouldn't be complacent about this and a lot can go wrong, a lot a lot of surprises can happen. But at the moment, they're in, they're in a good position and they should try and maintain this momentum going into the convention.

One gold medal winner from Friday's action is proving the best revenge is success. Algerian boxer, Imane Khelif, who overcame a torrent of online abuse regarding her gender throughout the games, won gold in the women's 66 kilogram final, becoming the first woman in her country to win any medal in this event. Here's what she told those bullies after winning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IMANE KHELIF, ALGERIAN BOXER (through translator):  I am a woman like any other woman. I was born a woman. I lived a woman and I competed as a woman. There's no doubt about that. They hate me and I don't know why. I really don't know why. I sent them a single message with this gold medal and I saved my dignity. My honor is above everything else. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
