Our purpose in coming to the D-Day observance as we have done for a number of years is to thank our men, women and our veterans, and each year the number is smaller. The age is older. The enthusiasm is evermore increased to see them to hear about their -- they don't talk about their bravery. They just said we we did our job. We did our job. So let me just say the purpose of coming, of course, is to observe, but to thank first and foremost, it is the most exhilarating experience to hear from these veterans what it was like for them when they were practically teenagers, some of them. Now, maybe 100 years old, some of them, and -- or more, one from Baltimore, 104 years old, Mr. Melnikoff, he's from Baltimore, Maryland. Anyway, I've seen him along the way.In any case, in that atmosphere, the president's speech was almost prayerful. It was so beautiful in terms of the sacrifice that they made at the time, the purpose of it all for democracy and freedom, and the inspiration they are to us to protect it as we go forward. He referenced the speech today, referenced, of course, the Reagan speech, which is exactly halfway, you know, it's the 80th anniversary. That was the 40th anniversary, and it was a speech against isolationism for our country. It was a brilliant speech, and the president referenced that with our own call for understanding our role in the world. And as President Reagan said at the time, it's better to prevent war than to have to deal with the consequences of it afterward, or words to that effect. So we're very proud of the President's speech both days -- speeches both days. Yesterday, at the ceremony, then in the evening at the international ceremony when he was magnificently received being brought in by President Macron and then the speech the speech today. It was about values, about patriotism, about what America is all about and has been about, but it's mostly about the veterans and the sacrifice they made for love of country. It wasn't even any question. I took pride in telling them in 1970, when I led a dedication there in 19 -- I mean, excuse me, not 1970, the 70th anniversary, the 75th anniversary --",

Everything I read is that they're unhappy about this, they're unhappy about that. Not just Benny, but other members of his cabinet. I wish that he would be a statesman and do what is right for Israel. We all love Israel. We fought for Israel. October 7th was terrible. Hamas is a terrorist organization.

The Israeli government believes 120 are still being held captive in Gaza. And today, the U.S., Israel, Egypt and Qatar are waiting for Hamas to respond to the latest ceasefire proposal to pause the war in Gaza and bring hostages home.One of the hostages is Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old American- Israeli citizen who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. In late April, Hamas released a proof of life video of Hersh. Now CNN will only show an image of that Hamas video, but as you can see, Hersh, he has a mutilated arm. His parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin joined me now live from Israel. Thank you so much for being here. We all see the number on your your shirts you wear every day, the number of days that your son has been held captive. Today is 245, which is really remarkable. And it's impossible for anyone who's a parent or anyone who, you know, just has a sense of right and wrong to imagine what you're going through. You have been dealing with that, but you've also been dealing with the ups and downs of the negotiations. I want to start there. Egypt does say that they're receiving encouraging signs from Hamas. Are you hopeful? RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, SON HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN IS MISSING IN GAZA: We are always hopeful. We - every morning, say to each other, hope is mandatory. It's not an option. It's not a suggestion. It's not advice. It's absolutely mandatory. And yet we have been on this ride before with all of the hostage families. So we are optimistic and praying, but we also know that this is a very complicated, complex, tangled situation. And, you know, we're frightened.

What is your message to Netanyahu right now?JON POLIN, SON HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN IS MISSING IN GAZA: Our message to Prime Minister Netanyahu is, the hostages must come home, that should have happened 245 days ago. It's got to happen today. There can be no politics, not domestically, not internationally across any of the mediators. This is a human issue. People are suffering, the hostages, the hostage families, Israelis, innocents in Gaza and it's time to end the suffering and push politics aside. Get a deal done. There's something close.
