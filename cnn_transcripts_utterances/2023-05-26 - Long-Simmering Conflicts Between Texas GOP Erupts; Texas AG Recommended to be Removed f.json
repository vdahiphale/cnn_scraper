I actually as a council member a few years ago, almost 10 years ago, rewrote that curfew law. And this is about now -- how we're changing that approach. We know that unnecessary engagement of law enforcement has been something that is happening and we don't need that for our young people. And we've had some success here with our (INAUDIBLE) collaborative and other ways to deal with our young people to show how that can happen.So now, we are calling in social workers. We are calling in our community partners. Our rec and parks, our school employees, and also peers. Young people who are above the age of curfew that will be working with to make sure that we are having the approach to get our young people into our youth connections in which our at two of our recreation centers there. We're going to be providing the supports for them and their families. Law enforcement is not going to be leading on this because quite frankly they don't have to. And even though our city has seen a 14 percent reduction in homicides this year and 10 in nonfatal shootings, we are seeing far too many people and most importantly a spike in our young people. And we're going to do everything to save our young people, including enforcing curfew. And that also goes on our summer program that we're going to have. Midnight basketball, pool parties, cookouts, any and everything that we can do. 7,000 young people will be employed by the City of Baltimore through our youth reach program.",

When they get to our rec centers, however the two centers, that will be manned by folks from my office and other city agencies.But we will have our Baltimore City school police on site to help with security, but also to make sure that we're able to access where these young people, their emergency contacts, and their folks that we need to have them picked up. But law enforcement will not be going out and pulling and pushing young people into the vans. So, all of these things that folks think, we've never done that in Baltimore, even when BPD was enforcing it. They never chased young people for curfew or anything like that. This is something that Baltimore City has gotten right over the time. And now, we're starting to evolve --",

The documents detail a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II back in 1983 ahead of a trip to the United States. More than a hundred pages were posted on the agency's online record site called \"The Vault\". And it included a tip about a man who wanted to harm the queen after he claimed that his daughter had been killed in Northern Ireland. Now, the queen's trip happened amid the trouble. The violent period that divided Northern Ireland in part over allegiance to the United Kingdom. CNN's Scott McLean has more on this. He's joining us now. Scott, what do these files reveal about this plot to kill the queen?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kate. Well, first off, these papers were put out there in the public domain, some 40 years later as part of the FBI's library of documents that were put out to the public through freedom of information request. So, we have more than a hundred pages here to go through and all of the files seemed to be different.But they really illustrate the vigilance of the FBI at this time in the '70s and '80s and '90s in responding to any potential threats no matter how potential the benign they were when it comes to people associated or sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army. Which at that time, in 1983, was in the midst of a three decade-long campaign to sniper attacks, of bombings, and other terror attacks all in an effort to try to get Northern Ireland reunited with the Republic of Ireland. And so, one document, in particular, which seems to be addressed to the director of the FBI at the time, outlines this plot to kill Queen Elizabeth in 1993 when she visited San Francisco as part of a multi- city tour of the west coast of the United States. And the names are redacted so it's a little bit difficult to follow. But essentially, it says that an officer had gotten a tip from someone who spoke to someone else who was a patron at a well-known Republican bar and was sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army. The tip alleged that this man had a daughter who was killed in Northern Ireland by a rubber bullet, and that he planned to, during the queen's trip to San Francisco, try to kill her by dropping some item, it doesn't say what, off of the Golden Gate Bridge when her yacht passed underneath. It also outlines potential threats during a trip to Yosemite National Park, though it doesn't give any more detail. Now, the document also outlines that at the time the sidewalks of the bridge were closed off to the public, or at least had been planned to be closed off to the public as a result. And these fears that the FBI had about threats to the royal family potentially are not all that unfounded considering that in 1979, the queen's cousin, Louis Mountbatten, was actually assassinated by a bomb planted in his fishing boat. And as we know, the IRA frequently targeted sites associated with the British Day. Kate.",

He had eight different meetings, plus a big youth rally in the afternoon that went on a long time. He was just wiped out.The Vatican also emphasizes the pope's upcoming public appointments in his -- already on his schedule, a mass on Sunday for the Catholic Feast of Pentecost, a meeting on Monday with the president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, both are still confirmed.
