It took them a long time to get them to where they are now.But look, everyone is just ready to go back to work. Everyone I talked to has told me that they're looking forward to going back to telling stories. It's going to take some time. A lot of people in the industry seem to think that things won't really go back to normal until January. But nonetheless, everybody just looking forward to those productions starting up again. There's optimism about summer movies and what's coming up next year for shows and streaming. And so this is sort of the beginning of that work restarting after so many months of everything being shut down. We're talking billions of dollars in losses here. But again, the members that I talked to have told me it's worth it if we are going to get what we need. So after very difficult months this is sort of the light at the end of the tunnel -- Brianna?",

We likely will see it happen soon.But after that, it's really when you're going to see timelines for a lot of the shows and a lot of the movies. But as I mentioned there's optimism about summer movies. You know, just a couple of weeks ago a lot of people were saying, if this deal doesn't come through, you're not going to have summer movies, you're not going to have tv shows next year. So now finally people are like well, you know what? Maybe we will have those summer movies and we will have new shows starting in January or the beginning of the year. A lot of them were in preproduction or prepping before the strike. So hopefully, those shows will get started a lot sooner. But it will take some time before we see everything go back to fully being normal here in Hollywood.",

And keep in mind, the drug is in the same class as other weight lossdrugs we've heard about like Wegovy and Ozempic. It's the same formulation, as you mentioned, as Mounjaro. The only difference is who the drug is indicated for. Mounjaro is a diabetes drug, whereas under this new name of Zepbound, it's approved for people with obesity or who are overweight, who have weight-related conditions. Now, what we know about Zepbound, it is administered as an injection, given once weekly. Side effects are similar to what we see with other weight loss drugs, that nausea or vomiting or stomach pain. And the price tag, it costs about $1,000 per month before insurance. So the idea here, Boris, is that this is another option out there for people who are looking for help with chronic weight management. The only hurdles would be if they're able to access it and, again, that cost before insurance -- Boris?",
