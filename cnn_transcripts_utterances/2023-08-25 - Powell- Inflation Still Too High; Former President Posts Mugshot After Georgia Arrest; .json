The summer is coming to an end and as you can see -- but we're not getting up just yet. The markets and how they're trading on this last one. It is -- they are actually higher. We're up more than 300 points that's on -- And you can see the way the day has gone compared to what Jerome Powell was talking about. Now, the markets like what they're seeing. It is a question for Matt Egan in just a moment. The events of the day: Jerome Powell has told Jackson Hole, he's firmly committed to hitting a two percent inflation target. Never surrender: Donald Trump posts the historic mugshot on Twitter. His newest post in two years. And views like this do not come cheap. I am going to talk to the Million Dollar Listings' guy, Ryan Serhant about the pricey real estate and who is buying what and why. We are live in New York, as you can tell. It is August, it is the 25th of August. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, on top of the world, I mean business. And a very good afternoon to you, good evening where you might be. For the last in the dog days of summer, and we are at The Edge at Hudson Yards, which is of course the building where our studios normally are, but we've come to the roof and that is of course The Edge, which is such a popular attraction. We started here, we'll finish here, as always. This is the highest viewing platform in the Western world. We knew there was a statistic that's somewhere. I am 1,100 feet above the streets. It's the perfect place to see out the summer. And by the way, of course, there is always the problem of rain, so just to be clear, we are ready just in case. If we have to use the umbrellas, we will. We hope we won't, but it is a summer Friday, so who knows what will be happening. Let's talk about the markets and what's been going on. The central bankers were in Wyoming at Jackson Hole for the Annual Federal Reserve Symposium. Jerome Powell spoke earlier in the day. Last year, he warned of some pain, and on the day he spoke, the Dow sank 1,100 points. This year, far karma. Powell is still resolute. But look, you see the red, that's roughly -- that's just before -- that's roughly when Powell was speaking, and then it goes down because -- but mature thoughts later, and it's back up again. So inflation is falling, but the Fed is not satisfied. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Paul Krugman argues it was likely -- it is going to be three or four percent. The Nobel Prize winning economist and \"The New York Times\" columnist is with me. And now Paul, I've got rain here. Rain all over me, but I'm just wondering when you look at what Powell says, Do you think he has one or two more rate hikes in him? PAUL KRUGMAN, ECONOMIST AND COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Oh, I think he probably will do another rate hike, I mean, I'm not a terminology Fed expert here, but it sounds to me like Powell is basically trying to not make news. Not to say anything that will startle people, not doing one more rate hike would actually be a big upside shock for people and he is afraid of that, announcing today that anything less than staunch support for two percent target would have made big news, but doesn't necessarily mean that it really means that.

Everyone should understand the dynamic here. The indictments don't make Donald Trump more likeable or likely to be elected in the general election. The problem is because our politics have been forced to the extremes, playing to the base works, except when it comes to actually winning elections because you need to win swing voters in swing states and Independent voters.
