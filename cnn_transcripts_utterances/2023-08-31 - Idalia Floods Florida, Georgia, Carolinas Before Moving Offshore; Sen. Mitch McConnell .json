I should also point out on the video what is not being shown very often is the fact that 30 seconds later, he came back and he answered several more questions from reporters, and then he took off.And as you pointed out, he came back home to Louisville. I was with him with Jim Banks, who's running for Senate in Indiana. He met with a group, answered questions, worked the crowd, and was on top of it, sharp and fully in command of all the politics and issues of the day. And I should also tell you I was with him two days ago and watched him give a long speech to a lunch crowd and then answer several questions from that crowd in the midst of another long day. So, throughout the month of August, he has kept up a pretty robust schedule. He was down at the Fancy Farm political picnic, which is a huge, thousands of person thing. You probably saw a video on that. So, it's really kind of in business as usual for McConnell. Other than this incident that happened that you showed the video of, it's been a normal, robust schedule for him, from my perspective and my up close observations throughout this month. SIDNER:  I'm no doctor, but to hear that he has still a robust schedule, that he went to a fundraiser afterwards, I don't know. It just seems like he's pushing himself in a way that might be problematic. I want to get to Sanjay Gupta, our resident doctor here. As a neurosurgeon, what did you see? What did you make of what happened?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, let me just say that what Scott is describing is really important to know because whatever this is, it comes and goes, and it seems to come and go quickly. And in the world of when you're looking at the brain, that's an important sort of clue.What I saw, and this is, I think, an appropriate term here is the term freezing. That does sort of describe this freezing of his body, freezing of his speech, freezing of his face. His hands were very clenched to the side of the lectern. One of his aides came over and was trying to, I think, just raise his arm, and he was pretty locked in there for about 30 seconds. But then, as Scott mentions, a short time later, he seems to be more lucid again and seems to improve. And when he walks out of the room, he's walking out moving his arms and his legs, which is important because people think, is there some sort of stroke or precursor to stroke, such as TIA, less likely, given how quickly the recovery happens. You do think of things like a seizure, for example, a sort of mini seizure that can cause these sorts of cessations or coming off medications. People who have Parkinson's, for example, when their medications start to wane off, they may have freezing episodes. But, again, it comes and goes. And I think what is curious is we've seen it twice, the aides that rush to his side, they didn't seem so sort of affected by it, almost to the point where you wonder, is this something they're more used to. If this were the first time it happened, I would say, look, you got to get to the doctor, figure out is something going on here with the blood flow to your brain or something. They didn't seem to react that way, which I thought was another important clue.",

He's had these episodes where he's had trouble hearing reporters. It's (INAUDIBLE) a thought or that's actual hearing loss. Hearing loss is not uncommon, another fall in the in the middle of July. And then these two episodes now about a month apart, where, again, freezing is the right term in terms of what happened, lasting about 30 seconds. And, again, as Scott pointed out, last time and this time as well, he does seem to recover quickly from whatever this is.

It's a different job than U.S. Senator. And I should note McConnell's actually not up for re-election until 2026.But one of Joe Biden's biggest problems is a persistent belief that he should have not run again over his age. And that is, as you pointed out, a belief that's held by a lot of Democrats. Now, I do think a lot of those people will ultimately vote for him because they don't -- Donald Trump or some other Republican. But, yes, it's going to be a big issue. And it's also probably going to honestly highlight the role of the vice president in this next election. And that will be true for both parties, if the Republicans nominate Donald Trump, although he's been, you know, quite vigorous, you know, he's no spring chicken either.
