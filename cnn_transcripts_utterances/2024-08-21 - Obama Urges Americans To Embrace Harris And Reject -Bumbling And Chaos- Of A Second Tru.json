OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND DIASPORIA STUDIES, VANDERBILT: Yes, she had more shade than your night curtain. When I look at the Obamas, a kind of double headed fountain of black oratorical genius, each in their own way, pace and cadence. Michelle Obama was James Baldwin indicting the system with searing poetry. I think Keffer Burns (ph) texted me and said, the great poet that she gave it wasn't a speech, it was an epic poem, that she laid out and she did. But if she was James Baldwin, then her husband was Thurgood Marshall, he's got to prosecute the case. He's got to lay it out. That's not as exciting as what she did, but you got to carefully deconstruct what happened. Or, if we change musical terms, she was, you know, Louis Armstrong, a blistering, brilliant solo, and he was Duke Ellington trying to bring together the various parts of the symphony in order to represent a whole. But at the end of the day, they just cold blooded with their black, oratorical genius, and to see that on display for the nation and to be free of the encumbrance of office. There was something free about them, not having the obligation to toe the line to when they go low, we go high. She just said, I'm going to do what I got to do.

MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN DIASPORA STUDIES, VANDERBILT: Yes, I think so. Look, I mean, it is the house that Obama built, but a hell of an addition added by Kamala Harris is pretty remarkable now. She's expanding the party in interesting ways. She's more forthright on issues. Look, Obama is Jackie Robinson. His greatest strength was his ability to keep quiet in the face of white hostility, so that he wouldn't undermine the policy in civic piety (ph). That's a genius in its own right.
