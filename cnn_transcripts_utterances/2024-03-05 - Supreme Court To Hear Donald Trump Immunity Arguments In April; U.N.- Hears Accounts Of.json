And that list includes Colorado, where Trump's name will indeed appear on the ballot after the Supreme Court ended months of debate on Monday and unanimously ruled the state could not unilaterally exclude him for allegedly violating the insurrectionist clause of the U.S. Constitution. While that ruling has no impact on the four criminal cases Trump is facing, it carries nationwide implications for other states considering similar efforts to keep Trump off the ballot, states such as Maine which quickly restored Trump's eligibility after the Supreme Court's decision was announced.

And Srettha added this, \"If I had known this, I would have brought the shows to Thailand.\" And on Monday, its Culture Minister Edwin Tong, made new comments about the grant. Speaking to parliament, he said this, \"There has been some online speculation as to the size of the grant. I can say that it is not accurate and not anywhere as high as speculated.\" Citing confidentiality reasons, he did not reveal the size or the conditions of the grant. This week, Swift is playing six sold-out nights to 300,000 fans in Singapore, her only stop in Southeast Asia.
