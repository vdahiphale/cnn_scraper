Desperation is growing, though, as rescuers are trying to work to find more survivors. They are still finding some of them, like this 77-year-old woman there. You can see her there under rubble, 212 hours. The Turkish media just reported a short time ago that a woman and two children have also just been rescued after 228 hours in rubble after the quake hit.CNN's Sara Sidner is on the ground for us in southeastern Turkey. Sara, you've been doing incredible reporting on this. And in these stories that, you know, amid the devastation, with the death toll, it's remarkable to hear that people are still being found somehow.",

We look at these polls where people say they're worried about a recession, they're worried about their financial future, but they continue to spend. Also very big post-holiday discounts. It looks like those discounts were enough to get people out there and spending. Auto sales a big part of this, too. Remember after a chill in the auto market because of really high prices over the past year or so, you've got people out there buying cars again. So, when you look across the board here, I see a consumer that is incredibly resilient. So, you see on the far right of your screen there, that 3 percent surge? That is the most since March 2021.",

KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN, O'LEARY VENTURES: Year over year over 6 percent. That is absolutely stunning. That is -- you know, to be talking about a recession and have a print over 6 percent is almost unprecedented. And so something is really interesting here. We have full employment, decade -- it's been decades to have unemployment this low. Remarkable. We're raising rates on the consumer. Core inflation and food is really high and yet somehow, because everybody's got a job, you get a print like that. This is a rip-roaring economy.
