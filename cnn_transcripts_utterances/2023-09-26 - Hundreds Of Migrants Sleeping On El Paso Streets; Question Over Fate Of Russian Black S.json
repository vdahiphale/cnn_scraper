The court on a five to four vote said no, you've got to go back, draw another map, either another black majority district or something like it.Alabama goes back to the drawing board, comes up in July with another map with only one district. The lower court was furious here, said look, you're in defiance of the Supreme Court. Alabama said, I don't care, we're going to go to the Supreme Court anyway, just ask. We're going to say that we can distinguish the maps this time around. The Supreme Court said no, dice today in an order with no dissents. Here's the important takeaway. This is a big important case because it's going to likely give another seat to Democrats there, but more than anything, it's going to send a resounding message to other states involved in similar disputes. The Supreme Court was really definitive today. Nobody noted any kind of dissent on this order.",

A source tells CNN that crossings into the El Paso area have been dropping since Mexico pledged to deport migrants from its own northern border cities.On Monday, encounters dropped by about 30% to fewer than 1400. That number though is still higher than September's daily average of about 1200 a day. To cope with that influx, El Paso is turning an old middle school into a migrant shelter. In the last 10 days, the city has helped more than 7,000 migrants with housing, but hundreds more are now unhoused, sleeping on the city streets and its parks. We're joined now by John Martin. He's the Deputy Director of Opportunity for the Homeless in El Paso. John, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. The mayor of El Paso says the city is at a breaking point.

It's my understanding that we've had others since then, none on Sunday. And so that does help to decompress, but we still focus in working with the migrant and their destination of choice. So we take advantage of those buses if by chance their destination matches up with the location that the buses are going to. And so I think the efforts are well at this point. It may be a bit premature to say, has it been successful? Are we going to see less people overall? But I do believe that we're heading in the right direction as a community.",

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, and I'll preface by saying I'm a father of three teenage girls. Boris, I pay really close attention to this. It's interesting when you look at the findings, people have a lot of speculation how much usage of these devices is going on. What they found was that for 11- to 17-year-olds, on average, it's about four and a half hours a day of usage. 16% used it for two hours or less a day. 13% used it for nine hours or more. So a fair amount. But to your point about the notifications, I think this was interesting to a lot of people. On average, people got about 237 notifications a day. To which they responded to nearly a quarter of them, about 46 notifications. Which means that, you know, four times an hour for 12 hours, Boris, they are being diverted. Their attention is being diverted away from whatever they're doing. If you're working on your device and it's all, you're controlling that, that's one thing.

And I think this is relevant. We point a lot to adolescents, but if you look at adults, they are -- they are on average using the phone a similar amount of time. They pick up their phone 100 to 300 times a day on average 97% of them own a phone. But here's the thing also, 87% are interacting with their phones at a time when they should be asleep for sure between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m. So I think there's a lot of modeling of this sort of behavior that's going on from young people watching what is happening to older people.

But I think practical things like really programming do not disturb time, so people really don't interact with their phone at that time. We set limits on social media use for our girls, for teenage girls. There's things like that. I think there's two things that really struck me when we're reporting on this. One is to change the way you think about a phone. Instead of a toy, think of it like a high-powered tool, like a car. We let our kids drive, but it comes with lots of training, lots of responsibility, and sort of a gravity of the use and the appreciation of it. And also something that Catherine Price says, Boris, maybe you'll appreciate this specifically. Every time you're about to pick up your phone, ask yourself three questions. What for? Why now? And what else? What else could I be doing? Breaking the habits, breaking the cycles can make a big difference in terms of developing that healthy relationship.",
