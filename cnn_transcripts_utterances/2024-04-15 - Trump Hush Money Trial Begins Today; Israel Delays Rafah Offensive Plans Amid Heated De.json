Donald Trump abounds, become the first former President to stand trial on criminal charges, the U.S. and the world react as Israel plots its next move after an attack by Iran.And congressional leaders still unable to come together on aid for Israel or Ukraine. It's 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, here's a live look at New York City, good morning, everyone, I'm Jim Acosta in for Kasie Hunt, it's great to be with you. This has never happened before, just a few hours, Donald Trump will become the first former U.S. President to face a criminal trial. Jury selection begins this morning in the hush money case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The historic trial centers on a potential sex scandal cover-up that took place just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors alleged Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels in an attempt to influence the vote. Last night, Trump went to his social media site to sound off, calling Bragg a corrupt prosecutor, and the judge in the case totally conflicted. He also mentioned the case during a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, good morning to you, a very big deal, a very historic occasion, and initially what I'll be watching for is the ability for a trial jury to be selected. That's fair and impartial. You know, Jim, that the Trump team has done a significant amount of polling already in their effort to get the case delayed.Polls indicating, of course, in Manhattan, according to their polling, voted overwhelmingly for Biden, which is in fact, a fact in 2020 and Clinton in 2016. But using that to indicate that they could not select a fair jury as a result. Remember in doing that, it leaves out the whole notion that when you have voir deir or voir de-i-r, some call, that's the selection of a jury. You do have the ability really to select the fair jury based upon you being able to exclude jurors who just raised their hand and say, you know what? This case is not for me, I can't be fair. I can't be impartial. And then of course, you have a host of the challenges that you could make to jurors for cause if you feel and further questioning, they can't be impartial. And then you have another set of challenges, Jim, in which you can discretionarily remove them. So, it's all about the selection of a fair trial, that's what I'll be looking for and I'll also be looking for Trump's team if they can't to find the pool of jurors, not to be impartial, to be making further motions to delay or perhaps change the venue. That's what it's going to be all about, at least initially as the trial gets underway.",

There are about in large measure, these business crimes, financial crimes, and really election bill style as interference crimes.And so, what they will do is indicate that there were false invoices that were created in order to advance this scheme to hide from the public information that could have been damaging right to Trump to 2016, they'll talk about ledger entries that were false with respect to the Trump organization. They'll talk about these checks that we use for reimbursement. And a lot of people, Jim, look at this case is -- oh, Michael Cohen is a star witness. He's damaged good. It's really in large measure, not about him. People say, what do you mean it's not about him? Look, it's something called corroboration. You could be the most convicted felon and perjurer, but if this corroboration for what I say, because you do find these ledgers, you do find text messages, you do find e-mails, you do find communications that lead to the notion that this was occurring, guess what? What you're saying if it's largely corroborated, you become less significant and your word becomes less significant because the proof, the evidence, and the documentation is there, and that's what I'll be looking for during the trial, and I think that's what the jury needs to see in order to find Trump guilty. Everyone presumed innocent until they're found guilty. But that critical evidence will make all the difference.",

      "sentences": "Yes, good morning. You know, we are in the heart of the severe weather season, and today is no different. We're starting off the work-week with a bang. You could see severe weather chances today. I want to just highlight this across the east coast.This is near the coastal areas of Virginia. A -- just a marginal risk of studying across the Ohio River Valley. But this is the area we're going to pay close attention to. The central and northern plains, that shading of orange, that's an enhanced risk. Parts of Kansas and into South Dakota, very large hail, a few tornadoes and damaging winds. But I really believe that the hail threat is greatest here. You especially -- where you see that hatched locations overlaid on top of these colorings, that is where we're indicating the greatest chance of 2-inch-size hail or larger. So, the potential for baseball-size hail as it falls from the sky is a real possibility within those locations. Now, we have a 5 percent probability of tornadoes, so, the tornado threat is not as great as what we had anticipated late last week. That's the good news. Still, the severe weather threat, the strong gusty-winds as the system evolves over the next 48 hours. This is a multi-day system, so, we're going to focus our attention tomorrow across the state of Iowa and into parts of Missouri and Illinois, large hail tornado threat shifts a little further eastward. Here's our rainfall forecast total, could get a quick 1 to 3 inches of rain in some of those storms that move over the same locations, and then behind it, we've got a dry line and very gusty winds. So, what that's doing is it's taking advantage of the dry conditions on the ground, critical fire danger in place across the eastern plains. Look at this, you can see that extends into the Texas Panhandle as well as portions of New Mexico winds-gusting here, anywhere from 40 to 50 miles per hour. Not what we need to see, especially in this area of the country. Jim?",
