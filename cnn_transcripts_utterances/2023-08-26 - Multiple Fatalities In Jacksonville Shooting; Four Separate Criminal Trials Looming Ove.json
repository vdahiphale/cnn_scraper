We know that there is -- there is a white male that is barricaded inside the Dollar General from what we understand. And I suspect you know all of this already. But that is all I know at this point. I'm just out here really to make sure that the folks in the neighborhood know that we're here and that we're here to help and to answer any questions that they have when we can.

This is the grand park area just west of the downtown area. Now Deegan, Mayor Deegan told our affiliate WJXT that a shooter barricaded himself inside. It is not clear here if the victims, these multiple fatalities that they're speaking of, if they were taken down inside or outside of the store. We are told specifically at CNN that Jacksonville fire rescue, they are on, quote, \"standby, ready to treat any victims\". Now, I want you to listen to what Councilwoman Ju'coby Pittman had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JU'COBY PITTMAN, JACKSONVILLE COUNCILWOMAN: This is a tragic moment. My heart is heavy, and I'm just -- I'm just hurt (ph) seeing all the shootings. You know, we have four districts into one, and as a community the mayor and I was just together on this past Thursday. And we want a solution. Our sheriff is doing the best that he can. But as an alignment and resources to the community, we got to keep working together. This right here today was a tragedy. And I understand -- I think the young man who was doing the shooting, I think he has been killed. But the people in this community, they're hurting. And they have every right to. You know, this makes no sense. I am very, very angry right now. I'm emotional. You know, we got kids in this community seeing all of this. and this is unnecessary. You know, it's unjust that we can't -- we can't even walk on the sidewalks, we're not safe in any stores. And I'm looking for opportunities. This community needs to come together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also, I want to mention Edward Waters University. This is a historically black university less than a mile away on the same road, King's Road. It put out a campus safety alert saying that preliminary reports indicate no students, faculty, or staff members have been involved in this incident. [11:04:47] ROSALES: And the date here Jim, is also very important, August 26th. That is because five years ago in 2018 the city of Jacksonville had a mass shooting. This happened at Jacksonville Landing (ph), less than three miles away, at a video game tournament. Two people were killed, ten were injured.

If somebody's already been wounded or somebody is in danger there, certainly you cannot wait this person out because people will bleed out.So they have to enter quickly, and they have to do it probably through an alternate means because you'll probably have different cover. That is if he's alive. The thing that I heard in the statement from the police and fire is that they are standing by to get -- to treat victims. Well, if they're standing by to treat victims, it means that they don't have access to the scene yet. So they are either being held off by a barricaded suspect, or they don't know if he is in there alive and able to shoot when they come in.",

So I think right now there should be -- we had on SWAT, what's called an emergency team that goes in immediately in case you believe that there are victims or potential victims inside that are in imminent danger. So I think there needs to be an entry fairly quickly. And when you do these kind of entries, quick entries, you are trading a little bit of the officers' safety for the safety of the people inside.

But right now police are kind of handcuffed when it comes to proactively dealing with somebody who is potentially dangerous.

A judge presiding over the Georgia case approved that date for Kenneth Chesebro, an architect of the fake electors scheme, and now former Trump attorney Sidney Powell is also requesting a speedy trial.For the former president this could get messy very quickly. On top of the Georgia case, the federal election interference case could happen in January, 2024 followed by the hush money case in March and the Mar- a-Lago classified documents trial in May. All of this on top of a busy elections season. Already his campaign is selling merchandise featuring that historic mug shot. And joining me now to talk about this is Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressman, it's not shocking that Trump is fundraising off of his mug shot and his arrest. I suppose we all expected that to some extent. But how do you deal with this possibility that he's just going to make a spectacle of this from now until when all of these cases are resolved? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): Well, it will be a -- if he wants to make a show out of it, he probably will. It will be very interesting when that show takes him into the courtroom and he is sitting there with the jury off to his side. We expected this, those of us that have followed the January 6th hearings we've expected that Trump would be indicted in multiple ways. We also knew that this case in Georgia was likely to be a very strong case, had no idea it would involve so many people. But this is going to come to a head very, very quickly. Two of the defendants now want to have a trial within the next two months. And next week, actually I think it's Monday, we will have a situation in which meadows will be in court, and a lot of the information about what the prosecutors have available to them will become public at that time. So this is going to unfold very, very quickly. And yes, the mug shot is out there. I looked at it, I'm going, \"Oh, boy, I don't want to get near this guy. That's one mean-looking guy.\"",

We'll defend it in hearings if that's where Jordan wants to go, and we will defend it publicly as I am right now.

Of course the Kremlin is going to deny involvement. What a surprise. This plane didn't fall out of the sky by itself. It fell out of the sky because it was damaged in some way.

Look, it's no secret that they buy hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons every year. It's no secret that they stabilize the world oil markets. But at the end of the day, that should not be a reason or excuse to keep these documents classified. And the blame goes all around, right. It starts with President Bush, President Obama vetoed our law (INAUDIBLE) which he eventually overrode. President Trump invoked the state secrets principle and was playing golf with them on every other weekend with LIV Golf. President Biden, to his credit, was the only president that actually engaged with us and made an executive order to declassify these documents. But what we think is that these three-letter agencies are ignoring the will of that executive order. Our government does not want the truth to come out about what level the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia played because it's a very inconvenient truth.

It comes shortly after the soccer federation in Spain accused a star female player of lying about the controversial kiss from the federation president shortly after the Spanish women's team won the World Cup.CNN's Patrick Snell joins us now. What's the latest? There are so many twists and turns, and it doesn't get any better in all of this. PATRICK SNELL, CNN ANCHOR, \"WORLD SPORT\": No. Jim, you're absolutely right. This is a fast-evolving story. Which seemingly changes hour by hour. The federation president, Luis Rubiales, at the center of all this. On Saturday, another day of twists and turns. Spain's national team was saying they should be backing in the glory of their first-ever women's World Cup, all the celebrations, the euphoria of making history. Now, though, what is happening, Spain's entire coaching staff from that World Cup triumph jointly announcing their resignation as the fallout continues unabated. Such a strong statement from all those coaches. I will say this, though, Jim, the head coach of the team, Jorge Vilda, he was not part of the mass resignation today. Now in this statement, the group citing several reasons that led to that decision to quit and express, quote, \"their strongest and deepest condemnation of Luis Rubiales' behavior.\" The soccer federation threatening to take legal action against one of the star players, Jennifer Hermoso, who was on that World Cup winning team, accusing her of lying about being kissed during the World Cup final trophy presentation. Hermoso saying on Friday that at no point did she ever consent to an unwanted kiss. I will say this, Jim, from a man who is the most powerful figure in Spanish football. He is also a UAFA vice president. Earlier a statement from the Royal Spanish Football Federation reading: \"The evidence is conclusive, the president has not lied. The federation and the president, given the seriousness of the content of the press release from the FutPro Union, will initiate the corresponding legal actions.\" Just to reset for our viewers, Rubiales refusing to resign through all of this. Now world football was governing body, FIFA, getting involved. They've moved to suspend him from all football-related activities. Reaction has been coming into us fast all weekend long. Condemnation, too, from the world of football and beyond. Listen now to the head coach of Barcelona's men's team. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XAVI HENANDEZ, HEAD COACH, BARCELONA MEN'S SOCCER TEAM (through translation): First, I would like to give my unconditional support to Jenny and the players of the women's team because of what they are going through now. Secondly, to condemn the behavior of the Spanish federation president, which seems to me absolutely unacceptable. And finally, to express that I'm sorry and it's a shame that we are not talking about the women's World Cup football, of what I think is an historic date for our football. And that we are talking about the behavior, which is intolerable for me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
