Just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM a legal case involving former President Donald Trump is once again heading to court in the coming hours. We will look at which Mar-a-Lago employee is caught up in it and how Trump is reportedly paying for his mounting legal costs.The hottest month on record is finally coming to a close. We will look at whether there's relief in sight from the blistering temperatures baking much of the United States. And dozens were killed and many more wounded after a suspected suicide bombing in Pakistan. We'll go live to Islamabad for the latest. Good to have you with us. Well, the coming hours, we'll see a little- known employee of Donald Trump in federal court as part of the criminal case against the former president and Republican candidate for his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Carlos de Oliveira is a property manager at Mar-a-Lago. He is charged with making false statements in a January interview with the FBI when he was asked about the movement of boxes at the Florida resort. He is also accused alongside Trump and aide Walt Nauta of trying to delete security footage at the resort. CNN spoke with a former Trump attorney who thinks prosecutors will have a hard time with that particular claim. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If they don't really have much more than that, they may be have enough to charge Carlos with it, but quite frankly, if you charge Donald Trump every single time one of his employees says, you know, the boss wanted something, you know, I think that it could go on forever because so many of them, you know, just use that phrase.And so, they would have to actually make the connection that he actually communicated that to Carlos. So, I don't think that they're going to be able to sustain their burden as to others, even if they do have that employee come in and say, yes, you know, Carlos said this to me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This amid reports that his political action committee, which raises most of its money through small donations has spent more than $40 million on legal fees for Trump and his associates this year alone.A brutal heat wave sweeping the U.S. is set to continue this week. More than 140 heat records could be broken or tied as temperatures continue to climb across the country. On Sunday, parts of California, Louisiana and Georgia recorded new record highs.

It's unclear right now who is responsible for this kidnapping or whether they've made any demands, whether for ransom or anything else. El Roi Haiti, which is a humanitarian organization, a Christian humanitarian organization this nurse from New Hampshire was working for, put out a statement.Here's what they said in part. \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus.\" Now, El Roi has also said their highest priority is the safe return of this mother and her child and they want to limit the amount of information they're sharing. We also heard from a State Department spokesperson saying that they have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. But this kidnapping comes at a time of growing concerns about the worsening violence in Haiti. It was just two years ago this month that then President Jovenel Moise was assassinated by a gang, and there's been a power vacuum ever since, with some gangs taking control of various different swaths of the country. The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the frequency of kidnappings, crimes, civil unrest, and also the poor health infrastructure. And just last week, the State Department ordered all family members and non-emergency personnel of the embassy to leave the country immediately because it's so unsafe. This came after at least three days in a row of restrictions where embassy staffers and families were supposed to stay there on the embassy compound because things were so dangerous. The U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, said during a recent visit to Haiti that \"Haitians are trapped in a living nightmare with humanitarian conditions that are beyond appalling.\" Guterres went on to say, \"We are calling for a robust security force deployed by member states to work hand in hand with the Haitian national police to defeat and dismantle the gangs and restore security across the country.\" But bottom line here, we're still awaiting more details of this scary and dangerous situation there in Haiti.

It was a suicide bombing, which has been confirmed to us by police officials in the Bajaur region of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan.Now, these kinds of attacks were not uncommon during the war and militancy in Pakistan a couple of years ago, but it's been quite some time since an attack of this scale has taken place in that part of the country. So, it's been a very deadly bombing. We do not have a claim of responsibility. There is a sense of unease, of fear. There was this attack, wars targeting a political convention. This was a gathering of workers from the Jamiat-Ulema e-Islami Fazl Party, which is one of the parties that is making up the current coalition government.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, this news this morning coming from the governor of Russia's Bryansk region, which is just across the border in the northern border of Ukraine. This would be the third time in four days that we're seeing Russia blaming an attack on its soil on Ukraine. You can see there just where that Bryansk region is. The region we're talking about, the part of that region that we're talking about is actually right on the border with Ukraine.So, this is significant. This comes, of course, after we saw Russia claiming that it intercepted a missile in the Rostov region on Friday where fragments injured, it said, 14 people. Moscow, again, targeted, Russia said on Sunday, with drones that it apparently shot down, but there was damage to Moscow's prized business district called Moscow City. So, this, as I said, the fourth time in three days. No injuries reported, though a drone, according to the governor, did hit a building of the regional interior department and there is damage there that he says that they are working to clean up. No claim as of yet from Russia that this drone was shot down. So, that is noteworthy. But also, this comes, of course, after we heard comments from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Sunday. There's been no specific comment on this latest drone attack, but he did say on Sunday, gradually the war is returning to the territory of Russia. He said this is an inevitable natural and fair process. We've seen an uptick in these attacks. We've also seen an uptick in attacks on the Crimean Peninsula. I think this speaks to not only a strategy from Ukraine of hitting behind Russian lines, trying to disrupt infrastructure logistics, weapons depots, things like that, as it continues with its counteroffensive, but also really a sort of concerted effort now to bring the fight to the Russian people, to the Russian soil, and try to sort of test their ongoing support or at least non-opposition to this war, Rosemary.",

This week it will be things like strengthening their military for the long term, the industrial base, weapons, training, things like that. Also, it's strengthening Ukraine's resilience as a state, which is, of course, something Russia is trying to undermine, and committing to ongoing sanctions against Russia. Critically important, of course, because if there's any guarantees that we've seen thus far by NATO countries have proved clearly worthless, given that Ukraine has now been invaded twice by Russia. And separately, of course, we see Ukraine also trying to rally support, international support, and alignment around President Zelenskyy's 10-point peace plan, a summit, set to be held according to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" at the end of this week in Saudi Arabia with national security advisers to countries not only in Ukraine's western allies, but developing countries as well. We really see Ukraine trying to bring in countries that will include India and Brazil, we think, countries that Russia is also trying to court. So, Russia not included in these so-called peace talks, but this is really a strategy by Ukraine to rally support and to sort of get its own agenda for peace on the global stage. Rosemary?",
