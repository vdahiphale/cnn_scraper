According to authorities, the man charged with trying to kill Paul Pelosi and separately accused of plotting to hold House Speaker Nancy Pelosi captive and break her kneecaps told officers on the scene, \"This is a suicide mission.\" David DePape was in Court today in San Francisco. Those words are from the State's motion to detain him. CNN has obtained a copy and that is not all he reportedly said. We'll have more of the details on that in a moment.

Jurors were shown a series of text messages from January 6th referring to Speaker Pelosi, one of them reads, \"Was hoping to see Nancy's head rolling down the front steps.\" We begin in San Francisco where Paul Pelosi remains in the hospital facing what Speaker Pelosi says will be a long recovery from a skull fracture and where his alleged assailant was in Court.

And when Mr. Pelosi agreed, DePape responded that they are all corrupt, and said we've got to take them all out.\" The motion also says the attack on Paul Pelosi with that hammer was caught on body-camera video and it also says that DePape told officers that he didn't have plans to intentionally harm Mr. Pelosi, but that if he escalated the situation he would go through him if he had to. We saw him in Court today. He was arraigned on multiple felony charges including attempted homicide, burglary, elder abuse among others. He entered not guilty pleas for all of those. The Pelosi family was not in Court, but the prosecutor told the Judge that they are asking for privacy during this very traumatic time.
