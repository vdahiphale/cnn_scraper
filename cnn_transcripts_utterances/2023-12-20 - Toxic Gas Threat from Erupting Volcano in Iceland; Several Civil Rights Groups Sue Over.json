      "sentences": "The authorities here are saying that the volcanic activity is subsiding a little bit, but certainly the danger by far isn't over. Of course, in the initial hours after the first eruption took place, we saw that massive wall of magma coming from that fissure and some of the lava being spewed hundreds of feet into the air. Also, those lava flows coming from that as well, moving laterally into the immediate area.That's calmed down a little bit. The authorities first saying that they believe there was about five vents that were still active, still spewing, again, lava hundreds of feet into the air. Now they say it's about three vents that are still going. At the same time, the authorities do say there still is a lot of activity going on, and they say there could be new vents and new fissures opening up across that fault line that is going on there, with, of course, a magma tunnel that goes all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. So, the authorities here are definitely still very much on high alert. They've cordoned off the immediate area. And then you have that town of Grindavik, which has been so affected by all this. It was evacuated a long time ago. The residents have now been told that they can't go back until at least Christmas, which, of course, isn't really that surprising considering something that looks like the gates of hell has essentially just opened up in their backyard. Nevertheless, as of right now, luckily, no one has been injured in this eruption, and the authorities do say that they have the situation under control. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Over the last 24 hours, border officials have processed more than 10,000 migrants who unlawfully crossed into the U.S. These are new images showing some groups lined up along the Texas state line there in Eagle Pass. It's a crossing the Biden administration was forced to shut down to send resources elsewhere. Aron Thorn is a senior staff attorney with the Beyond Borders program of the Texas Civil Rights Project. His group joined the ACLU's lawsuit against Texas. Aron, thanks for being with us to talk about this. First off, tell us about concerns that you have about how this law would affect the Latino community in Texas as well as immigrants who do have legal claims.",

If this one does, too, considering the court is obviously more conservative now that it previously let a key and controversial part of Arizona's law stand, do you worry the Supreme Court OKs the Texas bill?",

Allowing state officials to deport people is something that not even Arizona tried to do.What Texas is trying to do is, you know, much, much broader than Arizona. And if Arizona's -- many of the policies that Arizona was proposing in that law were also struck down by the Supreme Court. And I think it's likely that you'll see Texas's attempt to grab even more clearly federal authority than what Arizona was trying to do over 10 years ago. I think you'll see the same result with Texas being told clearly. Immigration enforcement is the federal government's job and the federal government's job only.",

We see this record number of crossings on Monday. Congress seems incapable and unwilling to address it. Why shouldn't it come down to states to address what it seems the federal government is not capable or willing to in some points here?",

And so, enforcing it in this unlawful way also will not solve the problem at the southern border. Aron, thank you so much for your time today.
