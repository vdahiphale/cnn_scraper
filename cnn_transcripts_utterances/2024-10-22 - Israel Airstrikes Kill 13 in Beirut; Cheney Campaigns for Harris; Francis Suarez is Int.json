The secretary hoping to revive peace talks and move toward an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and an end to the fighting in Lebanon. The Israeli military pounding Hezbollah targets in Beirut overnight. Thirteen people, including a child, killed by an airstrike near the main government hospital in southern Beirut. Let's go live to Jerusalem, where we find CNN's chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance. Matthew, this, of course, comes after Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas, was killed, potentially some thought providing an opening to renew this push for a ceasefire deal. What can you tell us about whether that is even a remotely possible expectation at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, you're right, I mean following the death of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader last week. He was killed by Israeli forces inside the Gaza Strip. There were a lot of people in Israel, in the United States, amongst Israel's allies elsewhere as well, talking about how this could be a window of opportunity for a ceasefire for hostages - there are 101 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza to be brought out - and for a broader sort of settlement - a broader sort of ceasefire to be introduced in the region.But, I mean, that is not what's happened in reality. In fact, Hamas is still leaderless. It hasn't got anyone to negotiate with right now. And once that person is identified by the movement, it's not clear what their negotiating position would be. In the meantime, the Israeli government is pressing ahead with its strikes inside Gaza, killing, what was it, 27 people over the course of today according to Palestinian health officials. It's also expanded its military operation into neighboring Lebanon, where it's been conducting airstrikes as well. And it's poised, of course, the carry a strike on Iran, at which the Israeli government has threatened to do as well for the past couple of weeks. And so, it doesn't seem at this stage any side in this conflict is prepared to back down or prepared to ease off the fighting. And so that's the challenge Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, is facing as he comes for I think what will be his 11th trip to the region since the war in Gaza, since the October 7th attacks.",

I understand, I guess, while the Harris campaign is doing it because they're behind and they have to, in these swing states, and they have to peel some people back who are currently voting for Trump.

Obviously, Miami, you have so many Cuban Americans, et cetera.But I am still interested in your assessment of why Latinos, as a voting bloc, we're seeing this with black voters as well, voters of color, that are not necessarily seeming to be as inclined toward the Democratic Party this time around as they have been in past election cycles. It's part of why we're seeing numbers, especially across the sun belt, seem to look better for Donald Trump. And you touched on some of these issues in terms of the border, but I'm curious why you think that is and how much of it has to do specifically with culture.",

Thank you, sir.I actually want to just take a beat before we talk about this next story because, Brad, I mean, why - and, Kate, I'm honestly interested in all of your perspectives as to why this is moving the way that it is. And like, in Pennsylvania, for example, Reading, Pennsylvania, is a place - it's a city with a lot of Latinos who are living there. I talked to the mayor of that city who's a - it's a different kind of story, but there is an undercurrent of potentially pro-Trump influences there in a way that I think might surprise some people. What do you see going on with this? TODD: I think Democrats approach the Latino community wrong. They have an identity politics approach. And I think a lot of immigrants to this country don't want that. They want to be treated as Americans, not something hyphen Americans. And I think when you look at their individual concerns, you know, it's inflation, it's crime, wait a minute, the border. It's the same as everybody else. Donald Trump is going to get more Hispanic votes and Republicans down ballot are going to get more Hispanic votes this year than they ever have before. Some of it's culture. You know, we mentioned earlier that Trump currently leads among Catholics by 22 points. That - that's a factor. But it's definitely a big movement. And I think four years from now Republicans will carry the Hispanic vote.",

They're going to skew more Republican and fit more with the Cuban model than say the California Mexican American.
