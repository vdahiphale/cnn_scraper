The charges were later dropped and the men were exonerated but got no apology from their accuser. She had stuck by her story until now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

People in the New York metro area are now reporting a growing number of these drone sightings in their communities. And it follows a wave of mysterious drone appearances in the skies over nearby New Jersey for the past several weeks.The White House and the FBI say that there is no evidence the drones pose a national security threat or that they have a foreign connection. But the feds have given no explanations as to what they are, where they're coming from, or who is launching them. And frustrated lawmakers have gone from asking questions to demanding answers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER, (D) NEW JERSEY: Based on one of the briefings I've received from the FBI, which is the lead agency in the United States on drone threats, coupled with Homeland Security and the FAA, based on the information they have presented to date, I feel there's no imminent threat to public safety. This is not some made up thing. The question I believe the FBI and DHS needs to brief the public on right now is what do they know where these drones are from? Are they authorized or unauthorized? Right? Are they licensed or unlicensed? Where are they from? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "DHS and the FBI saying that thus far they have not been able to corroborate any drone sightings with electronic detection, I should say. So we did some digging into what that actually looks like and how that can actually happen.I had an opportunity to speak to a representative of T-DRONE (ph), which is a private aerospace security company that basically helps their clients prevent and detect any unauthorized drone -- drone flights. That representative telling me that there are at least four ways that you can actually detect some of these flights. The first, using radio frequency, you can actually pick up some of that chatter, some of that -- some of the signals that are sent to dispatch between the drone and the remote control on the ground, there are certainly cameras. A simple surveillance camera often does the trick, though with more advanced cases, more advanced technology is needed. Radar, we all know how that works. And then finally, acoustics, you can quite literally use equipment to listen for some of these drones, though that representative told me that that is becoming less reliable since drone technology has evolved. And oftentimes these drones are much quieter. But overall, these are the kinds of resources that authorities on the ground in New Jersey, at the state and local level are asking the federal government to provide. In fact, on Friday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy sending a letter to President Biden. And in it, not only does he express growing concern about these drone sightings, but also is asking for more federal resources to be sent to New Jersey to help them try to get to the bottom of this. The Governor also adding that the residents in his state deserve more information. That it's not enough to simply be told that this is not a matter of any sort of public security or public safety. They want to find out what's behind these drone sightings. And finally, the governor is saying, expressing concern about conspiracy theories that we have seen and heard for the last several days. It was just a few days ago that there was an official that was publicly speaking out about this, saying that it was his theory that it was likely an Iranian mothership off the east coast that was sending these drones in. Of course, the Pentagon quickly denying that claim. Back to you.",

But these big drones do exist.And in fact, experts told me that it could be the kind of thing a hobbyist could make or buy these sort of extra-large drones. But you need a special approval from the FAA to fly anything that weighs more than 55 pounds. And experts also told me that these larger drones can also cost tens of thousands of dollars. So more often they are used for commercial or military applications. Companies can use these large drones for things like agricultural surveillance or to spray fields. They can also be used for infrastructure to survey buildings or roads or for mapping. Some law enforcement agencies are also using drones for search and rescue applications, although you don't necessarily need an extra- large one. These things can also be used for commercial transportation, like deliveries. And then of course, they can be used by the military for surveillance with very powerful cameras or infrared sensors. But again, I want to stress that we don't necessarily know that any of these things are the case, that these are what are being spotted over New Jersey. But it's worth knowing that these larger drones do exist and that not all of the applications are scary things, Boris.",

PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENTAnd the Prime Minister himself, Trudeau has been categorical. That would be devastating for the Canadian economy. But what does it mean, you know, for Americans and the whole energy system? I want you to look at some facts. Even though Premier Ford there, he was talking about electricity specifically. But if we talk about electricity, we're talking about 84% of all of the electricity that the U.S. imports come from Canada. But again, Boris, it's only about 1% of consumption. When we talk about oil, sure, 60% of the oil that the U.S. imports does come from Canada, but the United States has enough oil for the entire country. What does this do more than anything, Boris, is it will have severe disruption to what is a highly integrated energy system between Canada and the United States. Doesn't matter if you're talking oil, electricity, natural gas. And what is that going to do? It's going to cause a little bit of chaos and disruption, but that's if it comes to this. And how did we get here, Boris? Well, you know, President Elect Trump has said that, look, 25% tariffs, unless something is done about the border. He really wants to tackle fentanyl and human trafficking. To that end, the Canadian government has said that, look, they'll have a plan likely presented next week, about $700 million extra that'll go to helicopters, drones, intelligence, a lot of different things that the United States is looking for. Now, look, to make his point, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the day after Thanksgiving, went to Mar-a-Lago. He spoke one on one with the president and assured him, we hear you, we will do what we can on the border. But they did not come away with any guarantees that these tariffs, 25% on everything Canada imports to exports to the United States, he did not come away with that guarantee. So what are they doing Boris, they're drafting a list, a list of retaliation. And Trudeau himself, he's the one who brought up energy. He brought up electricity. He brought up gas. He would then put, not stop supplies totally, but certainly perhaps put a tax on all oil or electricity or natural gas going into the United States. And that obviously, again, can cause significant disruption. I want to tell you, Boris, look, a lot of things are on the table right now. And the point is that Canadian officials do not believe any of this will go away. They are taking the President Elect at his word. And they do expect some economic chaos to come by the end of January.",
