That was not reflected in the data that FDA consulted.And I would point you to J.A. 383 to 384 in particular where FDA explained that even in-person you're not necessarily getting an ultrasound, that's never been required. And so, the relevant question might be, is your provider going to ask you a series of screening questions like when was your last menstrual period in person or via telemedicine?

FDA has always left that up to medical judgment.Now, it is, of course, necessary for providers to be able to diagnose ectopic pregnancy and to date gestational age. That remains true under the REMS now. Prescribers still have to have that capability, and they have to deploy whatever mechanisms they believe would accurately allow them to identify contraindications for use of mifepristone.

And if the woman has those kinds of risk factors, then imaging may be necessary.

You know, if the doctors have a conscience injury, there's a specific statute designed to deal with it, to specifically tailor-made guard against the risk of that injury occurring.And instead, they're reaching out and seeking to invoke rights under a different statute, the FDCA, that doesn't regulate them at all, that doesn't make them do or not do anything.

The Fifth Circuit found that that challenge wasn't timely because of the statute of limitations. As you're aware, in the context of another case, we heard this term, the court is currently considering the statute of limitations issue.So, setting aside standing, have you thought about how a ruling from this court on the statute of limitations, in either direction, might impact what happens in these kinds of cases with these kinds of challenges?",

I think this court should think hard about the mischief it would invite if it allowed agencies to start taking action based on statutory responsibilities that Congress has assigned to other agencies. On the merits, this issue was not presented below -- excuse me, it was not ruled on below.

I think your honor's question though gets that concern I heard in some of the earlier questioning about who would have standing if these plaintiffs don't have standing. And one of the things I want to note is that drug manufacturers are very frequently subject to tort litigation, product liability suit, failure to warn suits, deceptive advertising suits, when someone is claiming harm from a pharmaceutical manufacturer's product. What is so, I think, revolutionary, really, about the arguments here, both on standing and the merits, are the way that they attempt by individuals who do not use this product, do not prescribe this product, and have a conscience right not to treat anyone who has taken this product. Those individuals want to prevent anyone else from using it in line with FDA's considered scientific judgment.",

Wade, all eyes have been on politically what different states want to do now that it's returned to the states. This is a case about mifepristone, one in a two-step drug regimen to perform a medication abortion. Nearly half or more are performed in this way using this drug.The whole point of this is that there was a lower court ruling that said, hold on. The FDA should never have granted access to this drug in the first place. And if they did, they should roll it back to where you could have telemedicine or even have a brick-and-mortar retailer dispense it. The whole crux of these arguments now is whether, one, the people who brought this, the anti-abortion activists, the divisions have had standing to be here. Do you have an injury before me, or is this perspective in some way about your conscience? The other side of it is, if they were to decide that the FDA suddenly has to change their rules, only with respect to abortion-related medication, it could have a huge domino effect down the line for all drugs that are prescribed in this country. And so, the big question for them now is, well, where should we favor? Is the idea of trying to avoid this case entirely, or is it leaning into further this idea that we want to regulate abortion in ways that their Dobbs decision said ought to be left to the states?",

The efficacy rate they find is 95 percent to 98 percent.And super interestingly, because this drug is increasingly being used via Telehealth, they find that the safety is the same regardless of whether you're getting this through telemedicine or you're getting this in-person at a clinic.",

Wade, abortion specifically, and what does it mean in American life, number one. Number two is the role of the administrative state. What power do agencies have to regulate and make decisions on things like drugs or food or air or water? And a goal, quite frankly, of the conservative movement -- legal movement for the last half century has been the dismantling of the administrative state, and particularly Justice Gorsuch is one that deep in his bones believes that agencies have too much power. Even the FDA ought not to have the juice that it has to regulate. So, whatever they write here, I would think is going to touch on some of those issues. However -- you know, because the justices are free to write concurrences or dissents or whatever else, and what power agencies have to make decisions is a critical issue and it's going to come up.",

It's not -- it would not just be mifepristone. If they challenge and say that the FDA ought to have to have a new way of examining and evaluating drugs and how they have to go down the line to figure out whether they're available and how they should regulate that, that's just not just this drug. It should be all of them. Think about all those that then would leave the marketplace, not just for women reproductive rights, but everyone.
