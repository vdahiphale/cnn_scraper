He can see out of the glass. They can't necessarily see in. So, when you go up those stairs and you have no cover, yet they continued up the stairs going toward him, and, of course, Wilt, unfortunately, was struck, causing Galloway to go back down, get cover, radioed to the other officers so they don't go right into the line of fire.John picked something up that is very important. You can see when the rookie officer pulls up, he pulls up a little too far in front of the glass. So, the veteran tells, hey, back up a little bit because, you know, you don't want to get, you know, hit before you can get out of the car. So, tactically, everything was going about its best as it could, but they were at a distinct disadvantage from the very beginning. And that time of day, he could see out, you can't see in. You can see the glare on the glass. Well, that's what the cops are seeing. Now, you just can't blindly fire in. You could hit a hostage. You could hit a bank employee and not the bad guys. So, you want to get a clear shot if you're able to in order to take him out. Eventually, he was able to get that shot fortunately and kill him.",

For years, Fox lawyers have maintained that Rupert Murdoch doesn't have an official role at Fox News. He's the chairman of Fox Corporation. But that the lawyers had said he didn't have an official role at Fox News. It was only disclosed recently that he is actually an officer at the company.And the judge, not very happy about this, making it clear in court, he said at one point, you have a credibility problem to the Fox legal team, and so not good for them heading into this trial.

And then you're also going to have them having to admit on the stand that they gave air to those election lies in the wake of the 2020 election.So, it's going to be an agonizing process for Fox News.

The president, as he stated repeatedly, very supportive of the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace and stability to this area 25 years ago, but also recognizing the complications that continue to exist, complications on the economic side of things and complications brought by that Brexit vote just a few years ago. The president very supportive of the Windsor agreement that was put in place about a month ago, but yet there are still real questions about the political future of an area that lags far behind, particularly on the economic development side, of Ireland just to its south. The president will be meeting individually with the five leaders of the political parties here. The body that currently meets here is not meeting at this point in time, isn't telling that the president is going to try and urge them to that point, not wanting to put a thumb on the scale here, but recognizing that there's still very real concern about the future of an element that has been so critical here in this area over the course of the last 25 years.",
