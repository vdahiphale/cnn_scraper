Whether or not that comes to fruition, we do not know yet at this point.But Israeli military officials saying that they have now taken control of a refugee camp about three miles from the center of Gaza City. So indications that the Israeli military continues to make a deeper and deeper push inside of Gaza and take control of areas. And if you've been watching the reporting of our colleague, Nic Robertson, who was inside of Gaza with Israeli military teams yesterday, you could really see the level and the extent to which the Israeli military has taken hold of many of the streets and neighborhoods that he was able to pass through there. Israeli military officials also say since the beginning of this ground offensive, they've spotted and located about 160 entrances to tunnels throughout the Gaza regions that they've entered. And that so far they've been able to strike nearly 3,000 what they - as what they describe as terrorist infrastructure inside of Gaza as well, Brianna.",

MJ, we were hearing earlier from someone very involved in former hostage negotiations for Israel that this isn't done until it's done. And he thinks right now when you hear a lot about hostage negotiations, it can just be noise. But when you listen to what we're hearing from President Biden, it does sound pretty hopeful. So where do things stand?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. Before President Biden left Washington to head here to San Francisco, what we heard him say about the hostage negotiations was, I believe it's going to happen. Now, he has sounded optimistic in the past. But one of the reasons that this seemed noteworthy, particularly today, was because a senior U.S. official familiar with the ongoing talks had told CNN that Israel and Hamas were moving closer to a deal.Now, they did caution that it's closer, but it's not done, essentially saying closer does not mean close. There are many, many details that still have to be worked out. And, Brianna, this is what we do know about the ongoing parameters that are being discussed, we know that there would be an exchange of a large number of hostages for a number of Palestinian prisoners that Israel is holding and that all of this would take place when there is a sustained pause in fighting up to about five days is what we were told and that the priority would be given to particularly vulnerable populations like women, like children. But there are so many sticking points. These talks have been so incredibly complicated. And just as you said, parties that are involved in these talks have said before, look, we've gotten close, but we haven't had a deal yet. And just one illustration of that is that we were told that the Israelis had initially asked for 100 hostages to be released. But if you listen to what the Hamas' military wing has said recently, it is that they are discussing potentially 70 hostages being released. So as one Israeli official basically summarized it, they said Hamas is trying to release as few hostages as possible. In exchange for the longest ceasefire possible. So at least from the U.S.'s perspective, yes, we are seeing some hints of optimism creeping into these conversations. And they're going to be very, very relieved when those hostages get out. But I think you're very right that until they are actually out and physically out of Gaza, there's not going to be a real sense of relief.",

And I believe, as do many, played a role in the ultimate collapse of the Iron Curtain, strengthening President Reagan's knowledge of the moral high ground that the United States had in the Cold War. So these rallies can make a profound difference.

The rally that you are at right now, we see behind you, it's drawing several high-profile speakers, including members of Democratic leadership.
