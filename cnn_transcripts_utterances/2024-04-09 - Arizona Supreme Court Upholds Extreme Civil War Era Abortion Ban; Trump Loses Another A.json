The Arizona Supreme Court ruling the state must comply with a 160- year-old law barring all abortions. The only exception to save a while pregnant woman's life, but no exceptions for rape, no exceptions for incest -- just the latest example of the abortion rights battle, heating up since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Reaction this hour, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Plus, Donald Trump rejected again in yet another attempt to delay the New York hush money trial, which is set to start in just six days. Can his legal team attempt another Hail Mary? We'll ask a former Trump attorney about those potential conversations. And a traffic stop to turn deadly in Chicago, killing Dexter Reed. Police weapons fired 96 times and just 41 seconds. What does the body camera footage of this tragic case show? We'll show you. (MUSIC)",

Today, the state Supreme Court upheld the law from the 1800s, which bans abortion in all cases, including rape, including incest, except when it's, quote, necessary to save a person's life. In addition, the civil war era law punishes providers who perform abortion procedures with two to five years in prison. This is all a direct result of the U.S. Supreme Court eliminating the constitutional right to abortion nearly two years ago, when the court overturned Roe v. Wade with its decision in Dobbs versus Jackson Women's health organization. The word Dobbs in fact, appears 22 times in the Arizona Supreme Court's 47-page opinion. Now, the law they refer to dates back to 1864, a time in our nation's history when women in the United States were not allowed to vote, women in some states were not alone to own property Arizona itself was not even a state until 1912. And while there is a temporary hold on this Arizona decision, women in Arizona are now living in complete uncertainty, according to Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs, who just spoke after the ruling this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D), ARIZONA: It is a dark day in Arizona. We are 14 days away from this extreme ban coming back to life. It must be repealed immediately. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's also sure to affect the consequential race for Arizona's pendingly empty Senate seat. CNN's Natasha Chen is following all this closely. So, Natasha, how was the Arizona Supreme Court able to resurrect this law? Kind of an ancient law, and especially with -- given the fact that in 2020, Republican Governor Ducey, who was the governor then, he signed a law that banned abortion after 15 weeks. Why -- why is that not now the law of the land?",

In 2022, when that 15-week ban was passed, that was contingent on Roe versus Wade, and without Roe versus Wade, since it's been overturned, now, the state of Arizona and federal law, there's no independent right to access an abortion that would serve as the basis for that 15-week ban.So it's the court's logic that the older law dating back to 1864, as you said was technically always on the books, except on hiatus while Roe versus Wade was in effect for about 49 years. And so when Roe versus Wade was overturned, the court's logic is that, that older law is now back in effect. So you can imagine this is highly confusing. This is not the only state that's dealt with a lot of these similar types of issues. You can see there on the map, how many states in orange there have banned or severely restricted abortion? Nearly all abortion is banned in Arizona where you see the star there. That's been because this ruling it will not be enforced for 14 days. That gives the parties some time here, the opportunity to raise additional issues at a lower court if they want to. Now, no one who provided an abortion prior to this ruling will be subject to the penalty, which is between two to five years. In prison for the abortion provider and -- but at the same time, this is super confusing for a lot of people.

But as a lawyer, I think you're obligation is to say, look, we've got to focus on the task at hand because this is a tribal case, and this is going to be a case where a jury selection that Paula just laid out is incredibly important because there's going to be a real incentive for people to want to be celebrity jurors, to be -- to find a way to answer the questions in a way perhaps dishonestly, that its a minute that magic number of 12 jurors.So there's a lot at stake. There's a lot to be focusing on, I think in terms of courtroom decorum, courtroom behavior, because it's such a -- I think creative, which really means weak case, relying so heavily on the credibility of Michael Cohen, that even in New York, President Trump has a shot. So I think the lawyers in to focus on trying the case on cross- examination, on the right arguments to make. And they want to have a client who's respectful in the courtroom so that the jury doesn't have any risk of being alienated by any of that kind of political atmosphere.",

It's not going to get them to delay. I don't think there's any real likelihood at this hour the judge is going to say, okay, fine. You broke up with your lawyers, we'll see you in June. It's going to happen short of a more traditional motion, it's going to happen soon. And really, the focus I think should have been on that huge avalanche of paperwork that they just received. If you can find things there, that are legitimate causes for concern like, judge, we have to follow up on this exculpatory information.

They are defendants and criminals convicted of crimes from the Capitol attack, often violent crimes, often committed against police officers, such as Matthew de Silva.Matthew DaSilva is a Navy veteran from Lavon, Texas, just outside Dallas. He was convicted did last year of assaulting police on January 6 at the Capitol. Prosecutors say that with a flag pole in hand, DaSilva worked with other writers to forcefully push against police trying to defend the lower west terrorist tunnel of the Capitol. Prosecutors say video from that day shows DaSilva grabbing a police riot shield and pulling it away from at least one police officer. About a month after the Capitol attack, a witness notice DaSilva from an FBI wanted photo. Ultimately, it was that long bushy beard that gave him a way not to mention the blue and gray camouflage navy jacket and his distinctive black and yellow scarf. A second witnessed also recognized DaSilva noting the red hat, adding that he wore that yellow scarf almost every day. The second witness also said DaSilva had the long beard for years. But after the riot, DaSilva shaved it off and cut his hair and stopped wearing that scarf. Curious time for fashion change. In a bench trial last year, a judge found DaSilva silver guilty of two felony and four misdemeanor counts for his actions at the Capitol. He is currently in the D.C. jail waiting to learn his prison sentence. Again, no matter how many times Mr. Trump calls them hostages, they're not hostages. This one, and a long list of others are convicted violent criminals. Let's bring in Democratic Congressman Jason Crow of Colorado. He's a combat vet who served as an Army Ranger before his days in Congress and he spent more than 30 minutes on January 6, hiding in the house chamber, crouch down between the seeds helping colleagues while the rioters attack. Congressman, thanks for joining us. Last Monday, Trump wrote on Truth Social, one of his first acts as president would be to, quote, free January 6 hostages wrongfully imprisoned, unquote. What's your response? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Well, that's abhorrent. There's no doubt about that, but we also shouldn't be surprised as one of the many abhorrent things that Donald Trump always does. He doesn't respect our democracy. He doesn't respect rule of law, and he certainly doesn't respect American voters, right? If you call these -- these criminals, these insurrection as hostages, you very clearly, were trying to undermine the election, overturn the election and have no respect for our Democratic government. That's situation we're dealing with here, but, you know, we're not going to let Donald Trump rewrite history. We're going to call it like it is. This was a violent insurrection that killed a police officer, several others took their own lives because of the trauma after the fact and over 160 were brutally beaten that day",

You do not achieve national security either for Israel or for the United States by killing tens of thousands because of civilians putting over a million at risk of famine. That doesn't serve anybody's interests, in addition to being a very big moral travesty.So, there has to be changed and there has to be changed now, for everybody's interests. You know, I fought the war on terror and I know that you cannot defeat a terror organization with military force alone.
