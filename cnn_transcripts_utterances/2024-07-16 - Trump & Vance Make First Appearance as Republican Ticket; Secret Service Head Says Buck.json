And this is sort of what I was alluding to about some of the speakers at the convention yesterday. A lot of those people did ridicule Paul Pelosi. A lot of those people did ridicule or are actively talking about political violence. Someone like Mark Robinson from North Carolina said that there are times when it's OK to use political violence, recently, paraphrasing. And so, I hope that the assassination attempt on President Trump is a wake-up call to people in both parties that a cavalier attitude right now towards political rhetoric is really bad. We are at a point in our politics where we are completely polarized, where people just are overly amped up. And so, rhetoric that, you know, we used to use when Mark and I had less gray hair today doesn't -- you know, it -- it takes things a little too far. And I hope this is a wake-up call for people in both parties.",

Because we had wind gusts up to 105 miles per hour in this line for Camp Grove, Illinois; 97-mile-per-hour winds in Holy Cross, Iowa; even 75-mile-per-hour wind gusts reported at O'Hare Airport. We are looking at more than 500,000 customers without power from the damaging winds that have rolled through. The severe risk continues today. We do have the continued threat for damaging winds, isolated tornadoes, and large hail stretching across the Ohio Valley and then getting into the Northeast. So, something that we'll have to watch out for again -- Kasie.",
