Stand by for details on what he knows as he urges voters out there to learn the truth about his former boss.Also tonight, a dire warning from the FBI director that the terrorism threat against the United States is at a whole new level after the October 7th attack on Israel and the war in Gaza. Stand by for more on alarming new testimony by the nation's top intelligence officials. And the Princess of Wales now says she's responsible for editing a family photo that was supposed to ease speculation about her health after abdominal surgery. Instead, the image and the controversy are now raising even more questions about what's going on with the British royals. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news, CNN's exclusive new interview with a key witness in the Trump classified documents case known only as Trump employee 5, at least until now. CNN's Katelyn Polantz says in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Mar-a- Lago. Katelyn, who is this witness and why is he speaking out now?",

Brian Butler worked for Donald Trump for 20 years at the Mar-a-Lago club, at one point, running the car service for all of the guests coming in and out of the club. He eventually left that job in fall of 2022, but that was not before he had been privy to some major conversations and moments in this classified documents investigation.And now he is someone who has spoken to prosecutors multiple times and clearly is a key witness for the indictment. One of those moments he recalls, Wolf, is June 3rd of 2022, when he was working at the club and the body man of Donald Trump, Walt Nauta, asked him oddly in his estimation to borrow an Escalade, a Cadillac Escalade, so that it could be used on the very same day that the Justice Department, FBI agents, were coming to Mar-a-Lago to collect documents, classified records that might be there. That day, they did not get all of them. And Brian Butler and Walt Nauta then helped get all of the Trump family's luggage over to the airport to go out of town for the summer. That's not all he said. Here's more of what Brian Butler told Kaitlan Collins here at CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN BUTLER, TRUMP EMPLOYEE 5: And then what happened is Walt left before me, and he never goes directly to the plane. He's either in the motorcade when he goes there with the boss, which the former president. And I remember telling him he left the club with -- I didn't know what he had in his vehicle, but he waited for me at a nearby business, and I told him I would tell him when I was leaving Mar-a-Lago. So, I left Mar-a-Lago, I texted him, hey, I'm on my way. He followed me. He pulled out and got behind me. We got to the airport. I ended up loading all the luggage I had, and he had a bunch of boxes.",

And humanitarian law likely would not cover in countenance the kind of devastating military operation that Israel is undertaking. Now, there's no doubt that there are very bad people in Rafah right now, that there are significant Hamas assets, but there is a much more surgical means by which to try to take out the high level Hamas leadership that may be inside those camps or in and around those camps.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was meant to quell the rumors, a smiling Princess of Wales with her three children looking the picture of health, but instead it fuelled them. The photo, released on Sunday by the royal family, dramatically pulled from circulation by several major news agencies later that day, citing concerns that it had been manipulated. The Princess of Wales apologized on Monday, taking personal responsibility for editing the image. Like many amateur photographers, she said, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. Kate was seen on Monday in a car with her husband leaving Windsor. Out of the public eye since her abdominal surgery in January, Sunday's family photo, released for Mother's Day in the U.K., was supposed to offer the public some reassurance of her health, but instead it's raised more questions than answers. A CNN analysis of the photo found at least two areas which appear to show evidence the photo has been potentially altered, including Princess Charlotte's sleeve which seems to melt into nothing and then Kate's zipper which appears to be cut short. CNN is continuing to use the original photo in the context of the debate around its alleged manipulation. A Royal source told CNN on Monday the Princess made minor adjustments to the image as she shared in her statement on social media but didn't explain why they weren't transparent about the edits when they shared the image with news media and picture agencies.

TRISHA GODDARD, BRITISH T.V. PRESENTER: Well, I think the biggest breach of trust is between the royal family and the press. And you might remember in his book, Prince Harry talked about a deal being done between the royals and the press. It now seems, I think, that all bets are off. That photograph of her supposedly being driven by Carol Middleton wasn't published in the British press, and they explained why. And they seem to be standing by the privacy rule. I don't think they will so much. And, remember, Catherine is also patron of the Royal Photographic Society. So, it's so embarrassing.",

The judge, though, in this case, is issuing a somewhat stern warning moving forward. He said that Trump's team and the D.A.'s prosecutors, they must now seek permission if they're going to file any new motions ahead of the jury selection March 25th.

This was initially described as strong turbulence, the kind of incident that keeps making headlines. But I want to read you the statement from airline Latam. It was operating this flight between Sydney and Auckland. It says there was a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement.Technical event leaves a lot of room for interpretation and investigators will want to know if something happened in the cockpit. Was this an issue with the flight controls? Was this an issue with the autopilot? This was on a Boeing 787, not a 737 MAX, like during the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout two months ago. But even still, Boeing says it's working to gather more information about this incident and his standing by to support an investigation. This plane was to go on to Santiago, Chile, the latest data from FlightAware shows the plane remains on the ground in Auckland. That's where first responders and there's treated a total of 50 people who are on board this flight, 12 were taken to the hospital. One patient in serious condition. Technical event or not, passengers are describing this like a severe turbulence incident. One telling Radio New Zealand blood was on the ceiling, people flew and broke the ceiling of the plane. Turbulence can be caused by weather such as the up and down drafts of thunderstorms. Sometimes wind shear, where there are two rows or columns of air moving at different speeds. But turbulence can also be triggered by no weather phenomena at all called clear air turbulence, meaning it can be invisible to pilots. Airlines have gotten better at forecasting turbulence, but the National Transportation Safety Board says turbulence is the number one cause of injuries on commercial flights -- Wolf.
