He said that vehicles have been passing up and down this road and the village just around the corner from us have been taking direct fire from houses, literally just across the border. They were once upon a time civilian houses, but they're co-opted and Hezbollah moves in and maybe moves the family out, maybe not.This is just sort of descriptions we've been getting over the past few months and they fire from there. And this, when Daniel Hagari -- Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief IDF spokesman, describes what they're targeting, this matches up what people on the ground here tell us. And I've been in this village before. There are houses here that have been very clearly hit by exactly the type of shoulder-launch rockets that are being described to us. So, the scenarios match up. What Hagari is talking about is a more complex issue, saying that Hezbollah plan to follow the Hamas October 7th playbook, which is have a concerted effort, massed forces, massed weapons to infiltrate across the board. That's what people here tell us they're worried about as well. So, in this part of the border, right now, I can tell you it is it is pretty quiet. But can also tell you the security officials here are extremely on edge and they truly believed that there could be something incoming across that border in a seconds time.

But you know, Becky, we are hearing from the Israeli military saying that they have launched what they are describing as this limited ground operation, these targeted raids as they describe it. Now, we've been getting information here from security sources, a source with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, UNIFIL, as well as two senior Lebanese security sources, and what they say -- they are saying that Israel has not yet launched a full-scale invasion.They're describing what has been taking place as sporadic raids across the border and that no Israeli troops remain on Lebanese soil. But what we also do know has been taking place is intense shelling, artillery shelling as well as air airstrikes around that border region. That's according to residents there and the Lebanese state news agency. We've heard from residents in some of these southern towns describing a really terrifying situation that they have been living through. People in their homes, unable to evacuate, they say they've even called the Lebanese army to get them out. But the army said it can't do that. We've reached out to the Lebanese military and have yet to hear from them, but we do know that it moved its troops. The Lebanese army yesterday, from the observation post along the border back to military barracks in villages and towns further north. And you know, as you were hearing from Nic there, Hezbollah is still continuing to launch attacks. They say these barrages of rockets targeting Israeli military targets and you know, in the last couple of hours, Becky, we've heard from the Israeli military, ordering the evacuation of 27 villages in the south, telling people they need to get out immediately and they need to move to the north of the Awali River. For some of these villages, that's about 30 miles south -- north into Lebanon. So this is really only going to exacerbate an already dire humanitarian situation here. As you know, up to a million people already displaced just in the past ten days or so. I can tell you the mood here right now, fear, anxiety, apprehension that is just so palpable. You hear the Israelis talking about a limited ground offensive. No one here really believes that. They say they feel that this -- that history might be repeating itself here, of course, because back in 1982, Israel also launched what it described as a limited ground incursion into Lebanon. That turned into a full-scale invasion and an occupation of southern Lebanon for many, many years. So, a lot of fear here of what might be coming next, Becky.",

Well, the war risks further destabilizing Lebanon, a country already on the brink without a president and suffering from a deep economic crisis. My next guest posted, \"Lebanon's fate and the region's outlook will be determined in the battlefield in south Lebanon, as we speak.Dr. Sami Atallah is a Political Economist and Director of 'The Policy Initiative' think tank in Beirut. And he joins me now live. Can you just explain further what you meant by that post? SAMI ATALLAH, FOUNDING DIRECTOR, 'THE POLICY INITIATIVE':  Sure. Hi, Becky. Indeed, we are actually entering in a very dangerous phase of the war. Israel is euphoric about its tactical wins, though it has not defeated Hamas. It has destroyed Gaza, killed many thousands of civilians in Gaza. Now, they're entering Lebanon thinking that they can do the same. Now, this is the situation. Israel is not interested in peace or in liberating the south as the Israeli spokesperson was saying. In fact, Israel's main goal is actually to impose its hegemony in the Levant, and the only force standing in the way is Hezbollah (ph). Now, so this is what I mean, is that their ability to enter Lebanon and destroy Hezbollah is not to liberate anything, but to control the region. Hence, it all depends on what the battlefield tells us, and the performance of Hezbollah forces and their ability to withstand the Israeli aggression. So, I doubt there is going to be a limited incursion unless the Israelis think it is going to be a picnic or they are going to run away or run out of Lebanon. This is going to be a major battlefield. We are going to see to what extent Hezbollah's organizational structure, command and control is ready for the war. And I think we get to see that in the coming days or weeks.",

The Palestinian issue sits Hezbollah, certainly would say, at the heart of what is going on here.But the stated goal of the Israelis is to secure the northern part of Israel where some 65,000, of course, are displaced by the threats from Hezbollah. And those threats, of course, are very real. I want to talk to you very specifically about the risk at this point for a Lebanon that is already, as many will say, on the brink, that is further destabilized by what is going on. Now, there are a million displaced as we understand it, that is some 20 percent of the population. What are the risks for the Lebanese, for Lebanon at present?

In fact, it's Israeli that is actually trying to provoke Iran for the war. It has done so, so many times, asking for it and counting on the U.S. to help it. So really, see how much of a danger Israel is not only to Lebanon and to the Palestinians, but to the stability of the region, because Bibi Netanyahu wants a war because that serves him, serves him politically and electorally, and it serves the state of Israel's hegemony in the region.So, we are really -- we have to focus on what the Israeli government is going to do. Now, as for the Iranians, we have seen that they've been very restrained relatively. I don't think they have -- obviously, they haven't reacted to Haniyeh's assassination. The big question is, how will they respond to the battlefield today and if Hezbollah is weakened seriously, will they interfere or not, that is really the big question. But so far, they have not -- in fact, if anything, they've kept more a low threshold in terms of interfering directly or even causing a war. So, I think in order to make sure that no war breaks out, again, international community, the West and the U.S. need to stop Israel because, frankly, Netanyahu is undeterred. He has the green light to do whatever he wants and no one is stopping him. (Inaudible) responsible the U.S. and the West for all the wars and the crisis we are facing.",

Members of the International Longshoremen's Association are striking at (ph) 14 major ports in the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico too. Last-minute efforts to reach an agreement with ship operators and port authorities came to nothing. The employers have offered a contract that would raise wages by 50 percent over the next six years; the Union says that's unacceptable. It is the first strike at the East Coast ports since 1977. Vanessa Yurkevich is in Elizabeth, New Jersey and we should clarify exactly how much impact this would have to the U.S. economy and economies in other countries. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENTOne estimate puts a one-week strike at over $2 billion. And just into this port alone, imports consists of alcohol, cherries, fruits, furniture, and exports auto parts and other items that our foreign counterparts by. But that's all at a halt right now because the union, the ILA and USMX failed to reach a deal yesterday. On the table was an offer from USMX of 50 percent in wage increases over six years, but the union saying that is not good enough. Also of note, retailers saw this coming and a lot of them brought in a lot of their holiday products early because they didn't want a strike to interrupt shipping. So for holiday shoppers out there, you can rest easy that there will be things on the shelves around the holiday shopping season. Now, the administration, the Biden Administration is really the only power to stop a strike. President Biden could enact something called the Hartley Act and Taft-Hartley Act, and that would essentially end a strike. However, President Biden is saying he is not planning to get involved despite major business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on him to do so. I briefly spoke with the president of the ILA union moments ago and he told me that in order to get back to the negotiating table with the shipping alliance, all of his demands need to be met, Max.
