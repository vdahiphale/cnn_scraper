At this hour, 151 flights out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport have been canceled because of the cold weather. You really can't walk to far around here without running into any number of lines. Folks either have to see a ticket counter to get a boarding pass, they've got to come over here to drop off their bags, and then they've got to head over to TSA where the line there is at least several hours long. Across the country we're looking at well over 1,500 flights that have been canceled because of this cold weather. That number yesterday was well over 3,000. And, of course, we're talking about hundreds of more flights that are being delayed across the U.S. We caught up with one woman who was able to make it to Atlanta, but she's stuck here for now. Here's what she told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN has reported that allies are worried about Trump's slow start and the direction of his campaign. Nuzzi, for her part, interviews Trump. It is a fascinating read. She also talks with some of his closest aides. One adviser tells her, quote, he has retreated to the golf course and to Mar-a-Lago. His world has gotten much smaller. His world is so, so small, closed quote.Olivia Nuzzi joins us now. This is so riveting. But I want to start with the headline, because your headline on the piece is, inside his sad, lonely, thirsty, broken, basically pretend run for re-election.

It's -- you say, quote, in this business, you can have it and have it so hot, and it can go overnight and it's gone and you can't get it back. I think we're just seeing it's gone. The magic is gone, according to an advisor. When you say the magic is gone, he's saying he's not going to be able to get it back.

I think that's sort of the difficult thing about a campaign that is just really about a personality, right, is that even if it were to be run in a really common sense way, it was really well run, would it really matter if the personality that the whole thing is built around, that the entire political movement is about, if that personality is not really on his game, if he's like lost his mojo in some way. I don't know.But I think that, you know, Donald Trump, when he's cooped up, when he's got his wings clipped, historically is kind of a dangerous creature who's prone to listening to even crazier ideas than normal and - and doing even crazier things. And one former White House official in this piece talking about, before the insurrection, before he officially lost the campaign in 2020, already he had become this sort of terrifying figure who, in his Covid isolation in the White House, kind of locked away and kept from having contact with regular Americans or just with more normal people who might be around him in a busy place like the West Wing, he really had cracked and begun to lose his mind. And that this person began to move further and further away from him. But, you know, Sara, in terms of what Trump might think about this piece. It's like an 8,000 or 9,000 word piece. I don't know that he's going to be sitting down to read it. I think he'll probably just look at the cover, look at the headline and think, ah, it's fake news and move on from there.",
