      "sentences": "Well, just hours from now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will arrive in the Middle East to begin his fourth trip to the region since the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. His visit comes as fears are rising that the Israel-Hamas war could erupt into a much broader conflict after a suspected Israeli attack on a senior Hamas leader in Beirut, twin ISIS explosions near the graveside of an Iranian commander and Iran-backed Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Also, a drone attack on a pro- Iranian - Iraqi militants in Baghdad, which the U.S. says it was behind because it blames the group for its recent attacks on American troops.At the same time, Israel is unveiling its plans for the next phase of its war in Gaza, including a new combat approach in the north and sustained focused on targeting Hamas leaders in the south. CNN's Oren Liebermann joins us now from the Pentagon. Oren, there is a lot to unpack here. What's on the secretary of state's plate? How is he going to handle this in the days ahead?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, Secretary of State Antony Blinken's goal here, at least part of his goal, is to find some way forward here without escalating tensions in the region, or at least trying to contain potential conflicts that could very easily grow into open war. And look here at the challenge he has ahead of him. And this is just in the last week.As you pointed out, on Thursday, so yesterday, the U.S. took a strike in Baghdad that killed the commander of a pro-Iran militia. Those strikes have angered the Iraqi government in the past. They've called it an infringement of Iraqi sovereignty. Just a day before that, there was a major ISIS terror attack in Iran. Iran blaming Israel, at least in part for that, saying they'll respond. A day before that, an Israeli strike in Beirut, in Lebanon, killed a senior Hamas leader there. Both Israeli and Lebanese officials warning there could be open war if there isn't some sort of arrangement found on that border. And then two days before that, U.S. Navy helicopters sank three Houthi boats that fired on the U.S. military and were approaching a commercial vessel in international shipping lanes. All of these are essentially across the Middle East. The U.S. sees Iran as largely responsible here for the attacks on U.S. forces and on international shipping lanes. But the U.S. is trying to find a way forward, grappling with how to respond to these without sparking a wider conflict. And that is part of Blinken's challenge here as he meets with the Saudis, the Qataris, the Egyptians and more, as well as, of course, the Israelis and the Palestinians, because that war is very close to the three-month mark here, Phil.",

So, when you look at some of those top states, California, New York, Illinois, for example, again, a composite of gun death rate and gun law strength. And at least for California and New York, they had some of the lowest gun death rates in the country, which includes homicides, suicide and accidental killings, which is interesting because they have the two largest cities in the country as well. On the other end of the spectrum, Arkansas was ranked last because of their weaker gun laws and high gun death rate there.Now, when it comes to the laws that they studied, Every Town essentially looked at five foundational ones. So, that's requiring background checks, that's securing -- secure firearm storage, that's rejection of stand your ground laws, extreme risk laws. They could take away someone's access to firearms if they're deemed to be a threat to themselves or others. There are other metrics, but those are sort of the foundational ones. And based on the implementation of those, they claim that nearly 300,000 lives could be saved over the next decade if every state followed the example of some of those top ranked states, like California and New York.",

So, 216,000 for the month of December, that is hotter than we were expecting. I don't know if you guys are feeling a little warm right now, but this was a hotter than expected report. The expectation was closer to about 160,000. The unemployment rate sort of remained at 3.7 percent.And we can show you the unemployment rate over the last few years or so. And, guys, we've been in this really tight range, as you can see. So, that spike was, of course, the pandemic. And now you see that we've been sort of below 4 percent for almost two years. I mean we've been at or below 4 percent for unemployment, which is very low, since January of 2022. If you look at the sectors where we added job, you can see they're some of the sectors that we expected, health care, government, construction. Government adding 52,000 jobs. Health care, 38,000 jobs. And construction. Wages, which, of course, have inflationary impacts and implications. Wages increased as expected, 0.4 percent on an annual basis. So, what this means broadly is, it's still a hot labor market, it is still a strong labor market. But when you step out and look at the broader picture, you do start to see some cooling on the fringes. So, you look at job postings, for example. Those have started to fall. We haven't seen layoffs like some had been expecting, but we're seeing job postings start to fall. So, it may not be as easy to find another job, but by and large you're still looking at a pretty robust labor market.",

You mentioned that there are peripheral elements too that are being considered. How's the Fed looking at this given what Jay Powell said just last month? SOLOMONreport sort of increases the likelihood that when we do see rate cuts, it's going to be later in 2024, right? So, we have, I want to say, seven or eight Fed meetings next year. And so the hope had been, well, maybe if this was a cooler job report we would start to see rate cuts, maybe in March, maybe in April. This is starting to look like we may start to see them actually later in the spring, earlier in the summer. So, those are the implication because it's still a strong labor market, it's still a strong economy, because you have to remember, the labor market powers consumer spending, right. Consumer spending is two-thirds of the U.S. economy. So, if people are employed, people are having their wages go up, they can spend. That that, of course, has an inflationary impact.",

I mean, you are still seeing -- even though we're seeing inflation, the price rises cool, they're still higher prices by and large, are still higher than they were a few years ago. People, of course, know that. Even in the last CPI report, Consumer Price Index report, you still saw prices for categories like shelter, rent, for example, the cost to put a roof over your head, that still continues to go up. That's going to take some time. Food prices, grocery price, those are still going up. And so even though most people by and large, at least according to the data, are meaningfully employed, you still have to go to the grocery store and eat, and it's more expensive. You still have to put a roof over your head, and it's still expensive.On the bright side, though, gas prices, about $3 a gallon right now on average. That's lower than it was a month ago. That's lower than it was a year ago. And so that's helping. But I think until inflation is really in the rearview, until people don't feel like, gosh, it's so expensive to buy most things, it's still going to be that disconnect.",

Two, I was thinking when we were - kept going through research before this segment, I'm very -- can't wait to watch it. This flight was part of your work routine. You said, though, that on that day something felt off. PAM SEAGLE, PASSENGER, FLIGHT 1549: Yes, it was -- so you have to remember, this was the height of the financial crisis. I worked for Bank of America. We were merging with what was then Merrill Lynch. And you flew up every Sunday or Monday, you came up to New York from Charlotte. You worked three or four days and then you went back. So, this was routine. This was something that I was doing every day for the past three or four months. But on that Sunday night, prior to this flight, I had a dream. And in this dream I'm standing - I'm on a bank of water - I don't know if it's a river or it's a lake, but I'm standing on the water and I watch a plane go down. And it was frightening. And it woke me up. And I told my husband about it and I said, I don't - I don't know if I can get on that flight tomorrow morning, that Monday morning. Got to Charlotte airport and this is - you still had paper tickets. You know, you didn't have digital. I walked to the gate. And I got there and I handed - and I pulled it back. I couldn't do it. I was just too frightened to actually get on that flight. So, I went back home and I was convinced that I was going to turn on the news, probably CNN, and watch that this plane had gone down. And it didn't. So, Tuesday morning, yes, I felt a little bit foolish, but got back, resumed my travel schedule, flew back up to New York on that Tuesday. And so everything seemed fine other than that was still kind of lingering, this feeling. And then the other thing that was a little odd and off that day was that everyone knew that flight. So, when you did that -- that routine, it was the same thing all the time. You went to the same gate. You kind of sat in the same space. You ate at the same restaurant. And they moved the gate. And I know gates get moved all the time. But for those of us where it was very routine, that was off. That was odd. We had a delay, and they moved us to a gate.
