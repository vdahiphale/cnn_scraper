You've got Japan, all enclosing the Sea of Japan. And where that earthquake, the magnitude 7.5, occurred, that water is going to propagate all -- in all directions. And instead of having an entire Pacific Ocean to absorb that energy, it's going to be bounced around, sloshed around across the Sea of Japan, or the East China Sea, depending on where you're located. And I just want to bring up the video of the water pushing up thecanal because that was particularly interesting to me. What you're seeing there is what we're trying to stress home to people is that a tsunami is not necessarily one wave that takes out infrastructure or reaches the coastline. It is a series of waves. It is a surge of water. And sometimes the crest tines (ph), that's the wave crest between the highest waves to the second highest waves can be anywhere from 5 minutes to upwards of an hour. So, the threat is not over, especially for the near shoreline near the epicenter and also across that Sea of Japan, or East China Sea, depending on where you're located. So, that's really important. Just think about what happens during an underwater earthquake. It literally can cause a displacement of the ocean or the sea. And so that displacement is transpired into a wave at the surface. And that expert, Max, that you were talking about, I heard him speak about this because I haven't seen this information, but hearing it from the expert himself, the offshore buoys were registering a 1 meter tsunami. And that transpires to a larger wave once it reaches the coastline. It's all about the bathymetry, which is the shape of the coastline that can alter that wave height as it gets closer and closer to the coast, because as that nature of the shoreline edges closer and closer towards where people live, the population density, that water has nowhere to go but up. And that can cause larger waves. And that is why the Japan Meteorological Agency, for instance, and its initial suggestion around this potential tsunami wave of upwards of 16 feet or 5 meters. That is why they have issued a major tsunami warning. That is for the Ishikawa prefecture, right there, that shading of purple we have highlighted near that little peninsula that sticks out on the west side of the country of Japan. Yes, that is significant because it hasn't been issued since that devastating tsunami that occurred in 2011 claiming over 20,000 people's lives. So, we have seen reports of official tsunami wave heights of roughly 5 feet or 1.2 meters. That's in the Ishikawa prefecture as well. But the potential still exists, Max, for large tsunami waves to occur basin- wide, that is across the Sea of Japan or East China Sea, because of the nature of this shallow earthquake and how powerful it was.

Her pitch, core to her pitch is that she can beat President Biden in a general election and is the best person in the field situated to do so. So, I expect here, in the closing days, before we get to Iowa, where she has said she has to do well, but not necessarily win. More hope for her in New Hampshire where she has said that electability is so key. And I expect that to continue to be really core to her pitch to voters, Max.",

And we did hear and see from \"Axios\" reporting the other day about Hamas telling Qatari mediators that in principal they have agreed to resume talks that could lead to up to 40 of those 100 plus hostages being released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails, in exchange also, of course, for a pause in fighting of up to a month in length. So, things do seem to be moving in the direction of talks that could lead to another truce and hostages being released, but it's still far from a done deal, even that they will get to the situation of having talks, let alone agreeing on another truce that could see some or all of those hostages freed, Max.",
