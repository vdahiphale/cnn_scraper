Well, more school districts are trying it out. 24 states have at least one schooldistrict using a shortened week, some 850 districts and all. That`s a 31% increase since 2019. Shorter weeks can help schools with budgetary constraints, staff shortages and student attendance. That flexibility can increase teacher morale, and decrease burnout in the classroom. Four-day weeks have traditionally been more common in rural areas. Now, they`re gaining steam in metro areas like Denver, Phoenix and San Antonio as well. But research shows there are drawbacks to a shortened school week. One study found lower math achievement in some districts a four-day weeks, but the ill effects vanished in districts with longer school days. A second study found higher absenteeism and lower on time graduation rates compared with five days students. Shorter school weeks can also be heading for parents costing families an extra $5,000 to $9,000 a year in childcare as more school districts shorten the week, you can expect to hear more about this debate.

El Nino, Spanish for the little boy is this irregular weather pattern that occurs in the Pacific Ocean. Sticking to our returning theme this summer brought back some really warm temperatures in many parts of the country. The summer of 2023 and parts of the nation has seen record high temperatures at times and some projections say we could see a new record for the warmest year ever recorded. A big reason, weather models are showing one of the strongest El Ninos in decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA announced the presence of those El Nino conditions on June 8. Years where El Ninos are present tend to be hotter as warm ocean waters that originate in the Pacific Ocean can influence global weather patterns. These events happen every two to seven years and they vary in intensity. Scientists are still searching for why this happens but the pattern can last for weeks or months. More now from meteorologist Jennifer Gray, mom of one of our very own CNN tenor`s Caden, we see you Caden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We`ve heard so much talk about El Nino. But what is it? In fact it`s a weather phenomenon that happens between thePacific ocean and the atmosphere. It can have an influence on the temperature and the weather all over the world. In the springtime, the trade winds start to relax and in a normal year they come back during the Asia monsoon in the summer. During an El Nino year, they don`t. In fact, some years, the trade winds can even reverse that has a huge impact on the Pacific Ocean. During a normal year, warm water is pooled on the west side of the ocean, cooler water on the east side. That results in cooler waters off the coast of California and warmer waters in the western Pacific. During an El Nino year, that thermocline tilt goes away and so warm water is spilled all the way over to the east side of the Pacific that increases convection, it also brings thunderstorms to the coast of California and droughts to the western side of the Pacific. We all know that El Nino will impact the world. The only question is, how will it affect you? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Major companies are asking remote workers tocome on back as many as 1 million U.S. workers are facing return orders. Even zoom, the company that powered remote working for millions is asking its employees to get on back to the cubicle. But even with all these changing mandates, the traditional office space isn`t what it used to be. Once these buildings and skyscrapers were full of busy workers, now after the pandemic, less than 50% of office workers are going back in person. And that`s a problem for the people that own these buildings as you can imagine, without as many tenants to pay rent many of these landlords are having to get creative. Our CNN Business and Politics Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: There statuesque, vast and staggering and their empty, skyscrapers and office buildings, one stacked high with businesses are experiencing high vacancy rates in the U.S. nearly 19%, 5.5% higher than before the pandemic. The pandemic emptied offices around the country, today the number of people returning to in- person work is less than 50% in 10 major metro areas, forcing companies to rethink physical office space. Half of the biggest global companies say they`ll need less real estate in the next three years, leaving landlords with loans to pay in a bind. Steven Durels runs the leasing at SL Green, New York City`s largest commercial landlord with more than 30 million square feet of space to rent, the collapsing demand for office space means their tenant vacancy rate shot up from 3% pre-pandemic to 10% today that calls for some creativity.
