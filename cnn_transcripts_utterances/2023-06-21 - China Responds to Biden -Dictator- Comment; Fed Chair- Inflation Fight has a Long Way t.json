And just ahead on today's show, rescuershere banging sounds that may be coming from the missing Titanic Submersible, raising hope now that the five people on board could still be found alive. And they may have just one day's worth of oxygen left the very latest on the desperate search in the Atlantic coming up. Plus, rebuilding Ukraine a Summit underway in London plotting post war reconstruction U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing more than a billion dollars of additional U.S. assistance. We'll take you there. And Powell pronouncements the U.S. Fed Chair is set to brief Congress on the state of the American economy next hour. Powell was saying in his prepared statement that getting inflation down to the 2 percent target still has a long way to go. And as traders await Powell's testimony U.S. Futures are lower across the board red arrows across the board there U.S. stocks lost ground Tuesday as well, with the S&amp;P down half a percent. And as we can see Europe is also softer new numbers show UK prices rising 8.7 percent year-over-year in May. That's unchanged from April but firmly above expectations the numbers now giving the Bank of England new ammunition to raise rates again at its policy meeting tomorrow and a rough session for Chinese Stocks the SHANGHAI COMPOSITE and the HANG SENG down both more than 1.5 percent around 1.5 percent. A lot of news to get through today but let's begin with a life or death rescue mission in the Atlantic; the search really ramping up this hour with more vessels headed to the area after those banging sounds were heard. That's according to a U.S. government memo. And the U.S. Coast Guard says that a Canadian military plane also picked up underwater noises in the search area, the submersible with five people on board but missing on Sunday while exploring the wreck of the Titanic. CNN's Paula Newton has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A sound of hope in the search and rescue of the missing submersible with five people on board according to an internal U.S. government memo, sonar picked up banging sounds underneath the water Tuesday at 30 minute intervals.",

And turning now to Ukraine,Ukraine says that its top priority is to exhaust Russian forces before the main strike of the counter offensive, which is said to still be ahead. They're doing that by targeting Russian artillery and armed systems. Officials in Kyiv say that Moscow is hemorrhaging military resources on the front lines. But Russia claims that they will stop Ukraine's advances. Now as Ukraine prepares for even tougher battles ahead its allies are already looking toward reconstruction. And the Ukraine Recovery Conference is underway in London as we speak. And that's where we find CNN's Nic Robertson. Nic, you know, Zelenskyy not exactly known to be shy about asking for what they need, which include more aid. I do believe he spoke virtually, what are some of the big takeaways so far on day one?",

And that means reforms in Ukraine's government institutions to get away from corruption. There was praise for President Zelenskyy in some of the reforms that have happened. And President Zelenskyy himself spoke about the reasons to invest. He spoke about Ukraine being responsible for agricultural products reaching more than 600 million people around the world. But Ukraine had a future as a green energy provider, not just for itself, but for other countries in Europe as well. So he painted a picture of the Ukraine that was worth investing in, but one that they would be that private investors would be able to invest in, because it's one that's getting rid of corruption. And he talked about how that's being done with new digital tools for customs controls. And that was something echoed by Secretary of State -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said the U.S., is providing $100 million, some of which that particular pot of funding would go specifically into that digitization of the customs process to avoid corruption. I think perhaps the other big takeaways were the number of businessmen that showed up and the support we heard from Richard Branson, the virgin boss spoke to the combined people attending the conference, more than 400 different businessmen according the British government had pledged to support this rebuilding Ukraine effort. And perhaps the key to achieving that was outlined but not the details of - - it was outlined by the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said, there will be a war insurance framework, an insurance framework that will give businesses perhaps a better, you know, a better sense that their money invested in Ukraine while the war still going on. That money all won't be lost. Of course, that's the sort of thing that business looks at, they want certainty. They don't want an ongoing war. So perhaps these insurance frameworks that the Prime Minister was talking about can help with that.",

But it does raise the question of whether this is going to impact or potentially up end those efforts to ease tensions between the two countries. Now, the President's comments were similar in some respects to something he had said just on Saturday when he said that the Chinese spy balloon incident was embarrassing for China's leadership. But he went one step further in those fundraisers as he specifically likened Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictators. Now the President often in these types of venues, these off camera fundraisers does tend to speak a bit more candidly and freely, including weighing in on Foreign Affairs. And that's something that we simply saw play out last night, as he spoke at that California fundraiser. And as you mentioned, this has already prompted a fierce response from the Chinese who have accused the President of engaging in open political provocation. Now, this all follows a recent visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China to try to ease some of the rising tensions between the two countries following that Chinese spy balloon incident following these close military calls that have been seen between the U.S. and China. Officials after that meeting, I had noted that they were constructive. The discussions did lead to some progress in that diplomatic relations. The question now is how this might impact that relationship going forward. The President himself had predicted that there would be a thought very soon between the U.S. and China regarding their relations, but this simply throws another wrinkle another wrench into an already tense relationship.",

We're told to expect deliverables when it comes to the defense cooperation as well as technology space. But this visit is also playing out as there are very serious human rights concerns. About Modi's time in office in India, the White House has faced some criticism from human rights groups for the decision to host him with a state visit with a lavish a state dinner. But simply put, the White House has called this one of the defining relationships of the 21st century and they are hoping that with this visit, they will further deepen their cooperation with India even as there are concerns about human rights and democracy in that country.",

Because if the Fed is saying that, you know, inflation is still too high, and there's still more work to be done, and rates will need to keep rising. Then why did they pause last week and the Fed Chief is going to say we've seen his testimony. He's going to say, frankly, that they want to pause to assess the leg times that remember, it can take a year, but it's uncertain exactly how long the leg will be for some of this hiking to get into the economy. And also, they want to look at the headwinds from the credit tightening that would be the banking sector, right? So he's saying the banking sector is still resilient and strong, but that they took the appropriate actions to prop it up left in March, actually, when those three banks failed. So a lot here to go through, but I think there are two quotes that I think that are really important here. First, nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. So more rate hikes are coming. And the reason the number one reason inflation pressures continue to run high. He says he will tell Congress, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. So that's I think, the inner Hawk of Jerome Powell shining through in his testimony here. You know, Democrats are going to probably be concerned and raised concerns about going overdoing it here and specifically hurting the job market. And I think you'll probably hear from Republicans about the banking sector. So there's a lot to parse and to question the Fed Chief about when he begins this testimony in just over half an hour.",

And he says labor demand is still far outpaces labor supply. But he is pointing out that some of those wage pressures are starting to come off. And the job market may be slowly cooling a little bit here.

DIK BARTON, FORMER DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AT RMS TITANIC INC.: Yes, hi Rahel, it's obviously encouraging, we have to be optimistic, we have to be upbeat, and everything else must really just be focused on the on the actual rescue event. Buying of course is a submarine his way of communicating literacy. It was done by the USS Arizona, in Pearl Harbor and on the Russian submarines on the Kursk. So, noise travels well through water. I think the only word of caution really, apart from the fact that sick stopped is that they're the oceans are busy places a lot of activity down that part of a mammal and marine life. There's also been a cabling and vessel activity. So we need to be quite cautious on what we're interpreting here.",

Last the equivalent of two adult elephants balancing your thumbnail to put it into context. Risk is high you have to have an appetite for risk.

Premium class travel is recovering faster than in other parts of the plane. And that's not just down to business travelers. Leisure customers are increasingly prepared to splash out. With Air France, KLM saying they have an unwavering willingness to travel. Other airlines are noticing too, Finnair launched a brand new business class cabin last year.

Now tourists have been coming here for centuries, but experts say that it's the next few decades that could decide the future of travel. SEBASTIAN (voice over): The Tourism Foundation says big changes are needed to meet the emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Its report calls for major investments in cleaner modes of travel, like rail and electric cars, temporary caps on long haul flights, and closer tracking of how tourism affects our environment.

And then theother option is very expensive train travel. Who are we to say that you should do one and not the other? So we've need to change the way that the system works, so that it just becomes the most obvious option to take the least damaging holiday. SEBASTIAN (on camera): Well, in theory, it shouldn't be too hard to convince tourists to take more trips closer to home, there are nice places to eat and drink. There's rich history and weather's not too bad for the late spring. But the real question is how do you break those habits that have formed over generations and really have people rethink how they travel? SEBASTIAN (voice over): One group says trips further field can still be sustainable, much better adventures as a tour company that designs holidays with the environment in mind, donating 5 percent of its revenues to conservation projects, in urging travelers to interact directly with local communities. Rafting trips in Albania, for example, on a river once threatened by industrial development. ALEX NARRACOTT, FOUNDER &amp; CEO OF MUCH BETTER ADVENTURES: We recognize that it's unrealistic that no one's ever going to fly. So if you will do flight, it's all about making sure when they get there at counting. It's maximizing the benefits that have a community, maximizing the benefits to the local environment. The tourist dollar, the money we're spending can have a huge impact on conservation of our natural world. Tourism is one of the best ways we could achieve that, actually. SEBASTIAN (on camera): Are you optimistic that the travel community will step up though to this moment will really make this change?",
