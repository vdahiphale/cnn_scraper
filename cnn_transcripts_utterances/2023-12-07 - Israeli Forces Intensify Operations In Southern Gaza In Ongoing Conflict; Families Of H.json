      "sentences": "Yeah, Boris, Brianna, so this is an expert witness, the final expert witness that Trump's team has called in their defense. He's an accounting professor from New York University, Professor Eli Bartov. And he was asked questions, you know, he's been testifying all morning on this. And a lawyer for the Attorney General's office objected to one of these lines of questioning, saying that the accounting professor is not a banker, and so he's not qualified to answer questions about what a banker might be thinking when they received the financial statements at the heart of this case.And that is when Bartov became upset, saying shame on yourself talking to me like that. You make up allegations. I'm here to tell the truth. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Now, Bartov had previously testified this morning that he found that there was no evidence of accounting fraud, and he said that the financial statements were not materially or any in a meaningful way misstated. So, the strongest evidence that Trump's side has put forward in the most kind of clear, common light. language to explain to the judge their position that these financial statements were not inflated. Now, the judge has already found that the financial statements are fraudulent, saying that Trump and the other defendants did commit persistent and repeated fraud by inflating the value of their properties on these assets. Bartov is Trump's strongest defense against that. They're also playing not only for this judge, but also for an appeal in this case, which they have made clear they are laying the record throughout this trial to do just that. So Bartov will pick up testimony in just a few moments. He'll be back on the witness stand. They are still on direct examination, meaning Trump's lawyers are the ones asking the questions. When that wraps, then there will be cross- examination by the attorney general's office. It's not clear how long they will do that today, but his testimony is certainly one of the stronger, clearest, most coherent pieces of evidence for Trump's side so far in their defense that there was no intent to defraud anybody. Bartov testifying that he did see that there were errors on these financial statements, but he said, he didn't believe that they were fraudulent. Brianna, Boris.",

Yesterday, the Israeli prime minister said that Israeli forces had surrounded his home, although there's no indication that he is actually there.Instead, he is believed to be underground. But the Israeli military is targeting key Hamas commanders. They announced just today that two senior Hamas members were killed in a strike on an intelligence facility, as well as five out of 11 members of Hamas's northern brigade, who were seen in a picture in an underground tunnel, that they were killed in a strike on that underground infrastructure by Hamas. And even as the Israeli military is pushing deeper into southern Gaza, not only with troops on the ground, but also with airstrikes on several key cities. There are also still battles raging behind me right now in Northern Gaza. We have heard all evening the sounds of outgoing artillery fire, machine gun fire as well.
