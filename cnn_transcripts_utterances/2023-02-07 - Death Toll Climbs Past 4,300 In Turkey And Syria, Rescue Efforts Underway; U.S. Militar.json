The global effort to find survivors and care for the wounded and homeless as Turkey and Syria both struggle in the wake of Monday's powerful quake. Troop call-up. Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia is set to mobilize half a million troops within months. And the balloon incursion, the Biden administration under fire from Republicans demanding why it took so long to shoot down what was almost certainly a spy balloon sent by China. At this hour, the search for survivors goes on, the death toll keeps rising rapidly in both Turkey and Syria after the region was rocked by the biggest earthquake in almost a century. Officials have confirmed more than 4,300 dead in both countries. The World Health Organization is warning that number could increase by eight fold. Aftershocks from Monday 7.8 earthquake continue to rattle the region bringing down already damaged buildings. Early estimates from the Turkish Government put the number of destroyed buildings at almost 7,000. Adding misery to desperation, winter weather hampering rescue efforts and survivors now are left on the streets in the cold rain and snow. Witnesses in northwest Syria describe the scene as terrifying. The U.N. says nearly 12 years of civil war have left more than four million people there dependent on humanitarian assistance. Still, rescue workers push ahead pulling survivors from the rubble. Devastation from the quake spreads across both Turkey and Syria hundreds of miles from the epicenter and amid all that destruction and death there are moments of hope like we just saw of survivors are pulled from an eighth mountains of debris. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has been covering this story from Istanbul and a warning, her reporting contains some graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Flattened in seconds, moments later, two aftershocks. A Turkish T.V. crew reporting live during the makings of an apocalyptic scene. The reporter grabbing a young girl as the rubble and smoke settles around them. Rescue efforts beginning immediately. In Southern Turkey a young man trapped desperation in his eyes, then in the pre-Dawn darkness a moment of joy. Hauled from the wreckage. This was a residential building full of families asleep in their homes when the massive earthquake struck. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I was sleeping when my wife suddenly woke me up.

What's the latest word from Beijing?KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): China insists it was a civilian vessel that somehow blew off course but we heard from the U.S. State Department overnight saying that that explanation rings hollow and that it was used for spy craft. [00:20:02] We also heard from the White House saying that the debris revealed that the Chinese balloon had a propeller. It also had an aerial rudder which gave it limited maneuverability. When the U.S. shot down the Chinese balloon with the U.S. fighter jet. China condemned that, you know, saying it was an overreaction. We also heard earlier from China, saying that it reserves the right to deal with a similar situation but didn't elaborate exactly what that meant. But I want to share with you a very revealing statement that came out on Monday from the vice foreign minister who basically blamed the U.S. handling of the Chinese balloon for further fracturing the U.S.-China relationship. Let's bring up the statement for you. This is according to Xie Feng, the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister who said \"What the United States has done severely impacted and undermined the efforts and progress made by the two sides to stabilize China-U.S. relations since the two countries leaders met in Bali, Indonesia\". The Chinese balloon caused a political uproar. It also caused you a Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel his planned February visit to Beijing. According to the White House, the balloon was not used for meteorological purposes. And also according to the White House, and this was very interesting to hear this overnight. They also said that the U.S. approach to relations with China will remain calm. I'm going to show you this statement from the U.S. White House press secretary that came in overnight. She said \"It's up to China to figure out what kind of relationship they want\". Kind of putting the ball in Beijing's court as to how things will proceed from here. The White House says that Blinken will reschedule his visit to Beijing, but only when the time is right, back to you.",

Even so, Ukraine's Security Council chief says his country is ready. We're concerned he says but I would stress that we are preparing together with our partners, good preparations are being made now. So, if the Russian offensive begins, it will be unsuccessful.

Unfortunately, in the meantime, we're losing our people while fighting for our independence.

The UAE and Qatar are going to be sending field hospitals to the ground. Again, we're talking about a delay in terms of timing. But teams, from what we hear, are working as quickly as possible to get deployed into Turkey. Spain, Iraq, Pakistan, neighboring Greece also sending teams. We've heard of actual first responders going on the ground and then, importantly, those rescue dogs. Equipment will be critical and vital in putting people out of the rubble. Now if we had to look at what the international community is saying, the big fear is, John, that there's going to be a further loss of life. Injured people, sitting almost at 16,000.

So they were going to have to cancel this meeting. The timing was atrocious now. They're going to need to find a way to get back to rescheduling it, but they're not starting off very well. The incoming Chinese ambassadors just demanded that we compensate the Chinese government for the cost of blowing up the balloon. That's not going to happen.

What we're finding out from the commander of the North American Command today is that we have not been able to see, and have not been looking for, balloons.And so this entire fleet of surveillance balloons that China's been ramping up over the last decade, has largely been missed. That may certainly be a proper issue for investigation and discussion, both with Congress and within the Pentagon. I think taking it down safely, not waiting for it to go over water, off the coast of South Carolina, so I think that probably was the correct call at that point. And then finally, the investigations are going to be about not just what the reaction of shooting it down and when we are going to shoot it down, but really whether we're properly set up for air missile defenses to set up and look for balloons, not just high-speed missiles. To look for drones. To look for the kind of direct trajectories and approaches that an adversary might want to take for intelligence. But also for, possibly, delivering military arms. Maybe electronic jamming or unleashing drones. In 2018, indeed, there was a hypersonic test on a PLA surveillance drone so they could be using these to deliver weapons in the future. Not that they're going to do this, but this -- these could be part of the military operational plans that the PLA is working up.",

It could pick up things that you're not picking up in space. They're also trying to gather intelligence about our defense and our detection, and a reaction.

John, the rain and the snow is starting to wind down, which is great.Now behind the front, behind this area of low pressure that's pretty dominant at the moment, it gets really cold. In fact, we're coming into the coldest part of the year for Syria and Turkey, where temperatures at this point in time, in Aleppo, at two degrees.  So we're near freezing this morning. Unfortunately, the colder weather is going to continue in the upcoming days, so there's that area of low pressure. Still quite a bit of moisture with it, but as the skies start to clear, that's when it becomes a problem, because all of that warmer air escapes right back up into the atmosphere, and we cool it right back down. Especially through the overnight hours, which we're experiencing this morning. There is leftover rain and snow, of course, for the colder areas. You see how scattered it gets here in the upcoming days, the next 48 hours. We clear out the skies. And that's why we're about to get much colder. So temperatures, you'll watch the blue set in here, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. All that cold air sets in with the Northerly winds. So it gets frigid. Again, we're coming into the colder parts of the year here. Look at Aleppo, dropping below zero Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And this, of course, as we are trying to clean up and as people cannot get back into their homes. Many are left homeless. So just remember, if you can, bundle up. That's the biggest thing, especially as we drop below freezing in the coming days. High temperatures, expect them to be around eight degrees in Aleppo all the way through the next 72 to -- 72 hours, rather. Of course, that 7.8 magnitude, that's the epicenter where you're seeing that red dot that occurred February 6, roughly 4:17 in the morning. But there was a series of aftershocks that continued on, and that's going to be the problem here in the upcoming day, especially, you know, here in the upcoming hours. We're still very scared about this whole issue, so then we have to just keep that in mind, as many -- If you do have a home left over, if you try to get back in it, it's just very dangerous and very scary.
