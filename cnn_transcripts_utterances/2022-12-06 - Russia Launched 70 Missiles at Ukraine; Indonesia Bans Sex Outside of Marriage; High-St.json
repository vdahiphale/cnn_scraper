There's been no official response from Ukraine's government. If Ukraine is responsible, it would mark a significant failure of Russian defense systems more than nine months into the war. The latest explosion happened early Tuesday at an airfield in the Kursk region, about 90 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, inspired to fire at the airfield and cause the cancellation of classes in nearby schools. Russia says two other drone attacks happened Monday one of them killing three Russian soldiers at a base in Angles hundreds of kilometers inside Russian territory. Afterwards, Russia launched 17 missiles that Ukraine, with Ukraine claiming its shot down 60 of them. I want to bring in our Nick Paton Walsh, who joins us now from London. Good to have you with us, Nick! So these deadly drone strikes kidding deep inside Russia, one getting remarkably close to Moscow. Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility. What more can you tell us about these attacks?",

One in Ryazan and one in Saratov as you can see on the map there. Now, it is unclear quite exactly how this happened? Ukraine has not officially claimed this, Russia's Ministry of Defense has pointed towards Soviet made unmanned drones as being behind these particular attacks. And we've also heard from a Ukrainian drone company recently talking about the increased range of their newer products. So all is pointing towards potentially Ukrainian drones being behind this, although Ukraine, as I say is retain that ambiguity, that deniability, even a Ukrainian presidential adviser talking cryptically about how if missiles fly from Russia towards Ukraine, Russia might expect to see things flying back at it. I paraphrase there, but it is certainly a sign I think of the changing dynamics here. If they're able to hit Rayzan and Saratov of like this, there are some analysts saying well, is Moscow, potentially a now a target within Ukrainian range? And it also begs the question, what does Russia actually have left in its arsenal? That's not the catastrophic nuclear parts of it to throw back at Ukraine, but it's not already using. So a startling development certainly, indeed, because it essentially shatters the idea perhaps some of the Russian military held that they could continue to bombard Ukraine from deep inside Russian territory and not seeing Ukrainian response there, Lynda?",

That's a significant change because it adds to the compound damage done to Russia's military reputation, since they effectively failed to take Ukraine and the three detainees in 10 day window which they initially seem to have thought was entirely possible back in February. And as we slowly see that erosion of Russia's military standing in the area, you'll see meetings in the Kremlin brought forwards like that Putin and his entourage trying to suggest that might be some sort of reaction he's able to give. We have in the past seen, potentially, the damage to the bridge between Russian Mainland and Crimea, some arguing may have led to some of the strikes that were hit Ukrainian infrastructure targets a number of weeks ago now that some suggest perhaps those strikes were planned way in advance. But it certainly begs the question, what can Russia do in response? And many observers say, well, it's done all that it possibly can using conventional arms, there's very little to booze, it hasn't already broken hitting hospitals, shelters might with the word children or anything in Ukraine civilian infrastructure to turn the power off. And so we're into an uncertain time here now where Russia either has to just take it this new Ukrainian capability as it seems to be, or find some other way of responding Lynda.",

We've seen it in infrastructure attacks and attacks against civilians across the country. But there's been a significant drop off of those in the past weeks, and Ukrainian officials have suggested perhaps Russia has indeed run out of its initial supply of Iranian drones. Now, that was again confirmed by some Western officials today. They say they believe that they have run out. They believe that Russia is looking for a resupply, but they're not clear exactly how or if that's necessarily going to occur? And just to add to that, as well, Lynda, those same Western officials believe that Russia has not managed at this point to get ballistic missiles from Iran.

Now for Vladimir Putin the Orthodox Church is absolutely central to his vision of the Russian world. For some Russians, though, that's a world they don't want to live in. Indeed, they don't want it to survive. KILEY (voice over): Ukraine's Orthodox Church broke with Moscow three years ago.

And, of course, this is extremely worrying for those both inside Iran continuing to take part in those protests. You mentioned that strike fairly widely observed, as far as we can tell through geo location are those videos showing shots, closed shops across the country. That protest continues to keep that momentum even as Iran waits to hear whether or not there will be any concessions over the wearing of the hijab? There has been a new development of this afternoon; I'd like to draw your attention to a tweet that's come from the leading Sunni Cleric in Iran. And that refers in fact, to those abuses that we've been seeing in so many Iranian detention centers CNN, of course, has been widely reporting on some of those abuses, not just for women, but of boys and men, as well. Here is what the leading Sunni Cleric in Iran is saying news about the sexual assault of female prisoners with the intention of humiliating suppressing and forcing them for confessions have been reported in the media and some prisoners accounts confirmed this going on to say that if proven the biggest corrupters on Earth are the perpetrators of these crimes, referring of course, that very charged that five more people have been sentenced to death on today. So I think it's an important reminder of the fact that the pressure continues to be maintained on the regime, that someone as prominent as Cleric, who leads the Friday prayers in one of those cities has been so marked by some of the protests, but also by the violent crackdowns shows, I think it reminds us as we've seen, with so many people joining these protests online with tweets on Instagram or in the streets, that so much of the fear on which the regime had based its power and control seems to be dissipating. And I think the day tomorrow, that Student Day, which marks the death in 1953 of three students, by the security forces of the Shah that is marked every year by protest by more calls for democratic reform.

So I'm not going to forecast anything yet, but at the moment, it's even Steven. And you've referenced the later game coming up against or rather between Portugal and Switzerland. You know, once again, the build up to that game has just been dominated by Cristiano Ronaldo. Is he going to Saudi Arabia? Is he not? No one really knows there are reports out there of deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And none of that confirmed. This is going to be a really, really interesting match though, because the Portuguese qualified for this stage after only two games, meaning they can rest a lot of their players where Switzerland came through a bruising encounter with Serbia in order to make it this far. And we're about to learn whether or not that took any kind of toll on the team. And while we're discussing Ronaldo, would you believe in his Fifth World Cup, he hasn't yet scored a goal in the knockout round of this tournament. And we used to say the same about Diego Maradona who has only just a certain not Maradona, Lionel Messi, who has only just scored his first knockout goal. And Messi and Ronaldo always tend to do kind of things and reach milestone points in their career at pretty much the same time often in the same week.

Today what's going to be really interesting to watch out for is whether or not Governor Brian Kemp, the Republican Governor, who, you know handily won the election his reelection, he is now out campaigning for Herschel Walker.

Correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh was shot in the head while covering an Israeli raid in the West Bank back in May. Al Jazeera says it's has evidence that she and her team were deliberately targeted, something Israel has repeatedly denied. The network is asking The Hague to investigate if the circumstances around her death constitute a war crime. Well, Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem with more on this. And Hadas, the Israel initially said that she was killed in crossfire then they then concluded that she probably died after being shot by its own military, but that it was unintentional. Well, Al Jazeera claims that this was intentional. What evidence does it have?",

It's actually the second case because the Abu Akleh family has also filed their own case with the International Criminal Court, but they are filing the Al Jazeera case in conjunction with them together. Now Al Jazeera says they have conducted their own long term fact-finding mission that they believe based off of they say new eyewitness testimony as well as video footage that Shireen Abu Akleh was they say intentionally targeted when she died while covering that Israeli military right in Jenin in the West Bank in May. They also say as part of this filing that they believe that this was part of a wider campaign; they say to target and silence Al Jazeera. This is a claim that Israel has repeatedly denied. Now Lina Abu Akleh, who was the niece of Shireen Abu Akleh was at The Hague today and she's calling on the International Criminal Court she says to take some action on this case, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINA ABU AKLEH, SHIREEN ABU AKLEH'S NIECE: I'm here today on behalf of my family. Because months after multiple requests have been submitted to the ICC, the court has still not taking meaningful action towards accountability. When individual states are unwilling or incapable of investigating their own atrocities, as in the case with Israel, it is the responsibility of the international community to intervene to ensure war crimes don't get unpunished.

And that'sbecause Israel and actually also the United States are not parties and do not recognize the International Criminal Court. So that's even if they take the case. Now, Israel did conduct its own investigation into what happened. And what they found is they believe it's most likely that an Israeli soldier was the one who fired the fatal shot but that he did so unintentionally without recognizing that Shireen Abu Akleh and her colleagues were members of the media. This is despite the fact that they were wearing those protective vests and helmets and the vests say a press on both the front and the back. Now Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid has said that they will not allow a foreign body to investigate their military. He said in a statement today, no one will investigate IDF soldiers and no one will preach to us about morals in warfare certainly not Al Jazeera, he said, Lynda.",

So how is Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace likely to respond? Well, we'll have to wait and see under the queen as Monique. They will tend to hold back and allow these accusations to sit as they did after the infamous Oprah Winfrey interview. But this time King Charles is in control and Prince William has been elevated to the Prince of Wales. So they may feel a need to respond this time. If there are major accusations which the monarchy feels it needs to address within this Documentary series, six parts of it, three parts of it dropping on Thursday. We will see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex out and about before then they are in New York to receive a prestigious Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. The cameras will be out in force capturing this moment before the landing of the big Documentary series. Max Foster, CNN, London.",
