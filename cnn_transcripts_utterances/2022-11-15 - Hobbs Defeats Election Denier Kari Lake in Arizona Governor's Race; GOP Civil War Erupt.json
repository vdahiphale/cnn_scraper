Now, that tweet is trying to disparage the election process, a process that here in Maricopa County is continuing regardless of what she says. There are still 5,000 to 15,000 votes yet to be counted. Those votes are going to be cured, they're going to be counted, every last vote, promised election officials, will indeed be counted. But it is not enough for her to catch up, and in part because Republicans and independents rejected her. Lake thought she could win without moderates and we heard from a lot of moderates last night shortly after that projection.

Congressman Andy Biggs from Arizona has said he's going to run against McCarthy. But here's what we know. McCarthy still poised to win this election today to be leader of the House GOP. He needs only a simple majority, Kaitlan. He will need 218 in January. But it's worth noting if you look back in history, Pelosi didn't have 218. She went on to become speaker in 2018. Paul Ryan had the simple majority, didn't have 218 but went on to become House speaker in 2015. So, there is precedent for this.",

He said, of course. So, I think, that was very much intentional and very much on purpose. This feed though just really spilling out into the open and there is just a lot of blame right now for why Republicans didn't deliver the way they thought they would, why they don't control the Senate.

Other officials in the U.S. administration are saying that's really not our place in the U.S. or in the White House to be dictating to Ukrainians what the terms should look like or when they should sit down.Ukraine right now understandably is not in the mood to negotiate. They've lost too much. They just have taken back Kherson. This is a huge strategic and symbolic humiliation for the Russians. It was the only regional capital and the largest city that they've taken since the beginning of the invasion back in February. At the same time, while you have Zelenskyy talking about D-Day saying that it's clear the trajectory of the war in the sense that the Russians can't win, President Putin also understands for his own political survival he can't lose. And so what the Russians are banking on at this stage is that they can drag out or protract this conflict as long as they can and make it as painful as they can, not just for the Ukrainians but for the western countries backing Ukraine. And as you head into the winter, as you head into a recession, they're hoping that that will sort of, you know, push the Ukrainians, that there will be more sort of Ukraine supporters in the west pushing them to go to the negotiating table.

WARDKaitlan, to underscore for our viewers. This is victory and victory, as you can see, in those scenes of jubilation, it's a beautiful thing but it's also grim, because it is also now the beginning of the sort of unpacking of the trauma, of the horrors of what happened, of people who were tortured, who were beaten. One man allegedly for just spray painting, you know, glory be to Ukraine, on a bus stop. So, the people of Kherson, many of them have lived through things that are unthinkable and they are now living in a city that has had no electricity, that probably won't have electricity for several more months.
