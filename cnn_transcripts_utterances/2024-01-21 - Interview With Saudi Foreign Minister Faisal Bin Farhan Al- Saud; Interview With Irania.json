We are in a very difficult and dangerous time in the region. That's why we are calling for de-escalation.

You know, we were already at the very unstable region unfortunately before but this continuing conflict and the continuing carnage that we're seeing, we're now at 30,000 civilian dead in Gaza, we have to find a way to stop this crisis.

You just wish they'd do it a little bit quicker and faster and not have so many collateral casualty.AL-SAUD: Fareed, unfortunately to what we're seeing is the Israelis are crushing Gaza.

I think all of the Arab states have indicated that they are willing to talk about a resolution or a solution that includes how we manage the situation in Gaza as long as it's part of a bigger picture, and what we feel is necessary is some form of credible, irreversible path to Palestinian state.

Again, as long as we're able to find a pathway towards a solution, a resolution, a pathway that means that we're not going to be here again in a year or two, then we can talk about anything.

And I think, Fareed, that's the consensus of all -- of everybody in the international community. When I talk to the Europeans, even when I, you know, what I hear from the Americans, everybody agrees that the only way to get out of the cycle of violence is to inevitably be on this path to a Palestinian state and that's absolutely necessary and that's what we're focused on.",

I'm not going to get into that discussion. I will just say that in order for the region to see true peace, to see (INAUDIBLE), real integration that delivers economic and social benefits for all of us, including Israel, is through peace, through a credible irreversible process through a Palestinian state.

We've been hearing since day one, don't escalate here. We cannot do this because we don't want to escalate there. None of the prophecies, apocalyptic prophecies of Russian retaliation proved true. Answering your first question, there are two elements which I would like to mention. The first one is obviously air defense. And air defense consists of planes, consists of missiles, consists of air defense platforms and interceptors, and electronic warfare. This is a complex -- and if we protect our sky, if we throw Russia from the sky, we will be in a much stronger position to define the time when this war ends, with the victory of Ukraine. The one who controls the sky controls the end of the war. Second, frozen assets. If we take frozen assets, Russian assets frozen in only three countries, Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland, we can repair all infrastructure damaged in Ukraine. Airports, bridges, roads, everything. If we take the $180 billion assets stored in the Euroclear in Belgium, we can have a lot of weapons. We can have a lot of recovery. We can repair hospitals, schools. Russia must pay. And we don't buy the arguments about legal constraints, about financial regulations.
