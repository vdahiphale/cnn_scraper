Today will be his fourth winning ties it up, mixing official policy with politics. We seen him going to Democratic strongholds. First, we saw him in Colorado, then, two stops in California. Today, he will be in Oregon, really touting the achievements that this administration has done, really tried to make the case for Democrats as they are just under four weeks to the midterm election, and to raise millions of dollars with Democratic candidates. Noticeably absent, though, from that West Coast string is a president's appearance in Arizona and Nevada, two states where those Senate races are very tight, and they could determine whether or not Democrats keep the Senate. Again, really limiting possibly they lose it, what President Biden could do in the next two years? And so, be really reflective of that absence is the president's poll numbers. He is unpopular right now. And so, the president, as well as his advisors, we know that he thinks that his best contribution for the midterms is him going out to those democratic strongholds and touting what this administration has done. And also really trying to draw a contrast between Democrats and Republicans. What he is sometimes labelled MAGA Republicans, and talk about what's at stake here.

Costs continue to rise in essential categories like shelter, medical care and food. The report illustrating that inflation has spread beyond volatile categories like food and energy core inflation, which strips away those two categories rose 0.6 percent In September, or 6 percent annually, that is a fresh 40-year high. The stubbornly high inflation also reflected in separate government data released on Friday. According to the retail sales report, consumer spending in September was flat compared to the month prior.

And look, I'm sure the President wishes he had a dial on his desk that he could use to bring down gas prices or the cost of eggs and milk and everything else you buy at the grocery store, he doesn't. There are some things that the administration could do kind of around the edges to help. So I'm thinking things like tariff repeal, we have tariffs on every part of a house right now. And there's a shortage of housing. We have tariffs on lots of consumer goods from China, and some inputs that are purchased abroad from elsewhere.There are a lot of problems with the immigration system that continue that they didn't begin under the Biden administration, many of which were aggravated under the Trump administration. But those are contributing to labor shortages. Some of those could be worked out. And then there's some other things like suspending some shipping restrictions that also raise the cost of sending goods around the country. But in general, it is up to the Federal Reserve, the central bank to do what it can to get price pressures under control. And it is trying. It is raising interest rates, which also imposes some pain. To be clear, we see mortgage rates going up, for example, that imposes some pain. But the goal, of course, is to cool demand. To tighten financial conditions just enough so that you get demand and supply more aligned and therefore bring down some of those pressures that are pushing prices upward.",

Again, not to say that the January 6th hearings are not important, I think they are important for setting the record straight for the future of the health of democracy, all of those critical objectives.But when it comes to what is driving voting behavior, I think you're much more likely to see voters paying attention to the prices that they're paying, whether their wages are keeping up, whether they're feeling financially strained. So whatever the other noble objectives of these hearings might be, will it affect the midterms? Probably not as much as the price people are paying at the pump.",

Last year in Louisiana, Hurricane Ida, a devastating category four storm ripped off roofs and destroyed schools. More than a year later, two schools for close to 900 students are still inoperable. And in Tennessee, 17 inches of rain fell in 24 hours flooding Waverly Elementary and junior high school. More than a year later, some students are using an auditorium with partitions for classrooms. A government study found that since 2017, more than 300 presidentially declared major disasters have occurred across all 50 states in U.S. territories with devastating effects on K through 12 schools including trauma and mental health issues, lost instructional time and financial strain.
