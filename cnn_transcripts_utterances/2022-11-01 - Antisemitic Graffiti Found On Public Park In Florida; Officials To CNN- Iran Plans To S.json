And that is actually the second time in just the last week that antisemitic messages appeared on public property in the state. The city of Weston is now offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the incident there. Joining me now is the mayor of Weston Florida, Margaret Brown, and Rabbi Adam Watstein of the B'nai Aviv synagogue in Weston. Thank you both for coming on. Mayor, do you have any leads yet on who is behind this?",

But now, since this has occurred again, we're looking so seriously at this not that we didn't before but to the extent that we're asking our entire community. As was evident yesterday, we held a press conference, including all of our religious leadership in our community, primarily. We know somebody knows something. And if you know something, say something, please come forward, let us know contact the Broward sheriff's office with information.",

How do you really stop this?ADAM WATSTEIN, RABBI, B'NAI AVIV SYNAGOGUE: So that's a great question, Kate. And again, I appreciate you having us on your program. Ultimately, I actually don't think it's my responsibility nor the Jewish community's responsibility to stop this perpetrator. What was so outlying about the press conference was exactly as our mayor just testified the three rabbis of Weston were flanked by our fellow clergy people and our political officials, none of whom are members of the Jewish community. And really, the onus of responsibility and onus of response really lies outside of our community to stop this hateful rhetoric and to stop this racist speech.",

We teach our children sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me. The Jewish people for 3300 years have never believed that. We know that toxic rhetoric will eventually lead to sticks and stones. So an educational component in the homes amongst both sides of the aisle of our politicians needs to be incorporated so that hate speech and all of its forms is mitigated so that the temperature is, as you said, turned way down. Otherwise, we will continue to be targets.",

And we're looking at racial slurs, antisemitic rhetoric, none of this is good. It's not good for any community.And when this first happened, myself and our city manager and other leadership, as well as our religious leadership, decided that we wanted to collectively present a unified force that we're not going to tolerate this. We will find this individual. And for that individual, and I stated yesterday, I'm not sure what dark hole they crawled into. And, as I stated, they have all the bravado to do this under the cloak of darkness. And I think it's cowardly. If they really felt this way, they need to come out into the light and let us know and be brave there and speak to us. I will tell you something. I'm speaking with Rabbi Watstein yesterday following this event, and we talked like what would you do if you knew this person. What I thought showed such great humanity as what he told me, if I knew the individual or the individuals, I would make personal time to sit with this individual and share who I am, share our Jewish faith, and let them get to know me, and they would find out that I'm not your enemy. And for that, I'm ever thankful to the leadership we have, the rabbinical leadership that we have here in the city of Weston for taking that kind of position of kindness, compassion, and humanity. And I think that's what really speaks for the city of Weston is just that.",

When you ask yourself the question what has Russia been targeting lately? What it's been targeting lately is the critical infrastructure of this country is its electricity grid, its water supply, its cell phone towers. Just here yesterday in Kyiv, there was a barrage of missiles that led to 80 percent of residents not having access to water, hundreds of thousands without power, and communications were extremely difficult and spotty, most of that back up now. But officials here, of course, are concerned that Russia will do that again and they simply don't have the ability to continue to repair this infrastructure over and over again.And then I have to bring up those drones, of course, Kate, because these Shahed made Iranian manufactured drones, these really turned things around a few weeks ago here in Kyiv and across the country. They were essentially used to terrorize local populations. They were loitering over homes among the victims were pregnant women. So, this could be a turn potentially in the conflict. But just the fact that Russia is turning to Iran for weapons, I think that reveals a lot, Kate.",
