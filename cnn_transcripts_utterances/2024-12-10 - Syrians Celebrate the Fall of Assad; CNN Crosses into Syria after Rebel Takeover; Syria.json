So Syrians may choose to wait a little bit more, to feel safe to go back. So it's up to what happens in Syria, which will accelerate the Syrians in Turkiye and in other countries, go back to their home towns. But this will take some time, I think, even though we have seen some people going back already. But they are not in their tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. That will take some time. As to the other issue, YPG is a terror organization. I mean, in Turkiye's, eyes, YPG is a terror organization. It is the extension of PKK in Syria and it is after its own agenda, to set up a statelike structure, an autonomous structure or whatever it is -- terror corridor, as we call it here. And Turkiye said very clearly that we will not allow that. We will not allow YPG to set up a corridor just beyond our borders. So there has been some fighting. And this is -- this also goes for the Syrian national army, the Syrian opposition, because the area, the territory is that the YPG is trying to set itself on, is Syrian territory.

It is an extraordinary moment, not only for the history that is being made as the Israeli prime minister walked into this courthouse and then began testifying in his own defense but also because of the moment at which it comes, with Israel facing a multi-front war. That was part of the reason why the Israeli prime minister sought to delay this very moment of testifying in this case, unsuccessfully though, as the judges ultimately ruled that he would have to show up to testify in his own defense, a process that could take several weeks. We expect that the prime minister will testify as many as three times a week for as long as six hours per day, initially beginning with questions from his own defense attorneys, who have been giving him a lot of running room here to make comments about foreign policy, accusations against the media, as he really tries to make his own case. But then, the more serious cross-examination will come from the prosecution. And there are three cases that are involved in the trial that the prime minister has been facing for four years now. They are Case 1,000, Case 2,000 and Case 4,000; all of them effectively boiling down to allegations of corruption that the Israeli prime minister offered favors to wealthy businessmen in exchange for more favorable media coverage or in exchange for lavish gifts. Some several hundred thousand  in champagne bottles, in jewelry and other gifts that these businessmen allegedly provided. Now the prime minister and his attorneys, of course, maintain that he is innocent and we have heard the prime minister already on the stand, making his case, defending himself against these allegations, insisting that he is innocent -- Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.

News coming in and just the latest from the Israeli Defense Forces, saying that they have destroyed Syria's naval fleet in an attempt to avert anyone, of any weapons getting into the wrong hands. What is your initial response to this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, it's quite an extraordinary situation, Eleni, and it's great to be with you. When you look at the Syrian naval fleet, it was a relatively small fleet. And we're not talking a major player in the eastern Mediterranean in terms of naval forces. However, this is significant because the Syrian navy was often used by Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, to transfer weapons from -- that originally came from Iran and then went through Syria and then were transshipped to places like Lebanon and then, of course, down to Gaza as well. Hamas also, I think, benefited from what they what they were able to transship that way. So in essence, the Syrian navy was a bit of a support force for these efforts. They also supported the Russian naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean, which still exists at Tartus. And that is, of course, significant. But the way in which the Israelis did this, it's very clear that they are trying to, in essence, zeroize, if you will, the Syrian military capability and make it a much different, more different place when it comes to the military balance of power in the northern Middle East.",

So a lot of the equipment that we see in these videos is actually originally Russian equipment that was either sold or donated to Syria over the over the last 50 years, really, of the Assad regime's rule. So from a rebel perspective, this does weaken their possible power in -- from a military sense. Now they would have some issues by taking over these installations. They would have some issues taking over the naval fleet from the previous Syrian navy because of training issues, personnel issues, loyalty issues, all of those factors.

People had hopes and they continued to live in a denial phase, hoping that they would find their beloved ones under the ground in Saydnaya prison. But in fact, also reports confirms that tens of thousands of detainees were sent to this prison but in fact, they are were only a few thousand, 3,000 or 4000 people who were there at the time when the regime collapsed. Most of the other detainees, they were either executed or buried in mass graves or transferred to other detention centers. It took us almost two days because we had to respond to every report, to follow up on every piece of information. And honestly, that was at the expense of searching in other prisons and detention centers. Five of our teams who were already overstretched, under very difficult logistical challenges on the ground, they were fully occupied at Saydnaya prison, digging the ground, searching for everything. And there were no detainees left, no hidden cells there. And yes, we could use this time to search in other areas. Now currently, our teams are already deployed to other areas because we know that there are tens of secret prisons across Syria in Al Ba'ath party centers and military bases, in private prisons held by the Kifah Moulhem (ph) groups and Hezbollah and people are still -- they still have hope. And we have to keep fighting and struggling until the last minute, because every minute counts.",
