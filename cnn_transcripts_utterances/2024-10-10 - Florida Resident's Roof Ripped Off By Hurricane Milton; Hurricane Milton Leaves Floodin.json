They had to help 135 elderly and disabled people get to safety today. But other rescues are taking place in the wake of tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Milton.Tornadoes the director of the National Hurricane Center says were quote, \"supercharged.\" Crews are digging through the rubble of decimated homes in Florida today, looking for survivors. The St. Lucie County commissioner says nine tornadoes tore through the area, killing at least five people. The total death toll from Milton right now stands at 12, although state officials are expecting that number to go up. President Biden this afternoon said it's still too early to know the full extent of the damage. CNN's Bill Weir starts off our coverage today from Pinellas County outside Tampa, where residents are dealing with the effects of two back to back hurricanes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Earth overheats, these are the kinds of storms that take lives and livelihoods, but as families, real and private grief, it's the material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County, from the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings to Tropicana Field peeled like an orange by Milton's winds, the Tampa Bay Rays already have plans in the works to build a new stadium with taxpayers kicking in hundreds of millions of dollars. But what happens now is anyone's guess, especially after the loss of entire neighborhoods, retirees and working class American Dreamers.",

WEIR: Long after all of these pieces of people's lives have been picked up, what will remain in Florida is a massive insurance crisis. In just the last couple years, dozens of different carriers have gone insolvent or stopped accepting new customers or been placed on state watch lists. So, as a result, flood insurance for a home like this can be over $20,000 a year, way more than the mortgage. So most of these families had no coverage at all. So many folks are uninsured, right?",

This church has been in this community for over 70 years. We're speaking to the pastor.He says, this is used as a school for young children. It's used as a meeting place in this community. And you can see the damage left behind after a massive tree was quite literally thrown on top of this church. He says, every time he looks at his church here, he finds more and more damage. He's lived here in Sarasota since 1963 and he's never seen anything quite like it. His son had to barricade the door of his home with his own body to keep it from flying in, to protect his wife and his two young children.

CNN is reporting a record breaking haul for the Kamala Harris campaign, which has raised 1 billion with a B dollars since the Vice President entered the race officially just in July. Despite all that cash, Democrats are far from celebrating. Instead, there's a lot of hand wringing.New Quinnipiac polls in three blue wall states show Harris and Trump still deadlocked in a tight race with no clear leader. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Harris is slightly ahead of Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent within the margin of error. In Michigan, it's the former president who holds the edge over Harris. Trump also narrowly leads Harris in battleground Wisconsin, all of those states, all of those polls within the margin of error, indicating it's basically a tie. Here now to discuss our political panel, we have talked a lot about how both campaigns have been trying to appeal to white men. One Democrat is concerned there isn't being enough done by the Harris campaign to win over black male voters, specifically in Michigan. Jamal Simmons, who we all know, he's a panelist, quite often, a former communications director for Vice President Harris. He told Politico, quote, I am worried about turnout in Detroit.

So, keep that in mind this is not an active mine. Again, this is a place where people go for tours and to really learn about the evolution of mining. And so when you look at the website of this mine, what they say is this about an hour long tour. And in that tour you go down essentially what -- it's like an elevator, they call it a shaft, right, that goes down in two minutes. And they say it goes down about 500 stories every single minute. After you get off that elevator, what happens then is that you ride this tram air locomotive. So again, we do not know what part of the equipment malfunctioned. But we do know that at least 10 people are underground and are now being -- trying to figure out exactly what to do or how to get them out. We do know that about 11 people were already rescued and there is, again, all these resources trying to get everything out. This is seasonal. This only opens in the summer.
