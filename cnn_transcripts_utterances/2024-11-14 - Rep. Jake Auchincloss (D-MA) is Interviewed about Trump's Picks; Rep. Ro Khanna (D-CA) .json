One, we didn't speak enough to the millions of American's, the vast - the majority of American's who are struggling economically, who feel that the American dream is slipping away, whose kids aren't able to buy a house or a car, who have seen factories offshored. And we just didn't speak to their pain, to their frustration. They didn't feel seen. And we didn't have a compelling vision. I mean what we should have said, like FDR, who had a dollar a year menand women, business leaders and technology leaders coming into government to build America, that's what our vision should have been, that we were going to enlist people in - from Silicon Valley business leaders to build new factories and with union and not to tear down government. And we should have contrasted our economic vision with theirs and made the case in Michigan and Pennsylvania that we're actually going to be more successful in getting new steel plants up, new aluminum plants up, and increasing wages, giving machinists and electricians incentives to actually get stock in a company's performance and having equity. I mean we should have had a more robust economic agenda. And the second thing is, we need to listen to people more. Be humble.
