And we're just two days away now from the Iowa caucuses, which will give us our first results in the 2024 presidential election cycle.But blizzard conditions are wreaking havoc on the campaign trail and wind chills are dropping to a bone chilling 45 degrees below zero. Much of Iowa is now under a blizzard warning. And that's putting a major chill on what's typically a fiery final blitz for campaigns. Candidates are scaling back in person events across the Hawkeye State even as they try to lure those still undecided voters. CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Kristen Holmes, and Jessica Dean are all tracking the latest forest on the campaign trail. Jeff, let's begin with you outside in the very snowy conditions.

You can just feel it as it sort of hits your face. That is what is a concern to people.If you have to be outside for a long period of time. That certainly is a worry. And the reason is for those caucuses on Monday night, it's going to be even colder then. So, as voters potentially have to wait in line to go into a caucus site, the campaigns are trying a variety of things to try and encourage their supporters to come out to those caucus sites on Monday evening. The question hanging over this race, though, aside from the weather is, is the campaign still frozen in place? By that, I mean, is Donald Trump still the commanding leader in this race? And are Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis still fighting for second place? We are going to get a glimpse of a potential answer to that, a snapshot of that in tonight's Des Moines Register Iowa poll. That is going to be released, the final look at the race before the caucuses on Monday. Historically, that has been a pretty good indicator of where things stand. So, for now, the former president, he canceled his events today in Iowa he'll be flying in later. But Nikki Haley is on the campaign trail in Cedar Falls, Iowa. She had this to say to Iowans about the importance of their choice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, thank you for coming out on this really cold snowy day, you know, this comes down to a choice. It's what's the direction that you want the country to go to. And let's kind of look at what you've got. You've got the opportunity to look back at the past and continue. Or go forward and start new.

But they -- if they don't win, they want to come in very close to Donald Trump to really make the case that DeSantis is the alternative. That it's not Nikki Haley, who is nipping at his heels and has had a lot of momentum as we head into this final stretch. So, to that end, we are seeing DeSantis all across the state of Iowa. We're also anticipating it for tomorrow. He has a number of events today in person. He had to cancel one later tonight. But, as you mentioned, he's already had one today. I'll let you listen to what he said to supporters there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDATE: I'm a Florida boy, born and bred. And yet, here I am in negative temperatures, I am not going to be canceled. If people are willing to come out and hear from me, I'm going to show up all the way until the end of this caucus.

He's going to all 99 counties, the full Grassley, and a nod to Senator Chuck Grassley here.He has the support of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. Bob Vander Plaats, who is representative of a lot of evangelical voters here in Iowa that the DeSantis campaign really believes he is -- he will perform well within. They are hoping to really peel off that support from Donald Trump. And then, it comes down to Monday, as Jeff really laid out and the weather situation here Fredricka, it is going to be about turnout and organization. Something that's always key in Iowa caucuses because you don't just go in and check a ballot, you have to show up, you're there for a while. You may have to drive a long way if you live in a county where there's only a couple of caucus sites. So, it takes a lot of effort. And that requires organization on the part of the campaigns. And that's where Ron DeSantis and the super PAC aligned with him, Never Back Down, feel like they have the upper hand. They say that they have an organization that is unparalleled. They've been here for months, they've spent a tremendous amount of money, and time, knocking on doors, getting precinct captains. They are hoping that, that pays off on Monday, and they're hoping certainly with this weather, which is this new factor in all of this, that, that organization will carry them through for a strong finish on Monday.

I think, there is a 30 to 35, to maybe even 40 percent of the overall electorate, and probably the majority of the Republican electorate, that no matter what happens in these various legal cases with former President Trump, it's not going to deter them from supporting him. I think it will matter in terms of whether or not other Republican primary voters feel like it's worth coming out in the snow to vote for Governor DeSantis or Governor Haley, whether or not in New Hampshire where people can cross party lines to vote in the primary, people will come out to support particularly Governor Haley, and it will matter in the general election with President Biden.

And because Governor DeSantis had a strong debate on CNN the other night this past week, I think now it's a much more open question about who comes in second in Iowa, and then who can parlay that into a strong New Hampshire performance? Again, I think ultimately, we're talking about Trump being the nominee, but both DeSantis is in his mid-40s, and Governor Haley is in her early 50s.

And although the Chinese government says that China has a historic claim on Taiwan, China's claim is really tenuous at best. Since 1895, Taiwan has been ruled from Beijing for a total of four years. In that same period, India was ruled by London for 52 years. So, by any standard of international law, Beijing's claim on Taiwan, is tenuous at best. It's more equivalent to Russia's claims on Ukraine. And as we're seeing in Ukraine, if the Russians have this assertion, and are trying to implement it by force, then, the Ukrainians like the Taiwanese, perhaps, in the future will have no alternative but to resist.

He says 134 U.N. staff have been killed, 1.9 million Gazans displaced from their homes. That's 85 percent of the people, he said. But the really damning part is the part that you mentioned, where the U.N. workers in the north have seen bodies on the street, people in near starving conditions, people who want to return to homes -- return home but many of those homes are destroyed. Another U.N. report, again, marking this 100 days, says that the whole neighborhoods have been destroyed. That cultural buildings, mosques, historic buildings centuries old have all been destroyed. Those cultural points of reference for the community there have all been lost. It is a very unsettling picture that Martin Griffith's report paints, particularly for the potential of what may come. He talks about the normal population of Rafah along the border with Egypt, inside Gaza, of course, about 280,000 people. He said, there is an additional one million displaced people there. If the fighting spreads there, that will put huge pressure on that border to allow people to get out of the way of the danger.

      "sentences": "Well, the White House has condemned the Texas governor's actions on the U.S.-Texas border -- the Texas-Mexico border and saying that this is, quote, \"extreme political stunts.\"Now this is part of an ongoing dispute between the Texas governor and President Biden over the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. Since the start of the Biden administration, the Texas governor slammed the president's immigration policies and taken actions as an affront to the policies. And this latest action on the Texas-Mexico border this past week, where the Texas governor blocked part of the border and Border Patrol from accessing it, really marked an escalation and an unprecedented one. Now, as you mentioned there, the Department of Justice went to the Supreme Court asking for them to intervene because, they said, Texas was blocking Border Patrol from its federal enforcement duties. And saying the Supreme Court needed to intervene. And it backed up the point that they should do so in a timely manner. But the president, of course, has been dealing with this for years. There has been an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border now for years. Again, as there is record migration across the western hemisphere. And he is trying to navigate the politics of all of this, including Republican pressure to do more and to take executive actions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what is clear, at least, is that this is a political liability for this White House. This all remains a challenge for them as they move forward. WHITFIELD: Yes, a big challenge.
