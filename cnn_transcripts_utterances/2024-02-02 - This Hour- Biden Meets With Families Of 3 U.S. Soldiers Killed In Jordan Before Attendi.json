      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, honoring the fallen. Right now, President Biden is in Dover, Delaware to attend the dignified transfer of three U.S. soldiers killed last weekend in Jordan. And to meet with families as their loved ones remains returned to U.S. soil.Plus, 353,000 jobs added. The first employment report of 2024 is out and it's much stronger than anybody expected. This as new exclusive CNN polling shows that voters are giving President Biden slightly more credit for economic gains. And a jumbled mess. That's how a GOP source is describing House Republicans attempt to impeach President Biden. We're going to bring you new reporting on how top members are finally admitting, it's probably not going to happen. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with the most solemn duty of an American president. Joe Biden is in Delaware at Dover Air Force Base to witness the dignified transfer of three U.S. soldiers killed in Jordan. 24-year-old Sergeant Kennedy Sanders was known to her parents as munchkin. They say she dove into everything headfirst. 23-year-old Sergeant Brianna Moffatt, her sister says she talked to a stranger on the street and had them smiling and laughing within minutes. And 46-year-old Sergeant William Jerome Rivers, he's remembered as quiet, genuine and a huge Philly sports fan. These brave Americans were all from Georgia. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Arlette, you've covered President Biden for some time. You understand how solemn this is for any president, but particularly for him.",

It really is the most somber duty a president has as commander in chief and President Biden will experience this now for the second time, as he is on hand for a dignified transfer of those three U.S. service members who were killed in Jordan. Now the president has just arrived at Dover Air Force Base on Air Force One. He is accompanied by his wife, First Lady Jill Biden. And first up on their schedule is a meeting, private meetings with the families of those service members. The schedule says he has a little over an hour to meet with them.This will give him a chance to hear directly personal stories about their loved ones and to hear their concerns as well. The president spoke with the three families on Tuesday. And the White House said that in those conversations he gauged their feelings about having him attend the dignified transfer. All three families agreed that they did want the president there. Those are the families of Sergeant William Rivers, and also two army specialists who are posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant, Kennedy Sanders and Brianna Moffatt. And we really got a very rare video showing a moment where President Biden spoke with the family of Kennedy Sanders and personally delivered the news where he said that they were posthumously promoting her to sergeant. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he will once again do that today.I will note that back when he was vice president, he actually did attend a dignified transfer and then had attempted to as he was a senator of Delaware. But had said that he was turned away at times from those ceremonies. But certainly, it will be a very poignant moment for the president, especially one who has dealt with so much grief himself, and so often has stepped into that role of comforter- in-chief.",

Joining me now at the magic wall to talk about this -- to break it down is David Chalian. Let's start with the overall idea that political strategists and we've been covering politics have been looked -- have looked at and matters more than anything, which is how people feel about the direction of the country.",

That's about a third and it's a low number.But Dana, look, it is ticking up a bit. It was a 28 percent last fall. I mean, we weren't at 35 percent until the aftermath of the midterm elections in December of '22. And that was a blip. So that is a bit of good news that maybe the country is turning the corner and perception, those still two thirds do not believe things are going well. But I think this is instructive. Look at it broken by party. You see growth in positive perception across all Democrats, Independents, Republicans. So yes, Democrats think more now that things are going well than it did before.

Only a quarter say they've improved conditions. 90 percent no effect.So yes, 58 percent said that in August, but again, that's margin of error. He's largely staying even there with a majority of Americans saying that economic conditions have worsened under his watch. And take a look, just overall of his approval ratings on a whole host of issues. Right there in the middle, Dana, 37 percent approval on the economy. He's at 38 percent approval overall. The economy drives so much about people perceive him. Where he overperformed his overall approval rating, protecting democracy and the situation in Ukraine where he underperforms his overall approval rating. The Israel-Hamas war, and then immigration consistently his worst issue in the eyes of Americans, only 30 percent of the proof of the job he's doing on that issue.",

I mean, you know, interest rates are still high. It looks like the Fed is not going to do anything now. And they feel the groceries are still high, et cetera, gases coming down, but it's still high.

That means high interest rates.Then everyone looks around and says, I can't buy a house, which was kind of the point, right? So, these things like your rent, your home, those things are worth looking at, because that's where people can't enjoy the gains they've made with their wages because they feel like they can't put them to work. KANNO-YOUNGS: Those in the White House also, when it comes to this issue are still trying to figure out how to talk about some of these sprawling investments that they've had and actually have that translate to how it's impacting people's lives now.
