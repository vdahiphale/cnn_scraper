That warning is raising pressure on President Biden and McCarthy to reach some kind of deal. Mr. Biden is now calling a meeting with four top congressional leaders for next Tuesday. But the White House says we won't -- he won't back down on his insistence that Congress send him a debt ceiling raise without conditions. On Capitol Hill, it's still all posturing.

Warning that potential default, the first ever default in U.S. history, could occur as early as June 1 if the debt ceiling is not raised.This of course has been an issue that the two sides have been squabbling about the better part of this year. The House Republicans insist that there must be some spending cuts attached to it given that the debt is more than $31 trillion. And they've already passed a bill. They did last week along straight party lines to include a slew of spending cuts and tied to raising the debt ceiling up through next March. But the Senate Democrats and the White House say that is an absolute nonstarter. They say that there should be no negotiation over raising the debt ceiling given the potential calamitous impact of not raising the debt ceiling. Saying that it must be raised, no conditions whatsoever. But that is the position rejected by House Republicans. And in a sign of how far apart the two sides are, two Senators today indicated how they believe it should be resolved. One Democrat up for re-election saying that there should not be spending cuts attached. SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT): What they're saying is they're going to default on the debt.",

The strike was announced after the Writers Guild and studios failed to reach an agreement hours before a midnight deadline. About 11,000 writers are affected.
