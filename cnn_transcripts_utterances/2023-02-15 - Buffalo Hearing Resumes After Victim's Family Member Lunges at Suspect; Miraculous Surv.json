We don't know what the interaction was during this time between law enforcement and the Laundries.Now clearly if law enforcement was asking that family if they had information about Gabby Petito and they lied, if they, you know, lied to law enforcement, then, of course there could be serious implications and perhaps charges against at least the mother who apparently wrote this letter.",

We knew that there were going to be up to 17 people who were going to speak. Obviously this is a tragedy that has shaken not just Buffalo but places across the world to its core, but especially in Buffalo. But to see this level of anger was something I think you could see the surprise on a lot of people's faces when this happened. But obviously, right before that, the victim impact statement that was being given by Barbara Massey was already emotional. She wasn't speaking into the mic. She was turned and speaking directly at Payton Gendron. She wanted him to understand what he had done to this community, to these people, to these loved ones for everyone that was sitting inside of there. Another thing was that now the hearing is back on track. We should say. That the judge trying to get things back under control did acknowledge that we know this is emotional, we know that this may be difficult for people to hear, but please leave the courtroom if you feel like you can't control that. Also saying that we are better than this as far as acting on some of those aggressive emotions, perhaps. But obviously it's indicative of what we are dealing with in the sentencing hearing and those moments are among the most dramatic I think I've seen in recent memory.",

They're the latest retailer to file, joins a growing number of companies, you think of Party City, they filed for bankruptcy recently, Serta Simmons Bedding, which is one of the largest bedding manufacturers in the country, and then a large independent pet store chain.And this is a reversal of what we've seen the last couple of years from the retail sector when consumer spending was strong, they were buying clothes, furniture, television. But now they're being squeezed by inflation. They pulled back some of their discretionary spending and that's hurting these vulnerable retailers. We also look at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.
