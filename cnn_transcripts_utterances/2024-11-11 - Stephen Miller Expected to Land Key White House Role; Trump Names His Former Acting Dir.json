I'm actually told that his title kind of underplays the amount of influence he is going to have in a second Trump term. And you're exactly right, he has been the lead architect of Donald Trump's plans for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. But also, he has always been a hardline immigration enforcer. And I think he's going to really be leading a lot of the immigration policies from the White House.I think there's a lot of questions over who is going to serve as Donald Trump's Secretary of Homeland Security. But I think with now, Tom Homan, the former Acting Head of ICE, and Stephen Miller being given these roles, it shows how centralized a lot of that policy is going to be from within the White House. Now, one key thing that I actually found very interesting is one, both of these men, of course, have been very loyal to Donald Trump. And they have remained loyal to him ever since he had departed the White House, even as other people were distancing themselves from the former President, these two have remained by him. They've also both contributed to Project 2025, something that Donald Trump has consistently distanced himself from. But I will say in my conversations with Trump advisers, that they will likely be using some of the Heritage Foundation's, you know, big roster of names to fill some of the lower level roles in an upcoming White House without really getting into Project 2025.",

They could potentially add 53 at the moment.Right now, Trump has not endorsed any of these three candidates, Senator John Thune, the number two Republican Senator John Quinn Cornyn of the former number two, as well as Senator Rick Scott, someone who does have support, as you mentioned, from Elon Musk and some folks in the MAGA world, but is still seen as an underdog. So a bit of a long shot candidate at the moment. What Trump has made one demand on is to have the next Senate majority leader essentially allow him to short circuit the Senate confirmation process, allow him to install his cabinet nominees without Senate confirmation votes and still use what's known as recess appointments. That's something that has really not been done, really since before 2007, even before that. And it was very controversial. Senate majority leaders have since then taken procedural steps to block presidents from short circuiting the Senate confirmation process. But after Trump made that public call, all three of those candidates essentially said they were supportive of Donald Trump doing this. Now, that doesn't mean that these candidates have always been in line with Trump, especially in the aftermath of his 2020 election law. Senator John Thune in particular was pretty critical of Donald Trump in the aftermath of that. John Cornyn also has raised some concerns about Donald Trump.

Cornyn actually was in Austin, Texas, waiting for Trump to come tape his podcast with Joe Rogan.And there's Cornyn on board Trump's plane saying, glad to welcome you, President -- Mr. President Trump to Texas.

And that's the man that was on the bridge, seemingly close to the girls. Liberty German, one of the victims, her phone, she recorded this man. And it's believed minutes later, they were murdered. But no eyewitness in the courtroom said that was Richard Allen. The man I see in the courtroom is the man I saw on the bridge that day. But here's what they do have. Richard Allen placed himself on the Monon Trails that day. In that afternoon, he went to law enforcement shortly after the bodies were found. He said, I just wanted to let you know that I was out there. I didn't see them, but I was there. And then furthermore, what the prosecutors have are confessions. When he was in solitary confinement, according to prosecutors, he confessed over 60 times. But the defense is saying false confessions. He was in solitary, and at the time he was diagnosed to be psychotic. And so you've got a difficult case.

This tends to be a group that kind of views the experience of what they were going through economically during the Trump years and from up until COVID, things were probably perhaps as good or maybe even better than the economic conditions perhaps ever experienced by Latinos emigres and seconds (ph), maybe even third generation Latino voters. And the discrepancy between who was to blame, I think, is one of the truly remarkable moments in American political history.But their lives, Latino lives, the Latino economy itself, was foundationally better under the Trump administration until COVID. And the economic collapse under COVID. And I think that that's what voters were responding to is not this policy. But no one can tell you what the CHIPS Act is or build back better, but they can tell you what the price of eggs was. They can tell you what gasoline cost, what costs were like. And the affordability of American life has gotten so out of control under the Biden administration that this kind of visceral economic pushback is, I think, inevitable. S2L Before we let you go, Mike, I've been seeing a lot of stuff on my social media feed, accusations of hypocrisy toward Latino Trump supporters, accusations of misogyny, of sexism and racism as for why larger numbers of Latino men specifically went out to vote for Donald Trump. I'm wondering what you make of that. How big a factor were those ideas in their support for Trump versus Harris?",
