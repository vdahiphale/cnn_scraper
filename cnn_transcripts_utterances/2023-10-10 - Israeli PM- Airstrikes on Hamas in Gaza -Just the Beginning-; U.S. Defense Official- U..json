In the past, Israel has often, when they struck Gaza, Hamas militants would be using and putting that might include civilians. The civilians would be notified. They would leave and the building an infrastructure is destroyed.And, basically, Israel, it sounds like to me, please give us your reporting on this, they're no longer giving those warnings. Hamas has come out and said, okay, if you don't do that, we're going to start executing hostages on TV. What is the latest on this?",

And Hamas suggesting that is not happening. There is no warning to effectively -- their suggestion is residents of Gaza and their threat is that they will then assassinate hostages as a result of this.Look, this is difficult for the IDF from their perspective, they say they are intent on denigrating the entire Hamas military infrastructure. They say that in conflicts of past, it is regular as far as the IDF is concerned for Hamas to be housed in its military equipment to be housed in buildings which also accommodate civilians. So that is a really difficult situation for the IDF. Not one that they won't have anticipated. But their effort is to degrade this infrastructure, complicated as it is of course by the 100 to 150 hostages we still don't have specific numbers from the IDF. But it is a very tricky situation, and that threat of course will be taken very seriously by the Israeli forces here.",

The support would not entail U.S. troops on the ground, to underscore that. And let's bring in former director of communications for U.S. national intelligence, Shawn Turner. Sir, thank you very much for being with us this morning. Can you help us understand what the meaning of this development is? The fact that the U.S. is out there saying we are going to provide with these supports? SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  Yes, Kasie, good morning. Thanks for having me. You know, a lot of people are wondering whether U.S. military support would look like to Israel as we see this strike group moving through the area. You know, it is going to be really clear that no one should expect to see U.S. military forces on the ground in Israel. What we can expect to see is an immense amount of intelligence surveillance -- intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance support. So what that means is when we think of the fact that if Hamas is going to continue this fight, they are going to need to resupply at some point. As you all have been reporting, Israel is cutting off the Gaza Strip, so there won't be food, water, electricity. So when we think about that supply line, the ability to get that resupply in, the United States is in a good position to disrupt those supply lines, to provide Israel with the intelligence needed to disrupt the supply lines which will obviously have a significant impact on limiting Hamas's ability to continue to fight. We know that a lot of the rockets are being made in the Gaza Strip, but ultimately, at some point, they're going to need to get additional resources. And the United States can help with that.",

The Israeli government says it did not see this coming, but the signs were there. CNN's Sam Kiley has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Slick propaganda, a blatant threat and published last year. Hamas gunmen training a motorized paragliders. They also showed meticulous planning for fighting in built up areas, all an historic failure of Israeli intelligence. Hamas videos of the start of their assaults from Gaza were published within hours of its launch. Once a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, a Sunni movement, won Palestinian elections in 2006 on a platform of social reform and resistance to Israel. Driven by corruption and incompetence, rivals Fatah launched attacks immediately against the movement, which denies the right of Israel to exist at all. In the end, Hamas won control of Gaza, and its grip on the enclave of around 2 million people tightened as Israel and Egypt largely sealed it off, causing intense humanitarian problems. Hamas responded with waves of rocket attacks against Israel that got worse as the years went by. Israel counter attacked from the air, and with ground assaults that left thousands dead, and Hamas still in charge. But Iran's influence has been key to Hamas's military power.",

But they really interesting article they put together suggesting that the groups fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight. A lot of it was filmed. They even set up a mock Israeli settlement in Gaza. WE asked the IDF about that. They said they weren't aware of that. But the more interesting part of this, that it was combined with a separate intelligence operation which was really an intelligence tactic, which was giving any public impression that Hamas wasn't willing to go to a fighter confrontation with Israel, not getting involved in some operations perhaps Islamic jihad were involved in, just showing that they are appreciative of the visas that they were getting for example, and this was all combine of course with a reaction that the Netanyahu who government had, judicial reform, and also, you know --",
