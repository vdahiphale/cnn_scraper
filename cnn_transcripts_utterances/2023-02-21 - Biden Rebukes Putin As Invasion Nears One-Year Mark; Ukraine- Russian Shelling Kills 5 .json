As Mattingly mentioned, hours before Biden spoke, Putin delivered hisown message to mark one year of what he calls a special military operation. Putin arguing that the West is responsible for the escalation in Ukraine, a message to the White House fervently denies. Shortly after Putin's speech, Russia launched a new round of shelling on a residential area in Kherson, killing five people, injuring 16 more. These are former stores and shops. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports now on Putin's speech from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  A determined Russian leader entering center stage. Vladimir Putin, showing he will not back down from the war in Ukraine, calling Kyiv's leadership illegitimate. The Kyiv regime is essentially alien to the people of Ukraine, he said. They are not protecting their own interests, but those of their mind or countries. Putin squarely blames the West for the conflict, even though it was Russian forces that invaded Ukraine almost a year ago. The Kremlin claims Russia is under assault from the West, even more so after President Joe Biden went to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, showing the U.S.'s resolve to help Ukraine stand up to Moscow. The elite of the West does not conceal their ambitions, which is to strategically defeat Russia, he says. What does that mean? It means to finish us off once and for all. While Putin praised his army, he acknowledged they need better gear, as progress has been hard to come by and losses mount in the face of stiff Ukrainian resistance. Still, support among the Russians, both for what Putin called the special military operation and the Russian leader himself remain rock solid, Russia's top independent pollster tells CNN.",

We must strike the centers like Germany, London. I think the West will bend and be forced to make concessions, he says. What opinion can there be? We shouldn't have barged into where we weren't wanted, this man says. Putin saved arguably his biggest message for last, announcing Russia is suspending its participation in the new strategic arms reduction treaty, after Moscow last year accused Ukraine of striking an airbase for strategic bombers. We know that NATO is complicit in the attempts by the Kyiv regime to strike our air bases, and now they want to come and inspect our bases? While Putin says, the treaty could be revived if relations between the U.S. and Russia improve, on this day, the gulf between Russia and the West further widened. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  So you see the view from the Kremlin there, Jake. I was actually able to get in touch with the Kremlin spokesman tonight, as well, and ask him about President Biden's speech, specifically President Biden's comments that Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. And the spokesman came back with some pretty harsh comments. He said, it's impossible to talk about destroying Russia without nuclear war. And that nuclear war would have no winners. He also said that he firmly believes, like Vladimir Putin apparently also believes, that the ultimate goal of the United States is weakening Russia and the disintegration of Russia. So as you can see some, pretty harsh words coming out of Moscow tonight, Jake.",

Maybe not exactly a celebration, Jake, but certainly an affirmation of what they've been saying when it comes to the coalition, to the alliance, so the way that NATO and its allies have rallied behind Ukraine and the way that they have to help them, whether it's humanitarian assistance or, sending weapons, or what they've done over the last, you know, 12 months as we've closed in on this one year anniversary.And so, certainly I think there was a validation in that sense because that's really been President Biden's message ever since he took office, this idea of autocracy versus democracy. And he was saying that Putin was wrong today, saying that he believes that autocracies would get stronger, they weren't weaker. Democracies grew stronger instead of weaker, and making that point. But I think also, the White House, you know, before they would go to the stop of celebrating, they realize that this is an increasingly complex situation on the ground in Ukraine. They're very worried about it becoming a standstill and how long it could drag out. They are worried about support waiting at home. You know, President Biden saying today that the support will never tire, that America and NATO will be behind Ukraine. But obviously, you've got lawmakers in Washington who are already raising complaints about how much money is going there. So, I do think it's a real concern for them, even if they do feel validated in the way that Putin has been wrong time and time again over the last 12 months.",

As the same time, you talk about the criticism from Republicans.But also, a lot of Americans are questioning whether Biden should be reelected, due to his age. I guess I'm guessing the White House aides see the vigor and the energy he's displayed on this trip as a rebuttal to that, almost. COLLINS:  Yeah, I think they think he deserves some credit here because he left Washington at four a.m. on Sunday morning, took a ten hour train ride to Kyiv both ways, he was only on the ground for about six hours. And yes, it's a trip that other world leaders have made. It's obviously more difficult for the president of the United States, who has one of the highest levels of security of any leader in the world. And so, the White House was kind of making the argument that he had a really good week. He had a very strong week, they believe, when he was on the ground in Ukraine. They believed it was the perfect way to set him up for this visit here in Poland. You know, 11 months after he was here last time. And so, I think that they do believe that this shows that, you know, he had the strength and the fortitude to make such an arduous journey, and then come and deliver that fiery speech, talking about there is all of the United States behind Ukraine tonight.",
