He needs all those votes.We're following all of the latest developments on Capitol Hill this morning. Let's begin with CNN chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju.

      "sentences": "Highly uncertain at the moment. And still Kevin McCarthy's path to speakership, it may happen or my collapse. We just simply don't know. We do know that he still doesn't have the votes to become the speaker of House. Last night, we reported about those key concessions that he made to a handful of conservatives who are opposing his speaker's bid, one of which would allow one individual member of the House to call for a vote to essentially oust a sitting speaker.That is something that he has opposed in the past. But he came down and agreed to that. That has caused a lot of angst within the ranks of more moderate members who are concerned that it could create instability, it could potentially even make McCarthy, if he becomes speaker, a very short-lived one. In addition to that, he has proposed some other changes, some political moves that got some support from conservative outside groups but in a very significant change that can impact how the chamber operates, the policy, the bills that come to the floor. He agreed to add some members of that far-right House Freedom Caucus to the house ruling committee. That is a very powerful committee in Congress and essentially dictated the terms of legislation, what comes to the floor, what amendments can be allowed and agreed to put some of those members on there so it will raise questions about how they will effectively be able to govern on some key policy issues in the new Congress, assuming he becomes speaker. And that is still uncertain. If he does, those proposals, if they do win over support, it probably would only be with maybe ten members. He needs to win back 16 members of that 20 group -- 20 opponents who have voted against him on the floor. Six times he has been rejected by the full House. So, can he get those other members? That remains unknown because some of those members have other concerns. This morning, he did meet with Congressman Self, who was one of the 20 who opposes Kevin McCarthy. They met in the speaker's office. Self walked out of there, declined to comment. It is uncertain if he will win him over and others. McCarthy's goal is to go one-by-one, get each of these members on board. But the challenge here is that there are four Republicans who are just dead set against him and he can only afford to lose four votes. So, that means he essentially needs to win back every own one of those 20 opponents in order to win the speakership. So, it is a very, very narrow path. But McCarthy still believes that he will get there. And at noon today, the House reconvenes, it would go to a seventh ballot if they don't try to move to adjourn to allow for these talks to play out. So, again, this House is in a complete state of paralysis. They can't do anything, not even getting national security briefings, which is raising some major concerns about on the impact on the U.S. government if they can't get a deal here.",

I know you're still, and Republicans are still counting votes, but just in the simplest terms, is Kevin McCarthy more likely today to be speaker of House than he was yesterday? F. HILL:  Such a good question for all of your viewers. I believe yes. 200 members of Congress are standing firm by their desire to see Kevin McCarthy be elected the next speaker of the House based on leadership and policy development in our commitment to America, his ability to raise funds and recruit candidates to have our back-to-back pick up in seats in the last two congressional elections and his ability to select the right people to be on the right committees. So, those conversations between Leader McCarthy and those who are not yet yes votes continued yesterday and they were very constructive.",

Sources tell CNN that McCarthy has now agreed to allow just a single member to make a motion to vacate, as it's known, in effect, force a floor vote to remove the speaker, as well as other concessions among them agreeing to allow more members of the freedom caucus to serve on the rules committee. Have those concessions, and they are big ones, have they won any new commitments to support McCarthy as speaker?F. HILL:  I think that is the kind of discussion that's still going on this morning, which is after Leader McCarthy's good work with members of the 20 that were voting no as of yesterday, he made a lot of give and take yesterday. As I said, very constructive discussions on rules, on spending and on budget reform and on who would be on what committees. And the question now is who has gone to yes, and that is what we await for the report this morning.",

Are you certain that moderates will support, continue to support McCarthy with these concessions that they very publicly oppose?F. HILL:  Well, let's see how that rules package ends up in detail and in writing. Let's see what those budget and spending reforms end up as. And let's see what the steering committee does about appointing people to committees. Kevin McCarthy knows better than anybody else because he knows this conference well what it takes to create unity in the conference and move forward so we can move our legislative agenda and create a contrast to the proposals and policies of Joe Biden.",

Is this good politics right now for Republicans having just gained the majority in the House to be giving in so much to a wing of the party that has not fared well for Republicans in recent elections?F. HILL:  Democracy is messy. I would you remind you, a hundred years ago, in 1923, House Republicans went through precisely the same unrest. Only at that time the insurgency was from the left, not from the right. And it led to one of the most productive Congresses for the next probably eight years led by Nick Longworth and President Calvin Coolidge. The budget was balanced, the debt was paid down. It was a good time for Republican leadership in the House. So, we're going through a messy process now and I acknowledge that. It is not an instacart election of speaker.

We've, of course, known for a while that the president intended to mark the two-year anniversary of the January 6th insurrection by doing something tomorrow and now we can report that he is going to deliver remarks and hold a ceremony at the White House to give the presidential citizens medal to 12 people that the president and the White House see as essentially having been heroes coming out of January 6th and the 2020 election. So, we are talking about law enforcement officers, as you said, including Capitol police officers, many of whom got injured and harassed and assaulted as they tried to protect the Capitol from rioters. Some names that people might be familiar with include Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman. Of course, people might remember he played a role in diverting the rioters away from the Senate chamber as lawmakers were in the process of evacuating and has been heralded a hero for those actions. D.C. Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was brutally assaulted. There's also Capitol Officer Caroline Edwards, who testified before the House January 6th committee that she had lost consciousness at some point. And then when she regained consciousness, she decided to run back into the chaos. Now, a number of other people who are going to be honored tomorrow are also election workers, including some other names that again viewers might be familiar with because of the committee's hearing, including the mother and daughter Shay Moss and Ruby Freeman. They, of course, gave emotional testimony before the committee, saying President Trump and his allies attacking them for their work have been incredibly traumatic. So, this is going to be a big moment for this president and the White House. Of course, the events of January 6th is something that the president has talked about a lot, including leading up to the midterm elections. Jim and Erica?",

So, we're still waiting for more information on that. But Bryan Kohberger is here. The courthouse is in the same place as the jail. And he was brought over and booked here last night for four counts of murder and one count of burglary. This was after a very long flight from Pennsylvania where he was extradited. That flight had multiple stops and he finally landed last night at the Pullman Regional Airport. And we have video of him coming in being handed over from the Pennsylvania State Police to local authorities. And at that time, you can see in the video that they put a helmet and a vest on him. The entire time authorities have been very tight-lipped about the transition process across the state lines. And they said it is because of security reasons and you can see in that video extra security being taken. The reason why he was in Pennsylvania is because he was on a cross-country trip with his father from Washington State back to the family home in Pennsylvania. And during that trip they were in the white Hyundai Elantra that police were looking for. They were pulled over twice, once by Hancock County Sheriff's Department and then another time by Indiana State Police.
