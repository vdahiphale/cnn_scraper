But I think perhaps the biggest takeaways were how he said Ukraine was addressing this issue of corruption, that this was an issue that would potentially cause concern for international business, private business investors. He said the government was dealing this with new technology, new reforms in the customs processes, that money would not touch necessarily government departments or government officials. So he was offering here some certainty away from the perceptions that Ukraine still might not have made all the reforms necessary, that it is in the process of making, to join the European Union. Of course, one of those reforms is on corruption. He also gave -- drew a picture of what Ukraine was to the world and what it is in the future, if it gets this sort of financial assistance, what it is for the world's 600 million people, he said, depending on Ukrainian agricultural goods. What it would be in the future is a provider of clean energy, a net producer of electricity, shipping it to, Europe outside of Ukraine. That was something that was echoed by the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who said the U.S. is providing an additional $1.3 billion  of funding. Some of that would go to rebuilding the energy, infrastructure of the country to make it more integrated with Europe. So you know, the messages aligned there on what Ukraine can be going forward. But I think there is an important message ripped across all of this, for Vladimir Putin , that not only will the West provide weapons and support Ukraine needs to defeat Russia but it will rebuild afterwards. That's an affirmative message, which tells President Putin that Ukraine is orienting itself firmly to the West, that there is no space in Ukraine for Russia in the future and that whatever Russia wants and Putin wants out of Ukraine now, the West is planning and building for an entirely different vision of that.",

And China is furious, calling the comparison an open political provocation and extremely absurd and irresponsible.

That's what's a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn't know what happened.\" Now this builds on similar comments that President Biden said over the weekend, when he called that incident \"embarrassing.\" Of course, this is an incident that inflamed tensions between U.S. and China. Just over the weekend as you mentioned, secretary of state Antony Blinken visited China and met with his Chinese counterpart to try to smooth over those relations and open up those channels of communication between the two countries. Now we know that some U.S. officials found these remarks surprising. They were unscripted remarks by President Biden. But he has still, at least over the weekend, indicated hope that he would meet with the Chinese president in the months to come. The last time the two men met was last November on the sidelines of a summit. But of course, these remarks did not sit well with China. In a statement from the foreign ministry spokesperson, they said, quote, \"The remarks seriously contradict basic facts, seriously violate diplomatic etiquette and seriously infringe on China's political dignity, which is an open political provocation.\" Now we do not know yet if that is going to affect this already fragile relationship in any future meetings between the Chinese president and President Biden. But we know that, at least for now, the hope remains the two can continue to smooth over that relationship, which is critical, on so many issues, ranging from fentanyl crisis, to the war in, Ukraine to the tension of American citizens.
