Plus, Harris has now won enough delegates support to clinch the party's nomination. One senior Democratic aide calls it a, quote, \"coordinated drumbeat.\" The sound of the party uniting around the vice president. Today, Harris is traveling to Milwaukee, where she'll be holding her very first rally. That's where we find our Eva McKend. Eva, you are just outside there in Milwaukee.

Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. And I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse. I took on the big Wall Street banks and won $20 billion for California families. Holding those banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of 34 counts of fraud.

So, she raised that $100 million in just two days.Still a difficult road ahead for her though. Former President Trump, no doubt, will sharpen his attacks against her. But what she does have on her side is a host of Democratic coalitions that feel a new since of enthusiasm. I was on a call last night listening to thousands of black men from across the country. It was co-hosted by this group called Win with Black Men. And they were essentially outlining their strategy to be ambassadors for her in their respective communities across the country. Sara.",

I mean if you look at where Harris is likely to do better than Biden, Biden was suffering significant erosion among younger and non-white voters. And Harris, there's lots of reasons to think Harris can do better, reverse some of that loss, and that there's also some more room to grow with pro-choice women. And if she can do all of that enough, not only with black voters, but also Hispanic voters, maybe you can put Arizona and Nevada and Georgia back in play, conceivably North Carolina, but harder. But if you can't, Kate, if she can't, and if she is in the same situation as Biden, where she has to sweep the three old states from what I call the blue wall back in 2009, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, those are states that do not demographically line up with her strengths. Those are states where white voters in general and non-college white voters in particular are a bigger share of the electorate than they are nationally.And one of Biden's remaining strengths, amid all his other problems, was that he was holding his 2020 support with those voters to a greater extent that he was with the other groups, and that in 2020 he improved slightly among them compared to Hillary Clinton. So, if she slides back in those states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, toward the Clinton '16 levels, then she's going to have to make it up with bigger margins and turnout among non-white voters, young voters, and college educated white voters. It can be done, but if she can't bring some of those sunbelt states back into play, she is also walking across a narrow tight rope, as Biden was.",
