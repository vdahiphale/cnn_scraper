Several presidents have done that. Bush-Cheney were indicted in Malaysia for their torture activities. They could have been theoretically indicted here.

I think Tim Scott being the person of faith he is, always leading with faith, might also feel like Donald Trump is the man for the moment. I think he's that kind of guy who would go back to such simplistic thinking. And then also I do think that he and Haley have a lot of bad blood from those debates. I mean, they got nastier each time they met on the debate stage and it seemed rather personal at some point. So though privately Scott may acknowledge that she has what is needed to win in a general, beat a Democrat, there's a fair degree of positioning here that leads you to think that maybe this guy is really just looking to pull the evangelical vote towards Trump.",

Yes, and I'm bringing pop culture because it's night at night.What about -- what happens if she does not win South Carolina? If you're Nikki Haley, you came in third, although she says two firsts are raised in Iowa, even if she captures New Hampshire, yes, and can you actually then win your own state? If Senator Tim Scott does not endorse her, is that all the marbles? SOLTIS-ANDERSON:  This has always been the buzz saw that she is headed directly for. New Hampshire was always going to be a state where she had maybe a better shot, especially if other folks like Christie got out. But South Carolina, especially because it's her home state, the stakes are really high. You can't lose your home state. It looks bad. And especially if Donald Trump is already -- seems like he's romping to the nomination. You cannot have the kind of like stench of loserdom on your campaign, especially if it's your home state. I want to say one other thing quickly about Tim Scott as a potential pick. There's a lot of talk lately about Donald Trump wanting somebody who's going to be totally loyal to him, but also someone who's not going to necessarily outshine him. He's not necessarily looking for someone who has their eyes on a big, big prize themselves, but I think he'd be foolish if he overlooked Tim Scott, because Tim Scott has this very calm demeanor to him. It's a very interesting counterbalance, almost kind of the same role that Mike Pence played in 2016. I'm going to try to set people at ease. I'm going to bring over voters that I think I can hold on to, that might be nervous about my candidacy. So, we'll see if Donald Trump is thinking --",

The DOJ releasing a damning report today on wide-scale law enforcement failures that played out during the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.The nearly 600-page report ticks through failures in leadership, in tactics, training, in the police response to the massacre at Robb Elementary. It paints a picture of confusion and cowardice. Nineteen children and two adults, their teachers, died that day. One of the nation's worst school shootings. Joining me now to discuss, Texas State Senator Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde. Texas State senator, thank you so much for being here today. When you see this report, I mean, the description, talking about acting with no urgency, cascading failures, the attorney general saying that the people of Uvalde, the community, deserved better. When you look at all of this, what stands out to you in this first full official account?",

I think that what we see more than anything, it justifies everything that we've said, it justifies and gives support to everything that your own network was able to break along the way.There is not a whole lot of new evidence here. We -- all along, we've been seeing this failure. But what it does do is it codifies it all into 600 pages for the first time ever in black and white. And on the front of this document, there's a seal from the Department of Justice that tells us exactly that all of the law enforcement on this scene failed and failed miserably, and failed these children. And yes, they deserved better from those law enforcement officers, but they also deserved better from policymakers that were too weak and too cowardly to ever have avoided this in the first place, cowards like Ted Cruz and others who have failed to put an assault weapons ban in place to keep guns like this away from a young man who just needed to have -- we just -- we cannot allow this to happen again, Laura. We must do something --",

Terrified students, terrified children, adults and parents begging for law enforcement, more than 300 of them to go on to the scene.And the attorney general says, had they just followed generally accepted practices, lives would have been saved. I mean, the report, senator, specifically calls out then-School Police Chief Pete Arredondo, then-Acting Uvalde Police Chief Mariano Pargas, and Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco who, by the way, is now running for reelection. I understand that family members are absolutely frustrated. They are demanding accountability for those failures. So, what should accountability look like at this stage?",

The one man that they said was fired was given retirement benefits. The other, Texas ranger, is still on the force getting paid while he sits on his couch by the citizens of the state of Texas. Accountability is absolutely firing these people that failed these children so grossly. Accountability is absolutely bringing criminal charges for some of those officers that should have taken command and control of the situation, including DPS agents. But sadly, the district attorney in this community will not do any of those things because it means going after state officers that should be held accountable, and she simply will not do that.",
