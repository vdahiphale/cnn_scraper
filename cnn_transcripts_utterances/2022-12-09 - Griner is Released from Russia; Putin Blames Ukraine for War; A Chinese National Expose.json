      "sentences": "Oh, Michael, they have just released a lengthy joint statement after the summit really aiming to take this partnership to a new level, which has been described by Chinese officials as an epic making milestone. But when it comes to this fast-evolving and growing relationship, it's about more than oil. But at the same time, nothing matters more than oil because as the world's second-largest economy and its biggest oil importer, China obviously need reliable and diversified sources of energy. Especially at a time when Xi Jinping is trying to jumpstart this sluggish economy because of the impact of the zero-COVID policy, which is finally easing.So, Saudi Arabia plays a crucial part in this strategy. And indeed, in recent years, they have been the biggest source of China's foreign oil until early this year when Russia started flooding the global market with cheap oil after its invasion of Ukraine to counter Western sanctions. Now, the Saudis have since reclaimed the top spot, so they very much want to keep it that way that by ensuring China remains a loyal big customer, even when competitors are offering cheaper prices. But there are geopolitical implications here as well, with reports saying both sides already talking about pricing some of the oil transactions in the Chinese currency. So, that could obviously challenge the so-called Petrodollar system, which is critical to the U.S. dollar's position as the international reserve currency. But in a way, that very much speaks to what Xi Jinping's long-standing desire to reshape the U.S.- led world order. The Saudis are keenly aware of that and trying to adapt to that, especially at a time they seem to feel they can no longer solely rely on the U.S. as a security guarantee with a decreasing U.S. military presence in the region. So that's why in their joint statement, they talked about deepening cooperation and coordination in the field of defense. But even more notable was the language in the Chinese readout about the summit really highlighting the Saudis' support for China's efforts in de-radicalization and also the Saudis' opposition to outside interference in China's internal affairs in the -- in the name of human rights. Those are really thinly veiled references to China's policy on Xinjiang, where of course the U.S. has accused Beijing of committing genocide against its Muslim minorities. China has long denied that but having that kind of support from the world's preeminent Muslim power, A very important for Xi Jinping as something he could certainly use, Michael.",
