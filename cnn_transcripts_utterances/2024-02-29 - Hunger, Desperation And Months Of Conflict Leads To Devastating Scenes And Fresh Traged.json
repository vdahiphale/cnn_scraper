A toxic mix ofhunger, desperation and months of conflict has led to devastating scenes and fresh tragedy in Gaza. Gaza's health ministry says more than 100 civilians were killed when Israeli troops opened fire on crowds waiting for food in Gaza City. Video released by Israel shows people rushing towards aid trucks. A local journalist says the panic triggered by Israeli fire caused some trucks to ram into the crowds. Israel is saying that its troops felt under threat. Now, a warning here, some of the images are disturbing. In addition to the deaths, the Gaza health ministry says more than 700 people were injured. Video from the scene shows some of the dead being carried away in donkey carts. Scenes before the trucks moved in show a lot of people waiting in anticipation. U.N. experts have been repeatedly warning that Gaza is on the brink of famine. One man on the scene, before the chaos, explained the dire reality in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMJAD ELEWA (through translator):  I am not ashamed to say it. It's become normal because we have reached the level of famine. Tens of children have become martyrs because of the famine. I cannot wait until my child is martyred because of the famine. We all have reached the stage that we are not ashamed to go and get a bag of flour. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Meantime, a senior Hamas member warns today's incidentcould derail talks for a hostage deal and ceasefire. CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Washington, D.C., but let's begin with Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward, who is in London. So Clarissa, we're hearing two conflicting versions of what happened this morning, but it comes within hours of U.S. Aid Administrator Samantha Power's visit to one of the two border crossings there, where she implored Israel to increase the amount of aid going in and opening additional crossings. What more are we learning? What more are you hearing about what led up today's tragedy?",

But as you say, a different argument has to be made about who is actually ultimately responsible for what happens to avoid scenes like this on the ground. In terms of who these trucks were, Peter Lerner said that there are some 30 convoy trucks. They were international donors, that these trucks were private companies, it's what he said in the last hour. Alex, I want to get back to you, because we heard President Biden say briefly that he's been briefed on this, he's been made aware of this. And that it will definitely, in his words, have an impact on a ceasefire deal, which he gave a timetable for Monday, which surprised a lot of people. And that was even before this incident today. What more are we learning on that front?",

      "sentences": "And he has slightly walked that back as he left for Texas on the helicopter earliertoday. He said that Monday is almost certainly unlikely, but that hope springs eternal. And he acknowledged that what happened today will complicate the efforts to get to a ceasefire. I think the question that we're trying to answer today is, does it derail those talks? Hamas indicated that it may. I spoke with one senior administration official who indicated that they may accelerate these talks. What is clear in speaking with sources here in Washington is this adds more urgency to getting to a ceasefire. I think, Bianna, when we talk about this ceasefire deal, we talk about a pause in the fighting that is so desperately needed by those more than two million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip. We talk about the Israeli hostages who have been held for almost five months and their potential release. But a major component of this ceasefire deal that is being discussed is the need to get more aid into the Gaza Strip and get it to the people who need it. So, no doubt this is adding -- this is emphasizing the priority that these negotiators have in getting to that ceasefire that hopefully will come soon. Because, Bianna, it's not just about the amount of aid getting into Gaza. It's about where it's able to go. To add to what Clarissa was just saying, the two entry points going into Gaza are in the southern part of the Gaza Strip -- Rafah in Egypt and Kerem Shalom in Israel. And then, not only do they have to get into the southern part of Gaza, where oftentimes those aid trucks are swarmed, they then need to get farther north, where there are so many people who are not in the southern part of the Gaza Strip who so desperately need that aid. And that's what we saw today. So, what we've heard repeatedly from the Biden administration is not only does Israel need to allow more aid trucks to get into Gaza, but they also need to deconflict with those agencies, with those convoys to make sure that those trucks get to where that aid is desperately needed by people throughout the Gaza Strip. Now, we did hear from Lieutenant Colonel Lerner. He also agreed with that. He said that this aid needs to get where it's needed and that it needs to be facilitated. One thing Israel can do is open up more crossings. There's been discussion about Erez in the north or another crossing in the north. There are ways to get more aid into the Gaza Strip. And there is an onus on Israel to make sure that that aid gets to where it needs to be, whether there's a ceasefire in place or not. Bianna.",

And we know this is on the back of immense desperation because of a critical and lethal lack of aid getting in. We can talk spikes in child nutrition that are unprecedented. And we can point to why they're so much worse in the north. Where almost no aid is getting. So, yes, a level of desperation in terms of people on the ground. But then we do know that as families went to finally try and get some aid for their families, whatever happened there, they were fired upon. And now you have hundreds of wounded people going to hospitals that are non-functioning or at least not functioning in a way that can take hundreds of people with more of these bloodied wounds.",

We're seeing a very dangerous form of malnutrition in the north, around 15 percent in children, three times what it is in Rafah in the south. Again, clear evidence that when we're able -- when we are allowed to get in life- saving aid, it's making a difference and when we are not -- we're seeing these terrible spikes, which is, Bianna, feeding into what we've been warning about for months. It is not just the indiscriminate attacks from the sky, though it is certainly that. It is also now lack of water, disease spreading. Nine in ten children have had some sort of disease, we think, in the last few weeks, disease spreading and a lack of food and medicines.

Under the Trump administration, when you looked at the policy that they had, they had less than 1000 people and that was considered too many that were coming over. Why 5000? Why not 4000? Why not 1000? But if you're going to normalize a number, at least have it be a strong number. And what we're seeing coming out of the Senate Bill was not that at all. In addition, the dollars that he wanted to put into the additional agents were not going to be used to actually secure the border, but to more efficiently have illegal immigrants enter our country. If they were serious about it, they would end the catch and release program and they would re-evaluate their parole program, which is totally going against a congressional law that has been set by having mass paroles.

And we saw that in some of the statements after the review was released, but also in some of the questioning here. Crucially, it also didn't hold anybody accountable. What we saw from today's hearing was largely along party lines. Democrats may have been critical of the decision or the failure to notify the President and others in the administration about Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's hospitalization, but they, by and large, defended Austin and said there were more pressing concerns here to worry about from a national security perspective. Republicans went after Austin, first pressuring him on who is responsible here. Austin was pressed by one Republican about who failed here, to which he said, look, he went to the hospital and was in the critical care unit, and therefore it was on his staff to notify and put out the notification by the procedures. But when asked if somebody on his staff should be held accountable, Austin kind of waffled there and wouldn't say that there should be accountability here. The 30-day review backed him up on that point, not holding anybody responsible. So, some Republicans pressed on this point and said, look, we're going to keep going after this until somebody is held accountable here. Austin saying that there is a review going on from the DOD Inspector General, and they're working on improving the processes here. But that certainly didn't seem to alleviate the questioning on the breakdown in notification here and why it took days for President Joe Biden to know that Austin was in the hospital and why. So, there is still a lot of anger about the issues here. We'll see how this plays out, and we'll certainly have a chance here to ask the Pentagon in a press briefing. It is worth-noting, Bianna, that we'd expected this to go quite a bit longer, but the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee said they're limiting this to two hours because Austin is still recovering from the prostate cancer surgery and from the complications there.

At least 104 people were killed and nearly 800 others injured amid the ensuing chaos. Multiple eyewitnesses and a local journalist tell CNN that despite civilians -- the desperate civilians swarmed the aid trucks that had entered the city. And the journalist says that when the IDF opened fire, people tried to escape and many were run over by the trucks in the chaos. Israel says there were two separate incidents and the stampede happened first. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Clarissa Ward joins me now live in London. And Clarissa, as we discussed earlier in the hour, there are two conflicting reports. Put that aside, what that spokesperson just said, that the overwhelmed civilians were desperate, so desperate for aid that that in turn led to this terrible tragedy. And that once again describes the urgent need and the lack of nutrition, food, medical supplies that are facing civilians, especially in Northern Gaza.",

And I think, Bianna, you're hearing a lot of frustration from aid agencies that have really been sounding the alarm formonths now, saying that this sort of thing was bound to happen. They have experienced this when they try to move supplies, particularly to the north of Gaza, which is so isolated, which has been so hard hit. They are running into this all the time, not just looting, but also criminal gangs who are taking the aid and it's being sold in markets. That speaks to the absolute desperation of the situation on the ground, which is borne out in the numbers that we're hearing now, the U.N. talking about being one step away from a famine in Northern Gaza. One official telling me that six children died last week in one hospital in Northern Gaza of acute malnutrition and dehydration, that the rate among children of acute malnutrition is now 15 percent as compared to five percent in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. And all of this against the backdrop of a pretty drastic reduction in the amount of aid that has been getting in, 500 trucks a day before the war started, 250 trucks a day on a good day afterwards. And in the last week, there were four days where only 10 trucks of aid got in. And as you and I were discussing before, you know, USAID Head Samantha Power has been in Israel. She's been imploring. We had indications that the Israelis were planning to open another crossing -- another border crossing in the north to try to take some of the pressure off of the chokehold in Rafah and Kerem Shalom, and also to make it easier to get that aid into Northern Gaza because it is the most urgently needed there. So, at this stage, everyone really waiting to see whether this tragedy is going to become a watershed moment in some way, shape or form, and is going to precipitate some change to the status quo, which simply put, cannot sustain, Bianna.",

And he said it should be an international organization's responsibility in collaboration with Israel, but he said that they are looking to find the right solutions and that the food will be distributed to the right people. We're looking for different methods because we will see different steps and different actions in order to provide the food. And when I asked if that was imminent, the answer I got was that yes, that there are plans in the works. This was before today, so no doubt, Clarissa, this puts even more pressure on not only more aid coming in, but also more crossings being made available in which to bring in that aid.",

We see that there are other countries that are airdropping supplies during this desperation as well, and some asking if this puts more pressure on Egypt also to step in here. We are learning that Prime Minister Netanyahu is speaking at the moment, but it seems that he is addressing more internal domestic issues specifically related to his defense minister yesterday, saying that they will end draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox in Israel. But of course, we will bring you any comments that he makes with regards to this crisis that happened just hours ago in northern Gaza, this tragedy unfolding with over a hundred injured and killed.
