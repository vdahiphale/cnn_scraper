Longtime aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira allegedly tried to delete security camera footage at Donald Trump's request. De Oliveira has now been added to the case as a defendant. And prosecutors argue that he told the I.T. director at Mar-a-Lago that -- quote -- \"The boss wanted the server deleted.\" Trump is now also facing an additional charge for willfully retaining a top secret document about potential attack plans on Iran. That's the document that Trump allegedly was waving around and discussing with biographers during a taped meeting at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, all this as charges could come at any time in the special counsel's other investigation of Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And then there's this new, CNN video showing security barricades placed outside the Fulton County, Georgia, courthouse in downtown Atlanta. A charging decision against Trump and his allies over election interference is expected there just days from now. Let's discuss this and more with CNN's Evan Perez and Alayna Treene. Evan, let's start with you. What more do we know about this superseding indictment and the details in it?",

There's a 32nd document that has been added to the list of documents that he's alleged to have been willfully retaining, which is against the law.But we will read you just a part of the -- what prosecutors lay out here. So it's sort of like this very, very detailed picture of the former president and his two employees that they say were conspiring to try to delete, to try to delete surveillance footage after the FBI, after the Justice Department had requested access to that footage, which they knew had a clear view of the storage room where all those top classified documents were being stored. There is a part of it where De Oliveira is talking to a member of the I.T. team, and he wants the -- wants to know whether they can delete the footage. And he says -- De Oliveira, according to prosecutors, says -- De Oliveira then insisted to the Trump employee that the boss wanted the server deleted. And then he asked: 'What are we going to do?'\" The prosecutors really lay out chapter and verse. They seem to have a lot of information, perhaps from other witnesses, perhaps some of the footage that they have, of De Oliveira and Walt Nauta and some of these other people discussing how to delete the stuff and also how to keep De Oliveira on the team, to make sure that he doesn't turn against the former president.",

And so this really caught Trump off guard, and he's very frustrated by this, I'm told by many of his aides and allies and advisers. But, publicly, you're right, he's still using the same playbook that we have seen him use time and time again when talking about his mounting legal troubles. He had an interview last night with Breitbart where he railed against these charges. He called it election interference, that he's the target of political persecution, and also directly attacked special counsel Jack Smith. Let's listen to that exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Two essential elements of these -- this new superseding indictment, one, an alleged effort to delete evidence of a potential crime, and, two, some more details about this highly classified document he allegedly waved in front of people without security clearance. Paula, first, on the specific evidence, or at least the implication here, that he, in conjunction with one of his aides, tried to delete video surveillance footage showing that they were presumably trying to get rid of some of these documents here, what's the significance and what do we know, based on what we learned last night?",

It's really at the heart of prosecutors' case. Who do you see on their surveillance footage? Well, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. And the big question was, well, who was directing them to move these boxes, particularly one instance on this surveillance footage where they moved them out of a storage closet right before Trump's own lawyer went in there to look for classified documents? So the fact that not only is the former president being accused of trying to, again, obstruct his own obstruction. He also has a new co- defendant. And that's significant because it raises the possibility that the government could possibly get a cooperating witness here. There's been a lot of pressure on Carlos, just like there was on Walt Nauta, to cooperate with the government. So far, both of them have refused to do that. They both have lawyers who are paid for by a Trump-affiliated political action committee, and one of Trump's biggest tasks over the next year, not only is he trying to get back in the White House, but he's got to keep these two in the fold.",

They have now added it to the indictment.Interestingly enough, they have described this document as having been in Trump's possession until January of 2022, which is also the time he returned 15 boxes' worth of material back to the federal government. So it's likely that they found this document in those 15 boxes. Second, they'd have to get the intelligence community to approve the use of this document in the public prosecution, this procedure. It appears that they have now secured that approval. And, finally, you have to authenticate it by having someone, a witness who was there in the room, identify the document. So they likely have a witness who saw this document, then was shown the document by prosecutors, and said, yes, this is the document that I saw in his hand.It really closes the circle on this episode, and turns it into a very, very daunting thing for Trump to try to defend against.",

But, more importantly, number two, charging Trump with actively being engaged in the effort to suppress or destroy or conceal the videotapes shows a level of guilty knowledge.

They are looking at this more as a weaponization of the DOJ. They say Jack Smith has it out for Donald Trump.

And no matter how any rational person cannot see it that way, that's what they believe, and they're going to continue to stand by him.

I would assume Asa Hutchinson will do the same. I have talked with other campaigns. They're going to focus more on issues that are important to Iowa. Vivek Ramaswamy's team says he's going to focus on the economy, DeSantis looking at the more optimistic vision for the campaign and this country, and, Tim Scott, a new visionary outlook for the future. But Republican voters in Iowa, speaking with leaders and evangelical and party leaders, they're looking at the long game. They're not looking at who's the best to win the Iowa caucus. They're looking at who can win the general election. And Iowa has the distinct responsibility not just to pick the party's nominee, but to winnow the field to who is the best candidate to win in the general election. And that's what many of them are looking for, and, hopefully, more Republicans as we head into these early states -- I will tell you, the person I feel sorry for tonight at this dinner -- each candidate has 10 minutes to speak.

What does he need to do to distinguish himself? BARRON-LOPEZ:  Well, I was just talking to Republican strategist about this who says that, when DeSantis is going places, his events are very small and he's not getting that many -- that big of a draw to these places, compared to Trump, and that he's also surrounded more by Floridians than he is by any of the local state Republicans, which could be a problem for him when he's trying to win voters. Also, I think, speaking to what Alice and I have been talking about, which is that he's not going directly at Trump. He will occasionally sometimes take a small punch at the former president, and then he steps back. He also waffles on some of his policies. We saw that recently when he said he would put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of the CDC and then, a few days later said, never mind, I wouldn't do that. And so it feels as though he still is desperately trying to figure out what exactly he can say that will bring the Trump voters to his side, because, no matter what, there are a set of Republican voters that Alice is talking about that certainly want a totally different nominee.
