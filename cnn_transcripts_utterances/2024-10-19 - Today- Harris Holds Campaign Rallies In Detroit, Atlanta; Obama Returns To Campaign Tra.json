And later, a Muslim woman arrested during a pro-Palestinian protest is suing a sheriff's office in Tennessee. She says they forced her to remove her hijab for a mug shot and then published that photo. That woman and her attorney are here.All right, let's start the show. Well, first of all, to draw a crowd in Detroit or Atlanta is not Bruce Springsteen or Jon Bon Jovi getting the call. Check Vice President Harris' itinerary for guests today, pulling up to a rally with Lizzo in the Motor City and Usher in the A. Her running mate Tim Walz in North Carolina is doing the same thing, campaigning with Common. Seventeen days to the election, if the focus on Black voters by Democrats was not already obvious, the campaign says that tomorrow, Harris and Walz will be each attending services in Black churches. God is good, all the time. The campaign clearly thinks there's still work to do to get Black voters out to vote. Trump and Republicans sense there's an opening. Our first guest on this today are the co-hosts of \"Native Land Pod,\" Angela Rye, Tiffany Cross and Andrew Gillum, joining us from Detroit. The first stop on their podcast, bring it home toward. Tiffany, let me start with you, and good morning. I should have invited you all on the show long before now, but I'm glad you are on now. So Tiffany, let me start here. The Democrats concerns their fears of eroding Black support, specifically among Black men. Is it overblown? TIFFANY CROSS, CO-HOST, \"NATIVE LAND POD\": Absolutely. And first of all, Victor, hello for your show. I just want to say congratulations to you and thank you for centering the rising majority of this country on your programming. But absolutely it's overblown, and I find it quite offensive to be honest with you, Victor, because the people who are going to impact this election the most when it comes to Donald Trump are conservative White voters. The data just doesn't bear it out, Republicans got 12 percent of Black men in 2020 and they got 12 percent of Black men in 2016. I think when you see -- you know, reporters asking Black men, the immediate question should be, are you registered to vote? Did you vote in the last election? And so, I think that's narrative is attempting to lay the failure of this democracy at the feet of Black men. And I would no sooner lay this feet of the failure of this democracy as Black men than I would at Black women. When it comes to data, Black women are the highest number of ethnic voting block for Democrats. Black men, numerically are right behind that. And I think this narrative, to be honest with you, is because of the demographics of newsrooms. When you look at Black staff in the rooms, as you well know, Victor, it's 6 percent. When it comes to Black women, it's even less than 6 percent. So I hope that we can have more honest conversation when it comes to what this demographic looks like.",

      "sentences": "Yes, speaking of laying this at the feet of Black men and honest conversations, former President Obama was back out last night. This is the first time since he was in Pittsburgh and invoked the potential of sexism in his appeal to Black men to support the vice president. Angela, should there be a course correction because there was so much backlash to that framework. Was it a mistake for the former president to say what he did or to say it publicly? What was your assessment of what we heard from former President Obama?ANGELA RYE, CO-HOST, \"NATIVE LAND POD\": You know, I think that it's wonderful that President Obama is out hitting the trail for democracy, frankly. And what I think is a mistake is to let White folks escape the accountability that they must face for not showing up to save democracy themselves. Like they want to get mad at presidential candidates right when they don't wear a flag lapel pin or they don't see you pledging allegiance to the flag, that's what they want to get upset about. Now, the face of patriotism to them looks like trying to tear down the capitol in a terrorist attack on January 6, 2021. So the responsibility of saving democracy should be on the largest demographic in this country, that is White men and White women. I don't want to see a women's march with pussy hats come January if something doesn't go right. What I want to see is for them to march their selves to the polls, including today we are in Detroit, Michigan for an early vote rally. In Michigan, early voting starts next Saturday, which is my birthday, Victor.",

White women were 32 percent and voted in a larger percentage for former President Trump in 2020 than they did in 2016, that was after the Women's March. That was after the appointment of Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett. This was after the accusations from E. Jean Carroll.So as we see these Zoom calls, White Women for Harris, and the money raising and the signs and the population at the rallies, are you confident that there will be any reversal of the trend we saw from 2016 to 2020 among White women or White men, the White dudes for Harris, even?",

He went into a barber shop in the Bronx, and I know you have a concern about the media when they're going to find Black men going only to a barber shop, the breadth of our community and views. Let me play a bit of the moment and then I want to hear more your thoughts on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You guys are the same as me. It's the same stuff. We were born the same way. I grew up in Queens and all of that. I mean, you know, it's -- I had a great father. I had a father who was a great guy. He was tough, but good, big heart. Big, big heart. And he was a construction guy, pretty much, and a real estate guy. And I learned a lot from him. He was great. But I know you people so well. Without knowing you, I know you so well.

One of our friends -- Angela and I had a group chat, and one of our friends texted this morning that Donald Trump is worried about his freedom, Vice President Harris is worried about yours. He has no interest in our humanity at all.But I want to be clear, I completely understand and respect the sanctity of space, safe spaces for Black people, and certainly barbershops and hair salons are that. My challenge to the media is the same way that White voters have cute little colloquial nicknames, we say things like soccer moms and NASCAR dads, so too can names be applied to Black voters. And so, when you want to talk to Black people it is not -- it should not just be barbershops and beauty salons, but there's HBCU campuses. HU, Howard University's homecoming is this weekend. This is the Vice President's alma mater. Certainly folks there, of all walks of life, of all socioeconomic backgrounds, have something to contribute. And then there are also spaces for Black voters. Yes, churches count as well, but so often you see people going to diners in the middle of nowhere, what they call flyover states. Well, there are places like Detroit that's in a quote, unquote, \"flyover state.\" There's Cleveland, Ohio, that's in a flyover state. So there are different spaces I would challenge the media to explore and afford us the same depth and nuance that you have when you give to White voters. And I just want to piggyback on what Angela said when it comes to this broad coalition of voters. So somehow so many -- and racism is bipartisan. Don't get me wrong, none of us are mouthpieces for the Democratic Party. We've always voted for harm reduction, but there are so many pockets of voters. The Asian-American demographic is the fastest growing demographic in this country.",

You know, President Trump, his agenda is to finish, as I say, the unfinished business what we had in the previous administration. We had the record low black unemployment since 1972, recorded my lifetime. You saw the opportunity zones trying to go in and put some economic development in some underserved communities, which is a life support and building back generational wealth. And listen, I know Vice President Harris is 17 days, Victor. She -- it's -- it's a desperation trying to just throw something out there to try to get black folks.

We were referred to the Knox County Law Director's Office that told us they do not comment on pending litigation and added our response to the lawsuit will be filed in court.

Layla, let me start with you, because I -- I think most people understand that your hijab is part of your faith.

But the first thing that I want your viewers to understand is that when the government runs an institution like a jail, if it wants to burden someone's sincerely held religious beliefs, then it needs to have a compelling reason for doing so, and needs to do so in the least restrictive way possible. There simply is no compelling governmental reason to publish a Muslim woman's uncovered booking photo under circumstances like this. As -- as you mentioned, this exact sheriff's office had a policy against doing so, as do other sheriff's offices in Tennessee and across the country, including in conservative places like Rutherford County now, including in Davidson County here in Nashville, where I am.
