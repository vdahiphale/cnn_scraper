I was following his directions, Cohen claimed in day one of his testimony, the Trump explicitly ordered him to pay Stormy Daniels, the adult film star and director, to keep quiet. And Cohen also claimed that the reason was not to protect Trump's family, but to prevent voter backlash just weeks ahead of the 2016 election. Today we anticipate the prosecution the dive deeper into the details about how Trump repaid Cohen, who fronted the money used to allegedly by Stormy Daniels' silence. And then proceedings promise to turn extremely heated with cross examination. Inside the court expect defense attorneys to attempt to dismantle Cohen's credibility. Outside the court, expected a growing list of Trump allies, including the Republican speaker of the House, to do what Trump cannot do, attack the witnesses. CNN's reporters are inside the courtroom to bring you every important update from this historic hush money cover up trial. Let's get right to CNN's Elie Honig at the magic wall.

This is according to Michael Cohen. I'm not saying it's a fact. I'm saying according to Cohen. And, in fact, Cohen testified that he asked what - to Trump what Melania's reaction would be when the Stormy payment was made. And Trump said, according to Cohen, quote, \"don't worry. He goes, how long do you think I'll be on the market for. Not long. He wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.\"Again, good evidence if you consider Michael Cohen to be a credible witness. WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, FORMER TRUMP PAYROLL CORP. ATTORNEY: Right. I agree, Jake. And I think that any married individuals, especially married men, on that jury will say that this doesn't pass the smell test. I mean, you know, I think there was another quote in there that Cohen attributed to Trump that sounded - said something, it's going to hurt me with women. Going to hurt him with one particular woman, Melania Trump. And even if you take the, you know, the love and marriage aspect out of it, there's a huge financial risks there. And I think it's so long ago. I think his son was only a baby. So, it's ludicrous to say that - for Cohen to say that there was no import to Trump about the impact it would have on his marriage. You know, these two things, Jake, are not mutually exclusive. And I think that's where people are getting hung up. If that jury gets back there and says, well, he was worried about his marriage and his family, and he was worried about his presidential campaign, and they don't think that the primary worry was the presidential campaign, I don't think it gets to the second crime and I don't think it gets it to the felony.",

But as long as they're both substantial, it's not even a question of which is more prevalent in his mind, as long as they're both substantial, that's enough.But Bill makes a good point, we are about to get into a sort of dicey - and Elliot makes the same point - dicey area of campaign finance law. And we've had reporting, and I've -- maybe Jamie's report on this, that both sides are considering calling a campaign finance expert. That would scare me as a prosecutor because, you know what the answer is to almost every hypothetical you pose to a campaign finance expert? Well, it depends. It's subjective. Youd have to look at all the facts. And as a prosecutor, that's poison. You don't want the jury going back there going, I don't know, it's a - it's a riddle, it's a mind bender.

So, now prosecutors are going to have to walk him through this alleged conspiracy. What he heard from Trump. What he saw. His own even falsified invoices that he submitted. Walk him through all of those checks that he received over the course of that year.Then it is likely that they will have to walk him through some pretty uncomfortable subjects, including his lengthy criminal record and also the fact that he has spent years attacking the defendant. The reason prosecutors are going to want to talk about that is because we know the defense attorneys are going to talk about that and you don't want Todd Blanche to be able to debut these in front of the jury.

Because right now, Jake, throughout the course of the trial it doesn't seem to be moving the fundamentals of the race at all. And I'm not sure that it will. You made the point of comparing it to the other case, which, by the way, are not likely to see a jury before Election Day, or get tried before Election Day. And so this may be the only one. And so the fact - that comparison sort of goes away because it may be the only one before election day. That doesn't mean that the stakes are small. The stakes are large. This is a former president of the United States and a presumptive Republican nominee, sitting through what is now the most consequential week of his life as a criminal defendant. I mean that - that - that is high stakes. There's no doubt about that. And I do think we sometimes undercount just the targeted voters in the middle, independents in these battleground states that turned away from sort of Trump chaos in '18 and '20 and '22. It's hard to imagine that this brings them back in some way. And so if it keeps those voters at arm's length from Donald Trump, that doesn't serve him well in this scenario. But we truly don't know. And I think we have to wait and see, which is enormously frustrating, obviously, for - for the Biden campaign, for the Trump campaign, and for those of us that cover and observe this.",

And it's Weisselberg, according to the prosecution, it's Weisselberg calculating how to pay Michael Cohen back the $130,000 he pays Stormy Daniels, allegedly. $50,000 he paid this firm called Red Finch that was cooking all these bogus online polls on behalf of Donald Trump in 2016. So, that's $130,000 plus $50,000 equals $180,000.He doubles it so as to have Michael Cohen not have to pay the taxes on it. And then there's additional money because Michael Cohen was really upset that he got stiffed out of a good Christmas bonus in 2016. And then it says at the bottom of it, wire monthly from DJT. And this buttress the argument that he was paid back by Donald Trump for the hush money payment, and it was just this scheme to cover it up by having it look like he was just being paid a monthly fee.",
