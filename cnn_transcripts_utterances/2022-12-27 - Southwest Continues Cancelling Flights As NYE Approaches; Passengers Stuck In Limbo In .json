One major U.S. carrier is the big source of a nationwide headache.Plus, incoming Congressman George Santos says, he should get a pass for lying about virtually every single detail of his resume because not telling the truth is not a crime. And new CNN exclusive reporting about why you'll pay less at the pump now but should be preparing for more pain in the spring. This is what we're watching At This Hour. We begin this hour with the blame game playing out at Southwest Airlines, thousands of stranded travelers just want to get where they are going but bad weather, bad planning and bad systems mean more than 2500 Southwest flights grounded today so far. That's around 90 percent of all flights canceled in the U.S. Southwest passengers can't get through to customer service. And its employees are struggling to speak to the people in charge.

This one came in such amounts over such a long period of time where there were just whiteout conditions. It was just really brutal.I want to give you an idea of what sort of downtown Buffalo looks like right now. We're on Pearl Street and looking downtown there. You can just see the massive amounts of snow off to the side. The 28th that are dead in Erie County, they actually subtracted two from the total because the medical examiner said they had died from natural causes, and they added three. So, there were three more individuals announced dead in Erie County today. So that brings it to 28 for Erie County, 29 for the area because there was one person in Niagara County that was using a generator and the snow around it created a carbon monoxide sort of cave or capsule and that carbon monoxide ended up killing somebody in their home who was using a generator. So, authorities here warning people to be very, very cautious of all of that. It is amazing to see Buffalo like this, I've been up here many times, this should be a very, very busy area. And to see the city just completely socked in. The problem now is tomorrow it's going to be almost 40 degrees here. Friday, it's going to be up over 40 - and excuse me, Thursday up over 40, and then by Friday, it's going to be up about 50 degrees and rain. So, all those massive amounts of snow that you see along the roads here, they have to get rid of that because if it blocks up the drains, they're now concerned about flooding. Amara?",

They could do their own investigation, their own probe and make a decision about how they wanted to go forward. That committee it's evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Another option for McCarthy is he could just choose not to seat Santos on any of the committees at his disposal. Now, typically, a freshman member coming in, to office wouldn't have their choice of select committees. But that could be another way to punish him.
