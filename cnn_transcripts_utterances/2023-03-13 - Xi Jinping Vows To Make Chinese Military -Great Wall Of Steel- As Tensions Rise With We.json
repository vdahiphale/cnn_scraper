The National People's Congress wrapped up its session just a few hours ago, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. consolidating his grip on power in the first speech of his unprecedented third presidential term, Mr. Xi vowed to build the country's army into a quote Great Wall of Steel and reunite Taiwan with the motherland.Well, at the end of the parliamentary session, China's new Premier Li Qiang held his first news conference since taking the post. U.S. President Joe Biden will host the British and Australian leaders in the coming hours for a meeting of the AUKUS group, an emerging Defense Partnership, viewed as a bid to counter China in the Pacific. The UK's Rishi Sunak and Australia's Anthony Albanese are visiting the U.S. for the first time since becoming prime ministers. Sources tell CNN that the men will announce Australia's plan to buy at least four nuclear powered submarines from the U.S. along with development of a new class of nuclear powered subs. Let's take you now to Beijing, CNN's Steven Jiang is standing by. Steven, the Premier held his first press conference. What did he say?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Laila, that event and performance actually in many ways, was more closely monitored by many China watchers than the Xi Jinping speech, because as you mentioned, it was his debut press conference and up till recently, Li Qiang was a rather obscure figure outside of China, mostly known to be a close outline protege of President Xi Jinping. And of course, more recently, the party, the communist party boss of Shanghai, who oversaw that city's a brutal two month lockdown during the pandemic.But as he pointed out several times during the press conference, before the pandemic, he actually ran for years some of the country's most economically diverse and advanced economies, not just Shanghai, but some of its neighboring provinces. And actually before COVID, he was often known as one of the more pragmatic and pro-business provincial leaders. So obviously, he was trying to offer a reassurance to a to a global audience at a time when he is now tasked to run the world's second largest economy without any national governance experience, at a time when this economy, of course, is facing strong headwinds, both domestically and internationally. So he mostly stuck to the script and is saying all the right things, including his commitment to economic reform, and welcoming foreign investments, for example, but the issue here, of course, in today's Chinese political environment, it's very much a one man show and all the key decision making is now in the hands of Xi Jinping. So whether or not Li Qiang closeness to the President would have made wouldn't make any difference remains to be seen. But the one thing that's really clear out of the NPC this year, of course, Xi Jinping's overarching policy of reasserting the party's dominant controlling every aspect of Chinese society, including the economy that very much remains the same.

That will be followed a decade or so later by the acquisition of Virginia class submarines by Australia, having worked to supplement the production capability in the United States.And then following that will be a jointly developed submarine that includes technology from the United States centered on a British model, a student (ph) class submarine that's more in the keeping of Australia's numbers of sustainable submariner crew. So this is about nuclear propulsion for the Australian Navy. But it's also about a range of other technologies about hypersonics, about collaboration between these three trusted partners on advanced weapons systems.

The announcement came in a joint statement between the Treasury Department, FDIC and Federal Reserve where they also revealed the closure of a second bank Signature Bank, which is based in New York. Officials said that the same protections being offered to depositors with Silicon Valley Bank would also be extended to that bank as well. It came at a time where there were many questions for depositors about whether they would have access to their money. The FDIC only previously insured up to $250,000 being held at the bank and the majority of customers had more money than that in their accounts. Ultimately, this move will ensure that all depositors will be able to access their money at a time when there were questions about how people would run their businesses and also how they would meet payroll heading into this week. Now, federal officials worked around the clock over the weekend trying to find some resolution to the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. One avenue that was also being pursued was trying to find a private buyer to purchase the assets of Silicon Valley Bank. Treasury officials said that they were evaluating those bids but ultimately decided to move quickly as they were watching this situation quickly unfold and they wanted to offer some assurances to those customers who had been working with Silicon Valley Bank. Now Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier on Sunday that there would no -- there would not be a wide scale, large bailout of the bank similar to what was seen during the 2008 financial crisis. Treasury officials pushed back on the idea that this was a bailout, saying that the burden will not be borne by the taxpayers and also noting that shareholders and senior management would not be protected by these new rules. Now, ultimately, the White House and the Biden administration has tried to stress that they believe that the banking system in this country is resilient, in part due to those reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. President Biden told reporters as he was traveling back from Delaware on Sunday that he would talk about this issue on Monday morning as his White House is trying to ensure that there are not more stresses put on the U.S. banking system and the U.S. economy writ large.

Freddy actually originated early February just off the coast of Indonesia traveled across the Indian Ocean made three separate landfalls during its lifespan. And we're talking about over a 35-day period where this storm has been named incredible. Only four storms have traversed the entire Indian Ocean, Freddy being one of them.

It dance this way made another landfall in southern Mozambique, edge this way closer to Madagascar once again, and then curved right back towards central and northern Mozambique. And that's where we find it now it made another landfall on March 11, with winds of 150 kilometers per hour. And to put this into perspective, Mozambique only receives two to three storms of winds of 120 kilometers per hour or more per decade. And it did it at least once with the first landfall actually being slightly weaker than that. But nonetheless, we still got that landfalling tropical cyclone in excess of 120 kilometers per hour. Rain has been impressive there, accumulating over 100 millimeters in some instances. And unfortunately there is more wet weather in store that means landslides, and mudslides will be possible across the mountainous regions of Malawi. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But here's what else is in play here -- the battle between impartiality and free speech. This past week, British government announcing its controversial new asylum seeker policy, with the home secretary saying, quote, \"They will not stop coming here until the world knows that if you went to Britain illegally, you will be detained and swiftly removed back to your country if it is safe, or a safe third country, such as Rwanda. In response, Lineker on Twitter, \"This is just unimaginably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.\" The BBC which is Britain's public broadcast and bound by what it calls impartiality, saying the 62-year-old presenter breached its social media guidelines by criticizing government policy. Lineker seen in London on Sunday, out walking his dog, and in Leicester on Saturday when he attended one of his former team's Premier League fixtures. So what happens next. Well we've seen programming disrupted with \"Match of the Day's\" replacement on Saturday night airing with no presenter, no pundits, and no match commentary. Well on Sunday, the BBC telling CNN it will continue to show football match highlights without announcers or pundits. This after so many former players who act as pundits on the show came out in support of Lineker. And Sunday's \"Match of the Day\" to show also following the same format as Saturdays programming. The BBC says Lineker, who's a freelance broadcaster for the corporation has quote, \"stepped back\" as they put it, from presenting until this what it calls an agreed and clear position on his use of social media.

I direct House of Hope International. We work in Nicaragua, Honduras and Bolivia. Last year we were celebrating my freedom day, and we are scheduled to speak at several public schools near the home where we work with adolescent girls coming out of trafficking. So we went into the school and my coworker, who was a human trafficking survivor, told her story to the girls. And then, I explain to them what trafficking is, and I told them it was a trap. One little girl came forward and said, oh, my sister's already gotten caught in this trap. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her realize what her sister had been going through, and what was the reality of her sister's life. And that brought about two young women, maybe into our home -- one who was the older sister of one of the girls that was there on my freedom day, another was a girl who had been kicked out of school because she was being prostituted out. My Freedom Day was the absolute catalyst that brought about that event. Now, our focus had been visiting brothels and street corners in places where the women would be in prostitution where we could talk to them. But most of those women had been trafficked a number of years ago. But we've never had an opportunity before My Freedom Day to reach out to little girls in school. And so we have, within the last several months, uncovered a large group, at least 16 underage girls, elementary and middle school girls, that are being trafficked. They were identified because of one girl that was a friend of one of the girls who came into our home because of My Freedom Day. But we're speaking in that school this year on My Freedom Day. So there may be many more than the 16 that we identified. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
