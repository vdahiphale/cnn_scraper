Good morning and welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and around the world, great to be with you today, I'm Rahel Solomon. Let's start here, Donald Trump's legal team has until this afternoon to meet a judge's deadline. This is in a case over his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Although, prosecutors want to limit what Trump can say about evidence he receives during discovery. And a judge has ordered Trump's side to respond to that request. This is all part of an escalating back-and-forth that included Trump making threats and insults at the Justice Department Saturday night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump called him, quote, \"mentally ill\", as well as \"deranged\". Now, the former president also made an appeal to Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He argued that they needed to step up and do something in order to help defend him against his recent legal matters. But one big thing that I find to be different from his speech on Saturday is it came less than 24 hours after Jack Smith wrote in a court filing asking a judge to set limits on what Trump's team can do with the evidence shared in the election subversion case. Now, a judge ultimately ruled on Saturday that Donald Trump's team must respond to that proposal by Monday afternoon. But there are a lot of questions going into Saturday night. Whether Donald Trump's team would encourage him to change his rhetoric in light of that court filing. But clearly, he did not. Alayna Treene, CNN, Columbia, South Carolina. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, that may just mostly be an acknowledgement that their client Donald Trump can't stop himself or help himself or at least, he won't stop himself from talking about the evidence publicly. But in any case, the judge is going to have to weigh a couple of different things. She has to ensure that the defense and the defendant has his rights protected to review the discovery and work with his lawyers to defend himself. But also that other people are protected. And we know that this defendant has a long history of threatening and intimidating witnesses which obviously tampers with the justice system as well as putting people at actual risk of physical harm. So, the judge will rail at these issues, and she may tinger a bit with what the government proposed, but I think in the end, she will enter some sort of protective order here.

If there is speech, then it is protected, but criminal speech is not protected and our fraud laws and our conspiracy laws are constantly using speech as part of the evidence to prove crimes.
