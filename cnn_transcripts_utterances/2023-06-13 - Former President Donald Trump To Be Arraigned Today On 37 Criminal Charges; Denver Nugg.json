To be able to at least show to the jury look, when you look at these documents you're going to see why they shouldn't have just been laying around in a bathroom at Mar-a- Lago. But there are also a lot of different agencies who have an interest in this. We saw this big list in the indictment of all of the different agencies who have some kind of interest in the intelligence that was collected. So they have to go through with these agencies and essentially whittle down what are the documents that we feel comfortable listing in these indictments? What documents will we feel comfortable sharing with the jury? And that's a hard conclusion to reach.

Marlin -- excuse me, Merrick Garland -- he serves at the pleasure of the President of the United States. Before this even indictment came down it was thought that hey, listen -- this is going to be the attorney general going after the main competitor of President Biden. Now, Trump can pretend to have had an epiphany that this -- oh, this might be the circumstances now, but that was the whole contemplated reason to have Jack Smith there. I think staying out of the limelight, having the indictment speak for itself, having the eventual report come out as well is going to be very key. Also, not just reputation-wise but because you've got a jury pool to consider here. Everyone in Florida, right now, likely is going to know about this case. It's not going to be a situation where you say I've never heard of it. Has the former president been ever even charged? It will be can I believe that I can be impartial here? And I want to just say while we're talking about a presumption of innocence, that's so important, but a presumption of innocence does not mean a presumption of corruption at the Department of Justice. They've got to prove their case. There's a burden of proof. But we cannot assume by virtue of the fact that this is a political figure being charged that it means that politics was at play.",

It's led to paranoia, consternation among these groups. By the way, the FBI doesn't mind that one bit -- the infighting with these groups. But they're looking for these threats. I think what concerns me looking today, two things. First, the unknown, right? Any time you have a situation that can be volatile what could happen, right? But secondly, we still don't know if there's going to be this co- mingling of the pro-Trump supporters and the anti-Trump supporters. In so many protests we've covered they'll have some standoff that will set them apart. They can scream at each other if they want.
