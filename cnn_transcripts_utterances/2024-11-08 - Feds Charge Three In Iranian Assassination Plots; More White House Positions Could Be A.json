He says that he was tasked by the IRGC to find ways to kill Donald Trump. Again, that's back in -- that's in October 7, just weeks before the U.S. presidential election. And he said he didn't have -- essentially he didn't have enough time to come up with a plot according to his own conversations that he had voluntarily with the FBI over the last few weeks.Now, according to the FBI, this is a plot that spans -- it's much bigger than just Donald Trump. The top victim that they had in mind and who he recruited people to try to assassinate was Masih Alinejad, who is a journalist that you've spoken to on this program a number of times.",

And according to prosecutors and according to the FBI, Shakeri basically reached out to a couple people he had served time with in U.S. prison before he was deported back to Iran. And he worked with them to come up with this idea of surveilling her, going to speeches where she was speaking at Fairfield University in Connecticut. There's pictures of her front door that they took.We also see in these -- in the court documents, you'll see pictures of some of the firearms that they had. These are images recovered from their Google accounts, according to the FBI. Now, again, part of this is a broader issue for the Iranians. Right? They're targeting people like Alinejad, who is a dissident, someone who is a critic, a vocal critic of the Iranian regime. But they also were targeting, obviously, Donald Trump, people associated with the Trump administration in other plots. And according to the FBI, Shakeri was also trying to come up with a way to assassinate two U.S. Jewish businessmen in New York. They were going to be paid $500,000 to carry out one of those assassinations. And also on the list, Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. That prompted the U.S. and the Israeli government to warn tourists going to Sri Lanka as a result of this. Now, two of these people are U.S. citizens, they were arrested. They're in U.S. custody. They were presented to court, and they're going to be held pending trials. Shakeri is still in Tehran and is at large. He's not been arrested obviously.",

It's why the Secret Service had more counter sniper teams than usual at that site. Then on September 11, an individual named Merchant from Pakistan with Iranian ties was arrested and charged with trying to organize a plot to kill politicians, powerful Americans, whether that was John Bolton, Mike Pompeo or Donald Trump, trying to recruit people. And then we see this one. So, this is the third or fourth, depending, not counting other Iranian assassination plots on the ground in the U.S., so quite determined.",

Obviously, he ran against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, but ever since he dropped out, he's been a major surrogate of Donald Trump's. He was even briefly under consideration for the running mate position. Of course, ultimately, Donald Trump went with J.D. Vance. But Burgum has very much stayed within the fold.Trump, you know, his jokes, called him Mr. Secretary. He wanted him to be the Energy secretary. I am told that is not a position that Doug Burgum is interested in. He has politely said, you know, that's really not the route I'd like to go down. And so what we're hearing right now is that they're considering making him this Energy czar position. And obviously, Energy is something that Donald Trump is caring a lot about. He has said that on day one, Drill, Baby, Drill is going to be one of his top priorities. So something that he's really been putting a lot of focus on is what this energy portfolio is going to look like in a second Trump term. And he's considering this role for Doug Burgum. He's also considering bringing back other people who were there before. Dave Bernhardt from the Interior Department, Andrew Wheeler, who was in charge of the EPA when Donald Trump was last in office. Those are all names that are on the list, I'm told. And so, that's an important portfolio of how it's shaping up. Because, Jake, those are some of the first actions we could see Donald Trump taking when he's in office. I'm told they already have executive orders and regulation reversals ready to go. Obviously, when Biden took office, you saw him reversing a lot of what Trump did on the climate and energy front, expect that to go basically back where it was when Donald Trump takes office in January.",

And also what that actually looks like, Jake, because I talked to Chad Wolf last night, who, as you know, was the acting Secretary of Homeland Security the last time Trump was in office. And he was saying essentially, you know, this is already what they're doing in terms of ICE deporting violent criminals. He was arguing that they're not doing it aggressively enough under the Biden- Harris administration and that that's what would change.But I think it's a real question of one, logistically, what this would look like. Would it involve local police, the National Guard, this kind of roundup that they have described as this mass deportation. But remember, Trump has faced criticism even from some Republicans over not carrying out his immigration pledges his first time in office. Governor Ron DeSantis said, you know, he deported fewer people than President Obama did. And so I do think that's a big question. But obviously, immigration was a huge thing on voters' minds, and it was a huge pledge from Donald Trump. So, that's a question of whether or not it is fulfilled and if it happens as quickly as we hear. Often candidates on the campaign trail say, I'm going to do this on day one.

Obviously, Marco Rubio has been a big surrogate of Donald Trump's. He was also briefly in the running to BVP, and he certainly wants the Secretary of State position. But there are others who are in that role vying for it. And so, when I talk about these alliances that are being formed behind the scenes, while some people are advocating for one position and trying to get others to help them advocate, that's kind of exactly what you're seeing play out. So, whether or not he ultimately gets it remains to be seen. But we should expect, Jake, a lot of these decisions are going to be made in the coming days and coming weeks.

Just today, Donald Trump on Truth Social posted that he would not sell his stake in his social media company. CNN is reporting that post alone boosted the value of the stock, adding half billion dollars to Donald Trump's net worth. So what are the landmines that President Trump and the -- President-elect Trump and the American people should be looking out for?Here now is \"New York Times\" investigated reporter Russ Buettner. He has written extensively about President-elect Trump's finances. So, Russ, thanks for joining us. There's a lot to cover because he has so many investments and so much wealth. But what are the biggest potential conflicts you see as Mr. Trump prepares to return to Washington? RUSS BUETTNER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, I think the biggest ones are the ones that will put the most money in his pockets and because of the nature of his businesses and that he's chosen not to divest in those businesses in the past and seems unlikely to do that in the future, the biggest ones are the categories that just look like regular business transactions. And there's really nothing that the public would even necessarily know, sometimes for a year or two, maybe not forever. I think one of the biggest ones would be new licensing deals. Those require very little work by the Trump family. They were once like their greatest source of wealth. In 2010 alone, Trump Organization reported on their tax returns, which we obtained $30 million in pure profits just from licensing and endorsement deals. That money mostly evaporated as the popularity of \"The Apprentice\" dwindled and especially after he announced his candidacy in ways that turned off a lot of people that he had deals with it basically like ended. And so he needs to kind of fill that. And those can bring a rush of millions of dollars right away, some of it structured four years later. Another one would be to just host big events at some of his properties. LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia backed golf tournament is already doing that.",

Well, that very much is like Twitter. The former Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership, now called X.Truth Social has basically become a baby X. So what is its reason for existing? It's not very clear. It has revenue of about $4 million a year. That's roughly the same as a standalone Chick-Fil-A restaurant. Not a remarkable thing, but yet it has a valuation in the billions of dollars. It will be very easy for someone to make an offering for all their outstanding stock at something larger than what it's trading at and put literally billions of dollars in Donald Trump's pockets. And very difficult to untangle whether that was just a straight business decision or whether they were trying to curry favor with him. You could also just buy ads on Truth Social. They don't sell many ads, obviously, from their revenue. And you could greatly enhance the stock if you just bought $10 million in ads, that would almost triple their revenue for the year.",

And how can people rightly not think that influence, that's going to somehow influence the decisions that he makes going forward?

I have one of the largest Jewish communities in America in my district. And, you know, I think the work that we did over the last two years really paid off.

The fact that I was able to get legislation passed in a divided government, 10 bills, five of which were signed into law by President Biden. So I think we did the job.

When these asylum and parole cases are finally heard, 70 plus percent of them are rejected, Jake.And so, you have a major problem here on several fronts. Number one, the parole and asylum process is fundamentally broken. Number two, you have the fact that criminals were allowed to enter into the country, people who were previously convicted of murder or rape or assault in their country of origin. You have people who are committing crimes here in the United States. You have precincts in midtown Manhattan where three quarters of the people being arrested are migrants.

A source tell CNN that Elon Musk joined President-elect Trump calls with -- President-elect Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week. A story first broken by CNN contributor and Axios reporter Barak Ravid. CNN's Nic Robertson is in CNN's London bureau right now. And Nic, these three men haven't exactly seen eye to eye during Russia's more than two-year onslaught on Ukraine. Tell us more. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. and what -- we don't know exactly what was said in that conversation, but we can easily imagine what President Zelenskyy would have felt having Elon Musk join call. Look, Elon Musk, his SpaceX company owns and runs the satellite communications system Starlink. That is the -- one of the most fundamental and important pieces of -- of hardware that the Ukrainian military has on the ground in Ukraine to fight that war. So if you're a president or President-elect Donald Trump and you're looking at a way to signal to the Ukrainian president that maybe that war is going to have to come to an end on terms that are not favorable to you and this is pretty much what President-elect Donald Trump has indicated already. A way of signaling that is to have Elon Musk be on that phone call because in a switch he can take down that -- that -- that system. No amount of weapons flowing into Ukraine can be useful if you don't have the communications at the battlefront. This isn't, of course, the only challenge that Donald Trump is going to face as he tries to figure out how to end that war in Ukraine with Russia's illegal occupation of parts of it in a day, as he stated. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Raging Wars in Ukraine and the Mideast, an informal alliance of enemies, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are the obvious changes in world order, President-elect Donald Trump inherits. Less talked about since he left office in 2021, the political weakening of some of his former putative allies, particularly in Europe. Elections in France undermined President Emmanuel Macron's standing. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has a tanking economy and a collapsing governing coalition. Both of these E.U. powerhouses losing political ground to right wing populists who are on the rise across Europe. In Italy, a right wing populist, Giorgia Meloni won elections, is a fan of Trump.
