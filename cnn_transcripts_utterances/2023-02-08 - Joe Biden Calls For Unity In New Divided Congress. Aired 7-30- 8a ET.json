That former assistant district attorney is Mark Pomerantz, an expert on white collar crime with a ton of experience prosecuting and defending organized crime cases.Pomerantz says that if prosecutors were looking at similar evidence against anyone other than the former president, charges would have been brought in a flat second. He also compares Trump to John Gotti, the head of the Gambino organized crime family. The book is a searing criticism of Manhattan's current DA Alvin Bragg's decision not to bring charges last year, a decision that Pomerantz resigned over one year ago this month. But Bragg says that Mr. Pomerantz's plane wasn't ready for takeoff. And that it's appalling that he insulted the skill and professionalism of our prosecutors.
