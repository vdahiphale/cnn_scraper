      "sentences": "And welcome back to our special coverage of Donald Trump's Manhattan hush money trial. It is the first ever criminal trial of a former president.I'm Erin Burnett outside the courthouse in New York. And Wolf Blitzer, of course, is with me from our nation's capital today. So far, the judge has heard heated arguments over evidence and Trump's social media posts, as the former president was seated with his defense attorneys. He's been in the room all morning. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records stemming from payments that were made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, those payments allegedly made to stop her from speaking publicly about their alleged affair. Prosecutors say the six-figure sum was part of an illegal scheme to hide damaging information from voters in 2016. It is the motive and that reason that is at the heart of this case. Trump pleads not guilty. And in moments, the courts will -- court will reconvene. There's been a lunch break, jury selection still on the agenda. Our reporters have been in the room and have been covering all angles of this here in Manhattan. And Kara Scannell was in that courtroom all morning. So, Kara, what was it like? Tell us.",

      "sentences": "So, Donald Trump was in the courtroom today for what ended up being a lot of back-and-forth between the attorneys and not yet the start of jury selection. But Trump was there. He was paying close attention to what was happening.At times, I saw him pass a note to his attorney, who received it, looked at him and nodded. There was a lot of engagement there. He also was reacting, but in a quieter way than what we see from Trump other times. You could see his facial expressions. He was biting his lower lip, though he didn't speak audibly or make any grand gestures inside the courtroom. This, though, is the first day of this trial. And Trump is there. He intends to be here for every day of the trial. And what was very interesting is that we learned that Trump wants to go up to every sidebar if the judge has a one-on-one discussion with a client. That is something that defendants usually almost always waive, that their attorneys go up and the prosecution goes up, but Trump's lawyers saying he wants to go in the one-on-ones, the close proximity with the jurors, the prospective jurors, as they are asked more intimate questions that the judge finds that they don't have to express in open court. So it's a significant, kind of unusual development, Erin.",

His involvement and his -- the intensity with which he is trying to thrust his involvement onto center stage has been a focal point, not just of his legal strategy and his lawyers, as they have sought to delay, as they have sought to battle every little piece of every single proceeding. But, also, it's critical for what he's trying to portray on the campaign trail as well, that he is not only involved, but this is very much about him. This is his fight.

So, these are issues that are sensitive, that may have to deal with some evidence that's being brought up, an objection that is made.

It's not necessarily improper, because a defendant, Donald Trump or anyone else, does have a very broad constitutional right to participate in his own defense. Now, what happens at those sidebars is the follow-up questioning to the questionnaire that Laura was just talking about, the follow-up questioning asked by the lawyers and the judge. And if I had to put myself in Trump's position strategically, I imagine he's got a couple of objectives, one, as Phil Mattingly was saying before, to make his presence felt, not necessarily in an improper way. But, look, he's a powerful, charismatic, whether you love him or hate him, figure. And the other is maybe to get a direct sense of the person. Am I getting positive vibes? Did the person give me a look that maybe suggests to me that he or she is in my corner? So I think that's the strategy behind it. I do remain skeptical whether he's going to want to do it.

This is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill, boring tax case. This is deeply personal, deeply personal to the former president. So this could impact him in some ways. And, also, we do not know that past is prologue here. What I mean by that is, for the last year, every time Donald Trump has been in the courtroom, if it's in New York or Atlanta or elsewhere, his base has rallied behind him. We're at a different point and a different moment now, the general election campaign. A larger audience is watching this. So the reality is, we should say up front we do not know much about the politics of this. Of course, there are politics of this. It's essentially going to change the moment of the presidential campaign, but we do not know the outcome of this. And there are so many intricacies, interwoven developments here.

The other thing I wanted to add and ask Laura is, when it comes to the jury pool, Trump has always criticized the location of courts because he will say, I can't get a fair trial because of the jury, because of the judge. But, in this case, you're talking about the most famous person in the world who -- whose allegations against him have been reported ad nauseam.

So, there is a sense in the region at the moment of nervousness that Israel could respond quickly. But we have heard from members of the war cabinet, like Benny Gantz, like Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, saying that they would like to build support, a coalition of support, to try to isolate Iran. So, the question is, will it be a military response, which is what Israel is weighing, or will it -- or will it be a -- or will it be a diplomatic response? So, that really seems to be the question at the moment. And when it comes to -- when it comes to Gaza at the moment, more aid did get into the north.

So, when you're looking at Saudi Arabia, that area doesn't have as many proxy forces, but they respond to the proxy forces that are coming out of Yemen, the Houthis. Then you also have proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, and some sleeper cells in Jordan, as well as, of course, Hezbollah in Lebanon. So all of those forces are arrayed against Israel, and they're doing basically what Iran wants them to do against the Israeli state.",

And both in the first Gulf War and in the second Gulf War, what the Iraqis did was, they launched Scuds against Israel. In the first Gulf War, there were over 40 different Scuds that impacted, around 46 or so. When they did that, when the -- when they did that, the key thing to remember was, the Israelis stayed calm and let the United States handle it. The second Gulf War, we conducted operations called Scud- hunting operations and eliminated the threat in the western desert.",
