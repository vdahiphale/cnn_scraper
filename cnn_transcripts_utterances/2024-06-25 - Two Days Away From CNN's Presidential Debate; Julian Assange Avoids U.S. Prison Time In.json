Sources say President Biden and his advisers have started mock debates at Camp David while the Trump team is narrowing in on a few specific topics they want to bring up during the debate. We start things off with CNN's Kayla Tausche at the White House, and CNN's Kristen Holmes down in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. Kayla, let's start with you.

They'd been talking about a number of things that could come up, notably, what the Biden campaign expects to be a focus for the president and two, on abortion, democracy, and what they see as the danger of the Trump economy. The campaign released an ad to that effect earlier, this morning. That's going to be running in battleground states as part of $50 million in ad spend in the month of June where they say that Donald Trump is in it for himself and Joe Biden is in it for voters, for their families. Now that message has been crafted in recent weeks and it comes after weeks of top Democrats telling the campaign that there needed to be a shift in messaging that Biden touting his accomplishments on the economy just simply wasn't moving voters that he needed to take a tougher line of attack, Phil.",

So he's still cannot talk about prosecutors, court staff, or their family. They might be wondering why is the judge doing this now? Well, the judge said et quote, circumstances have changed. He said that he crafted this gag order narrowly around the time of the trial to protect against certain extra judicial statements that Trump would make. But, of course, this move comes just two days before the CNN debate were Trumps conviction will likely come up.

But I think the big weakness for Trump on this issue is the fact that he scuttled a deal that he essentially said, I want this as a political issue. People don't like that. The other thing I would say about this I think is maybe a little counter-intuitive, people like the tougher measures, no question, but they don't like a lot of Trumps rhetoric around this issue when he says that immigrants poison the blood of our country and, you know, they didn't like family separation.

That has been pushed aside because its issue is so potent on the border security part.And I think one thing also speaks to the potency of the issue is the Biden team felt the need to not only rely on that attack about kind of scuttling the deal, they felt they needed to do something on the executive order, do you feel that need to go further? If that wasn't the case, I thought they're winning on that issue. They would need to go on the executive order. And so I feel like again, bring it back to immigration much as possible.

I think the efforts in Congress as well had a significant impact that Julian has a growing constituency in congress, both Democratic and Republican side, who have been calling on the Biden administration to bring this bring this case to a close.

Why is this leaving you speechless? What's different about this?The fact that there's no possible exit for civilians to reach safe space. Just about every single other war zone has some sort of an exit to it, even if that path is dangerous.  There's always a way to get out. Generally speaking, when you survive a bombing or when the frontline kind of moves through your neighborhood, you're able to move out and you have access to shelter, food, water, medical care, none of that exists. Your people are being shepherded around this nightmare from one spot to another trying to keep each other safe. And then there's also the sheer level of psychological obliteration, the trauma that comes every single day that is constantly triggering and re-triggering people. You know, I was talking to one of our colleagues also works in the sector. He's sees from Gaza, has a five- year-old son. And he was saying that their biggest fear is the war that is going to come after the bombs because he was saying that right now to a certain degree, the constant triggers, the threat, the fear of the constant scrapping around for food and water, it kind of is keeping a lot of people distracted, because all of their emotional trauma has been buried underneath, but there's this very fear that that is going to come up and completely, and totally paralyzed them. There's also a very real fear due to this complete breakdown of social order. There's absolutely no rule of law here and we are seeing this increase in criminal activity, increase in looting. There are various reports of an increase in gender-based violence, which tragically happens in every single similar space. But people are terrified of what tomorrow is going to bring and not just because of the potential for violence, but because even if the bomb stop, there futures, so on, uncertain. It's also the first time that you really have aid organizations, this deeply entrenched in a war zone and completely and totally unable to move aid from -- or to the population that actually needs. I mean, it's almost mind-boggling, not to mention one last point that also makes this very, very different medical evacuations of stop. There have been no medical evacuations since the Rafah border closing.",
