He is about to take the witness in the civil fraud trial against his father and the family business. They've already been found liable for fraud. The state has had a data plan how to go after him. His father, by the way, takes the stand next week. You're looking at the judge in that case right there. Before the day begins each day in this New York courtroom, they let cameras in to take a picture basically of everyone. Donald Trump there sitting at the table, he is about to get on the witness stand. Let's get right to CNN's Brynn Gingras who is outside the court. What are we expecting to see?",

The federal judge overseeing the case of Trump's mishandling of classified documents is signaling that she may push things off.That trial is currently scheduled for late May. And at a hearing yesterday in Florida, the judge talked about her concerns over that timing. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is in Florida following all of this for us. Katelyn, it's all about the calendar. What is the judge signaling here, and how is Donald Trump's team responding?",

He's supposed to go to trial on that in May, but they said to the judge, he's so busy and we're so busy on preparing not just for that trial, but his other federal trial in Washington, D.C. around what happened after the election, January 6th, his attempts to hold onto the presidency, that how could we possibly go to trial in May? And Judge Aileen Cannon here in Florida, she didn't say exactly what she's going to do if she's going to keep that date on the calendar for the May trial in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, but she indicated that she totally understands where they're coming from. She even said, I'm having a hard time seeing how this work can be accomplished realistically in this period of time, the period of time where they're going to be preparing for trial as a defense team. So, we are waiting to see whether Aileen Cannon, the judge here, is going to move that trial date in the documents case. But then Donald Trump's team, in just hours after that hearing, they went to the judge in D.C., Judge Tanya Chutkan, over the January 6, 2020 election case that he faces, a trial that's set to start in the beginning of May. They asked her to put the entire case on hold. And so because they have things on the table around presidential immunity, they want the judge to look at whether Donald Trump is immune from that case. Prosecutors hit back pretty quickly telling Judge Cannon here in Florida, look what they're doing. They're trying to manipulate the court. So, we just have to watch to see how these judges are going to respond now.",

Judges do have to look out for the constitutional right that any criminal defendant in any case has to adequately prepare his defense. And it's important to understand the timing here.So, there're two federal cases. First, the one in Mar-a-Lago with the documents case. That one was charged first and Judge Cannon set the trial date of May 2024. Later the other federal judge, Judge Chutkan, in D.C., she sort of undercut that. She set an earlier trial date for the January 6th trial of March 2024. So, we have one trial in March, one trial in May. The Florida judge in May says, well, you can't put them back-to-back like this. He does have a right to prepare separately for each of these cases because they are completely unrelated and they have completely unrelated facts and completely unrelated defenses. So, it seems like the Florida judge's concern is, is he going to get enough time to protect his constitutional interest to prepare for trial here.",

The problem, if I'm Jack Smith's team, is your jury pool, because you're going to have to try that case in the Southern District of Florida, where Donald Trump did quite well, electorally. Inevitably, you're going to have half the jury, give or take, are going to be Trump voters. Yes, jurors are told, put aside your views. Trust me, they're human beings. I've stood in front of plenty of jurors.On the other hand, the D.C. case, I think, is more subject to a reasonable defense, based perhaps on the First Amendment. It's not the easiest criminal case to understand, but, boy, if I'm Jack Smith, I love the D.C. jury pool. Donald Trump got 5 percent of the vote in D.C.",

And if you get that win, take it to the bank, push everything else off until after the election, because I do think you're right, Kate.

What they're all doing is uniformly pointing downstream.And, by the way, you see this a lot with corporate executives. Donald Trump Jr. in his hour and change yesterday said, this isn't my deal. We have accountants. We have lawyers. I just signed the paperwork. I'm a big picture guy.

And I won't even repeat them here because it's just so jarring to hear it, but what they're doing to small children and pregnant women and the rest.

I was called upon to serve on the impeachment defense team in the House twice under President Trump when the Democrats used it for raw partisan political purposes, and I decried that at each step of the way.The reason is because the impeachment power that we have in the Constitution, in the House specifically, next to a declaration of war, you could argue it's the most -- it's heaviest power that we have, and it cannot be wielded for political purposes. So, I have been very consistent, intellectually consistent in this, and persistent, that we have to follow due process, and we have to follow the law. That means following our obligation on the Constitution and doing appropriate investigations in the right way, at the right pace, so that the evidence comes in, and we follow the evidence where it leads. We follow the truth where it leads. So, as we stand here today, I'm not predetermined that, but I do believe that very soon we are coming to a point of decision on it. We're in the impeachment inquiry phase, as you know, which is an important step in that due process. And what you're seeing right now, although a lot of American people are anxious about this, many Republicans across the country are anxious to get to the end point on this, and I think some Democrats want to know how it ends as well. What you're seeing right now is a deliberate constitutional process that was envisioned by the founders, the framers of the Constitution. This is how they envisioned this to go, not the way the Democrats did it, snap impeachment, sham impeachments, and all the rest. So, I know that people are anxious about it, but I will say Chairman Comer, Chairman Jordan in Judiciary, Chairman Smith in Ways and Means, they've done an extraordinary job, very methodically, and I would say outside the scope of politics. They've been taken in the evidence as it goes. So, we're going to follow the evidence where it leads, and we'll see. And I'm not going to predetermine it this morning.",
