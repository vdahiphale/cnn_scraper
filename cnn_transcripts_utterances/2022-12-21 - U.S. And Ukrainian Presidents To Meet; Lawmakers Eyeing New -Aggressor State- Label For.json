He's on a mission, first meeting with President Biden at the White House, then taking questions from the press.And then an historic address to the Congress. We don't know exactly the message. But we do know this:  President Biden is preparing to announce an additional $1.8 billion in assistance to Ukraine, including the patriot Missile system that Zelenskyy has long said is critical to Ukraine's survival. M.J., what's going to happen over there today? M.J. LEE, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  We know this is a visit that came together in just a matter of days, a tightly held secret until basically the last minute. The two sides have been working together for a number of days to make sensitive travel arrangements for President Zelenskyy, given that he's a wartime president and a war is ongoing in his home country. We, of course, expect President Zelenskyy to use this opportunity to make a strong appeal not only to U.S. lawmakers but to the American public as well, reminding them that the war is ongoing and the Ukrainian people need as much help as they can get. And President Biden is expected to announce additional aid to Ukraine. Part of that is the Patriot missile systems that Ukraine has been asking for. It's a sophisticated long-range weapon. What we don't know is what more President Zelenskyy, in person, might ask President Biden for. U.S. officials have said that we are appearing to enter a new phase of this war. Here's John Kirby talking about it this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  The capabilities we have been providing have evolved over time. When it first started, we were talking about the Javelin anti-tank missile, now advanced air defense, because the war has changed. And the way Ukrainians have been attacked have changed. Air defense is of prime importance. We'll see where it goes going forward. The president has said we'll support Ukraine for as long as it takes. And he meant every word of that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there's a lot of debate whether that's the best way to hold Russia accountable. It is fundamentally a compromise that the administration is making with lawmakers, who actually wanted to see the administration designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Therefore, you know, have the United States phase out those sanctions in order to incentivize Russia to do that. There's a lot of questions about whether President Zelenskyy, when he comes to Congress tonight, will endorse this idea. Lawmakers are waiting. And Nancy Pelosi in particular is waiting to see whether he does that. If she does, we're told, this could be introduced by her as a stand-alone bill and Russia could be designated as this aggressor state.",

So the administration was trying to avoid that but still get Congress a way to sort of vent their views on Russia. This is the wording. It would carry with it a sense of the Congress but really would not trigger any specific kinds of action. It's not an unfamiliar problem.",

SANGER:  The first and most important symbolic element, Zelenskyy was not supposed to be alive according to the Russian plan. So the very fact that he's showing up in the Oval Office and then addressing a joint session of Congress is really meant as a message to sort of drive home the humiliation of the Russian military for their inability to take over Ukraine. Second, it's supposed to be a thanks. I think President Biden has at times believed that Zelenskyy was not sufficiently grateful for what he's getting. Thirdly, it's supposed to whip up some support for continued aid. But then I think the most important thing is to sort of turn a corner, Kate, and get people accustomed to the fact that this could be a very, very long war.

That's a company-level organization that has between six and eight launchers, one massive control system and a massive radar system. It just takes a lot of time to understand and use. Yet I know Ukraine has proven themselves to be great on the battlefield. But they can't just fall in on this piece of equipment. And this piece of equipment can't move around. It's a stationary point defense capability. I will add again to what David said. I think this is a push and a wedge to have Secretary Austin go back to the Ramstein group and said, we provided a one of a kind -- there are no other weapons like this in the world. We provided a one of a kind system to Ukraine. Some of you other folks better start ponying up low and medium-range systems. Lastly, Patriot is a defensive weapons systems. You don't win wars on the defense. What I would be looking at is not so much Patriot as what's coming next with this big package, the capability of putting together combined arms teams to conduct offensive operations by Ukraine in the southeast and the east, potentially stopping any kind of aggression that may come from Belarus in the north.

What we are learning based on two reports, both from the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as the joint committee on taxation, is just a fuller picture of the former president's tax practices. One thing that became clear is the IRS did not follow its own protocols when it came to auditing an incoming president, using what they call the mandatory audit program. What's supposed to happen is when a new president and vice president come in, their taxes are supposed to be reviewed. But according to the Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, that did not happen for the first two years, it only happened after the chairman of the committee requested Trump's tax returns for six years, arguing he needed to see them so he could understand if the program was working properly.",

I have constituents here in Philadelphia, who are grilled if they're applying for the Earned Income Tax Credit, some 33 percent get audited. Here you have someone clearly in the top 1 percent, claiming hundreds of millions of dollars tax deductions and the IRS just didn't even look for further information. So there is a lot here.
