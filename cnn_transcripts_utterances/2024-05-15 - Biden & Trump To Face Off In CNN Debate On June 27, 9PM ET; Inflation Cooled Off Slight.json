      "sentences": "Well, it's amazing, honestly, how quickly all of this came together in just a matter of hours. Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreeing to two presidential debates. The first one will be hosted by CNN, as you said, on June 27th. Both campaigns agreeing basically to shun the presidential debate calendar that was set forth by the Commission on Presidential Debates, basically arguing that the idea that the first debate wouldn't take place until September is just too late, that both campaigns are set on trying to reach voters much earlier than that. And in fact, we are told that there were some informal backchannel conversations between the two campaigns described to us as having been largely about the mutual disdain for the CPD.Now, what is unusual about the CNN debate is that the Atlanta studio where this will take place is not going to have a live audience. That, of course, is unusual if you look back on previous years. And what the Biden campaign had said is that they saw the past debates as having become spectacles, that they didn't think that having a live audience was actually conducive to a lively and helpful debate. And one person we are - that we are learning who is going to be joining the Biden campaign's debate sessions is Ron Klain. That, of course, is the President's former chief of staff. One of his closest and most trusted advisors. He tells me that he is going to be taking some vacation time to help the President with his debate prep. I don't know how relaxing a vacation that's going to be. The other question, of course, that we don't know yet is who is going to be standing in for Donald Trump at these debate prep sessions. Remember, last time around in 2020, that role was played by Bob Bauer, the President's personal lawyer. But I'm told that it's just too early to be talking about those debate prep details. But I think what is clear in the big picture is that the Biden campaign did want to use this issue to try to go on the offensive. We saw that they wanted to be first to put these two debate ideas out there and have the Trump campaign accept that idea. And we also saw president - the President saying earlier, I hear you're free on Wednesdays in one of these social media videos. That clearly is a reference to the fact that Donald Trump has been stuck in a courtroom for a number of weeks now in New York City.",

So we're told that Biden is not going to and I'll read that statement from the campaign in just a second.[15:05:03] But just to give an overall view here, talking to Trump's senior advisors and those in his orbit, they're a little bit irked right now. The fact that Joe Biden somehow took over the debate narrative, despite the fact that Donald Trump has been really using this as a narrative at all of his campaign rallies. He's been up on stage with an empty podium next to him no one there saying, come debate me. He's often said, I will debate anywhere, anytime. This has been kind of a rallying cry for Donald Trump and for some of his top advisors. Now what we saw today was Joe Biden really taking control of the narrative and now Donald Trump trying to take it back. So after we saw this announcement from Biden, after Donald Trump had accepted these two debates, he then got on Truth Social to say he was going to accept a third debate at Fox on October 2nd. So this is Truth Social here. Well, the Biden campaign is saying, well, you already agreed to our terms. That's not happening. They wrote - the actual statement was \"President Biden made his terms clear for two one-on-one debates, and Donald Trump accepted those terms. No more games, no more chaos, no more debate about debates. We'll see Donald Trump on June 27th in Atlanta - if he shows up.\" This is also a big thing between both campaigns now that they continue to goad each other, oh, you're not going to show up. You're not going to show up. It sounds to me like they're both going to show up.",

Also, record closes possible for the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ.Now, today's inflation report showed that consumer prices were up by 0.3% between March and April. That is cooler than expected, cooler than the month before. Annually, consumer prices up by 3.4%. Now, that's not great. That's above pre-COVID trends. But this is an improvement from the month before, and it is miles away from that 9% inflation reading from two years ago. And when you dig into this report, you do see some positive trends here. Consumers are catching a break on food prices, finally. We saw month over month price drops for groceries, new cars, used cars and airfare. Also, core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, that is now increasing at the smallest rate in three years, so that is a positive trend. Now, I think when you take a step back, it's clear that inflation has not been solved, right? The cost of living remains a major problem for millions of Americans and frankly, a political liability for this White House. But these do numbers - these do - these numbers do point to some progress. I think the point, though, is that we're going to need to see further progress in the months ahead before Americans really start to feel better about things.",

Now it's not even a sure thing there'll be one.Now, in the last 24 hours, we have seen investors mark up their bets for interest rate cuts, not in June, probably not in July. But look at that, and this chart shows that there's now a 74 percent chance priced into the market for an interest rate cut at the meeting in September, which, by the way, is the last meeting before this election. Of course, interest rate cuts would be great for consumers, right? It would mean lower mortgage rates, credit card rates, car loans. But the problem is the Fed, they need to see real proof of progress, not just one month of improvement, but a series of months where inflation is ticking lower. They don't want to cut interest rates too soon because that could make inflation worse. So we need to see whether or not this is the start of a new trend where inflation does move decisively lower.",

No doubt about it, it created morale back in December when we first knew there was going to be a delay, and it's really causing ammunition to not be there.So Blinken has gone to Kyiv, given very clean signals, we're standing with you. At times saying Ukraine needs to improve on governance. We had (INAUDIBLE) display yesterday in a Kyiv bar where he played during a Neil Young song. But also today announcing two billion dollars worth of assistance, some of that to buy weapons immediately, some of it for weapons from the U.S., and some of it to invest in future mechanisms so Ukraine can develop its own technology too and resilience. So a certain effort for a long-term gain here, but this positive messaging of we're with you and we'll stay by you, I think really belies how utterly awful it is to be in a city like this, Kharkiv, and see a renewed Russian invasion, them seeing a gap here, Moscow seeing a weakness and seizing on it.
