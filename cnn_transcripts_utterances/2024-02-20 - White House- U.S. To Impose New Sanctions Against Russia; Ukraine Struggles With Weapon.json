So prior to this ruling, couples would have the choice about whether they wanted to donate additional embryos for research, store them for potential future use, or have them destroyed, right?It's unclear what will happen under this ruling. It seems pretty clear that donating embryos for research or destroying them will be off the table. If we view those embryos as persons, you couldn't destroy persons or donate them for research. So that part goes without saying. But what exactly fertility clinics do need to do now in terms of whether they're allowed to store them indefinitely or required to, whether they're required to implant all of them right away, the ruling doesn't really go into that. And so I think it's also going to create a lot of legal uncertainty for fertility clinics and people who are pursuing in vitro fertilization in Alabama.",

It's going to I think make it easier for state courts and even state legislators and other conservative states to take similarly aggressive steps on IVF. Somebody always has to be first and now that the Alabama Supreme Court has done that, I think its going to make it a lot easier for other conservatives to take aggressive steps on IVF, in states that also embrace this idea of fetal personhood. I think the ruling sets a precedent for being more explicit about embracing Christian religious teachings is some kind of constitutional principle in states like Alabama.And I think its another brick in the wall of a strategy to make abortion illegal nationwide by declaring a fetus is a constitutional person for the purposes of constitutional law, federal constitutional law and federal abortion law, which I think we've seen the anti- abortion movement pursuing. This is one piece of evidence they can point to, to say, states are already going in this direction. Federal constitutional law should, too.",

Police said the 26 year-old man appears to be connected to two stabbings in Arizona and a kidnapping in Florida, all of them targeting women. And now the New York police department is working with the FBI to determine if there are any additional victims across the United States.Let's get right to CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller, who's a former deputy police commissioner of the NYPD. John, we know that at any moment there are any number of serial killers in any country, including the United States. Walk us through how police determined that this suspect might be responsible for crimes all over the country and what the next steps are for authorities.",

So in this case, they were able to tie him to this victim. I am told by the victims phone was missing. So they tracked the phone. The victim's credit card was missing.So they tracked the credit card and I'm told investigators then were able to see him on video match him to the person on video leaving the hotel? And then actually had him using his own credit card at a Burger King afterwards, and police also believed that he is wearing the victims pants in these pictures because its not the pants he walked into the hotel with, according to investigators and the victims pants were missing. So it's quite a bizarre case, but let's get a summary from New York City's chief of detectives, Jo Kenny. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Their concern is this is a spate of crimes in Florida, in New York and Arizona connected in a short period. In Arizona, he allegedly attempted to carjack a woman, then assaulted McDonalds employee in the ladies room with multiple stab wounds, then involved in a case where he's arrested in a stolen car. So what other crimes might they not know about? And that's where they go to the FBI. The violent crime apprehension program, or VICAP, is a nationwide computer database that tracks crimes, the modus operandi of the crime, the offender characteristics, the similarities between victims. So you can input data and see what -- what possible matches there are. And that's what they're asking the FBI to do. Because as we learned from cases like the Gilgo Beach serial killer, a lot of these killers who are mobile, moving across the country, can avoid detection. Right now, these are the crimes he's charged with, but they're looking to see if there might be more.",
