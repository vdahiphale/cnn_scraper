Four years the day after he entered the 2020 race with a video condemning the former president's comments after a White supremacist rally in Virginia, President Joe Biden today announced he is running for a second term. He appeared in a video released this morning saying we still are in a fight for the soul of the nation. He spoke about the need to, in his words, defend democracy and repeatedly spoke of the need to stand up for what he termed personal freedom. This time, not just against the extremism of a former president who hopes to retake the White House, but a Republican Party the president believes is enabled by him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She was speaking at her alma mater, Howard University. She cited laws that ban abortion after six weeks like the one recently signed by Republican presidential candidate and Governor Ron DeSantis, and said that, since most women don't know they're pregnant at that stage, it is proof that most Republicans in her words don't know how a woman's body works. She also spoke about what she called an extremist plan for a national agenda to push strict abortion laws. Someone else also was speaking about abortion today, it was former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who declared for the Republican presidential race in February. She appeared in an event organized by a prominent anti-abortion group calling for a \"constructive conversation\" on the issue and the need for what she termed a national consensus but didn't provide any details of what a national abortion policy would look like under a Haley administration. Also today, something else defining the 2024 race, the many investigations both criminal and civil into the former president. There were opening statements in a battery and defamation trial against him. E. Jean Carroll says that in 1996, the former president raped her in a department store dressing room. The former president denies the charges. We'll have more on what happened in opening statement today in court later. We want to begin with the Biden campaign and CNN chief White House correspondent, Phil Mattingly. So what's been going on behind the scenes today at the White House?",

Behind the scenes, though there was an intensive flurry of activity from his top advisers, from top Democrats to lay the groundwork for what they know will be both a very expensive and very intense battle ahead.I'm told advisers throughout the course of the day were making contact and reaching out to key groups of the Biden coalition, kind of the core pillars of what got him elected in 2020 and he will need to get re-elected in 2024, whether it is young voters, Latino voters, Black voters trying to ensure that all of those groups were aligned and understood what was coming and what was going to be needed going forward. So to were reach outs and efforts to speak with donors. The top advisers for the president holding a call with top donors earlier today laying out the groundwork for the campaign, their message, what they see going forward, and they've also invited more than a couple of dozen of them to Washington later this weekend for more briefings, more intensive discussions around a plan that I'm told between the campaign and its supportive outside groups could total more than $2 billion, Anderson. As for the President, I'm told he was briefed throughout the day on how things were going, did hold a call with key Democratic governors earlier today to lay out the message and the strategy, particularly in swing states that his campaign sees as their theory of the case going into things. More than anything else, though, there is an understanding that there is critical contrast here that they want to push forward. They know there are headwinds, they see the poll numbers as well, but they feel like there's a clear pathway so long as they get their allies, their groups and probably most importantly, their money in place for the road ahead -- Anderson.",

The Republican National Committee releasing a very new ad that was made out of artificial intelligence, sort of imagining what the world would be in a second Biden administration. But as for the former president, he had this to say, he said: \"With such a calamitous and failed presidency, it is almost inconceivable that Biden would even think of running for re-election.\" He adds, \"I promise you this when I stand on that debate stage and compare our records, it will be the radical Democrats' worst nightmare.\" But interesting, of course, he says debate stage because he riled some Republicans on that same topic later today.",

They had a lot of that in the first two years, but as he put it today, this is about freedoms, fundamental freedoms, and I think that resonates with a lot of Democrats who feel that they look at the overturning of Roe v.

And I think for a lot of Americans, particularly Democrats who might be uneasy about the idea of a Biden at the age of 80, going for a second term, they're going to begin to look at that choice and say that this is actually a grand choice.

There's been so much of that, Anderson, in the last couple of days. And purposely, in the piece I wrote for CNN, I pulled back from that. But if you look at history, there is some indication here that this culture is still in place. The culture of sexism, misogyny, really a culture that debases women was built into the DNA of Fox News by Roger Ailes, the founder, you know, the master propagandist, the political operative who founded this. We saw it down the line in Bill O'Reilly. Fox talked about as if they excised this cancer when they got rid of Ailes and O'Reilly, Bill O'Reilly, the host. And that was really dramatic. But even cutting off the head with Ailes and then O'Reilly, you don't change a culture overnight. I wrote at the time that this is like a cancer at the heart of Fox News internally, and they really have to make a serious, systematic attempt to eradicate it. I don't think that they made that kind of attempt.",
