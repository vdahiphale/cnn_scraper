I'm Christine Romans this Tuesday morning. It is a race against time to rescue five people aboard that missing submersible off the coast of Newfoundland. The Canadian coast guard is hoping that the search for the vessel, contact with the craft was lost Sunday. It only has about four days worth of life support aboard. CNN has learned that British billionaire Hamish Harding is one of the five passengers along with a father and son from Pakistan. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An urgent search and rescue operation is now underway in the North Atlantic, in the area near the wreck of the Titanic. Defined a lost submersible with five people aboard. The U.S. Coast Guard tells CNN that it's got a ship on the scene, and an aircraft, including C-130 planes. Canadian ships and planes joining the search as well, along with the Polar Prince, the vessel that transported the missing submersible to the sight of the Titanic wreckage, about 380 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. The Coast Guard says the vessel submerged on Sunday morning and lost contact with the crew of the Polar Prince one hour and 45 minutes into its descent.",

All cases are handled in accordance with the law. There is no such thing as, so-called, wrongful detention, unquote. Blinken said earlier that the U.S. has a commitment to continue to work on resolving all three cases. And during Blinken's visit to Beijing, of course, he met with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as well as other top officials. China and the U.S. agreed to destabilize a relationship.

They see not so much an off ramp, but they see a level of communication which gives them -- which gives them some relief from their concerns.The discussions that Secretary Blinken had, for example, about the United States' One China Policy, sticking to that. It concerns over the Taiwan Strait. But also the talk that was had between the two about, you know, global health, about climate change, about these far reaching global issues that the United States and the rest of the world need, the United States and China to be getting on with each other, if there's to be, let's say, you know, to head off a potential economic downturn, which has global implications. Around the world, there is a great deal of concern on those issues that if the relationship got worse, then there would be bigger knock on effects. I think one of the issues that also has global reach and implications is the discussion that was had on China providing precursor chemicals for drugs like a fentanyl in the United States. But China is also seen as one of the major suppliers of precursor chemicals into Syria, which is pumping out a huge amount of illegal drugs that are affecting not just the Middle East but Europe and other countries as well. But, perhaps the biggest thing that did not come out of it is the military to military communications, which Secretary Blinken was pressing for, which, you know, was something that was established with Russia during the Cold War. It was really intended to signal and did head off any miscalculations and misunderstandings about military maneuvers, of which there are a large amount around Taiwan. So that is an issue, a big issue that remains. Secretary Blinken pointed out that that is still a topic of discussion.

We noticed over the past few months that those relations have improved, but specifically back at the Munich security conference, the Ukrainian foreign minister had a meeting with his opposite number in China, which was felt to be -- which was felt to be beneficial to both countries.The Ukrainians say they pointed out exactly that point Secretary Blinken was raising about other non lethal aid or support from Chinese businesses getting into -- into Russian military hands for use against Ukraine. And the Ukrainians felt they had a good response from the Chinese on that and the specific issue that they raised was shut down by the Chinese. So I think that there is hope on that front as well. But, of course, the big support that Russia really gets out of China is the economic support, the fact that this is improved business energy supplies, relations between China and Russia to Moscow's benefit, because it is getting a lot of money from China, which helps support the war. But, in terms of the nonlethal aid that China says it's not going to give to Russia, this is something that the United States will have heard and, as was said by Secretary Blinken, it's been a statement that the Chinese have given to other countries. This will have been heard certainly to my knowledge over the past few months.

I do not think that lack of trust is disappearing anytime soon and that is because there are two massive rival nations. China doesn't want to feel that it's being held back by the United States and its allies and partners, and until it reads the economic, diplomatic, political, military language globally in its favor, I don't think that's going to change.

The system is several days out from impacting, well, let's say the Caribbean, let alone the United States. We will get to the details on that in just a moment.First, let's look at the satellite imagery because it's still a tropical storm and very nicely organized tropical storm. You can see some healthy outflow, banding on the satellite imagery, this is indicated to the meteorologists that this thing is kind of gathering some strength and organizing. There is yet another disturbance just to the east, it will likely be named today, but we're focusing in on the newly minted tropical storm Bret. Winds right now at 40 miles per hour. So, just as I mentioned, this storm has no impact on the United States as of right now, we have the cone of uncertainty from the National Hurricane Center. It indicates a strengthening storm to a hurricane by Wednesday into Thursday morning. [05:25:02] And then, impacting the Lesser Antilles, so Guadeloupe, into Barbados, St. Vincent, for instance, by Friday morning. And then heading into the eastern sections of the Caribbean, and this is a very volatile environment within this region. So, a lot of the computer models showing that the storm will actually kind of fizzle out or at least become more disorganized and weaken as it does so. The way that I showed you on the satellite or moment ago it kind of re-curves, so that shouldn't be concerned, but as we focus in on Bret's track, you can see that it is going to continue to march westward. So, Puerto Rico, all the way down to the Woodward islands. They need to keep a very close eye on this. So, you mentioned some heat, some impressive records were broken yesterday. You've got to see this because we're talking 3 to 5 degrees above our high temperature records for the day for places like Laredo, San Angelo, as well as Del Rio. But this one astounded me the most, San Angelo had tied its record high temperature. The highest temperature ever recorded in its history, it only did this for other times, but 111 degrees. And that's not even the full story, the full picture. Because if you start heading in the relative humidity and that is when it gets excessively hot. In fact, obnoxiously hot, that's the way I like to describe it. Heat index values at over 120 degrees in some locations. Corpus Christi forecast to be 119. That's what it feels like on your exposed skin when you step outside. More of the same in Houston. I mean, this is just simply downright uncomfortable and it looks like this weather is going to continue before a bit of rain. So, cool things off into the second half.",

In addition, Trump and Nauta will only be allowed access to this material under the direct supervision of their attorneys. Now, they can take notes, but their notes must be kept in the possession of their attorneys and stored securely. And finally, nothing that DOJ gives can then be shared on social media. This sort of protective order is standard in criminal cases like this. And the order, it must be signed by all parties who are privy to the information collected, and handed over by prosecutors. And it's really to protect against the disclosure of sensitive information, like grand jury transcripts, especially when other investigations we know are still ongoing. Of course, the special counsel's probe continues into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn we know the special counsel's probe continues into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election.
