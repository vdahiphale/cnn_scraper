Sara Sidner is in Jerusalem.Overnight, Israel says that it hit hundreds of targets in Gaza and launched new raids on the ground. In all the IDF says 320 sites were targeted. Now, the Hamas-controlled ministry of health in Gaza says more than 400 people were killed. Here we are showing you pictures of some of the aftermath of those strikes. We also have an important update from the IDF saying that they now believe 222 people were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists in the October 7th attack. That new total is up, you'll remember, from 203 as more information came in and more detail was coming out. This morning, the family of the first two hostages released, two Americans, spoke out for the first time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

To give you a sense of what Kate was talking about right there, some of these cross-border altercations are taking place right down here. This is in Israeli kibbutz Kissufim, just across the border from there is where some of that activity, that ground activity, has taken place.And while that is happening, there has been aid getting into Gaza from Egypt. This is Egypt, going across the border right here, the Rafah crossing, you can see where some explosions took place before this aid started getting through. And we have some video of the aid trucks. You can see right here. Some 34 through the end of yesterday. The intention is to keep them trickling through over however long they can. Of course, there are relief officials who say the numbers that is getting in, as good as it is to have the border open, it is merely a trickle, a drop in the bucket of what is needed there. All right, we are everywhere on the ground that we need to be. Our Sara Sidner right here in Jerusalem, Nic Robertson in Sderot, just outside of Gaza.

And they know that that is going to mean more deaths, more deaths to Israelis, the soldiers, and more deaths to those who are in Gaza.So, it is a somber time, but there are people going about their business as best they can here in Jerusalem. We also heard overnight from several different people who are familiar with what is going on in Gaza, and they talk about that aid that you mentioned, that there are mostly medical supplies, food and water that has been brought in, but if you look at the numbers, normally there are 7,200 trucks loads that go into Gaza during normal times. There have only been 34 over the past couple of days and so it shows you just how much is coming in. It is just not enough for the population of 1.3 or 1.4 million people who are in the part of Gaza they were supposed to evacuate. Not all of them have evacuated because the hospitals -- many of the people in the hospitals simply can't evacuate and the doctors are saying they will not evacuate unless their patients can. I want to go now to my colleague Nic Robertson where overnight and over the weekend we spoke quite a bit. Nic, you had said something that I hadn't heard you say before, that this is -- that overnight there was a bombing like you had never heard before, a bombardment in Gaza. Can you give us some sense of what you are seeing today and what you saw overnight?",

We heard from Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister and former defense minister, who talked to our Fareed Zakaria over the weekend. And he said that he believed that that ground offensive was going to happen in the next few days, and said that he believed it could take weeks when the IDF actually goes into Gaza to do the job that they had planned to do, trying to rid Gaza of Hamas. Have you gotten any sense, just from the troops on the ground that you're seeing or from any of your contacts, as to when they think this ground offensive may happen?",

      "sentences": "I think the decision on it is very fluid, and that's because of the international pressure. There's a, you know, a big and broad conversation that's going on about humanitarian aid in for the release of hostages. That seems to be the equation. But from an Israeli government perspective, when aid goes into Gaza, that goes and some of it ends up with Hamas and strengthens their position at a time when Israel is trying to affect a siege on Gaza to weaken Hamas. So, there's that part of the equation.What we see in terms of troops along the border area, it seems very much that they are poised and could move to an incursion force posture very, very quickly. Talking to some of the soldiers, though, they describe a situation where they've been told to be ready and then they - then they're told not now and then be ready again and not now. Again, people who have been through this before, veterans of the IDF, say, look, we've experienced this sort of hurry up and wait before and - and to a degree that is a soldier's life, follow orders, hurry up and wait, but they say realistically they can wait a long time. And while they're waiting, they're doing drills, they're doing training, they're preparing. But it is that international pressure on Israel that is growing to allow a humanitarian pause that is really going to be very, very difficult for Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to that final conclusion about when to go for an incursion. To a degree we're told it's a military decision and that's why I say it's fluid. The forces are there. It seems to me at the moment they're -- this is very, very likely. Precisely when we don't know. And events on the ground play out. But there's always this perception that because Hamas took so many hostages, they were always going to use the hostages as a leverage, however they could, to prevent attacks on them and potentially that's also what we're seeing play out here. SIDNER: Yes. Nic Robertson, thank you so much for that view on the ground. You are very, very close to Gaza in Sderot. I think the closest point is only 2,700 feet from Gaza. I appreciate all your reporting that you've been doing from there. And I'm going to toss it back to Kate.",

Where are those U.S. troops? MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): U.S. troops currently in the Red Sea here and along -- on the destroyer, on the USS Carney. And then also we have ground troops here inside of Syria protecting some of our oil. And then also in the northern part of Iraq. And we've seen them be -- come under attack here. We've had to protect them. The drones -- the Iranians are sending drones after those. So, they're fighting back.

Number one, catch any Hamas fighters that are there, kill them, for example, and also go after the tunnel system that's there. Gain intelligence on what's going on, on the ground.Right now this is an area that Israel hasn't focused on. It doesn't have a lot of knowledge about what's actually going on across that border here. And then if you also notices, strategically, it's going to cut the - it's going to basically cut Gaza in half and it's going to shape the battlefield for this ground incursion and what's going to come. I think they're going to isolate the southern area, they're going to leave that for civilians. They're going to make that say a no fire zone and their main line of effort will be clearly in this northern part of Gaza.",

So, if you look in all these places, these are the kind of spots that, if they could cut the Hamas communications off - then as this time goes on, I don't -- I think there's really no rush to start this ground incursion. I think they're going to continue to bomb from the sky. Now, it won't solve the problem, it won't necessarily cause the war to end, but the bottom line is it will put them at such a disadvantage that they'll be really forced - the one that -- once the ground incursion (ph) comes in, then they'll be in much better shape.",

You have to remember that dozens of trucks a day were going in before the conflict because a large portion of the Gaza Strip depends on humanitarian aid. That was the reality before this latest escalation. So, all of that aid is going to be used up extremely quickly. And it's not even going to fill that huge gap, that huge ocean of need on the ground.And you have to remember these trucks are supposed to distribute aid under extremely difficult circumstances. As you mentioned, 12 hospitals already out of service because there is no fuel. So how are they going to distribute that aid? How far into the Gaza Strip can they go without gas and as air strikes continue to rain down? The Israeli military says it is intensifying air strikes on the Gaza Strip it says to target Hamas. But the reality, the horror that that spells out for the 2 million people trapped in that war zone, you'll remember, of course, it is sealed off, all borders closed, is absolutely unfathomable, John. I want to bring you one image that just explains how horrifying this is. And I do warn our viewers, it is extremely graphic. But it shows young children, little kids, who have been killed in this fighting. And you can see that there's writing on their legs. Their parents, their family members are scribbling their names, the names of their children, on their legs just so that they can find the bodies of their children so that they could bury them. That's how horrific the situation there. There is no guarantee you can bury or find your dead child right now in the Gaza Strip. Rights groups are appealing, they're calling for a ceasefire. They say that a pause is needed to allow aid in to get civilians into a safe place, to create a humanitarian zone of some kind.
