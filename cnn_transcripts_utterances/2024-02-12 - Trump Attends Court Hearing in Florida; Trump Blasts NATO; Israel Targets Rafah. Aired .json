CNN has not verified the numbers, but we do have some disturbing video from the aftermath in Rafah, medics in a hospital trying to resuscitate a child, a woman sobbing holding a child's body. And this could be a glimpse of what a broader Rafah offensive could look like. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are essentially trapped there, which is why the U.S. and other allies have been urging Israel not to advance. And now President Biden is said to be increasingly frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who Biden sees as ignoring his advice, according to sources. We have CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is in Tel Aviv, Israel, following this. Jeremy, what have we learned about this hostage rescue?",

This raid was carried out at about 1:49 a.m., according to the Israeli military. That's when Israeli special forces breached a residential building in the heart of Rafah using explosives. They were going off of intelligence gathered not only by Israeli military intelligence, but also by its internal security service, that these two hostages, 70-year-old Louis Har and 60-year-old Fernando Marman, were on the second floor of this building. They were able to go in there, grab the hostages and escaped under fire from Hamas fighters, we're told. About one minute later is when the Israeli Air Force began to bombard the area, striking, they say, Hamas targets in the area in order to prevent them from intercepting that rescue operation. But what we are seeing today is the aftermath of those strikes, killing not only Hamas fighters, but also very clearly civilians, women and children killed and injured in these bombardments. At least 94 people were killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. And we are seeing the scenes there of children, some of them shaking from the bombardments, others streaked with blood, women mourning their lost loved ones at the hospital. Now, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says that this is evidence that military pressure is the way to go to rescue these hostages. But, of course, it's important to note that this is only the second time that the Israeli military has successfully rescued hostages from Gaza.",

And the Israeli military says they're developing a plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from that city. But, so far, we haven't heard any details of what that plan would look like. [13:05:00] And then the question is, where would they go? Further north, there is just rampant devastation and destruction. Humanitarian aid is far more scarce there than it is in Rafah, so enormous questions there, but the Israeli prime minister, amid international concern, amid concern from the United States very much doubling down on the importance of going into Rafah, calling it Hamas' last bastion, and saying that Hamas is embedding, effectively, with civilians in that city.",

Lee.M.J., you have got new reporting that Biden has become increasingly frustrated with the Israeli prime minister and the brutality of Israel's operations in Gaza. Now, that was before -- this call that he had yesterday with Prime Minister Netanyahu, that was before this deadly hostage rescue operation. So what are you hearing now about President Biden's thinking? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Alex, what we are getting a sense of is this mounting frustration that President Biden is feeling and making clear to the advisers who are around him about this idea that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not heeding his advice, including when it comes to de-escalating the military operation in Gaza and alleviating the humanitarian crisis more, and doing more to make sure that people there are getting the help that they need. Tensions have definitely intensified even further, as Israel has made clear that it is preparing a ground incursion into Rafah. White House officials have been putting it pretty bluntly. They feel like the estimated 1.3 million people that are currently in Rafah simply have nowhere to go. And there's a lot of skepticism right now among U.S. officials as to this idea of evacuating all of those people out of that area before this ground incursion can occur, just as to whether that is even possible to do and whether all of those people, many of whom actually fled there in the beginning of the war, can be safely moved out of that area. And we know that the president told the prime minister directly that a military operation simply should not proceed before those people could be safely moved out of the way. And as for that hostage rescue operation that you were talking about, we are now learning that the Biden administration does have some deep concerns about this idea that two people were successfully rescued, but, as a part of that operation, some dozens of Palestinians were potentially killed. That rate of civilian death is something that is very worrisome to the Biden administration and is a point of tension that we could see erupt into the public even more. Of course, U.S. officials see it as incredibly important to continue working on the hostage rescue operations, but, again, seeing a lot of concerns and worry about the civilian death toll that is continuing to mount in Gaza.",

First off, can you explain, as you understand it, why the IDF would have used these airstrikes in conjunction with this special operation here? BRIG. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, I can tell you what the intent is, and then compared to what we're seeing the execution looks like and the consequences, the result of that, the effects of that. The intent is to isolate where the hostage rescue, which is a very precise operation, yet there will be intense gunfire, as described, to try to rescue those hostages, and then, as there's an exfiltration of both the IDF special operators and the hostages as they're moving out, they're going to be thrown into vehicles or dumped into a helicopter. So they're going to try to have a speedy retreat from the area, so they can get out of there. And then what you want to do is isolate that. So anybody who gets anxious, wants to return fire, wants to pursue, they will be blocked by the airstrikes. The consequence of that is, obviously, as described so very well, is you have got Hamas fighters that are completely embedded in Palestinians. And so, despite the best efforts, there will be collateral damage, as described.",

Clearly, there's a downside to that, in that there is collateral damage and others have been killed as a result of this operation.Clearly, there needs to be pressure. And Israel has demonstrated an ability with great intelligence and then some very precise operations to go extract hostages. They haven't done many -- many -- haven't had many of those, but they can do it. It's based on intelligence and clarity of the picture that you can put together. So these kinds of operations can continue to take place and should continue to take place. If there is a risk/reward, can we take the risks, not to lose any more folks, not to do too much damage, but to get these hostages back? And those are the decisions that are being made. So, I -- the short answer is, yes, do this as best you can. You might want to alter some of the additional tactics that you have been using to try to secure the area and to make it -- to decrease the risks associated to the IDF.",

I mean, you apply military force to achieve political objectives, just like you would apply any other element of power, whether it's diplomatic or economic or informational.So these two are completely connected, and the military operation is a derivative of what you're trying to achieve politically. What you're trying to achieve politically, obviously, is a Gaza that is not hostile to Israel and doesn't have as its core principle the destruction and sovereignty of the state of Israel. And so Israel -- this doesn't have a short-term horizon. I think, increasingly, as we look at it, there are -- there is so much hair over all the potential solutions, to include a two-state solution. There will be time. And so political objectives need to be put in place. That's why some type of an agreed-to secession of hostilities, so you can have a fulsome talk about hostages to see what the possible outcome looks there -- looks like there, and then, at the same time, it -- the -- there is going -- support will be able to come in, discussions about some type governance to follow can take place, those are the things that have to be put in place. Then you can make a determination as to what you want to do militarily. Right now, what we see, what the world sees is the inverse of that. There's a military objective, and the political objectives will cascade from it. No, it needs to be the reverse of that. Political drives what the military should look like.",

And I emphasize that word mutual, right, because it goes in both directions, the U.S. defending NATO and NATO defending the U.S. as they invoked after 9/11, you will remember. So those words matter. And it's how Vladimir Putin perceives whether Trump would indeed follow through on that commitment. And we should note, it's not the first time he's raised that question. In 2018, his own advisers tell me, and I recount this in the book, that he tried to pull the U.S. out of NATO at the 2018 NATO summit.
