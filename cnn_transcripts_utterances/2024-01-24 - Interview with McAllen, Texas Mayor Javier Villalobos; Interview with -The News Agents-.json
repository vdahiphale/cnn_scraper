Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's been 700 days since Vladimir Putin launched his illegal invasion on Ukraine, whose fate hangs dangerously in the balance now. Adding to the misery, a regular prisoner swap appears to have ended in tragedy, as Russia says a military transport plane crashed near the border, killing at least 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board. And the latest, Russian missile strikes across Ukraine killed 18 people and injured at least 130. Kyiv remains resolute but says their forces are no longer receiving enough ammunition and air defense missiles from the United States and NATO allies. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen joins me now from Eastern Ukraine. Fred, thanks for being with us. Can you bring us up to date about this Russian claim of that crash? And have the Ukrainian authorities actually confirmed it?",

I guess these questions are still to be answered. But in the meantime, you know, you're there in the east. I mean, you're reporting and others are reporting the really dire situation given the holdup in Congress and also in the E.U. of aid, of ammunition, of surface- to-air missiles.

If you're talking about the IRIS-T system from the Germans, but then also, of course, the Patriot missile system, the Ukrainians are saying there's a lot of Russian missiles that are fired at Ukrainian territory that can only be taken down with the systems. And of course, they're very concerned that the supplies of those missiles might not be replenished, especially right now from the U.S. systems, of course, with that deadlock in Congress. But the other big thing that we're seeing here on the front line, Christiane, which is also extremely important, is 155-millimeter artillery ammunition. We've been to pretty much the three toughest areas right now for the Ukrainians on the front line, there's a place called Mar'inka and Avdiivka and around Bakhmut in the east of the country. And in all of those places, the Ukrainians have been telling us shortage of artillery ammo is their biggest problem. They say that the Russians are pushing with assaults. They say that a lot of Russians are dying and getting wounded in those assaults, but the Ukrainians are unable to hold a lot of those assaults up because they lack ammo. And right now, they say the situation's getting worse by the day. Christiane.",

President Biden says he hopes a deal will be reached this week, and is open to \"massive changes.\" Authorities are dealing with a historic number of migrants at the Mexican border. Last month saw the biggest crossing in 23 years. And, as the November election gets closer, immigration is growing as a key voting issue. One official on the front lines is Javier Villalobos. Republican mayor of McAllen, Texas. He argues the federal government is failing his community and he's joining me now to talk about this crisis. Mayor Villalobos, welcome to the program.

And I think the perspective of the American people and the reason I believe it's really affecting these elections is that the perspective is changing from not necessarily just immigration, but national security and intermingling both as one and pushing reality. It's true. We are concerned, as you all just discussed about Ukraine and Israel, a lot of people coming in and we don't know who they are. We don't know who they are.

We are not in the business of immigration, but they do go up north, which is the reason New York, Los Angeles. Chicago, other areas are having the difficulties. Now, the reason for national security is that these immigrants are not the ones we're too concerned about, but the ones that cross outside of the port of entries. We know that a lot of people have been captured that are in the national watch list, but we can just imagine how many have not. So, the people -- I know that the American people are getting concerned about that. And we as municipalities, we are not in the business of immigration. We've been weathering this for more than 10 years. So logistically, it's not that difficult for us anymore, especially when it's only about 300, 400 immigrants per day, when at one point we're doing an excess of 2,000. So, it's taking the toll on McAllen and at different areas. And now, even the northern states, which we knew it would because the immigrants do not want to stay around the border.",

They're very eloquent. They're very anguished. And so, I think that is sort of the Achilles heel for this government. They have to deliver on this. And every time there's a horrible incident where hostages are killed in combat, and it happened a few times, this is a huge setback for the IDF and for the Israelis.

Itdoesn't much matter if Joe Biden's age impedes his ability to do his job well, which I think it probably doesn't. He's surrounded by terrific advisers. He's forgotten more about American foreign policy than most people ever learned. He brings a huge amount of wisdom. And by all accounts, and talking to my colleagues, I don't have the sense that he is not on his game on making important decisions. And if you look at his record, it actually stands up well to the last few presidents, some of whom were decades younger than him at the time. None of that actually matters as a political question, because if people think, because he's old, he's weak, and Donald Trump is stronger, then that's the ballgame. So, I sort of feel like that debate -- you can have that debate, but it doesn't matter what I think, or what people think about his competence, it matters what the voters think. So, if they think he's too old -- now, where I think we can play a role, as the press, and particularly people who cover President Biden day-to-day is to write about this intelligently, unscrupulously and thoughtfully. In other words, if there's evidence that Joe Biden's age actually is a performance issue for him, then we should point that out, right? And there have been a couple of places where he's made gaps. He's had to be cleaned up the next day by aides on some important enough issues. But by the same token, there's also a lot of evidence that he's conducted the business of the president very competently. So, our job is to do that.
