But ahead of the call, sources tell CNN that Mr. Biden has recently authorized the transfer of thousands of bombs. That decision, however, made before more Monday strikes but the revelation comes at a critical point in US Israeli relations. And inside Israel, Netanyahu is facing domestic pressure. A key member of his war cabinet is calling for early elections. Plus, more than 700 people are still stranded in Taiwan after the strongest earthquake in a quarter century. CNN is on the ground at the epicenter. Relations between the US President Joe Biden and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to grow even more tense today. According to a senior administration official, Mr. Biden is angry over the killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza earlier this week and will convey that message to Mr. Netanyahu in a phone call today. Both leaders are facing global outrage as the war carries on and feel increasing domestic political pressure. And CNN has just learned in the last half hour that the Biden administration authorized the transfer of thousands of bombs to Israel according to our sources. It was decided before the strike on the World Central Kitchen and aid workers, but still a recent decision and it adds to Israel's arsenal despite US concerns over the country's conduct in the war in Gaza. Meanwhile, the world -- around the world, there is horror and anger over the killing of aid workers in Gaza. These are the faces of the victims, innocent people who lost their lives trying to help others. Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen, is among those lashing out. He accuses Israel of systematically and deliberately targeting the aid workers. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And, you know, the US has been pursuing a change in rhetoric here, trying to get the Israelis to do more to protect civilians. And they are, you know, issuing statements and readouts, including from President Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying that they are outraged over in particular this strike on World Central Kitchen aid workers. However, when it comes to the actual arms sale policy, it seems to be business as usual. And that is something that the administration has not necessarily denied. They have said that they are going to continue supporting Israel with these arms transfers and these weapons sales in order to allow Israel to defend itself against the threats that it faces, including Hamas and Iran. But it's important to note that even though this authorization, this latest authorization came just before this WCK strike, it came after well over 190 other aid workers have been killed in Gaza already as a result of Israeli strikes and the fighting there. And so, I think that with this latest report, and also as you see President Biden speak to Netanyahu today, there are going to be even louder calls for the administration to kind of match its actions with its rhetoric.",

President Biden is being undermined in many ways on the progressive wing of his own democratic coalition by his continued support for Netanyahu. There is outrage among those voters about the civilian toll of the Israeli war in Gaza. So this is something that's really threatening President Joe Biden's own political standing. And in Israel, of course, we've seen the biggest demonstrations against Netanyahu since the war began. He's got problems in his own cabinet. Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, came out and called for early elections. So both of these leaders are in a political position where they're challenged by the situation.

A few weeks ago, we heard Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, call for early elections in Israel, another very pro- Israel senator.

ChuckSchumer was vindicating his own speech from two weeks ago in which he called for an early election. And what Benny Gantz did, and I'll get to that in five seconds, is exactly vindicating what Chuck Schumer did. Pay attention, as Stephen correctly did, to the three Chrises, Chris Coons, Chris Van Hollen and Chris Murphy, all three leading Democratic senators. All three considered to be very close to President Biden, with Chris Coons being very close. So the pressure that they are exerting on Biden is then exerted on Benny Gantz, who was invited to Washington two weeks ago. And I'm sure that was on the agenda. Now after Benny Gantz, let me put something in perspective briefly. Everyone seems to think that this is very dramatic, that Benny Gantz, member of the war cabinet, is calling for an early election. But look carefully what he said. Let's make September an agreed upon day for an election to which Yair Lapid, chairman of the opposition, alluded to. That means that he's not leaving the government with -- government, which gives and provides Mr. Netanyahu with even more added protective field, a political protective field. And two, September is an agreed upon day. So Mr. Netanyahu can prolong this, as Stephen was referring to correctly, can prolong the war for his own political needs. So September could actually become December and December can become February, which is exactly what Mr. Netanyahu wants to do. I do think, however, that the pressure on Benny Gantz rather than on Mr. Netanyahu, the pressure on Mister Gantz to withdraw from the government will increase. It would lead, as a consequence, to more demonstrations, which would lead to more pressure on the coalition, which would then lead to an early election.",

We are watching for any developments to come out of that call. Meanwhile, we're also learning that Israel is using artificial intelligence to help pick bombing targets in Gaza. That is according to an investigation by \"+972 Magazine\" and local call (ph), citing Israeli intelligence officials. The online publication, which is run by Palestinians and Israelis, reports the AI based tool is called Lavender. And although it is known to have a 10 percent error rate, human review of the targets it comes up with was cursory at best. The IDF did not dispute the tool exists but it denied AI was being used to identify suspected terrorists. Now CNN cannot independently verify what is in this investigation. Last hour, I spoke to the author of that report, Yuval Abraham. I started off by asking him about his findings and how the AI program works. I want you to take a listen to this conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YUVAL ABRAHAM, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, +972 MAGAZINE:  That description, just, you know, by the way, it appears in a 2021 book and a book that was signed anonymously but we discovered was actually written by the present commander of Units 8200, which is like the Israeli equivalent of the NSA. And that book is titled, \"Human Machine teams:  How a collaboration between AI and human beings can revolutionize the world.\" And such a target machine, such a system with this feature, exists in the book. Now according to the six Israeli military intelligence sources that have spoken with, as you said, what Lavender does is that it collects information on almost everybody in the Gaza Strip. One source told me it's 90 percent of the people. So hundreds of thousands of people. And it gives each one and rating based on this long list of features. And the rating shows how probable the machine thinks that a particular individual is -- that belongs to the Hamas or the Islamic Jihad military wings. And as sources said, when they were operating this machine, they were told two things. The first is that, during the first few weeks of the war, they were not forced to apply any thorough supervision over the results. So one source told me that he would spend roughly 20 seconds before authorizing each target. And the only supervision they needed to do is to check if the target the machine marked was a male or female. And the second thing, as you said, both have said that the machine would occasionally make mistakes. It would mark people who have a loose connection to Hamas or no connection at all to Hamas as potential targets. And they knew that the supervision mechanism in place would not be able to find all of these mistakes.",

I want you to give me a sense of what you think of the response to this particular case. And Amnesty International has been very loud in its response every time something occurs on the ground with aid workers. SHERINE TADROS, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND U.N. REPRESENTATIVE, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL:  It's completely unacceptable. It seems to be that the Israeli officials are saying, whoopsee, we have this fog of war. We didn't see the -- they were aid workers. But as your last guest talked about, there's very sophisticated weaponry being used by the Israeli army. And so it's really not an excuse to say that there's a fog of war. The head of the organization had talked about how the vehicles were very clearly marked. And it's one of the three vehicles were. He talked about how this looked like a deliberate killing, a deliberate targeting of his staff when the seven people were killed. And what we need now is an independent and an impartial investigation, not an investigation by the Israeli -- (CROSSTALK)",

This is not rocket science. This is something that can be done. The United Nations can do it. There are other independent and impartial experts that can conduct such an investigation. But what we've seen in the past is that Israel has said, no, we will conduct our own investigation into our own army. And of course, that leads to very little information ever becoming public and absolutely no accountability. Sherine, I want to move on to this new law, a potential new law out of Israel, that would ban any foreign media that posed a security risk to Israel. Al Jazeera coming under the spotlight; you worked for Al Jazeera. We know just how many staff members have been in killed in this war as well and how deadly it has been. But overall, this could open up a Dora's (sic) box for foreign media as a whole, covering this war. What are your thoughts?",

      "sentences": "Well, I'll let Al Jazeera speak for themselves and I believe they have released statements talking about how this is complete nonsense. Butit's a very slippery slope. Once you start accusing certain media of saying certain things that you don't like, calling them biased, it's hard right now in the media landscape to talk about completely neutral channels as it is. So under international law, it's very clear, you cannot pick and choose which media you like and you don't like this. These are accredited media professionals. They should be afforded that kind of respect, even if you don't like what they say. That is what democracy is about.",

It had been set to go to trial in May. that classified documents case in her Florida courtroom. That was clearly not going to happen and so they laid out timelines. Nothing since then. There are other things that the judge is not ruling on. And one of those issues relates to a thought exercise that she has had both sides go through, related to what they could tell the jury about the possibility of using the Presidential Records Act to look at the charge of mishandling classified documents. The Justice Department shot back just the other day that this case needs to be moved along quite promptly and that that thought exercise that the judge is asking them to do is absolutely incorrect under the law.",

It's a short window but thanks to the tools that NASA has, they can watch it a lot longer than most of us.Just for context, did you know that Einstein's theory of relativity was proven during an eclipse? He theorized that the time and space sort of warps the fabric of the universe so it would make stars seem out of place. And only three years after the theory of relativity, was that proven during an eclipse. They saw he was right about that. Right now, the fascination about the big mystery is the corona of the sun. That is the hot outer atmosphere, which is millions of degrees hotter than the surface of the sun, the center of the sun itself. They don't know why that is, that that hot outer ring, which looks like a halo during an eclipse, maintains a sort of a steady temperature while the sun goes through these 11 year cycles of activity. Right now were at solar maximum, which means it's most active it can possibly be. So they're going to measure with these high altitude planes, they're called WB-57s. They can fly 10 miles high in the sky, twice as high as commercial aviation. And using spectrometers and special cameras to study the corona there as well and the rockets that they're firing up will actually study the ionosphere, which is the layer of the sky between deep space and Earth -- breathable Earth -- that has -- is full of these electrically charged particles that come from solar activity. And as the sun moves around the planet, as we spin around and the shadow moves you can see the electrical activity in the ionosphere. It sort of sparks during when the sun is up and then fades when the sun goes down in that region of the Earth. Well, when you have a temporary sort of artificial sunset in the middle of the day, they're firing rockets in there to measure before, during and after how the ionospheric changes, which affects our satellites and our cell phones and life down here on Earth.",
