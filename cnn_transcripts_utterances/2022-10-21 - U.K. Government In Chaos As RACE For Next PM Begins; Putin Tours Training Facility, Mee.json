And Liz Truss's economic plan which went over like a lead balloon, the economic plan to give tax breaks to corporations and some of the wealthiest among us that hadn't actually been accounted for, hadn't actually been costed or found the money anywhere to pay for them. And so, people didn't exactly like that because their mortgage rates were going to go up, their groceries were going to get more expensive. And I was actually at a senior center in South London yesterday talking to people about the cost-of-living crisis. And people told us that these are people who are drawing pensions, and they said that, look, they used to be able to go to the grocery store and buy pretty much whatever they wanted within reason.

British conservatives have to make some decisions after party leader and prime minister Liz Truss resigned. The announcement came on her 45th day in office, making her the shortest serving prime minister in British history. Replacing her could be a relatively quick process. Potential candidates will need at least 100 nominations from conservative MPs. A new leader could be chosen as soon as Monday but by next Friday at the latest. Former finance minister Rishi Sunak and the previous prime minister Boris Johnson are considered to be the front runners to replace Truss.

We delivered on energy bills, and on cutting national insurance. And we have set out a vision for a low tax, high growth economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognize, though, that given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the conservative party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the conservative party. This morning, I met the chairman of the 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady. We've agreed that there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week. This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country's economic stability and national security.

And then 11 days later, Truss sacks Kwarteng and appoints Jeremy Hunt as chancellor. But Hunt dismantled almost all of the platform Truss' leadership victory had been based on, including most of those tax cuts. Ok, let's have a look at how the past 45 days went by the numbers. The pound, of course, has been on a rollercoaster ride since Truss took office, slumping to a 37 year low last month. The London Stock Exchange has had a similarly rough ride, as inflation returned to a staggering 40 year high. Let's have a look at the numbers. That shocking number came after food prices in the U.K. made their biggest jump since 1980. A new blow for households already struggling with the cost of living prices and facing skyrocketing energy costs to come in the winter.
