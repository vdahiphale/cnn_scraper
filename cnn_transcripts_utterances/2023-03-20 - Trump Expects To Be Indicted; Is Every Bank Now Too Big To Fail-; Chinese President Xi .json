The first thing is unlike January 6th, law enforcement is prepared for any eventuality that may come out or in response to any type of court action against the former president.While we are not seeing any signs that large groups are actually animating around Trump's call for protest, law enforcement is not taking any chances. And what we have been seeing all day in the last few days is careful coordination between state, federal, local police and law enforcement agencies, you know, really coming up with consequence management, how do they manage every type of eventuality that could come out, whether it is peaceful protest all the way up to, you know, acts of violence. So, I think what we are seeing right now is a lot of planning. Hopefully, a lot of that planning is not necessary, it doesn't materialize, but law enforcement to New York City is definitely ready for it.",

You know, what is really interesting in talking about sort of the what we refer to as the genus of Donald Trump, right, you know, there is a lot of focus on the courthouse, the courthouse, the courthouse. But NYPD and other law enforcement entities have to be -- you know, their remit is the entire city of New York. So, there could be a wildcard where Donald Trump may not even, you know, deal with the courthouse. He may be up at Trump Tower and decide to have a rally up in the streets around there with his supporters. So, the remit of the entire city is a real focus of the NYPD. That is why they have to just really be, you know, on their toes, ensuring rapid response capabilities to any type of eventuality.

And here's another thing, the consequences here, if people have this fantasy of Donald Trump ending up in prison, it is very likely not going to happen off of this case. This is either going to be a misdemeanor. Nobody is going to jail on a misdemeanor. You look at the books and it says up to one year. Sorry, nobody is going to jail on a first time, nonviolent misdemeanor. Now, there is a variation where they could get it up to a Class E felony. It is the lowest level of felony. Again, if you practice in New York, it is quite rare for somebody, first-time convicted nonviolent Class E felony, likely not sure, but likely not going to go to prison. So, what is even the endgame of all of this? And I think Linette makes a really good point. By leading with the weakest case, it does land fuel to this claim of victimhood.

The question is, is this contagious? People are worried about the other regional banks, people are worried about banks that have a lot of deposits that are above $250,000, which is the FDIC security limit. But I don't think that the other regional banks in the United States were run like these banks that took on a lot of risk from Silicon Valley. We will learn, hopefully, how we want to deal with banks that are smaller in size. Maybe we need to put in place regulations that we had once rolled back during the Trump administration. But I don't think Silicon Valley is going to learn much. We will have another explosion. We will have another deterioration like this again coming from that sector.

So, should we as individuals be worried? No. But if you are going to take a big chance as they did at that bank, you are going to lose, you're going to lose big. So, for the midsized -- we need small and midsized banks all over the country for the good of the economy and the good of small towns.
