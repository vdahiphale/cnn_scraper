White House officials making clear they plan the President's speech here in Warsaw long before they knew exactly when President Putin was going to be giving his state of the country, state of the nation address. And yet that address frame pretty much everything the President detailed in his lengthy remarks here in Warsaw.Now when it comes to what the president said - President Putin said about the New START treaty, White House officials were very quick to respond and respond quite negatively in terms of their view that it would be irresponsible, that it would be significantly problematic going forward. But also cautioning that compliance-wise, Russia hasn't necessarily been fully compliant over the course of the last several years and this wasn't necessarily a complete commitment to pull out. So there's some gray area here, some middle ground here, but it does underscore what has just been the dissolving of U.S. Russia relations over the course of the last really 11 months, certainly even further back than that. And also what U.S. officials have pointed to as the result of that, the result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which was the central point of President Biden's remarks today, which is that perhaps they thought - the Russian president thought that the West was not united that the West was weak, the West wouldn't come together. That has been the opposite of what happened and he just pointed to NATO itself as an example, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In August, Putin announced that he would not allow U.S. inspectors in. Gauge for us the severity of the impact of this announcement then. WILLIAM COHEN, DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, it sends a signal to the rest of the world that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is something that the Russians prefer and Chinese prefer. The Iranians are trying to get that capability and North Korea apparently has it.

But if the North Koreans continue to fire ICBMs over their territory, they might be tempted to have the capability of taking them down on their own or they might at some future time considered going nuclear on their own. What would that pose to China or to Russia at that point that certainly would upset the geopolitical calculation. So I think we're at a dangerous point in our in our world history today, we need to find ways to lower the temperature and lower the rhetoric as far as what we're going to do and how we're going to do it.
