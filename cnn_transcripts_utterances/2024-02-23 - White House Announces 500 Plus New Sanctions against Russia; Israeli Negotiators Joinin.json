Well Breaking News this hour, the White House holding Vladimir Putin directly responsible for the death of his longtime critic Alexei Navalny. Today U.S. President Joe Biden announcing further measures against his Russian counterpart in what he called Moscow's war machine. The new sanctions going after more than 500 targets they come nearly two years to the day since Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. What team coverage for you, CNN's White House Reporter, Camila DeChalus is in Washington and our Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour is in Kyiv. Camilla, let's start with you there.

Now, what we know at this time about the sanctions is that the Department of Commerce announced trade restrictions against more than 90 entities. We're also learning that the Treasury Department is announcing that hundreds of entities involved in the Russia's military industrial base will also be impacted by these sanctions. And the U.S. Department is imposing sanctions on those helping support Russia's energy sectors. So this is going to be a huge blow to Russia, and as Biden has mentioned before, is that they really are trying to set this remark set this president saying that this is not okay, what Russia is doing, and really, for them to kind of feel the economic impact of these sanctions that the U.S. is trying to impose at this time, Becky.",

If the United States still stands by its original policy, which was to defend Ukraine, to support Ukraine for quote, as long as it took to make sure that Ukraine won this battle between democracy and autocracy. Ukraine is standing right in the middle, they tell me here, right in the middle of the democratic and the autocratic worlds. They are fighting the fight, they are on the front lines, and they have shown that they've been able to use the influx of NATO weapons and ammunition over the past two years. And now they're left on the front lines on a two year mark of this anniversary slightly further on the back foot than they were a few months ago. And this is not what the West had promised, not what the West had intended. Certainly, it's doesn't seem to be a good return on their investment, which they've made over the last two years to suddenly stop and then what happens. So there are a huge number of questions on this, you know, in this country and around the idea of defending Ukraine. Huge number of questions as tomorrow marks the gruesome second year, actually going into the third year of this full scale invention. And let me just say that for Ukrainians and I'm hearing to Dnipro, which had an attack on one of its apartment buildings early this morning.

The Israeli Prime Minister for the first time actually putting on paper many of the principles that we've heard him talkabout for weeks, if not months now, but he's actually now putting it on paper. He has submitted it to the cabinet and the Israeli Prime Minister's Office says this will serve as a basis for discussion going forward. It would see Israel maintain full security control of the Gaza Strip, including the border between Gaza and Israel as well as Gaza and Egypt. It would also allow the Israeli military to basically go in and out of Gaza at will to conduct raids. On the civilian side, though, this envisions local Palestinian officials being in control of the Gaza Strip, the civilian administration of the Gaza Strip. And in terms of rebuilding Gaza, the Israeli Prime Minister saying that would only happen once the full demilitarization of the Gaza Strip is complete, which means removing Hamas from power, removing their weapons from them to the extent that that's possible. And that would only happen once that demilitarization is complete. Now all of this is sounds quite at odds with what the United States is pushing for in a day after Gaza scenario, in part because a lot of these principles would make it nearly impossible, at least in the short term to establish a sovereign Palestinian state. And that's exactly what the Palestinian Authority is saying this morning. They say that this lays out a plan for Israel to reoccupy Gaza, and to prolong the war, saying that this is a \"blatant maneuver to block and thwart the American and international efforts to link arrangements to stop the war and release prisoners and hostages to resolving the conflict and establishing the Palestinian state on the ground.\" Now, there's no question that this is just an initial kind of set of principles that the Israeli Prime Minister is laying out, but it's notable that he's doing it. It's also notable because it's going to set off a lot of debate within the Israeli Prime Minister's own government, you know, for the international community for the Palestinians. This is going too far going too far to the right. But for many of those far right Ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich, this doesn't go far enough. And that's because they have been advocating for establishing Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, which this plan does not do. So this is the beginning of a process certainly, but one that quite a lot of people have been waiting to see where that process is going to begin. The question now is where it will end, Becky.",

The point of this was to install these basically on the moon so that when other crafts came down, they had reference points to guide themselves in. There was also equipment on board to record the lunar surface reaction to this craft coming down, so they have a better idea of how it would react in that area to landings to observe radio frequencies that might naturally occur, that could interfere with future equipment, and the Embry-Riddle EagleCam, this could prove very important. This was thrust off about 100 feet 30 meters above the surface. It was a camera designed to take a bunch of pictures in about six seconds of the craft landing on the moon designed by the students and faculty at Embry- Riddle, those pictures could be very, very important if there is any damage to this craft.

Well, of course, if it will work, they still want to find out about water in the regolith, which is the surface of the moon, all that -- in the gray, sand and rock all those things. They want to be able to see how much water might be there. Can you convert it into liquid oxygen for rocket fuel or into regular oxygen for breathing? Can you drink it? Is there enough of it? They want to look at the sunlight there. They get a lot of sunlight and some of the high areas down here that could generate a lot of power. That's why this area is so interesting to exploration right now. And because of all this might be the area where you could have sustained human presence and why does that matter?
