Tomorrow, opening statements began in the trial of defendant, Donald Trump, the first former president ever to be on trial for criminal charges. Trump will walk into a Manhattan courtroom tomorrow morning, where he will hear the state's case against him. He is facing dozens of charges related to an alleged hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels made before the 2016 election. This is the first of four criminal cases against Trump to go to trial. Twelve jurors and six alternates will decide Trump's fate. Here is CNN's Brian Todd.

And that is a very good point you've made.The contempt hearing will not be in the presence of the jury and this is based upon 10 violations that are alleged by the prosecutor and this is criminal contempt, not civil contempt. Civil contempt basically is, you have not complied with an order because you just haven't done something. And I usually comes up in divorce cases where one spouse hides the assets of another and the judge says produce the money and the person says, no. The judge locks up the person until the person says this is where I put the money. So basically in civil contempt, the person has the key -- holds the key to the jail cell. All they have to do is give up the information. Criminal is different. The act has been done. So the allegation here in criminal is that he has violated the gag order 10 times by posting on social media and posting on his website. So this is out of the hearing of the jury. It is a criminal proceeding. The prosecutor has to prove each violation beyond a reasonable doubt, and actually, if the defendant also has a right, Trump has a right to assert the Fifth Amendment against incrimination and not say anything at all.",

If anything, it has actually grown. Now, I had an opportunity to speak to a student on campus yesterday that has been observing the situation every single day and says it has been peaceful and the university hasn't had any sort of need to interject. So the question is, how long will that in encampment be allowed to remain in place? But now in a separate vein in a conversation that CNN's Jake Tapper had an opportunity to have with a rabbi associated with Columbia's Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative, that rabbi is sending a message from a personal account to about 300 mainly Orthodox students on campus warning that it is likely a good idea for them to return home. In the conversation the rabbi had with our colleague, Jake Tapper. I want to read you a portion of what he -- of what this rabbi said and the reason why he issued this warning to some of the students on campus. The rabbi writing: \"In a response to the scene on campus last night to just horrific videos of protesters on campus calling for Jews to be killed, just off campus, Jews being yelled at to go back to Poland, text messages I am getting,\" he writes, constantly from Jewish students about how unsafe they feel, the rabbi wrote, \"I thought it is important to state the severity of the situation.\" Now, adding to the rabbi's message, we've actually also heard from other Jewish organizations on campus that feel that the university is simply is not doing enough to make sure that Jewish students feel comfortable and safe on campus. Now, if this sounds familiar at all, this is because this is part of the larger conversation that we've already had for person several months where you have people on all sides of the ongoing debate and then protests, feeling that the university is not doing enough because what we heard from Palestinians supporting crowds just off-campus here they continue to call for the campus to basically defund, divest some of those companies directly get linked to Israel. So really, it is all sides what we've been hearing today, but the reality is for the university, not just here, but throughout the country, they are now grappling with how to deal with intensifying demonstrations, not just on-campus, but as you see behind me, off campus as well -- Fred.",

And over the last several months, making the point that these funds were urgent and necessary for Ukraine especially in the last few weeks when we did see battlefield losses in Ukraine. The White House putting that squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress saying that these funds needed to pass. We saw that happen yesterday and the White House applauding that effort, and I am told by a White House official that on Saturday afternoon, President Biden jumped on the phone with Speaker Johnson and House Minority Leader Jeffries separately to thank them for getting this supplemental pass to the finish line. And of course, Fred, US officials have consistently made the point that the stakes were high here and they have been waiting for this moment and Defense Secretary Austin, in a statement on Saturday saying that this package could surge lifesaving security assistance to Ukraine, support Israel and increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Of course, there is still process that needs to play out here, but there is a high hope that they can get these funds and get them out quickly.",

Obviously, everybody here in the Ukrainian capital and really across the frontlines and across this country is looking forward to Tuesday, hoping that things will move very quickly, then a lot of the things the Ukrainians believe that they need are already staged with the US military in places in Europe.And so therefore, once a decision is made, they believe that that gear could be brought here to Ukraine very quickly, and then obviously disseminated to the battlefield very quickly as well. There are two main things that the Ukrainians are talking about, and certainly, Priscilla touched on that a little bit. They say that air defense systems are extremely important right now, not just for the frontline, while they are very important there to combat the Russian Air Force, but also to cities like the one that I am in right now, the Russians have drastically increased their aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities and especially on Ukrainian energy infrastructure over the past couple of weeks, really hurting the Ukrainians. And one of the things president of this country said Volodymyr Zelenskyy is he said, look, in some cases, the Ukrainians were not able to fight off Russian missiles because they simply did not have the interceptor missiles to do that because they haven't gotten any new ones from the United States. So in every respect, the Ukrainians are saying all that needs to happen quickly, I was able today here in Kyiv to speak with Volodymyr Klitschko, of course, the former world heavyweight boxing champion, the brother of the mayor of Kyiv and someone who is actually very much involved in the defense of this country.

Before this War Cabinet meeting began tonight, we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a video statement on the eve of Passover referring to the plight of the hostages, Passover is of course, a holiday rife with symbolism of freedom in particular.And so a lot of Israelis across the country right now are marking this Passover with an empty a chair at their Passover seders noting the fact that 133 hostages, some of whom we know are dead, still remain held hostage captive in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli Prime Minister vowing that Israel will soon land \"additional and painful blows and increase military and political pressure on Hamas\" in order to secure the release of the hostages. And that appears to be the second part of this Cabinet meeting, and that is to review military plans for the next phase of Israel's military operations inside of the Gaza Strip. We know that today, the Israeli military's chief-of-staff, General Herzi Halevi approved plans for the continuation of the war in Gaza. They are not explicitly referring to a ground offensive in Rafah, but it seems very clear that that is what these military leaders, as well as the political leadership are talking about. We understand that the War Cabinet was set to review plans this evening for the continuation of the war. Therefore, likely talking about the future of this ground offensive in Rafah, which of course we know last week they were supposed to start evacuating that southernmost city of Gaza where more than a million Palestinians are currently living. That was delayed as Israel prepared its response to Iran's military attack on Israel last weekend. But with that out of the way now, it does appear that Rafah will come next.

I know it is kind of strange getting used to him without the tattoos on his face, and it is the first single from a Taylor Swift's new double album. The 31-track double album dropped Friday and fans have weighed in all weekend long calling The Tortured Poets Department the beginning of another Taylor era.According to Billboard, the album generated 243.4 million streams on its first day, doubling the number of streams from Taylor's last released, \"1989: Taylor's Version.\" I'd like to bring in now cultural commentator and author of the upcoming novel, \"Okay, Computer,\" CJ Farley. We will have to have you back to talk about that. That's an interesting title. All right, CJ, good to see you. CJ FARLEY, AUTHOR, \"OKAY, COMPUTER\": Good to see you, too.

That is one reason why Taylor Swift has so many fans because she puts secret messages in there. People know that certain songs like the fifth song on an album will speak to them in a certain kind of way.And because she has almost novelistic depth in her work, I mean, that's why people care about her so much and they talk about her so much, and why I am here talking about it all over again.",

      "sentences": "Here is one thing to be careful about Taylor Swift, as though people think they know her, but we don't really know her and the way that artists go about writing these kinds of so-called confessional type albums is they change things and so the characters she is writing about may reflect certain things of life, but they may not really be real.I mean, Marvin Gaye did the same kind of thing when he wrote the album \"Here, My Dear,\" which he wrote to help settle a divorce case against his ex-wife back in 1978 and the songs were maybe about the marriage and the dissolution of the marriage, but they are also about other things that were universal. I mean, you think a Sylvia Plath who wrote \"The Bell Jar\" and of course, it tells about her experiences working for \"Mademoiselle,\" but they weren't really because she made up a lot of the characters and changed a lot of the facts, and so the universal story, maybe it is about here, maybe it is about something more. The same thing its true of Taylor Swift's songs when a song with the alchemy, with all the references to winning and things that seem to be about football, maybe is about Travis Kelce, but maybe it is about something larger and more universal. So people shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking that each song is about some specific person. They should realize that Taylor Swift has larger issues on her mind. She has changed things and this is really about everything that we, as people go through and not just about specific things about Taylor Swift, you may have seen on Twitter or X, or someplace else.",

They only have sort of seeing the outside. Taylor Swift gets guys. I think that's what is so terrifying for some men who listen to her because not only does she have the talent to write about the human experience, she has specificity in terms of the men she has talked to and knows and writes about them in unflagging unmerciful detail, I think that's what is so scary, and interesting and fascinating of what she does. And also, her vocabulary keeps expanding. I mean, you look on this album, she uses words like saboteurs and aesthetic and dopamine and xenophile, an impressionist, an empath -- words you don't necessarily hear on Top 40 songs. Taylor Swift's vocabulary is broad and deep and all gets into her music.",

I mean, it is cheaper and more environmentally friendly for us to do energy in the United States, energy production, so that means, more natural gas in the short term, that means more wind, more solar, more nuclear, more hydropower and more of everything because not only with that draw that carbon emissions as we have already started to do in this country, which is really important to keep doing, but it also allows people to spend less in their utility bills. People cannot afford to pay more for the energy bill like in California, energy prices have skyrocketed. In New York, energy prices have skyrocketed and it is one of the main reasons that people are leaving as those increased costs of life.And so, I think having closer to home energy is a really big, big part of it. I also think the resiliency measures of restoring ecosystems along our coastlines of the effects of hurricanes and sea level rise are less damaging and that also draws down carbon emissions. Those are some really common sense ones. Another one is forest management, preventing some of the worsening forest fires that have caused our country so much money just by clearing out some dead brush and not allowing them to have open flames in such a massive way. Those are just a few ideas that aren't -- you know, they are not going to draw down carbon emissions significantly, but they are also not going to equip -- or they are not going to force people to pay more to live their lives and it will make a positive impact.",
