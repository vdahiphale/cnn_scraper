It is 5 pm there. It is 7 pm in Abu Dhabi. Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD, I'm Becky Anderson, for you. More from Gaza in a moment, more about what is happening on the ground. But we begin tonight with what is happening in Doha, in Qatar, the location for ongoing negotiations between key players, in that important city, where the show is broadcast from many times in recent weeks. We are just getting word of potentially critical behind the scenes talks on a possible deal to release some hostages being held by Hamas. A diplomatic source tells CNN that Qatari officials met with Israeli and U.S. intelligence chiefs today. They discussed the possible release of up to 20 civilian hostages. That will be in return for a three-day pause in the fighting and the delivery of more aid to Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following developments for us in Tel Aviv. Katie Bo Lillis is in Washington. Good to have you both on board tonight. We are hearing from diplomatic sources very close to these talks that there is at least some progress at this point. And all of us have been following and reporting on the hostages, more than 240, of course, being held, as we understand it, in Gaza. Most of those, as we understand it, being held by Hamas. Jeremy, just how significant do you believe this news is, this evening?",

And at times it has appeared as ifa deal might be in hand, a deal might be close and then we watch those talks break down. So I think regardless of the developments, it's important to keep that in mind, that we know how fragile, how delicate these talks are. But it is very significant to see that Qatari, U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials sat down in order to discuss a very specific potential deal here, a plan to release 10 to 20 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas, in exchange for a three-day cease-fire, the entry of aid and also for Hamas to compile and share a list of hostages being held. As we know, Israel has made very clear that it will not agree to any kind of cease-fire, unless a significant number of hostages were to be released. So this deal, this potential plan that's on the table here, appears to be aimed at hitting that threshold for Israel and also hitting some of the points that Hamas has been trying to achieve here, including a pause in hostilities and the entry of aid into Gaza. Whether or not this actually develops into a full fledged deal is an entirely different question. We know, of course, that, over recent weeks, a number of other plans have also been discussed during these Qatar mediated relief efforts, hostage release efforts. We know that there has been discussions about releasing hostages, Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. There've been a number of other proposals on the table. But it is significant that the CIA director, the head of Mossad, sat down with Qatari officials today in Doha, to try and sketch out the details of this potential deal. Whether or not it actually comes to fruition is an entirely different matter.",

      "sentences": "Becky, look, very important obviously that you're seeing all these different intel chiefs coming together inDoha, here. Letting intelligence leaders lead these talks in the first instance really lets the different parties speak quietly, speak frankly, trying to get a sense of the left and right of what might actually be possible in terms of a deal. But of course, Jeremy raises the critical point here, which is, no matter what the difference intelligence officials might have to say about what's realistic, at this particular meeting. It's still a question of whether or not the political leadership in Israel are going to be able to greenlight the release of, a pause in fighting, for the release of between 10 and 20 hostages, whether or not that will be sufficient to get them to cross that barrier and be able to engage in some kind of pause in the fighting. But CIA director Bill Burns from the United States has been intimately involved in the hostage issue, really from the beginning. He's on a multi country, multi day swing, through the region, not just in Israel and Doha but also in Jordan and a number of other countries in the region. The CIA has been -- and U.S. intelligence community broadly -- has been very deeply involved in trying to help Israel develop intelligence about even where these hostages are and what it might take to get them back. One of the big complicating factors here, Becky, is that not all of these hostages are believed to be held in a single location and, in fact, not all of the 240 are believed to even be held by Hamas itself. There's also some belief that some of these hostages are held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza. So all of this is making for some extremely complicated and sensitive discussions about what may or may not be possible here. But again, the number one question here is, what happens when it goes back to Israeli political leadership?",

It's as if they've sentenced us to death.\" The Israeli military continues to call on all residents of northern Gaza to move south. It is the forced exodus of an entire population, Palestinians say. But some are unable or unwilling to heed the warning. Thousands of them are taking shelter at Gaza City hospitals. Among them, patients that can't be moved, families too afraid to travel through bombs and bullets and medical staff, loyal to a duty of care. Dr. Mohammed Abu Namus (ph) says he has sent his family away but he will stay behind. \"What can be done? There's no other way out of this, there is no safety,\" he says. \"That's why it's best that I get my family out, so I can focus on treating patients.\" On Wednesday, alone, as many as 50,000 people made the perilous journey south, via the time-limited corridors set up by the Israeli military. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON (through translator):  They're moving because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north and that the south is safer, a safer area where they receive medicine, water and food. They understand it's an improvement. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  But the south is not safer and hardly an improvement. Israeli airstrikes level homes here, too. \"Many of those living in this building came from northern Gaza, assuming the south was safe. But our homes were attacked,\" a survivor says. \"Every day we move to a new location because we don't know where to go.\" And the conditions for the estimated 1.5 million, now cramped in this corner of the enclave, are described as inhumane. Thousands of the displaced are living on the street. \"There is no aid, no water; the toilets are closed,\" she says, \"and no bakeries. We get a single loaf of bread every three or four days, after waiting in long lines for half a day.\" And U.N. shelters are overcrowded. At one site at least 600 people must share a single toilet, the U.N. says. And as for humanitarian assistance, it is so far a drop in the ocean of need. And fuel has yet to be allowed into the enclave. At the Egyptian gates of the Rafah crossing, a plea for more help.",

Any member of Hamas who is implicated in war crimes or anyone who commanded it should be accountable under the rule of law. But what we've heard at best up until this point is a whisper demanding accountability for Israeli war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and genocide, before October 7th and too much of a whisper for accountability for these crimes being committed by Israel since October 7th. International human rights and humanitarian and international criminal law is very clear. It applies to all actors and the duty of all member states of the U.N. and of the U.N. itself, is to work for accountability for perpetrators and redress for victims regardless of who is the perpetrator and who is the victim.

If it is, if all of those are true, there is no international human rights framework. But if it's only a prohibition on criticizing Israel, that's a racist proposition, because it means only Palestinians are not entitled to having their human rights defended. And I point to the many thousands, all around the world, of Jewish human rights defenders and peace activists and principal people who are standing up and demonstrating, marching, taking over Grand Central Station and the Statue of Liberty, making their voices heard on all continents, saying, this is not in their name. They do not support this. Israel does not represent them. And in fact, it's an old anti-Semitic trope to suggest that criticism of Israel is somehow criticism of Jews.

In practical terms, there's nothing left for a  sustainable Palestinian state. There's no hope of an Israeli government, this one or subsequent governments, reverting to the 1967 borders and turning over that amount of territory. In fact, there is one legal authority over all of historic Palestine, Israel now, a de facto one state. And so what I've said is, why is the international community not calling for the same thing in Israel and Palestine that it calls for in every other conflict situation around the world? Which is equal rights for everybody. Equal rights for Christians, Muslims and Jews. Moving forward into a paradigm that actually has a hope of existing that is consistent with international laws and standards. No, Becky, this year is the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But that same year, 1948, was the year that the (INAUDIBLE) happened in Palestine,  the first genocidal purging of Palestinians from their land. And the same year that apartheid started in South Africa. In South Africa, the international community maintained its focus on international law, international human rights and equality; 30 years ago, with the advent of Oslo, that was abandoned in Palestine. And what we've seen is this promise of a two-state solution as a smokescreen behind which we seem to continue dispossession and persecution for those violations and now, as I have alleged, genocide happening as well.",

Eleven Palestinians were killed during an Israeli raid and clashes with militants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. That is, of course, according to the Palestine ministry of health.

To date, Netanyahu has been fighting Hamas' war.Hamas undertook that operation on October 7th, horrific as it is, knowing that there is going to be an Israeli onslaught as a result, knowing that it could go and hide in these tunnels and it would be Israel's responsibility, that all these deaths would be blamed on Israel. So for now, that seems to be working and Netanyahu needs to be aware of that. So the Arabs are not willing to buy in, in terms of the day after in hell. To put more meat on those bones, the Americans want the Arabs to be on the ground the day after, potentially in Gaza, to help stand up Palestinian Authority, to see Hamas' rule come to and have the P.A. do what it ought to do. However, the Arab reaction has been, why should we bear the responsibility and all the political baggage that comes with it, in terms of their own public opinions? Riding in, as you heard the Palestinian prime minister say, on an Israeli tank to do Israel's dirty work? And who else is going to put skin in the game? Are American troops going to be on the ground, U.N. troops, European troops? All these questions are now being debated. But so far, the U.S. has not made significant inroads in terms of securing Arab buy-in for the day after. And a large part of that is because of the way this war is being prosecuted and the images that Arabs are seeing, of dead children and families on a daily basis on their TV screens.",

But I'm going to have you back. Just to fill you in on, I know that you will be aware that the Qatari emirate is in Abu Dhabi, as I understand it, tonight. Qatar, the UAE, Saudi and Egypt certainly having conversations about what rehabilitation of Gaza might look like, about what transition might look like going forward. But to your point, boots on the ground seems to be an absolute red line as far as these Arab nations are concerned; reconstruction, rehabilitation, helping to provide some capacity building, is certainly something that I think this region is very mindful that they have a responsibility for. But these conversations will continue and we will not get any sort of clear detail, I'm sure, for some weeks. Meantime, this conflict goes on. Thank you, Firas, always a pleasure. We'll get you an update on a story that we've been following closely for you in Sudan before I take a break. Reports of ethnic killings in West Darfur. The Darfur Bar Association says more than 50 people were killed in this area. Joining me now from Johannesburg to talk about this is CNN's David McKenzie. David, do you have at this point?",

And we believe it comes from the last few days, when the RSF made a fresh assault on an army base in that part of al-Geneina. Now I want to say show you a disturbing image that we've been able to verify in some sense. Now this shows that these dozen men, we believe, young boys and adults, it seems, that are lying dead on the ground. We've managed to place this in the same general area of the videos but we don't know if those same individuals you see in the video are in that still image. But the importance of this is that it speaks to the ongoing evidence that is building, of atrocities that have been happening in that part West Darfur. The U.S. embassy in Khartoum, Becky, saying that they are deeply disturbed by the ongoing eyewitness and evidence of these ethnic targeting, as they call it, that is happening in that part of the region. Thousands of people just in the last few days have streamed over into Chad. And in those refugee camps, Doctors without Borders saying also that people are speaking of these awful atrocities. The RSF, we reached out to them, they said that they have been involved in targeted killings but do admit that they moved some civilians in that coordinated move on that part of al-Geneina -- Becky.",
