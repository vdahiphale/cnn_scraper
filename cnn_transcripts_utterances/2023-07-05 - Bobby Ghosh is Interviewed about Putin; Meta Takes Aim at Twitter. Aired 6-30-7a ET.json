The storms, and you'll see that fire up right along Illinois, back into Indiana, about 5:00, 6:00. That weakens, and then round two sets up. And that will set up across the Plains, from Oklahoma City back into St. Louis yet again as we come into the overnight hours in early Thursday. Again, the heat and humidity helping to fuel these storms. We're well above normal temperatures. Back up into the 90s. We have heat index values reaching well over 100, hence why we have weather alerts in place, like heat advisories, as well as excessive heat warnings. Poppy.",

The one thing that Meta has is it's going to let people log into the new app with their Instagram accounts.

He's now asking people to pay $8, which I - you know, most people are not going to do. In fact, they've gotten very little uptick on it.And so he's really sort of changed the platform in a way that leaves it vulnerable. This was going to happen eventually, just in the nature of capitalist competition, but he really accelerated the process, left themselves open to attack, and now they've got a real big business headache that's about to present a challenge.

They tried to build a newsletter competitor to Substack. They shut that down. So I think this is just part of their DNA. When they see an opportunity, they go for it. But what is their business? That's a critical question. For now and for the foreseeable future, the business model of Meta is to capture your attention and sell advertising around it. And so that's why an opportunity like this makes sense. If they can go after some of Twitter's user base and get a little bit of engagement, they can possibly sell more ads against it.
