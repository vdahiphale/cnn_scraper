Essentially what that means is that the State Department want to express concerns and, in this case, it was obviously over the Knesset passing this legislation that would allow for resettlement in parts of the northern West Bank. And the U.S. has been very clear that they think that both sides, the Israelis and Palestinians, should refrain from taking any action that could further incite violence or drive up the tension between the two sides. We saw the secretary of state visit the region just earlier this year when there was that cycle of violence that had erupted between Israelis and Palestinians, really trying to urge them, both sides, to drive down any actions that could make things worse. And, of course, the concern here is an action like this could make things worse. We also, from the State Department in this conversation, the deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, who was speaking with Israeli Ambassador Herzog. And the State Department said they also discussed the importance of all parties refraining from actions or rhetoric that could further inflame tensions leading into the Ramadan, Passover and Easter holidays. I think it is important to note that they are talking about any action that could further inflame tensions because we have seen some pretty bombastic language from some far right Israeli politicians. And that has put the U.S. in somewhat of a bind over recent months. They have not said a whole lot in terms of some of those comments that have been made. But just last month, we heard from the State Department spokesperson Ned Price, who called it, quote, \"repugnant and irresponsible,\" when one of the Israeli ministers called for a Palestinian state to be erased.",

But on the next line he said, however, the government has no intention of establishing new settlements in these areas. So he is trying to cater to the base, which is holding up his new government right now, the right wing settler base. At the same time trying to appease these major concerns from the Americans, summoning the Israeli ambassador. That has not happened I think in more than 10 years. It shows you how serious this situation is. And I do not think it's isolated. I think that the Israeli ambassador summoned is not only because of this -- of this amendment but also because of all of the other issues and statements we have been seeing over the past few weeks that have caused the sort of diplomatic dustups. I should also add, even though this amendment passed, the Israeli military will have a say over this because that area is considered a closed military zone are pretty sure nothing would happen there without the Israeli military signing off on it. The Israeli military have no interest or desire to really have settlers move back into the area, especially right now at a time that has been so incredibly tense. It is just amazing to see this Israeli government essentially having two faces. On the one side you have these bombastic ministers, making the statements day before Ramadan, a few weeks before Passover, a time that is supposed to be incredibly tense, especially here in Jerusalem. On the other side, having these summits in Sharm el-Sheikh -- Becky. Hadas, thank you.

And to have Xi Jinping literally standing at his side, this state visit must have been a sort of a boost for Russia. A number of agreements were signed to bring the two countries closer together, including discussions about a new gas pipeline to carry gas from Russia to China as Russia reorientates (sic) its economy toward the east and away from the Western markets that it has traditionally depended upon. But he did not get -- if he was asking for this, he did not get a full throated acceptance or praise of the invasion of Ukraine from the Chinese leader.
