As the sheriff said, our officers, collectively UPD as well as Metro, responded to call for shots fired approximately 11:45. Two of our detectives responded to the scene. It immediately engaged the suspect in a shootout. The suspect was struck and is deceased at this time. The campus was almost immediately closed, and out of an abundance of caution, all Nevada system and prior education institutions in southern Nevada were as well closed.

Minutes later, a second notice saying active shooter confirmed. So, I was with dozens of students here, I'd say about 50 people, students and then also some faculty and staff. And we immediately had to shut the doors, go as deep into this building as we could. And these students were in the middle of giving their senior presentations, mind you. So we had to drop everything, go back to this back room, and shelter in place. And we actually were there for four hours. This began 11:45 AM, our time, and then about 3:45 PM is when they finally -- police came to our building. They were evacuating them one by one, making sure they are clear of any victims or anything else that might be of concern. And so it took about four hours to get to where we were on campus. And then they took all of the students over to the basketball center. Some of them, I believe, are being bussed to the Las Vegas convention center for reunification point. But it was immediately scary in those first moments. But these students I was with, amazingly, remained calm. It might be a generational thing, but they kept calm. Many were checking in on friends and family around campus, making sure they were safe. But it was tense there for a bit. And yes, as I said, we were in there for about four hours.",

I spoke with him for a deeply personal and emotional conversation in the White House for Season 2 of my podcast, \"All There Is.\" You can point your camera at a QR Code that will be on the screen and a link will appear on your phone that you can click and hear the full interview.Grief can feel lonely and it's hard to talk about. But, I hope hearing the president discuss his grief might make you feel less alone if you are living with grief and maybe encourage you to talk about it with someone. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COOPER (voice-over): A few days before I spoke with President Biden, I was going through a box of stuff in my basement that belongs to my brother Carter. He died by suicide when he was 23. I don't have a lot of pictures of my brother on display in my house. His death is still so painful to me that I find it hard to see his photos. These two pictures really stunned me. They were taken shortly before Carter graduated from Princeton in 1987. He looked so young and happy. There's no hint that 15 months after this picture was taken, he would kill himself in front of our mom. Looking at these photos, I don't recognize my brother. And I realized, I don't think I ever really knew him. I didn't allow myself to, and I didn't allow him to know me. When our dad died, Carter was 12 and I was 10. And it slapped us both into silence. We never spoke about my dad with each other, or with anyone. I think my brother would be alive if we had. Why is it so hard to talk about loss and grief? We all go through it. So, why do we keep it hidden away? Cry in private, speak the names of our loved ones in hushed whispers only we can hear. That's why I wanted to talk with President Biden. He has been more public about grief than any American president in history. And this is his most personal interview yet.",
