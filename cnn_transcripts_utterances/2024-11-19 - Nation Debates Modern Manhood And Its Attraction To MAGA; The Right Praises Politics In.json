Soaring college costs affect people regardless of their gender, but manufacturing jobs wants to take it to the middle class for men without college degrees have been off-shored. Housing is increasingly unaffordable. Men are stuck, they are isolated, despairing, and unproductive, prone to obesity, drug addiction, and suicide, susceptible to misogyny, conspiracy theories, and radicalization. They make inadequate mates, employees and citizens. It's a pretty dire picture that he paints there. And it seems what he's saying is that Trump spoke to that.",

And that's a real problem for a society that depends on all of us to be engaged and working together to make it as good of a country and as good of a society as it can be.I think the Democrats in this election made men feel like that the patriarchy is over, boys, and we're going to put you in the back seat for a while, and you're just going to have to accept it, without any thought to the ramifications of telling people who are out honestly trying to make a living, provide for their families, be good husbands, be good fathers. When you tell people who are doing their level best that either, A, it's not good enough, or, B, you're part of the problem, what do you expect? And then finally, as a political tactic, you know, the attempt to put Walz on the ticket and that was going to somehow solve all of the problems that had been built up for years was ridiculous, because it turns out Walz was the last person that men wanted to hear from. And I remember at the beginning of that whole campaign, when they put him on, I sat right here and people are like, oh, they got camouflaged hats. They're going to be wearing them in the deer stands this fall. And I think to your point that you just made, that was not -- that idea that was not formulated by a bunch of dudes who actually go deer hunting.

I think there was something else there.With that being said, because it went across multiple demographics, I do think that, to one of the quotes you showcased earlier, there is a large percentage of males who are trying to figure out where they fit in this economic system. The fact that, you know, we are living in a society and a culture where men are typically -- their value is determined by how much they make. And it is unfortunate, but that is where we are. And there are a lot of households where they are having a really hard time trying to, you know, make ends meet. They are in a society where, you know, more and more women are graduating, which I think is a great thing in the higher ed level, but there's a reason why more and more men aren't attending. There's a reason why those men who were able to get jobs 15, 20 years ago in a skills-based work that would have allowed them to buy a home cannot find those jobs now.
