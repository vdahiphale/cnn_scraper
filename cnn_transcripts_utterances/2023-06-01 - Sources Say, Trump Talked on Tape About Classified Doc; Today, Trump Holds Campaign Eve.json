It also is a meeting that was between him and two others who were helping write Mark Meadow's autobiography. Sources tell CNN federal prosecutors have already questioned witnesses about this recording and the document before a federal grand jury. This is not the first questionable audio recording first, of course, for the former president to come to light. Just before the 2016 election, the Access Hollywood emerged of Donald Trump talking about being able to grab women. And then after the 2020 election, he was recorded asking officials in Georgia to find those votes to help him to try to overturn the election results there. And now you have this. Let's get more on this record and new reporting from CNN's Katelyn Polantz. She's in Washington. What more are you learning, Katelyn?",

This would evidence, and it is the type of evidence that we understand from sources not only the Justice Department has, it is the evidence that they are people asking about, that they have interviewed General Mark Milley, the person that Trump was saying that he got this document about a plan to get an attack on Iran from. Milley is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and also was someone that Donald Trump often was not -- was very much in conflict with at the end of his presidency. So, there is that. There's this evidence that they are getting grand jury testimony around, that they're building up information, what they know about this meeting. And also it shifts our understanding of this Mar-a-Lago investigation, Kate, because we talking and it as the Mar-a-Lago investigation, what happened last year at Mar-a-Lago in Florida with these boxes leading up to that FBI search of Donald Trump's property. But that is not the extent of this case. This is a case where the Justice Department is gathering evidence and looking at the incident that they have on this audio recording from people in the room, people working on a biography, a communications aide to Donald Trump were in the room, that it happened in Bedminster, New Jersey, even a year before this was an issue, a criminal investigation. It was a moment in time that Donald Trump was quite angry, and that in this audio recording, he is captured acknowledging he can't declassify this document, he wants it to be shared more widely and he recognizes that it is protected and secretive national security material.",

And the reason it matters is, of course, is because election denialism, the insurrection at the Capitol, these investigations of classified documents really speak to the root of not only their relationship but what Republican voters will be deciding. And then it's not just Mike Pence. The field is growing, multiplying week by week, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also announcing next week. And there is a sense here, as we talk to voters in Iowa and Republican leaders, a growing field, a bigger field, helps one candidate above all, and that is indeed Donald Trump, because it could simply divide the rest of the field, divide the never Trump lane, if you will. So, John, on the first day of June here in Iowa, you get the sense this race is intensifying considerably. But the former president will be coming here to the Machine Shed restaurant in Urbandale shortly for a very intimate gathering, something that shows he's intent on trying to win this nomination again, John.",

The attack was Monday, and it actually forced the hospital to have to redirect ambulances to other medical facilities because it really tied them down. A spokesperson says their staff has now resorted to using pen and paper for patient charts as they work to restore the computer systems.While the hospital does remain open for walk-ins, it's still unclear when they're going to be able to accept new patients by ambulance because of the disruption to admissions because of the cyberattack. It's just horrible. And $38 million, that is apparently how much kale is worth when it is covering up a whole bunch of mess. It was all found hidden inside a shipment of kale at a checkpoint on the U.S.-Mexico border. Customs and Border Protection say 268 packages were found inside a tractor trailer, and that comes out to almost 6,000 pounds of meth. I know you're thinking of all of the jokes you could tell. The driver of the truck was detained and turned over to Homeland Security, yet another reason John Berman won't eat kale. Talk about being at the right place at the right time. Los Angeles Rams Defensive Coordinator Raheem Morris, he helped save a child from drowning in Las Vegas last weekend.

      "sentences": "Yes, Rahel. This is really the Supreme Court making it easier for at least one company in Washington State to actually sue union workers. So, eight of the justices here saying that a lawsuit between this cement mixing company and striking workers, it can continue in state court for now, even though the union workers here, they had argued that this suit should only be brought as part of a federal lawsuit.So, this case has really been closely watched by supporters of unions. Those supporters have really witnessed the conservative majority in recent years chipping away at the power of unions. This is yet another case where it does just that. So, the cement company here wanting to bypass federal labor law and sue this union in state court for damages the company claims were caused by those striking workers. So, to give you a little background here, this is a case stemming from a strike in 2017. Concrete drivers at this company in Washington State, they went on strike. And when they did, they returned their trucks fully loaded with concrete, so, obviously, rendering the concrete useless. The company was actually able to save the trucks, but they lost the concrete. So, the company turned to sue the union in state court for property destruction. Now, the union obviously wanted it in federal court in accordance with the Federal Labor Relations Act. But by allowing this dispute, the Supreme Court today to continue in state court, this ruling crucially, it could really chill other workers' decisions to strike, because the fear here is that if they strike, they could be brought to court for matters of property destruction, for example, in state court. This could really amount to expensive litigation. So, the lower court in this case, it actually dismissed the lawsuit, saying that this was property destruction. It happened in the course of a strike, so it should be governed by federal law. But the court today is saying just the opposite here. They're saying the union's actions not only resulted in the destruction of all the concrete Glacier had prepared that day, they also posed a risk of foreseeable, aggravated and imminent harm to Glacier's trucks. Because the union took affirmative steps to endanger Glacier's property rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk, the NLRA, which is the federal law, does not arguably protect its conduct. So, the decision here written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the judgment joined by eight of the justices, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett. So, Rahel, this is really the court here, in a minor way, but still significant, chipping away at union power, allowing a company to file this lawsuit in state court again, potentially chilling union workers from striking potentially in the future knowing that they could in fact be brought for cases like this, property destruction and otherwise in state court.
