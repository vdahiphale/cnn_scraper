We arelive in Virginia where control of legislators at stake, eyes on to Governor's races in the south Kentucky and Mississippi voting on that today and abortion rights on the ballot in Ohio. I'll talk to Greg Landsman. He's a Democratic Congressman from Ohio. Hello, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 am here in Washington. It is Tuesday, November 7th. That is the first Tuesday in November, which means polls are open now. We have one day until the next Republican Presidential Debate 363 days until the big Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". Hear the election music because voters are voting polls open in several States for off your elections that could give us critical insight into how the American people feel less than one year ahead of the 2024 presidential election. A key test is in Ohio where voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. That's also a big issue in purple, Virginia where state -- where control of the state legislature is up for grabs if Republicans hold state House, flip the state Senate they could pass Governor Glenn Youngkin's 15 week abortion bill in the last state in the south where abortion is currently unrestricted. There is also a tight Governor's race in ruby red Kentucky with both Democrat Andy Beshear and Republican Daniel Cameron considered rising stars with bright futures in national politics. And in Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves is all shook up by a challenge from Democrat Brandon Presley. Maybe it's because he's the second cousin of the king himself. Way to start that off. Let's dive it all into all of it with today's panel, Republican Lanhee Chen, Former Public Policy Director for Mitt Romney, CNN Political Commentator, Karen Finney, also a Democratic Strategist and the Editor and Publisher of Inside Elections Nathan Gonzales.

It's that the lessons that are being learned out of that race out of the race in Virginia are going to translate in 2024. Specific on abortion and access to abortion Democrats have been attacking Daniel Cameron on abortion and being too restrictive. Same things are happening in the ads that we all see in the Virginia races. And so if Andy Beshear is able to win in a state like Kentucky, that would be a good sign for Democrats. If Democrats able to do maybe better than expected in the Virginia assembly races, then I think that will embolden Democrats to run even more on abortion, abortion access when we get to next year's even bigger set of elections.",

That would be interesting to see if that works. Does that bring back suburban white women voters to the Republican Party who has pretty much shown up for measures across the country in support of abortion rights? So that'll be interesting to watch. The other thing in Mississippi that will be interesting is to see how African American turnout is because this is the first election where they've actually gotten rid of a Jim Crow era law that actually made diluted basically the impact of the black vote. Why is that important? Because if black voters turnout in big numbers, and they make the difference, that is a powerful argument and 2024 to say your vote made the difference.

And Kasie, you hit the nail on the head there. He's not on the ballot. But so much of his future and his juice within the Republican Party relies on what happens tonight? Is he going to be able to successfully flip the Senate? You know, he's leading the charge here, as I mentioned, been on the campaign trail, and it's really about selling his message. He keeps saying to voters, just give me a full slate of Republican lawmakers and I can get this agenda achieved. So he's asking for that. And so the question is will voters go there with him just the state of play for everybody watching to remind you, Republicans currently hold the House here in Virginia. Democrats hold the Senate and that's where they've been able to block some of Youngkin's agenda as he's tried to move forward. Chiefly among that he has proposed 15 week abortion ban. And he is really pitched that to voters as a more moderate play -- a moderate ban than some of the heartbeat bills the six week bills that we've seen in Florida and Iowa and other states. It's worth noting that because the Senate Democrats stopped that legislation that Virginia is the only southern state that has not seen further restrictions on abortion, since Roe Versus Wade was overturned in 2022. So while he may not be directly on the ballot, there are so much of a proxy battle playing out here in Virginia, both for him personally and his future. But also Kasie, as you well know, on the issue of abortion and reproductive rights and how much of an issue that's going to be as we go into 2024 of course, about a year ago, during those midterms in 2022, it proved to be such a big force for Democrats? They really benefited so much from that, and they kept the Senate. And so we're just looking to see kind of how this all plays out? Worth noting also, that oftentimes we see what happened here in Virginia and these off year elections as corollaries to what happens the next year in these federal elections in 2019. The Democrats flip the House and Senate we saw Joe Biden win the seat by 10 points in 2021. The Republicans pulled back the House won the House. And of course, in 2022, we saw Republicans on the Hill take back the House as well. So it will be very interesting to see how this all plays out tonight, Kasie?",

But the concept of a Youngkin himself being a candidate for the presidency, there just isn't a mechanism in the Republican Party in the Republican primary rules where he can sort of parachute in, in the same way that let's say a Democrat might be able to because of the structure of their primary process being different, and enabling that maybe a little more easily than the Republican process would.

OK, because if the Democrats do not do well tonight, it will be -- it will have been about Joe Biden I think. It will have been about the relative unpopularity of the President. And the fact that most Democrats are not interested in being associated with Biden right now. And I think that has been another element of what we've seen in Virginia is that Democrats have not wanted to be associated with Joe Biden, in Mississippi, in Kentucky, you see it all over the country, that Democrats are trying to run their own races. They're trying to run their own races on issues like reproductive rights, where they feel like they have the strong hand. They're not running on Joe Biden. So if Democrats are not successful tonight, I do think it is going to be an indictment of this President very difficult going into this election year actually.",
