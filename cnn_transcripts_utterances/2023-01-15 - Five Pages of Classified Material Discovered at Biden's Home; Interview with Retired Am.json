And the latest came as the White House said that there were actually more classified materials found at President Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware than was initially stated.It just marks the most recent shifting explanations that we've heard from this White House since the news of this, these classified documents first broke on Monday. Now, overall, it appears that there are approximately 20 documents that had fairings of classified markings on them and between both the residents in Wilmington, Delaware and that private office that Biden used in Washington, D.C. when he left the vice presidency. Now initially, the White House has said that personal lawyers who were searching the Delaware home on Wednesday found one document consisting of one page with classified markings. That was then turned over to -- or they were going to turn that over to the Justice Department. But yesterday, the White House clarified that when the White House Counsel went to facilitate the transfer of that documents, they actually found five more pages with classified markings. Those are now in the hands of the Justice Department. Now this comes as the White House has faced to scrutinizing questions over their handling of this situation and how much they have information they have revealed. First, when it was reported that documents were found at that private office. They did not include that there were also documents at that Wilmington residence. And now more thorough explanations about what exactly was at President Biden's home. Now, the President's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, has defended their work in this matter saying that they can't release all the information due to the investigation at hand. He said in a statement yesterday, quote, \"The President's Personal attorneys have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where appropriate, with the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigation's integrity.\" But bottom line, this just adds to the political headache that this White House has been facing since the revelation of these documents first came to light on Monday.

Also, we should note, a former ambassador as well. Ambassador Eisen, thanks so much for sharing part of your Sunday morning with us. Look, some of the key questions in this story have to do with timing. That first batch of documents that were classified materials were discovered in early November at an office here in D.C. It was then six weeks before investigators found the second batch at the President's home in Delaware. Do you think they would have scoured every box belonging to Biden immediately after that first batch was found in November? No? AMBASSADOR NORM EISEN (RET.), CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Boris, you would think that, but having sat in the White House Counsel's Office and having handled white collar criminal investigations for three decades, I can tell you that the timetable can be a little more complex. We know, for example, that the President's personal attorneys make contact with the DOJ, there's a conversation with the DOJ. We're talking about classified documents, so you have to establish a protocol to review those. You've got to find the personnel to do it.

So, while in this case, hindsight really is 2020. And some of the criticism is fair. The complexities from the inside when you're dealing with this are substantial. SANCHEZ: I also wanted to get your perspective on an attack that I got from a right-wing partisan on social media. I asked one of our guest Saturday morning about the differences between the Trump classified documents case and this one. And they argued that because Trump was president, he had the power to declassify the documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago, while Biden as vice president didn't have the power to declassify the documents that had been found.

When he was trying to secure the gavel, not even two weeks ago, he made several concessions to conservative Republicans, those holdouts that did not support him for speaker, including proposals that would tell the Treasury Department which payments should be prioritized if the debt ceiling is breached.Now, with this letter from Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, there's a time line to this. Lawmakers knew they would have to address the debt ceiling at some point. Now we know that the nation will likely default on its debt by June and it will reach its ceiling Thursday. So, one of the proposals that is being floated around would, of course, as I mentioned, tell the Treasury Secretary what to prioritize. And there are different versions circulating the Republican conference on the House side that would of course address the debt ceiling. But the priority for Republicans being, of course, that they do not want to raise the debt ceiling. They want to figure out a way to lower the debt ceiling and pay back the nation's debt. But with McCarthy's razor thin majority in the House, it will be really difficult for him to get all his conference to support any legislation that would address the debt limit. And of course, he will need Senates -- the Senate, which is a Democratic majority, to support any legislation for it to go into law. Take a listen to what he told reporters on Thursday about his priorities for this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  We don't want to put any fiscal problems to our economy, and we won't. What we -- what we're -- fiscal problems would be continuing to do business as usual. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just, imagine that. The school has been closed since the shooting last week, and school officials say the student's backpack was searched on the day of that shooting, but that search turned up nothing. Joining me now is Kenneth Trump. He is the president of the National School Safety and Security Services. Appreciate you joining us this morning, sir. Look, the new metal detectors, of course, might give some parents a degree of comfort. It might be emotional.

And oftentimes, it creates security theater, as we call it. It provides that emotional security blanket for parents but the devil's in the details of implementation.And schools are -- that do run them run them during the school day, but leave the schools open, vulnerable in the evening, during athletic, performing arts or other community use of the school. Meaning someone could come in, put something in the school, come through, clean the next day and then still have the tragedy you're trying to prevent. The first and best line of defense is a well-trained, highly alert staff and student body. And the number one way we find out about weapons in schools is from kids who come forward and tell an adult that they trust. So, we're looking at creating a culture of safety, a see something and say something, and train people how to do something once they hear about it.",

You're still going to have kids who are vulnerable if someone has the intent at school buses, bus stops, walking to school. And in those lines, leading up to the school to go in that typical single point of entry for the metal detector.So, look, school resource officers, training your staff, having adult supervision, connectedness to your community, and certainly engagement of the community itself where the guns come from in the first place are all valuable places to spend your time and energy because when you -- or else you're going to have that security theater.
