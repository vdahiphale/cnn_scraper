One was the kennel video which put his father Randi Kaye at the time of the murders at those dog kennels on the property known as Moselle. For many, many months, Alex Murdaugh said that he was not there earlier in the night with his family and only found them they're dead at the kennels and that's when he called 911. But at least 10 witnesses say they heard his voice on that video. And finally he took the stand and admitted being there. There was also the video, the Snapchat video that Paul Murdaugh sent to friends on Snapchat at 7:56 p.m. and that showed him wearing showed Alex Murdaugh wearing long pants and a blue shirt. Later when he saw investigators who's wearing shorts and a white T-shirt. So of course the state said that he had washed up and change clothes after allegedly killing his family at the time.
