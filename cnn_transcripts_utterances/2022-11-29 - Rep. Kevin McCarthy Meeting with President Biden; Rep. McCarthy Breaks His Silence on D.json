That -- I'm very clear in my position but let me walk through on Ukraine because I think that is a legitimate question.  I remember coming here in 2015 after coming back from Ukraine.  I remember sitting in the situation room meeting with then Vice-President Joe Biden, advocating that we would sell Javelins. A defensive weapon to stop tanks from Russia from coming in, unfortunately I wasn't successful that day.  I brought a bipartisan group in.  I think what Putin-Russia done is wrong, it's an atrocity. I think actions that we could have taken ahead of time probably would have made sure that they never entered, but I'm not for a blank check for anything.This is hardworking taxpayer money and I want to make sure whatever funding we spend goes to the right places.  Unfortunately under the current majority of Democrats with full body control, what they put on the floor last time they never gave members an opportunity to even have input. You voted on a fly-in day, $40 billon and now they want to come back and ask for more?  I want to make sure we're successful at this, but I want to make sure that no matter what we spend on come January 3rd, be it any funding, that there is no blank check.

But they're seeing inside and they're not being able to do their job, we've watched with the new administration where they'll leave gates open, where the mechanism -- the -- the mechanics have broken but they won't fix it because somehow they think that's working on a wall, the infrastructure.We've got to get the infrastructure working.  You should actually bring people in that are just processors.  They're not Border agents and let them do their job.  The other thing that they're doing is, they're doing these polygraph tests on people who are trying for a job.  These are men and women who are heroes, who are coming out of our military aren't passing that to get in, the challenge is that's wrong.  They need another -- they need a -- hundreds and thousands of more agents to be hired but we watch the administration and a Democrat control by thinking you need IR -- IRS agents.

First an emergency meeting called by the president of the United States to bring the four bipartisan leaders of Congress down. He needs their help.  There's a year in Congressional session that begins today.  The president is asking them first and foremost to pass legislation that would block a holiday season rail strike, but after that meeting the Democratic leaders came out first.  The Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, they were optimistic that rail -- that rail deal, the deal to prevent the rail strike can pass.Then you just heard there for several minutes the Republican, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Leader went back to Capitol Hill.  Kevin McCarthy, the Republican Leader, who wants to be the speaker of the House holding court for several minutes in a very combative, tough tone, challenging the Biden Administration on several fronts.  A very lot to talk about, let's start with the urgent news of the day, which is the effort to stop this rail strike.  MJ Lee is standing by at the White House for us.  Manu Raju, up on Capitol Hill.  MJ, the president called these leaders down.  He has a long list for this so-called lame duck end of year session, but he wants them first and foremost to stop this rail strike from happening, and it sounds like he had progress on that front.",

So we got a pretty good sense of how this meeting went, two big headlines to walk you through.  One on this bill to try to avert a rail strike.  Nancy Pelosi saying that a bill is going to be brought to the House floor tomorrow morning, just goes to show you how fast moving and what a big priority this is for Congressional leaders and notably Kevin McCarthy just said, I think it will pass though he did make sure to complain about the fact that, you know, the White House had celebrated earlier this year.  An agreement being reached and now Congress is in a position where they have to act, but nevertheless, very optimistic from both sides of the aisle that this is going to get done.And then on the important issue of funding the government, Chuck Schumer telling reporters that there was an agreement in the room that one, it must get done this year and two that an omnibus is better than a CR, that's a Continuing Resolution and -- and he did say that there was good will in the room.  So there were signs of optimism, bipartisanship, really signs that the two sides know they have to get -- get together and work together to get some of these things done. There are obviously, John, other things on the list that Democrats in particular, would like to get done.  The Same Sex Marriage Bill that the president wants to sign as soon as possible.  There's also the Electoral Count Act, which has Republican support and all of these actions obviously are ahead of January when things are going to drastically change in Washington.",

      "sentences": "Yes, there are trap doors and pit falls in the United States Senate.  This will pass the House tomorrow morning.  We do expect some Republicans to vote with most Democrats in backing it, but there is some opposition on both wings of both conferences.  Some Republicans believe that their Congress should not get involved, that this should be an issue left solely to the administration.  Some liberals are also critical, saying that the deal which leaves out paid sick leave should not be approved by Congress, but it is expected still to pass the House.  The big issue is the United States Senate.  You need all 100 Senators to agree to schedule a quick vote.  One Senator can object and drag out the process, potentially delaying it after that deadline of next week, in which, to avert a shut -- a -- a potential strike.Now there is some concern and some question about what some of the folks on the left who are critical of this deal might do. Someone like Senator Bernie Sanders, who was sharply critical of this deal, calling it outrageous.  That it leaves out the notion of paid sick leave for rail workers.  I asked him earlier today whether or not he would object to an agreement to have a quick vote before the deadline to avert a strike.  He would not commit to that, saying we're going to talk about that at a later date.  So there are still some questions, even though there is optimism and now widespread expectation that this bill ultimately will pass, can they get it done in time because as Chuck Schumer noted there John, it needs to be done before that deadline of December 9th or so.  Because of concerns that this could effect the supply chain down the line, can they do it quickly?  That will require an agreement in the Senate, they're not there quite yet.",

CNN's Kasie Hunt, Carl Hulse of the New York Times and Yasmeen Abutaleb of the Washington Post, grateful you're all here.  That was fascinating.  That was a glimpse at today and how much things are going to change in just a few weeks when the Republicans take charge.  Let's start with the issue of the rail strike.  That seemed, pretty quickly, right, we can deal -- that was a done deal. All right, McCarthy was complaining, Biden Administration should have dealt with this earlier, but you have the four leaders essentially saying this will happen.  Right?

That's why you hear Speaker Pelosi say, well I don't like to interfere with their right to strike, but she's also talking about, in her statements, that the railroads are making obscene profits.

And that tone tells you something, it tells you he doesn't have the votes at the moment and it tells you he knows he doesn't have the votes and he has to appeal to the more combative members of his House Republican Conference to get those votes.  By saying, I came to the Biden White House to tell -- invite the president to the border, invite the vice-president to the border, but the interesting part is that Mitch McConnell's not in this picture you're watching here.The Senate leader wanted no part of this.  He went back to Capitol Hill.  He went to his weekly lunch with Republican Senators.  He said when he got there, that he would like to pass an omnibus, now I'm translating for America, that's a budget for the next year, and Kevin McCarthy says perhaps we're going to end up with a Continuing Resolution.  That's a temporary spending plan where they pick a date, maybe it's a month, maybe it's two months.  They fund the government for that long.  Kevin McCarthy saying, if necessary that's what I want because I want to have a Republican majority deal with this if I don't get what I want. That's the fascinating part to me, is that McConnell says there's widespread agreement to reach a deal on a big (ph), an omnibus, again, sorry America, that's what Washington calls a budget these days.  He said quote, \"some significant hurdles to get over to do that\".  I'm going to translate for Leader McConnell, he means the House Republicans because they want to cut spending in some areas.  They want some restriction -- some new border funding.  They want other issues as well to be dealt with, the question is can they do that in a couple weeks?",

But Senate Republicans, sort of, overwhelmingly still support a lot of funding for Ukraine and generally back the administration's position.  Kevin McCarthy's talking about not writing blank checks.  You have some of these more extreme House members, Republican House members saying they don't want to send money at all or to -- to significantly curb it.  That's just an untenable situation to deal with and I think most ofthe people at the table, don't want this issue to come up in a couple of months.",

Because McConnell, while he certainly has specific ideas about governing and how you're supposed to get things done, he is not somebody who, for example, thinks a government shutdown is a productive way to do business.  And knows, that if they put this off, if that -- if they end up having to do something continuing, you heard Nancy Pelosi say, well if we do that it's going to be a year long.  Right?  McCarthy's talking about a matter of months, that puts a lot of power potentially in the House -- the hands of House Republicans in terms of threatening a government shutdown that would be removed from him if they can, in fact, get this budget done.  And I think, you know, McConnell knows the power that comes with the appropriations process and getting a chance to actually pick all these things, and also avoiding what could potentially be a massive electoral disaster for Republicans if in fact, you saw McCarthy.  You mentioned this right at the top, playing to that, I think we've got to them the MAGA base of the party now, because I don't think Freedom Caucus covers it.  I don't know what you think Carl.",

The Romney point about how low can Trump go, you hear it on the Senate side, which again back to what we were talking about earlier about the budget or border debates or almost any policy debates, the House Republicans, Senate Republican relationships are going to be fascinating.  Same -- same when it comes to Trump.",

Same when it comes to Trump, and the reality and, you know, Romney is such an interesting voice on this because he's the only one that can say, like he did say it also yesterday.  I voted to remove this guy from office twice, not once, but two times, and we should not be putting up with this and, you know, we haven't even talked about the fact that Donald Trump is going to be running for president for all of this time.  And we are about, what six, eight months away from the first round of Republican presidential primary debates?  I mean this was -- was how it -- Washington works from 2017 when Trump took office until 2020 when he was thrown out of it, and it looks like we're going to be in it again and Republicans still haven't come up -- come up for the most part with a good way to talk about it.",

One Arizona county refuses to certify its election results and in another, listen here, vivid proof of what happens when politicians peddle lies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
