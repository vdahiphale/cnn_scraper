      "sentences": "Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm David Culver. Let's get you up to speed on the top stories at the bottom of the hour.New revelations could be coming this morning in Georgia's election subversion case. Parts of a special grand jury report that had been redacted are expected to be released. The document could show that the panel wanted to indict even more people than the 19 charged last month. Hurricane Lee officially a Category 5 as Derek Van Dam, our meteorologist, calls it beast mode right now, spinning in the Atlantic well east of the Caribbean. It's still unclear if this is going to impact the U.S. mainland. President Biden is going to be landing in New Delhi in the coming hours. He's set to have one-on-one talks with the Indian prime minister later today before the G20 summit officially kicks off on Saturday. Worth noting here, China's President Xi Jinping deciding at the last minute not to attend and no explanation given. So, Biden's immediate focus is obviously going to be on the G20, but a new set of CNN polls is hinting at concern for his 2024 campaign. Let's bring in Stef Kight, a politics reporter at Axios joining us this morning. We really appreciate it, Stef, because this polling is really revealing. And you've got questions regarding Biden's age and perceived competence, and they really don't have anything to do with specific policies. But do you think, Stef, that this could be a wake-up call for Biden's campaign that maybe it's time to rethink some strategies here? STEF KIGHT, POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS (via Skype):  I mean, look, it's never a good sign two-thirds of voters from your own party or leaning Democrats are saying that they would rather see anyone else other than Joe Biden as the -- as the nominee next year. And, you know, this age question keeps coming up over and over again and maybe in the past it wasn't taken so seriously. But this is yet another poll. This is not the first time we've seen these findings. It's not the first time we've seen Democrats uncertain that they want Biden to be their nominee in 2024. And it's not the first time that age has been one of the, if not the top concern for these Democratic voters. So it's certainly a sign that this is a real vulnerability and the campaign is going to have to address these concerns and really make a show to Democratic voters and voters across the country that Biden is the best -- the best answer going into 2024.",

TODD (on camera):  The more days that go by without them catching him, does he get more dangerous? J.J. KLAVER, FORMER FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT:  Well, he does. He gets more dangerous because he gets more desperate. And he's probably looking to obtain a weapon. He's going to need to get water and food, and more clothes, and he's looking for a vehicle. And all of those things potentially put him in contact with the public -- with citizens in their homes, cars, outside -- and that's where the real danger comes in.

And I don't think President Biden's objective is necessarily to paper over them but he is hoping to highlight the United States as a reliable partner, particularly for the developing world and particularly, when compared to China.And he does have an opening on that front. The Chinese President Xi Jinping will not be at this summit. In some ways, that's a lost opportunity for President Biden. And you'll remember Biden and Xi met for several hours at last year's G20 in Bali. But it also sort of seeds the stage to President Biden to make this argument that the U.S. can be a reliable partner for these developing countries and he is coming armed with proposals to reform institutions like the World Bank to provide loans that can help provide funding for projects in the developing world. Of course, Ukraine is the other issue that is going to dominate the summit. And we're told in the lead-up to President Biden's arrival, diplomats have been furiously talking about a language and a joint communique that would come out of this summit when it comes to Ukraine and they haven't been able to come to any agreement on that front yet. So, certainly, that's a main dividing line. If they aren't able to come up with a communique, that would be a blow to the man at the center of these talks, which is the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is really trying to use this summit to bolster his stature as a global statesman. And it is remarkable when you're walking around New Delhi. His face is on posters, on signs. You can't really walk 10 feet without seeing him.

That is not a week -- that is a year. To put it into context, for the men's top flight it is $197,000. This is a negotiation that has been going on for a long time. It's over the last year. The players are asking for an incremental increase up to $26,500 for a minimum of a year and then in a couple of years that going up to $32,000. The league has hit back saying it isn't feasible.
