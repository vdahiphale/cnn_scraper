Yes, I agree with her. What I'm asking her is we finished the tax investigation, we proved the felony tax counts for 2017, 2018 and 2019. And I think that's so utterly important that those -- the statement of facts in the -- that was represented there in court, it actually stated that he miscategorized expenses. I don't know how anyone could consider a miscategorization the Chateau Marmont. Chateau Marmont, you're claiming in your book that you were blacklisted from it, that you learned how to cook crack, yet you are deducting that as a business expense on your tax return.

That recount of what happened only came out after that. So, it's -- what is it? And at the end of the day, I honestly thought that David was going to do the right thing for the right reason. We met with him so many times and he said, yes, you've guys have proven this, absolutely, 2017, 2018, 2019, I agree with those charges. That's felony and misdemeanor charges.

In addition to adding the third defendant there actually are three new charges now against Donald Trump. The most important one in my view is there is now one additional classified document, the 32nd document, there are 31 before and this is crucial, because this is the document that allegedly Donald Trump held up at Bedminster when he was no longer president relating to an Iranian war plan that he showed to others. There's the audio tape of him discussing it. Donald Trump had since said there was no document, turns out there was, DOJ has now charged that. There also were two new obstruction of justice counts that relate to this effort not just to move the boxes around, that was already charged, but now it's sort of charging obstruction on top of obstruction because the allegation is they tried to delete the internal Mar-a-Lago surveillance video footage.

Not only do I think the defense here will be sort of one of these constitutional defenses, the best defense is really non legal.The best defense is for Donald Trump to get this thing pushed all the way out past the election and hope he wins, in which case he will certainly dispose of this case. The other defense and maybe it's not a defense, but the other hope for Donald Trump given the strength of the evidence here is the jury pool. Remember this case will be tried in Florida, estate that Donald Trump won, even in the southern portion of Florida, he got 40 percent, 45 percent of the vote. And the reality is your jury in this case is going to have minimum mathematically four, five, six people on it who voted for Donald Trump.

Why is this all happening now when the new election is underway?[09:25:20] HONIG: I do think that absolutely is a public perception and something that will persist. And I think a couple of things. First of all, if we see as I think is widely expected, as I certainly expect, if we see an indictment coming very soon from DOJ from Jack Smith relating to January 6, or the effort to steal the election, if Fani Willis then charges the effort to steal the Georgia election, which I think is likely, that will really contribute to public perceptions of piling on. If Jack Smith has Georgia covered, why does Fani Willis, an elected Democratic DA, then need to pile on? The other thing is, the timing really matters here. And there's a legitimate question about I think these charges that we've seen from Jack Smith so far are well justified. I think if he charges January 6, it will be well justified. But why did it take two and a half plus now years? Why did it take until after Donald Trump had announced his candidacy until after he was leading the pack? I believe DOJ could have charged these cases a long time ago. And the fact that these are coming now as the election really heats up is going to only feel that problematic public perception.",

Small business is the U.S. institution in which we have the most faith followed by the American military but even faith in the military is on the wane.Today, 60 percent of Americans say they have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the military. That's down four percent in the last year. A new book argues that even that level of support is actually hollow. Peter Feaver is a political science professor at Duke University. He's the author of \"Thanks for Your Service, the Causes and Consequences of Public Confidence in the U.S. Military.\" Peter, welcome back. If public confidence in the military is high but it's hollow, does that suggest that some don't mean it when they say, thank you for your service?",

And I think you can trace it really to September 2020 at the height of the campaign when then President Trump started to attack the military, attack his own generals and criticize them and -- that created sort of a permission space for Republicans to look at the military in a different way that's been echoed by other media personalities and other political leaders.And now we have got this crazy phenomenon where the uniformed military is being treated like it's a combatant in the culture war. This politicizes the military and over time can cause a decline in confidence.",

All institutions are having trouble filling their hiring needs. And when that happens, it's a tough environment for recruiting.But on the margins, this can matter for recruitment. High confidence is associated with recommending to others that they serve. So, when confidence in the military goes down, there's going to be fewer people saying, hey, yes, go into the military. That's a good idea. And some of the polarized partisan critiques of the military that you're hearing particularly sort of on the fringes of the Republican Party, those can have a really negative effect on people's willingness to serve. It's not the driver, but it's kind of an unnecessary self- inflicted wound that makes it harder to recruit.",

I think Republicans need to stop targeting the military, stop accusing the military by name and military leaders by name on the one hand.On the second hand, Democrats need to stop hiding behind the military to defend controversial policies. If it's a policy set by the Biden administration have civilian leaders in the Department of Defense take responsibility for advocating for it. And then thirdly, the military needs to talk about its values but in way that does not trigger the culture war. So, the military needs to recruit from all walks of life, but that doesn't mean they need to talk about DEI or others you said have no longer mean to many members of Americans what they once meant. Those terms have become politicized, and the military should talk about their values in a different way. I don't think the military is woke. There's just not a lot of evidence that members of the military operate the way, say, truly woke institutions, university campuses for instance operate. But the military does have to recruit from all walks of life and does have to forge those folks together and that requires being sensitive to differences. And so, I think it's a mistake to call that woke.",
