TRUMP:  Because we did fantastically. We got 12 million more votes than we had as you know in 2016. I actually say that we did far better in that election. Got the most that anybody has ever gotten as a sitting president of the United States. I think that when you look at that result and when you look at what happened during that election, unless you are a very stupid person, you see what happened. A lot of the people in this audience and maybe a couple that don't, but most people understand what happened. That was a rigged election, and it's a shame that we had to go through it.

Now, that didn't happen and so for now, the fighting continues.So far as of about an hour ago, Israel says that militants have launched more than 500 rockets towards Israel, about a quarter of those have fallen short. And it says, in two of those incidents, when Islamic jihad rockets fell short, four uninvolved civilians were killed including three children, among them a 10-year-old girl. Islamic Jihad responded to today's claims, calling them a lie designed by Israel to cover up its own crimes in the words of Islamic Jihad. Now, no doubt behind the scenes, Egypt is continuing to make efforts to try to broker some kind of ceasefire. And Israel is in touch with the U.S. administration as well. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant speaking with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin last night to brief him.
