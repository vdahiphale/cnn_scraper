More than 20 Trump abortion bans. And today, this very day, at the stroke of midnight, another Trump abortion ban went into effect here in Florida. As of this morning, four million women in this state woke up with fewer reproductive freedoms than they had last night. This is the new reality under a Trump abortion ban. Starting this morning, medical professionals like Dr. Ten (ph) could be sent to prison for up to five years for providing reproductive care even earlier in pregnancy. Reality, under a Trump abortion ban, starting this morning, women in Florida became subject to an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant. Which, by the way, tells us the extremists who wrote this ban either don't know how a woman's body works -- (SHOUTING)",

Today, one in three women of reproductive age live in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions for rape or incest. Now, on that topic, as many of you know, I started my career as a prosecutor specializing in crimes against women and children. What many of you may not know is why. So when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather. And I said to her, well, you've got to come and live with us. I called my mother and my mother said, of course, she does. And so she did. So the idea that someone who survives a crime of violence to their body, a violation of their body would not have the authority to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral. That's immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining us now is presidential historian, Jeffrey Engel. Jeffrey, thank you so much for being with us. I always think it's hard to know, right?

Because one of the things that happens as we think about the past, is we tend to somewhat conflate how events unfolded.So the Vietnam War protests, for example, which began in the mid- 1960s, really didn't start to have an effect upon politics for several years after they began. And of course, it was perhaps eight years after the first protests before the Vietnam War actually ended. So, too, with the civil rights movement and so, too, with apartheid. In each case, college protests, which contributed to a broader discussion of the issues, yes, also took years and years and years to have any policy effects. So right now, we're still in the first weeks of at least confrontation over different protests on campus. As a historian, I would say there's a whole long way to go.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it could play out on two ways. First, disorder is never particularly good for an incumbent. That's just a rule of thumb. That when people look around and see that there appears to be things not being stable, that gives the challenger usually a leg up.There's a couple of exceptions to that. But I would caution people, perhaps, think back to the election of 1972 when Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent, really tried to argue his same theme as 1968, that he was a law-and-order candidate. And that the protests that we were seeing on campus were un-American, were from agitators that were going onto campuses. And more importantly, those protests, I think, drove the Democratic Party further to the left in 1972, ultimately, to their nomination of George McGovern, who lost quite badly to Richard Nixon. So I think most of the people who were protesting the Vietnam War and really wanting Nixon out actually winded up contributing to Nixon's reelection. So I would encourage the protesters today, if they're thinking about their effect on presidential politics, to ask themselves, which of the two candidates do I think would do a worst job, from my perspective? And make sure I'm actually supporting the one who actually would do better for me.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): There are substantive critiques of Mike Johnson, are largely true and accurate. No one is taking much exception with those substantive critiques. But in terms of the timing, I think we've got to be sensitive to the calendar and the realities. There's a reason I did this in a non- election year. REP.
