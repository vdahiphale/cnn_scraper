The woman who was dog sitting eventually realized, this dog is not coming back in and called the police. They initially tried to rescue her using a net. No luck. But then a neighbor with drone experience showed up and hatched a plan with police strapping a chicken cutlet to a drone. Because, of course. Police were able to lure Brooklyn off the ice.

A U.S. official tells CNN early indications suggest a Russian anti-aircraft system may have downed the Azerbaijan airlines flight on Christmas Day. Now, what you're seeing here shows the plane moving at a high speed, its wheels down as it quickly descends toward the ground, then right there, ultimately hits and burst into flames. At least 38 out of 67 people on board died, 29 others, including two children, survived. There's also new video from inside the plane showing somber moment before the crash. A man is heard praying in the cabin. CNN does not know if he survived. Questions are swirling around this terrible crash, including why the plane diverted away from where it was supposed to land in southern Russia, crossed the Caspian Sea and attempted to make an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. And what caused these holes? You see right here, found in the planes fuselage. We'll ask a former NTSB senior investigator and the CEO of an aviation security firm in just a moment. But first, CNN's Nada Bashir takes a closer look at the details of what happened before and after the crash. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They've even had some of those deployed in Syria. Or it could be something much shorter range, much more localized. Even if the Azerbaijan airlines flight was low, something launched from a shoulder mounted or a shoulder launched surface to air missile. So, there's a number of different systems that could have been used in this case.Crucially, as long as you get anywhere close to an airline, it has the capability to do serious damage and lead to a crash. Now, the U.S. official that we spoke with pointed out that this is only an early indication there is more information to come. The U.S. clearly looking into this, but worth noting, this is the first time the U.S. has weighed in on this, and there is a precedent for this. Think back 10 years ago, Malaysian airlines flight 17. It was a Russian anti-aircraft system used by Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that took down that flight. Now Russia has offered its own explanation, saying it was birds that may have struck the aircraft. But to state the obvious here, if its a bird strike, birds hit the front of the aircraft. The engine, the leading edge of the wing. Maybe they don't hit the side and the fuselage of the aircraft.",

The risk is quite dramatically increased. And we would never say to people don't fly. But what we would say is operate with a proper risk assessment, make sure you understand the environment and make sure you're taking every mitigation measure you possibly can to maximize the safety of your operations. One of those is to fly during hours, daytime. You know, the most of the activity in this area in most conflicts happen during periods of dark or early morning.

Of course, lots of people who do did lose their lives. And a -- that's a tragedy. But there's so much of that individual detail, the small -- the small details around where the explosion was, whether there was other impact, what else they could see or hear or smell around the aircraft at the time of the impact happened. And then not only that, from the point of impact to the point of crash, what happened in that period? Did the aircraft fly straight and level?

They include mocking Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, repeating his desire to annex Canada and Greenland for good nature, and claiming Chinese soldiers are illegally operating Panama Canal. But it wasn't all sardonic holiday messages. Trump also announced Kevin Marino Cabrera as his nominee for U.S. ambassador to Panama, sparking questions about what message that sends to the region. CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Mar-a-Lago. Alayna, what's the leadership in Panama saying about what has been, I think, almost a week long of the president elect talking about the Panama Canal and seeming to have a pretty consistent message on it?",

I'm going to read for you some of what Panamas president, Jose Mulino, said today. He said, quote, um, there are no Chinese in the canal. It's as simple as that. Neither Chinese nor any other power is in the canal.That was just part of a larger message that he said today, kind of pushing back on Donald Trump's claims. But I want to kind of break down and take a step back on what I'm hearing from Trump advisers around all of this, because, you know, there's a lot of questions over why is Donald Trump so fixated on this right now? I'm told that actually, he's brought up the Panama Canal a lot over the past several months, and it's something that he has been focused on in the past. He believes that the Jimmy Carter era treaty that gave control of the canal after it was made by the U.S. to Panama was a wrong move. He's called it stupid in previous interviews, but also, really, it all comes down to this idea of wanting to put the United States in a better negotiating tactic. I think the same goes for all of these threats that he that that he's making about Greenland, trying to buy Greenland from a Danish territory, something that the prime minister of Greenland is saying it's not for sale. You're also seeing this with Canada, him saying that he wants to absorb Canada into the United States. I think that is more trolling than it is actually a negotiating tactic. But again, its kind of this taunting of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, all to say Donald Trump is so laser focused right now on trying to better the United States position when it comes to trade and how they operate with different countries. And part of that is he's looking and seeking a better rates for American vessels in the Panama canal, that is what I'm told from Trump advisers. But again, it's also still unclear how serious he is about a lot of these threats. I think, you know, a lot of times we question, is this an opening salvo to force these people to the negotiating table, or is this really him trolling or taunting, like were kind of seeing him do with Canada? Or is this more of, you know, red meat for his base, knowing that he only has weeks to go until he is sworn in on January 20th? I think it can be a combination of both, and we're kind of seeing that play out. But to be clear, a lot of these things are very unlikely to happen again. You've heard Panama push back very heavily, saying that this is not something that they are opening, that they're open to. They do not want to give control of the canal to the United States. You're seeing that with Greenland. And also Trudeau kind of, you know, trying to put an end to some of these taunts -- Phil.",

Thanks so much.Let's dissect all of this with former Washington Republican Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley, and Bakari Sellers, a CNN political commentator and former state representative in South Carolina. Tiffany, I think to Alayna's last point there, this has been one of the questions of -- is it trolling? Is he? And I think in Justin Trudeau's case, it seems to be very explicitly trolling. But when it comes to Greenland, when it comes to the Panama Canal, is this a negotiating tactic? Is he trying to lay the groundwork? For an American First foreign policy, how does this all kind of align? TIFFANY SMILEY (R), FORMER WASHINGTON SENATE CANDIDATE:  Yeah, I mean, look, over the last four years, we've been the laughingstock of the world, and world leaders have gotten away with whatever they wanted. President Trump is showing peace through strength. You know, as far as the Panama canal, he has talked he talked about the Panama canal all throughout his campaign and rightfully pointed out that it was practically given away for free under Jimmy Carter. A safe and secure Panama canal is so crucial to America's economy, and not only that, but our national security. So we know that China is operating or Chinese businesses are operating on boats at the ports of both ends of the canal. This is a fact. So President Trump is setting the stage to protect us, protect the American economy. I believe it is a negotiating tactic. And he's very good at this. You know, we can use American our American economy force and tariffs to ensure that the canal works for the best interests of America, and putting America at the top of the list. So we are winning for the American people. That's exactly the mandate that was put down through the election. And President Trump is just standing up and leading. He made it very clear with Prime Minister Trudeau that if Canada can't survive without ripping off the U.S. billions of dollars every single year, then perhaps they should annex.
