The headlines we're following, President Biden has announced he is commuting the sentences of 37 prisoners on federal death row. Only weeks before Donald Trump returns to office.We have obtained the final draft of the House Ethics Committee report into the Matt Gaetz's sexual allegations, misconduct allegations will tell you what is in it. And in Germany, the far-right AFD Party in a matter of hours has told a public memorial in Germany, in -- a moment after the Christmas market attack. President Biden has announced that he is commuting the sentences of 37 inmates on federal death row to life without the possibility of parole. It is a decision that leaves only 3 federal prisoners whose crimes, including mass shootings or acts of terrorism still on death row awaiting execution. The president said, in his words, in good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted. Opponents of the death penalty have been urging the current president to use his final weeks in office to issue the commutations before Mr. Trump comes back to the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): These are people who should never be out of prison. But Pope Francis has called on President Biden, as have many other criminal justice reform leaders, faith leaders, to step aside from federal death penalties, because, frankly, Former President Trump executed quite a few -- directed the execution of quite a few individuals on federal death row. There are some real questions about the fairness and the process of the death penalty in the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then also Robert Bowers, the man who killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. I should finally note that President Biden, who is a devout Catholic, says he will be traveling back to Italy to meet with Pope Francis. Of course, the Pontiff is one of those people who has publicly said that he would like to see the commutations of those on federal death row here in the United States. Back to you.",

And sources are telling us the committee secretly voted to release the report despite Gaetz no longer being a member of Congress. As for Matt Gaetz, speaking at a conservative conference, he says he still has options for the future.

My fellow Floridians have asked me to eye the governor's mansion in Tallahassee, maybe special counsel to go after the insider trading for my former colleagues in Congress.

Now that you return to our top story and Joe Biden commuting the death penalty for 37 people on death row.Thomas Gift is the Director at the Center on U.S. Politics at University College London. He's now with me live from Harrisburg in Pennsylvania. This was sort of to be fort to be expected, bearing in mind, I mean, he pardons his own son for goodness' sake. He's been against the death penalty, but it does. It's a bit weird. He didn't do them all that he's three terrors related that he didn't do. THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR AT THE CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: No, exactly, and I think that that is a notable exception, but you're absolutely right, Richard. The critics of the death penalty had been pushing for a while for Biden to clear federal death row before leaving office, and that's because Trump was widely expected to resume federal executions. As you noted also, Trump oversaw 13 federal executions during his administration. I do think that the real problem though, with Biden's use of the clemencies here, and that includes for Hunter Biden and the commutations of roughly 1500 sentences and the pardons of 39 people earlier this month, is that it might spur on Trump to misuse the clemency power itself. You know, if you remember, during his first administration, Trump pardoned multiple U.S. service members accused or convicted of war crimes.",

That war still rumbles on and continues to exact a heavy toll on Palestinians living in the Enclave. And so, in that Nuseirat incident that was reported by Hamas officials, where you say, of course, Richard, that at least 50 people were killed or injured in that operation, which it says was carried out by the IDF. The Hamas officials saying that all of those killed were civilians, many of them women and children. And at the same time, this area Nuseirat in Central Gaza, is quite hard for ambulance crews and the like to get to. So, it's very hard for them to get to those who are injured, or even to retrieve bodies. And we've seen some horrific video, video that is too graphic to show you right now of cats actually feeding on some of these bodies that have clearly been left out in the street for a certain amount of time to such that these animals have started coming out to feed on them. Another incident that has been going on for what more than 80 days is a kind of siege of the Kamal Adwan hospital in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where as you say, the director of that hospital is saying that Israel has placed explosive robots in and around the hospital. If you look at the video, it looks kind of just like wooden boxes, which the hospital director says contains explosives. But as you say, Richard, we have reached out to the IDF regarding both of these incidents. As far as Nuseirat is concerned, we've not received any official comment, official comment. When we spoke to the IDF on Sunday, they told CNN that there hadn't been any strikes carried out on the area of the hospital in the proceeding 24 hours.
