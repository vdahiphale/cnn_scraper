Those candidates vying to lead one of the most strategically important countries in the world. For the past two decades, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gripped the levers of power here, a NATO member with close ties to Russia, China and Iran. He defied preelection polls that had him losing to challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu in last weekend's first round of this presidential election. Now both candidates will face each other again. Well, ahead of that President Erdogan sat down for an exclusive interview with me. You will hear the full extent of that review over the next two hours. In part one we discuss allegations that are under his leadership Turkey has witnessed an erosion of democracy, an economy in crisis and a Syrian refugee crisis that is playing a prominent part on the campaigns of both candidates. I started by asking him about his chances in the upcoming runoff election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now yourleadership is challenged and you are competing in a first ever presidential runoff in Turkish history. How confident are you, sir? RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): The current competitor has challenged us 15 times and he was defeated. This is a new experience for Turkish democracy. I believe my people will turn out for a strong democracy in next Sunday's elections because the turnout in the last around was around 90 percent. Very significant.

This is a concluded election and after this election it will be the people who would be the kingmakers and when the people decide, I believe they will stand with those who successfully served the Turkish nation for the last 21 years.

You argue that your policy is good for trade, for tourism, and for foreign direct investment, but that is risky at best and reckless at worst. That's the view of the international market. So I ask you again, can Turkey expect a change in economic policy if you are reelected? ERDOGAN (through translator): We have seen results in terms of the steps that we have taken. In this country the inflation rate will come down along with the interest rates so that we will come to a point where people will be relieved. I say this speaking as an economist.

They are reducing the interest rates and they are trying to shorten up the inflation rate as well. This is what we are going to observe.

But right now it's reached $10,650 per capita income. This is showcasing something. The GDP per capita reached that level, the purchasing power of the people increased, and this number is bound to reach $15,000 in the next term, and we are going to move on even stronger.",

If reelected,, what are you proposing to do with Syrian refugees here in Turkey? ERDOGAN (through translator): When you say you want to get rid of all Syrian refugees, I will send them back, this will not generate support in Turkey because among them are highly qualified people such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, nurses. All of these people are highly qualified. Look at the West, look at the United States. They have been welcoming refugees from all corners of the world who are very qualified.

But then certain developments unfolded unfortunately that led to the deterioration of our relationship. And that fracture upset us as well.

I'm in Istanbul inTurkey, and I've been speaking exclusively to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of what is a historic second round of presidential election here. If he wins on May 28th, Erdogan is sticking with his economic gamble, he tells me. Keeping his plan to continue cutting interest rates to tackle sky-high inflation. And that is orthodox -- unorthodox at best. He's also talking about (INAUDIBLE) around Moscow. More on that a little later. But it is worth noting how important Russia is to Turkey's economy, which is in dire straits, it has to be said. The Turkish lira crashed by more than 40 percent last year as the president's economic policy fueled the jump in inflation. Well, here to discuss all this with me is editorial coordinator with the \"Daily Sabah,\" Mehmet Celik who is watching every development and the days leading up to the crucial runoff. You're with me on election night and I very much appreciate you coming back. Let's start with, though, what's going on as far as his economy is concerned because the central bank here is in full defense mode ahead of this runoff. President Erdogan's unorthodox economic policy, reducing rates to try and bring down inflation rate which is officially at 40 percent, some say as high as 100 percent, is causing havoc for the people of Turkey. The cost of living crisis, and as real as we discussed in my interview, a real credibility gap for President Erdogan and Turkish assets on the international markets, and that is important because what President Erdogan wants to see here is a policy that really encourages growth. He believes, and that's the way forward, he's getting some decent growth numbers out of it, but the short-term pay is swindling and it could get a whole lot worse, couldn't it?",

So, you know, for the short term, they have already been getting some results despite the fact that many are challenging him or his unorthodox, as you call it, his controversial economic policies, but this is something that we should assess I believe in the midterm or long term whether his game plan is successful or not.",

Where Turkey is located geographically is between the two poles, so this gives Russia a hugeleverage as well as the West a huge leverage over Turkey. How Turkey deals with this, the power leverage or the power politics, in its region to serve its own interest is I think very important. So for this sense, I think that pragmatic relationship between President Erdogan and President Putin, despite their all differences, serves the Turkish economy, let's say for example in tourism. So this is very strategically important for Turkish economy. Having said that, you know, if Turkey had turned its back to Russia, let's say with the grain deal would be very successful at the moment, something that is hugely important for global food security. And Turkey has made it very clear that it is against Russian invasion of Ukraine, and it has actually, you know, those whole drone phenomenon that has been very popular in the Western world with Bayraktar drones, for example, Turkey is on the side of Ukraine when it comes to the war. But to serve its own interest, to protect its own economy, Turkey has to maintain a relationship with President Putin, be it in northern Syria or within the relation of Ukraine and Russian war.",

However, I think one thing that we needto acknowledge and understand that this is not going to happen despite everything that is currently on the ground. And one of the main important and most important perhaps aspect is the presence of U.S.-backed YPG terrorists in northern Syria. This is a very, very thick red line for Turkey. Ensuring that terror corridor is dismantled, it will be something that Turkey will perhaps have to make sure that they are on the same page with Assad, if they were to agree. The other thing I think will be also the safe return of refugees and this is something that Turkey will also be making sure that this is not a nonnegotiable issue, something that, you know, they have to make sure it happens before, you know, all ties are reestablished. I think that trust issue is a big thing for two reasons. One is fight against terrorism, and number two, there is this opposition that Turkey has been supporting what will happen to these. The reconstruction of many areas. You know, the political stability and making sure that a new influx of refugees will not be at Turkey's door. These are some of the things that they have to overcome for that relationship to be reestablished. And these are very, very hard issues to overcome at this moment, although they have been taking some steps towards more normalization, I think there's still a lot of time to go to make sure that this actually turns back to its normal state.",

How far he can continue with those policies after the election of a low interest rate policy will be determined really by the market. I mean, the reality is the numbers don't add up, so if he faces a huge demand for dollars, big current account trade deficit, lots of short-term debt falling due, big demand for dollars, and a limited stock for foreign exchanges.

And I don't think the Gulf states are going to provide that unless he goes back to some kind of orthodoxy. It's been quite interesting in recent years that support from the Gulf states to countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Tunisia, Bahrain, has come with strings. Strings us, you go to the IMF, or you conduct unorthodox policy. You know, they're lending because they want to make investments and returns on those investments in the countries they're investing in. And they don't like unorthodox policy.

But if any of that does happen, then he's going to have to think about capital controls and going to those countries, you know, like the Gulf, unless he raises interest rates. And he may have to do that anyway in defense of the currency depending, you know, where the currency goes. At the moment the lira is about 20 to the dollar.

China and Russia are topping the agenda at that summit. G7 leaders agreed Friday to postpone further sanctions on Russia and reaffirm their commitment to stand against Moscow's war in Ukraine.

First of all, it's symbolic, it's his first time here since the start of the war in Ukraine at least to Asia. It's a chance for him to meet not only with G7 members but perhaps more importantly is the fact that he will also meet with other world leaders. Not necessarily G7 leaders, but world leaders. I'm thinking about India, I'm thinking about Indonesia, Brazil, who will all be here, who will have a chance to meet with President Zelenskyy face to face. And that's very significant for him because these are meetings that may not necessarily have happened but it's a chance for him to plead his case about what he needs militarily, politically, as well as economically. And then that leads me to the other big headline of the day, sanctions. The G7 agrees that it really needs to double down on economic loopholes that are allowing Russia to fund its war machine. So that's why we will see sanctions, continued sanctions, stronger sanctions on things such as construction, manufacturing, transportation, business services. These are all key components that Russia has been depending on to fund this war. So it's a chance to try and cripple them. So with this visit this weekend with President Zelenskyy, I'm sure these are going to be topics that will be up for conversation. We may hear more about his military wish list including F-16 fighter jets. He's also seen success -- the Ukraine army has seen success for some of the antimissile forces. They have proven to be effective in this fight against Russia. We'll have to see what this wish list includes, but the stage is set for this monumental meeting with the Ukrainian leader along with leaders of the G7.
