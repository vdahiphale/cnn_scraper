Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Broadcasting from our Middle East programming hub here in Abu Dhabi when the time is 6:00 in the evening. Electricity out, water service disrupted, subways halted. Ukrainian cities feeling the impact of waves of Russian missile attacks on critical infrastructure. These are pictures from near Kyiv. This missile among the 44 Ukraine says it intercepted but others hit their targets including an energy facility that the mayor says supplies power to 350,000 departments in the capital. Similar attacks are reported in Kherson and in parts of southern and central Ukraine. Now these strikes happening as Russia withdraws from the Black Sea grain deal after what it claims was a Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea fleet in Crimea. Despite that, dozen ships left Ukraine's Black Sea ports on Monday. Nic Robertson is on the ground near one of the latest missile strikes in Kyiv. Salma Abdelaziz also in Ukraine's capital with the latest on those grain shipments or lack of them. We'll come to you, Salma in a moment. Nic, let me start with you. Where are you and what are you seeing where these attacks happened?",

Those strikes around the capital here today, the mayor of cube saying that 80 percent of the city's water has been taken off line. So what the government has done is set up spigots around the city. The line of people behind me, they're waiting to get water at the spigots here. So, if you want to cook your dinner tonight in Kyiv, if you want to have a cup of tea this evening, if you want to wake up tomorrow and be able to -- and be able to -- able to wash and clean your teeth tonight, you need to come to a water spigot to be able to get water because most of the city doesn't have it. Now the mayor says that he does anticipate the city getting water back to some parts of the city as the coming -- over the coming days. But it could be weeks before the system is fully restored. And that is because the electricity grid across the country and in the capital in particular has now become so precarious after three weeks of strikes that even just a couple of strikes here now can have a significant impact, not just the water affected today, the cellular phone network hit and impacted across the city, many areas of the city without full cellular service. The Internet services over the mobile phones which are normally very good here had been -- had been damaged. And the government saying that 10 different regions hit here today with 18 different strikes, many intercepts they say but it's still the number of missiles getting through because the system is precarious. This is what's happening. People were talking to here though saying they're even expecting this and they're ready to put up with it. Of course, it's getting cold as well.

      "sentences": "This is extremely critical, Becky. There is a rush from the international community. A great sense of urgency to try torevive this deal. This is very important because what we saw earlier in the summer up until July, when Turkey in the United Nations brokered this deal, we saw millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukrainian ports unable to be exported. And that's the fear here is that we continue to see that happen again. That could mean in the short term potentially, rising food costs as we head into a winter where already the cost of living crisis has hit many countries. So huge urgency here to try to resolve this. Russia for its part blames Ukraine. They say Ukraine carried out drone attacks on their Black Sea fleet. Ukraine is denying that. But I think there's a bigger picture here. President Zelenskyy has said that for weeks Russia has wanted to pull out of this week. That's according to President Zelenskyy. This deal was supposed to expire at the end of November. And Russia was giving no indication that it was going to continue the deal. And as you heard from my colleague Nic Robertson there, there are very few pressure points that the Kremlin can press on when it comes to this conflict. And absolutely, this is one of them. Now, what we know so far is potentially there are dozens of ships, over 200 ships that may be blocked in the port, unable to get out of Ukraine and export those very important goods. We do know that a dozen vessels were able to get out of the Black Sea today with the help of the United Nations and Turkey. Russia responded to that by saying that if this continues without their involvement in the initiative, it could be risky and dangerous. Now that's very worrying rhetoric there as well. But as you're seeing there, Becky, civilian suffering being inflicted here in Ukraine and potentially wider implications for this conflict if this grain, if this initiative isn't restarted. Becky?",

The Biden administration doesn't have a good history of relations with Netanyahu. And if he takes on these far-right extremists into his government, into his cabinet, then I think that we're in for a rocky road. Plus, of course, the potential a week later for Congress to fall into the hands of the Republicans would give Netanyahu an opening to do what he's done before which is to play the Republican Congress off against the Democratic administration.

We've seen the coming together of the Israelis and the Lebanese who are technically at war over this maritime border which allows for both countries to exploit what they hope will be some natural gas reserves in the Mediterranean, given the energy crisis in Europe, at present. There is a much needed reserves potentially. But the Lebanese economy is in absolute dire straits. There is only a caretaker government at present.

So, I don't expect that we'll see it fall apart particularly because it holds the potential for economic salvation for Lebanon whose economy has been in freefall. And the politicians who benefit from an economy that's growing rather than declining, I think, have a common interest in seeing this go forward. And that's the case on the Israeli side too where Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized it severely.
