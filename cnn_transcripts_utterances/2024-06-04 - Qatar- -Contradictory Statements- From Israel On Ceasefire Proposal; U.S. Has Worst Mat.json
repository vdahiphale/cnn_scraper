He said it was proposed by Israel. But now Qatar, one of the key mediators in the negotiations, says that Israeli officials have given contradictory statements about the proposal and have yet to convey a clear position. Qatar also says, despite Hamas saying it views the proposal positively, they're still falling short of a, quote, \"commitment to the language.\" It has been now 241 days since the brutal Hamas attack and kidnappings in Israel. And joining us now is Adi Alexander. He is the father of Israeli- American Edan Alexander, who has been held hostage by Hamas since October 7th. Adi, thank you so much for being with us. I know you actually met with Jake Sullivan at the White House along with other families this morning. What can you tell us about how this meeting went. ADI ALEXANDER, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE HELD BY HAMAS: The meeting as always went really, really well. It's our eighth meeting with Jake. We kind of having recruiting monthly, meeting with the updates. And basically, we back to square where we we're back in January and the beginning of May, awaiting from Hamas reply.",

She is the chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Foundation Board of Directors and also a board-certified OB-GYN. Doctor, thanks so much for being here with us. These numbers are really sobering and kind of astounding considering the United States has so many sources. Why are other nations seeing better rates compared to us, here in the U.S.? DR. TAMIKA AUGUSTE, OBSTETRICIAN &amp; GYNECOLOGIST: Well, thank you for having me and speaking about this very important topic. When we look at the other nations and compare them to us, there are a couple of different things that we have to look at. We do have to look at the population. We have to look at how they expand their resources towards maternity care. And we have to look at the workforce.

But I can tell you some of the differences and what needs to change here.One of the things that is driving our maternal mortality numbers, especially our black maternal mortality numbers is the issues around racism or bias. Not only the effects of that has directly on birthing individuals and women, but also the bias that's in health care. That is, that's been there for decades, for -- upon decades upon decades. Also, we have to look at the resources around maternity care that are not resources that are typical here in the United States, but maybe other places. Things like covered insurance, also home visits, also we need to look at the workforce that are doing some of these deliveries, physicians, midwives. We need to look at how other countries may do it and maybe take some lessons from that.",

We have to acknowledge the effect that that racism and bias, both conscious and unconscious, have on individuals, right? The stress that they endure, the weathering they ensure. And then we need to acknowledge that, in some -- some decision-making procedures or practice in health care there is bias baked in there. And we have to pause. We have to look at it, acknowledge it, and change it. But in terms of access or the places where there might be without any obstetrical care, we need to look at the reasons why, why physicians, midwives aren't practicing in some regions in this country. And then we have to make that change.",

And I think afterward, there was no home visit. I think that's just the case for so many people.And yet, that you can see where, for the postpartum deaths, would be so key.

But it's something that is not routine here and the United States.Sure. We have some pilot projects, certain small communities that do that. But that is not wide-standing practice. And so how do we change that? Well, first and foremost, we need to have the postpartum period covered. Why we don't have some -- why some women don't have access, it's because they don't have health insurance. And there is Medicaid expansion that we are promoting to have for 12 months postpartum. I mean, states need to adopt that so that -- so that birthing individuals and women can be covered in the postpartum period. And then, we need to look at changing the mindset or changing how postpartum care is delivered. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently put out a paper saying, what -- how to optimize postpartum care. It's a little bit different. It's no longer, you have your baby, see you in six weeks. It's you have your baby, let's touch base in a week, let's touch base in two weeks. Or as many times as you want, in case there's a problem.
