Anger against the government spread across the country after a deadly fire killed ten people in Xinjiang province on Thursday. Some believe zero-COVID measures were the reason firefighters arrived too late to save the victims. Now, protesters have taken to holding up sheets of blank white paper in their rallies. It's been used as a symbol against censorship and unites those seeking relief from Beijing's strict COVID policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I think in a just society, no one should be criminalized for their speech. There should not be one voice in our society. We need a variety of voices. We hope this piece of white paper can bring about positive effects, and let others know that what we are going through is wrong. We should speak for ourselves. I hope in the future, I will no longer be holding a white piece of paper. But what I really want to express, so that more and more people know directly.

So you've seen a lot of people really key posting and re-posting images and videos, despite the very quick removal of these posts. And also, of course, people discussing this in very coded language, trying to evade censorship. So along the way, the irony here is this policy has become the great equalizer for most people in this nation, even though they may have different political aspirations. But they are now united in their sheer grievances against the authorities because of the harsh zero-COVID policy, and obviously, one of the most immediate goals of the protesters is also to end all the lockdowns and incessant mass testing.

Indeed, the Ukrainian government is explicit in drawing a parallel between their weekend gathering --KILEY (voice-over): -- an international gathering remotely and in person known as Grain from Ukraine, or Grain for Ukraine. And that is because it also marked, on Saturday, the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor. This is the systematic starvation of many millions of Ukrainians under Stalin's Soviet Union. When the Ukrainian language, its history, music, and culture was attempted to be obliterated in, by any definition, what should be described as a genocide against Ukraine committed by the Soviet Union under Stalin. Now, from the Ukrainian perspective, many of Stalin's techniques are now being repeated in this country, with the forced deportation of Ukrainians from areas captured in Ukraine by Russia into Russian territory, in violation of international law; and with the manipulation, the Ukrainians say, of the international grain markets, as a consequence of the war here. The Ukrainians saying their product of grain this year is down by about 44 percent, 30 percent reduction in exports since the mid- summer. And that doesn't account for the total blockage on exports earlier in the year, which have driven up grain prices, particularly in droughts, and famine-struck East and Central Africa. Now, the $150 million deal being agreed to or donations being agreed to by the international community, and efforts made by Ukraine to try and get its grain out and onto the international market, an act of defiance. And the international community recognizing that with statements coming from the German chancellor saying that food could never and should never be used as a weapon of war. But meanwhile, we're seeing continued attacks on the ground here in the South of the country. Kherson (ph) city hit and at least 16 other smaller villages along the river and what is clearly an escalating campaign from Russia to try to dominate that part of the battle space and attack civilian targets, while elsewhere in the East, in particular, along the Eastern front, there has been very, very intense fighting with the Ukrainians admitting that, in small areas, they've lost a little bit of ground. But this has been a back-and-forth bloody battle since, effectively, day one of this war. It's definitely, according to Ukrainians, an area where the Russians are seeking to concentrate their forces.

The wettest three months of the year this -- across this region of the world. And the Mediterranean certainly active patterns developed this time of year, as well. And you notice what the end result is when you see an impressive amount of rainfall, as we saw on Saturday across this landscape. Observed totals exceeding 200-plus millimeters in the span of 24 hours. To give you a sense of perspective for that, that's about six weeks' worth of rainfall, even in the wet season here for them. So that amount of rainfall for just about any location on Earth is going to lead to problems. And 30 kilometers or so west of Naples is where we're looking at the island of Ischia. And notice, the highest observations would be found 242 millimeters in the span of 24 hours. And again, September, October, November, December. These are the months of the year when we typically see the highest rainfall totals. But not often do we see 200-plus millimeters in just one day. And this region is certainly prone to landslides, as well. Anytime you see excessive rainfall across an area that has elevated terrain, as does Ischia here, we could see that rainfall saturate the soil very rapidly. It takes on quite a bit of weight, and eventually fails. And these communities that are on hillsides often, whether it be from earthquakes or volcanic activity, as often is the case across this part of the world. And in this case, heavy rainfall will lead to these landslides where the sides of these mountains can very much fail. And that is precisely the concern, is the soil here has been very saturated. Now the next system, it is on the move, moving across this region. We do expect the bulk of the heavy rainfall instilled here to stay away from Ischia, but still, persistent showers are possible inside the next couple of days. You'll notice where Naples is and notice where some of the heavier rainfall is just to the South of it. So it will keep the area cloudy over the next couple of days, maybe tap into a few showers, come later on into the week here. But at this point, folks are only trying to recover across this region. And the last thing we want to see is wet weather in the forecast. And unfortunately, that might be the case here in the next couple of days.",
