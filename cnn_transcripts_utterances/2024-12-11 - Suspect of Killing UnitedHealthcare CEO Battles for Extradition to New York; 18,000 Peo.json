NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: What they're trying to construct is essentially what's what's a radicalization process. Here you have a top student, the best schools, a family that clearly was supportive of him. They've been looking for him once he went into hiding. He then has something happen, whether it's a back injury or substance abuse or where he basically tunes out. Right. And he goes off to Hawaii. He's in a shared house. He's surfing. He basically goes off the grid and then reemerges to kill the CEO of a major healthcare company. So they're looking at that time period to see, you know, was he radicalized because of the injury? Some combination of both outside and internal things. Who was he communicating with? The books he was reading were clearly in the genre of sort of hating the healthcare industry. And how did all of those things lead to the kind of very targeted attack that we often don't see?",

And it's hard to build an insanity defense if you know that the thing you did was wrong. Because in most cases, the insanity defenses, I didn't know what I was doing was wrong because I was insane. The second is this other piece to this very horrible incident, which is him as a sort of Robin Hood, right. Him as a hero, as a martyr, that people supporting his mission, even if they don't support the assassination and hating the healthcare industry. And it seemed to me that in the courtroom he was playing off of that in the statements he made or the yelling that he did, that he was he was he was with us.

WARD (voice-over): In a warehouse, rows and rows of luxury cars, Ferraris, Lamborghinis and classic Cadillacs. This was a dynasty that will be remembered not only for its brutality, but its deep corruption. Below the palace in the heart of Damascus, crowds gathered in Umayyad Square.
