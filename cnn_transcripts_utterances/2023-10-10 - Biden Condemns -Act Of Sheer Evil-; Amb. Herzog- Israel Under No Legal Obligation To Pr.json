And I mean, frankly, the savagery that we have seen, taking place, in those, from survivors' accounts, and evidence on the ground, as you just heard, from that General, it really is coming now into focus. You have very personal killing, of families, of people with their hands tied behind their backs. In many of these kibbutz, in all of these kibbutz, they're right in the border. They're used to rockets. They're used to kind of the threat. They all have safe rooms, in their houses. Many people would escape -- tried to escape, to the safe room. But many, it happened so fast, it was so early, in the morning, they were caught unaware. There's one account of, at the kibbutz, where Nic was, of a family, which put their two children, in a cupboard, and then, the family was slaughtered. The children survived, in the cupboard. They were only -- they were rescued, hours later, when neighbors heard them -- heard them screaming, were able to finally get to them. So, again, this is, these stories are really now just emerging, today. And it just it speaks to the brutality that people here experienced. And it's really, I mean, it's hard to imagine.

There has been a massive call-up of reservists. There have been large-scale movements of equipment, personnel as well. The big question, of course, is there going to be a ground incursion, into Gaza, to really affect change, to try to get hostages, to try to decapitate the leadership of Hamas, or completely destroy their military capabilities?

But it's also mobilized, or called up 300,000 reservists, another 60,000, in the past 24 hours. It's deployed something like 35 battalions, of its armed forces, around the country, in what looks like preparation, for a land attack, against Gaza. And so, yes, they're not saying, \"Look, we're definitely going to do this,\" right now. But all the signposts indicate that a ground offensive into Gaza is the next step, in this war. Perhaps, they're waiting for U.S. forces, to build up, off the coast of Israel. There's already a carrier fleet there. There's another one, potentially, on its way, as well, to provide some sort of support, perhaps, in case there's a regional backlash, against a ground offensive. And I think that might be what they're waiting for, because other countries, the Hezbollah, in Lebanon, for instance, has said, if there's a ground attack, they would look at striking Israel as well. And so, it's a risky strategy. But politically, for Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Israeli government here, it looks like it's got a lot of support, amongst the Israeli public.",

I mean, how deeply, do you believe in, from what you've heard, has this just shaken Israel? BLITZER: I've been calling friends, in Israel, every day, since this war erupted, Saturday morning. And it clearly has shaken the Israeli people, of all political -- of all political stripes. They're so, so disappointed that the Israeli intelligence community, the Military, failed to appreciate what Hamas was up to. And this horrible massacre has occurred. By all accounts, a 1,000, more than a 1,000 Israelis were killed, in just one day, by these Hamas terrorists. And it's something that the Israelis didn't necessarily believe, was in the cards. But it clearly happened. So, it's really shaken the people of Israel. And then, when they see all the stories, that have been reported, in Israel, being reported here, being reported all over the world, these human interest stories about these mothers, who are missing their children, the children, who are missing their mothers, and grandparents, all these little kids, who were killed and captured? It's just so heartbreaking, to hear about all of this. And the people in Israel, clearly, are shaken by this.",

This is different. And, I think, it's really the first time we've seen these terrorists go into a kibbutz, for example, and just start killing everyone. Little kids, adults, grandparents, just everyone, killing as many people as they possibly can. And that incident, at that musical festival, that was going on, where the 250 people, young people, mostly young people, who were just attending a music festival, were killed brutally.

And so, I've studied this area. And I don't think I've heard an American president speak with the emotion, and that pro-Israel attitude, as we heard, today, from President Biden. He was extremely powerful, extremely sympathetic, to the Israelis. He said what the Israelis wanted to hear he promised that the U.S. would be there for Israel, no matter what. That's precisely what the Israelis want. They don't want necessarily U.S. boots on the ground. Israel has never really asked for that. They don't need it.
