Welcome to THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Just ahead, major Chinese cities have eased some COVID-19 restrictions but the crackdown on protesters doesn't seem to be stopping. Then, Ukraine tells NATO to send more military supplies as quickly as possible. CNN speaks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. And a new experimental drug fuels hope that doctors will one day cure Alzheimer's disease. We'll have the promising results. But first, we begin at the World Cup in Qatar, where Group C truly had to be seen to be believed, but Argentina and Poland are through to the final 16. Argentina won the match, 2-0. But Poland made it through thanks to a better goal differential than Mexico. This 2-1 victory over Saudi Arabia, simply not enough. This is the first time since 1978 that Mexico has failed to make it past the group stages. And earlier, Tunisia beating already qualified France, 1-0. Yet there was breathtaking last-minute drama as a French goal in the final few seconds of extra time was ruled offside. And yet in another remarkable win, Australia is through the knockout stages after beating Denmark with a goal in the 68th minute. They will face Argentina on Saturday. We want to bring in \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell, who is at the World Cup in Doha. Great to see you, Don. I am getting messages all over the world, cheering on the Socceroos. But I have to ask you about Lionel Messi and Argentina. You are at that game. A huge win.",

That year, they were knocked out by Italy, who ended up going on to win the whole thing. So, interesting to see how it will play out now. We will see how awesome the Australians are when they run into Argentina because they are starting to look really good. Let's show you the highlights from this game. Of course, we all know about Lionel Messi, his 5th World Cup, probably his final World Cup. He has been up and he has been down he got a penalty against Poland and it was really well saved and I could just sense the Argentina fans around me getting anxious. But Argentina deserved this game. They were far more positive, they want to win and they got it. Alexis McAllister scoring at the start of the 2nd half. And then Julian Alvarez adding a 2nd one for the argentine side. That meant that off the back-to-back wins, they are now on their way to the mark out round. Earlier, their fears and concerns -- remember that if you to Saudi Arabia? That is all way behind them now. Any other game, Mexico against Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, I mean, they haven't really had a chance of this group. Mexico, they wanted it and they went out. Luis Chavez with a stunning free kick there to make it 2-0. They needed one more goal, the Mexicans, or they needed Argentina to score one more against Poland. It didn't work out. In fact, Saudi Arabia pulled a late consolation back, meaning that Mexico are out. If you take a look at the group, you see what it means. Poland, going through. And I might suggest that they might feel a little bit embarrassed about that because they were pretty negative today. It seem just know they were happy with a draw. In the end, a 2-0 defeat was good enough for them. This stadium, 974, was absolutely jam-packed with Argentinian fans. It's good for the tournament, and the atmosphere that they are still in. There was hardly any Polish supporters in their. But the Polish fans are still optimistic. They were celebrating. But kind of looked a bit guilty. Like, they felt like they didn't deserve it. They live to fight another day. Interesting to see what happens in their match against France, next.",

We are hearing similar easing of COVID restrictions in Shanghai, where lockdowns were lifted and in Beijing where some of the mandatory testing imposed on the population has been eased, suggesting that the Chinese authorities are taking a two-pronged approach to dealing with unprecedented protests, resulting from its strict COVID regulations. China's police state strikes back, flooding the streets of Beijing and Shanghai with police, an unmistakable show of force after a weekend of unprecedented protest in at least 15 cities across the country. In the eastern city of Hangzhou Monday night, police arrested people in a central square. And an eyewitness tells CNN police searched people's phones on the Shanghai subway, looking for apps that allow users to circumvent Shanghai's strict Internet censorship. The communist party's domestic security committee ordering officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilized social order. No compromise for peaceful protesters to voice their opinion. Meanwhile, health officials striking a slightly softer tone, calling for shorter lockdowns in the Chinese government campaign to eradicate COVID-19. CHENG YOUQUAN, CHINESE CTR.

One question will be, how will the Chinese authorities react if the Chinese people try to gather and hold vigils for this former leader? There is some historical precedent that this has led to unrest back in 1989. We will have to watch this very closely even as China prepares for a state funeral of its former leader.

Of course, remember the last one, President Trumphappened in completely different circumstances, but for the Europeans, this is a chance for an American president who understood about multilateralism with whom President Macron, frankly, has an easier relationship -- we have seen that at various G7 summits. We've seen them at NATO. We have seen that alliance reinforced as a result of the war in Ukraine. And yet, from the point of view of Europeans, there is still a great deal of unease about exactly what is going on. Not only because of the -- but also because fundamentally, there are worries that behind that facade of unity, there are concerns about the way the United States, with the measures that are being taken to try to help the American economy, it is in fact punishing the European one. There are fears about energy, trade. President macron says that this is not a level playing field. His point with President Biden is to try and emphasize that Europeans want more help. They want to be heard on questions of energy. They say this is a war. And the sanctions that have been taken against Russia has particularly penalized Europeans. Here we are facing the coldest winter. Energy prices are high. That is what is on his mind. He's going to be behind all the pomp and circumstance of what will happen on Thursday in Washington. He will be there to say that they want Europe to be heard. This is a transatlantic alliance, of course, that goes back to the foundation of two republics. President Macron is going to be there to say, we understand each other better, we're working better together than we have ever before over the last few years on a number of fronts. But on the question of trade, on the question of energy, Europe wants the United States to be able to listen to it and understand its concerns. So, behind all the pomp and pageantry that you will see, difficult discussions will take place, because Macron is there to represent European views. And they feel, frankly, Lynda, that they haven't been listened to enough on these issues. And that is going to be the concern over the course of the day tomorrow.",

It is not the kind of thing where a patient, maybe someone you know takes it and their Alzheimer's goes away. Let's take a look at what the researchers found. They were about 1,800 studies participants. They were in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. They were between the ages of 50 and 90. Half of them got the drug, the other half of them got a placebo. After 18 months -- so it took a while -- 18 months, the folks who got the drug, their cognitive decline was 27 percent slower. In other words, they had cognitive decline, but it was 27 percent slower than it was for the folks who got the placebo. Also, the folks that got the drug, their amyloid levels dropped, which is a good thing. Amyloid is the plaque that you see in brains of Alzheimer's patients. But here's the important question. When you look at those two things, was it really enough to make a difference in the lives of the patients? Were they suffering less? Did it really ease their Alzheimer's? Did it make a difference in the quality of their life? And was taking the struggle with the potential side effects? Let's take a look at what the study found there. On the drug, about 17 percent of patients had brain bleeding, and about 12 percent of patients had brain swelling, for the folks, again, who took the drug. Now, to be clear, some of the patients who took the placebo also had those two things. But it was in much smaller numbers. And so now, regulators at the U.S. food and drug administration, as well as regulators around the world will have to decide whether this drug ought to be approved. In the U.S., a decision could be made in weeks. But the authors of this study, they themselves say that more studies, longer term studies should be done to really evaluate the efficacy and the safety of his drug -- Lynda. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
