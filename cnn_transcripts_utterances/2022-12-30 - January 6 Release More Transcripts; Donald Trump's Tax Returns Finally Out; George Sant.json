There are now investigations both at the local level and the federal level looking into some of Santos's lies, as well as whether any potential financial crimes were committed. That includes the Nassau County District Attorney's Office which said in a statement that his fabrications are, quote, \"nothing short of stunning.\"And meanwhile, his web of lies continues to unravel. The latest claims that are coming under scrutiny is that his mother was in the World Trade Center on 9/11 and that she died on 9/11 or that it played some role in her death. Santos said it in a tweet that 9/11, quote, \"claimed his mother's life.\" But on his web site he says his mother actually died a few years later from a battle with cancer. And there's also an obituary that says his mother died on December 23rd, 2016, so more than 15 years after the 9/11 terror attacks. Our K-File team has also uncovered some additional falsehoods, including a claim that Santos said he went to a elite private school in New York and was forced to drop out after his family fell on hard times. However, the school says there is no evidence that he actually ever went to the school. Santos has also claimed that his mother had a historically Jewish last name, but genealogists say there's no evidence of that name in his family tree. In fact, they say there's no evidence that he had Ukrainian or Jewish heritage at all in his family tree. And so just remarkable stuff here on George Santos. But so far, GOP leaders remaining silent.

The bill includes more aid for Ukraine and NATO allies, as well as an overhaul of a federal vote counting law and a ban on TikTok from federal electronic devices.

The question has been posted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the briefing yesterday, the day before, and the response was that China is calling for a science-based approach in order to boost economic activity between countries, and what they call person-to-person exchange just to get people flying again.And China likes to make a pivot and point out, look, there are a number of countries that are welcoming Chinese travelers with open arms. I'm not too sure if we have this graphic available for you, but quite a number of countries are welcoming Chinese travelers back, France, Thailand, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, et cetera. So much so that they've gone online on Chinese social media, to Weibo, to literally say, you plan to travel, go overseas, come to our countries, we will welcome you. Back to you.",

But they are taking this very seriously.Of course, Italy was the first epicenter outside of China almost three years ago. And you can look at a busy airport like here in Rome or in Milan as well, these direct flights coming in from China. It is very important for the Italian authorities to test every single person that gets off of that flight because, of course, they are concerned about the transparency in China. And in terms of the vaccine that the Chinese nationals have, it's probably not as effective as those that are being used here in Europe. But the Italian prime minister is hoping that the rest of the European Union will also follow suit because if a flight comes into Paris and they connect in here to Rome, they aren't testing those passengers. That's not something that has been mandated yet. But in an airport like Rome, there's a fine-oiled machine here. They've been doing the tests. It was one of the last airports, one of the last countries to lift restrictions during the pandemic. You know, mask mandates, testing before flights, testing on arrival, that was very much in effect in Italy long after it was lifted in other parts of the world.",

Of course, if there is a new variant, of course, if there is a change in the pandemic, that could change. But for now, Italy does not plan to lift this restriction. They want to test everybody coming directly from China, and that is going to -- that's going to be for the foreseeable future, certainly.",

Of course, we are talking about a 95-year-old man. And as anybody knows, with elderly people, there can be ups and downs in their declining years. So, what we do now is wait for any updates from the Vatican. We are here in a Vatican City. The Pope Emeritus' health is just behind Saint Peter's Basilica there. The Vatican Garden then up a hill is the house which they call a monastery where he has been, of course, since resigning in 2013, and where the Vatican let us know on Wednesday he is surrounded by his doctors, again, in a stable but still serious condition.
