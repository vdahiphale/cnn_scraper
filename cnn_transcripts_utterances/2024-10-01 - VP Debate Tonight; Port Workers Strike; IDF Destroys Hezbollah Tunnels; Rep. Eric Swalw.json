But the big celebration was a couple of weeks ago at the Fox Theater. A star-studded event for America's first rock and roll president. And it was there that I caught up with his great grandson, Henry Carter, who just turned 18 earlier this summer, and he says he doesn't know who's more excited to vote in this upcoming election, him or his great grandfather. Look, it goes without saying, Jimmy Carter has had a phenomenal second act as former president. He's founded the Carter Center here, helped eradicate guinea worm, building homes for Habitat for Humanity. He's a cancer survivor. The list goes on and on. All of that will be highlighted today. I mentioned those private events that are going to be held here the begin in just about five minutes - or, I'm sorry, about an hour from now at 10:00 a.m. with a naturalization ceremony for 100 newly minted American citizens.

A face-off that will also likely be the last debate by all accounts this entire election cycle with just 34 days left to go. Yes, a month and a few days.Moments ago we saw Tim Walz departing Michigan for New York, where tonight the stakes will be enormously high on the debate when both nominees take the stage to make their cases to millions of voters. Like the last two debates, there will be no audience. Microphones, however, will not, in this case, be muted. But CBS has said they reserve the right to mute if needed. Each candidate will have two minutes to answer questions, two minutes to respond, and a minute rebuttal. Let's get right to how each team is preparing. Steve Contorno and Priscilla Alvarez both standing by here in New York, just down the street. Priscilla, I'm going to begin with you.

They said that they believe that the Minnesota governor is, quote, \"a wily political veteran and very good in debates.\" And so they have spent the better part of the last month preparing J.D. Vance for this moment. He's someone they picked in part because of his oration skills, and they believe that he will be a strong debater. And they have been preparing him, in part, by having him have frequent engagements with the media. He has kept up a pretty aggressive interview appetite, much more aggressive than his counterparts. It includes interviews with the press, it - Sunday shows. He regularly takes questions from the reporters that travel with him. All that they believe has sharpened his debate skills and gotten him ready for tonight.Now, one of the big questions, though, coming out of this is how Americans respond to it going into this night. He is under water in his favorability rating. Of course, though, Sara, his main audience is of one, Donald Trump.",

So, any change in the environment can be significant.Now, vice presidential races don't necessarily mean that much. Gloria and I remember the most famous debate line ever was Lloyd Bentsen crushing Dan Quayle in a vice presidential debate, saying, you know, Jack Kennedy was my friend. You're no Jack Kennedy.

The Biden administration encouraging both sides to come up with a deal on their own. But as the president of the ILA union said, he's not going to be making any concessions. He wants the deal that he has offered the shippers. He wants a wage increase of over 60 percent. He wants stronger language around automation.

Israel took heavy casualties. There were more than 1,000 Lebanese killed in that war. And then you go back to the '80s and '90s, when Israel had a nearly 20-year occupation there.
