So happy New Year's Eve to you. We start this morning with a new court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith. He's urging an appeals court to reject former President Donald Trump's claims of presidential immunity in the 2020 election subversion case. Jack Smith pressed the Trump claims. He, quote, \"Threatens to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office.\" Now, Trump's lawyers argue the Constitution protects a former president from criminal prosecution for official acts unless he is impeached and convicted by the Senate. Let's go now to CNN's Zachary Cohen. He's got more for us. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Special Counsel Jack Smith is arguing that the former president, Donald Trump, is wrong in claiming he should have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution in the federal election subversion case. And he's asking a federal appeals court to move quickly in hopes of preventing the March 4th trial date from being delayed. Now, this is in a new court filing by Smith in which he says Trump's claim of absolute immunity, quote, \"Threatens to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office.\" Smith also emphasizing the historical importance of the court's decision, warning that granting Trump such broad immunity, quote, \"Threatens the democratic and constitutional foundation of our Republic.\" This filing is coming ahead of oral arguments. Those are set to be begin in Washington on January 9th. The trial was initially scheduled to begin on March 4th, but Trump has been trying to delay that and his fight over the immunity claim really underscoring those efforts. But if the appeals court moves quickly, it could keep the original trial date from sliding. And with the looming presidential campaign only months away, it's clear that timing is critical for both sides in this case. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington.",

Nobody gave me a right to come in and challenge it. Your federal prosecutor, your special counsel has not charged me with insurrection.And, by the way, remember, when people did say I was an insurrectionist, the Senate said I was not. So what is the process? Who gets to decide? Is it just a made up label or is there actually some way to decide whether or not I'm guilty of insurrection to keep me off the ballot?

So I really think at this point, this is just about creating as much of a record as you can to give an appeals court a reason to set it aside. And I think they'll talk some about the judge being unfair. I think they'll say, look, he didn't even let all our experts get everything in that we were talking about. He cut off some witnesses. We've had this ongoing battle about what's relevant. And, by the way, we think that his initial finding hobbled us to be able to put on a true defense in a case like this.

You want to be able to communicate with them if things go sideways for your airline in particular. And finally, have a backup plan. Have a plan B. Know what other airlines fly the route that you're going to fly so you could potentially get rebooked. If you're driving, check road conditions, check airport conditions.

We're still roughly at about three, three and a half months supply, which when you compare with the normal market of about six months or still a ways off.However, there are some silver linings. Number one, we've seen active listings. And when you look at portals like Realtor.com, you see the number of homes available for sale, take up and stay there longer. In addition, and that's really encouraging to me. Home builders who have struggled themselves with acquisition costs, higher labor costs, materials costs have -- and you saw that in the builder -- optimism declining -- have actually seen the light at the end of the tunnel. We've seen more new construction, both single family and multifamily going into 2024.

Michigan's been able to rely on their run game really consistently throughout the year. It's been great with Blake Corum, Donovan Edwards, a really good running back duo there. But Alabama's defense only allows 125 rush yards on the ground per game. So, I don't really think Michigan's going to be able to run the ball like they have all season.I really think this is going to go into quarterback J.J. McCarthy's hands, something that he really hasn't had to do all season. But I think a big thing for him is going to be keeping that passing game alive while on the run, looking downfield for open opportunities, that's going to be tough with Alabama's pass rush. They get after it. So, that's going to be a big thing to keep in mind. But it's going to be tough for him. Alabama's cornerbacks in \"Kool Aid\" McKinstry, Terry and Arnold, two of the best lockdown corners in college football. So, it's going to be a big challenge.

I think this is going to be a lot of fun. If you haven't seen Washington play all season, this is a great chance to do so on a national stage.Their offense is led by quarterback Michael Penix Jr., obviously a Heisman finalist, but it's really the skill players around him that make this unit so great. Dillon Johnson, the 1,000 yard rusher. The receivers -- I mean, where do you even start? Rome Odunze, over 1,000 yards receiving. Jalen McMillan and Ja'Lynn Polk, and their offensive line has done really well, too. Texas pass rush, they do get after it, 32 sacks on the season, but Washington's offensive line, they have only given up 11 sacks this entire year. I do think if this game, kind of, gets into a shootout style game where both offenses are going back and forth, that's going to favor Washington because they have had to play more games like that throughout the season. Think about that Oregon game earlier in this -- earlier in the year against Oregon State, Washington State later in the year. But it's going to be a really fun matchup.

Coming into the season, he lost both of his offensive and defensive coordinator. They really had a ton of turnover, personnel-wise, and he's been able to get this team to this stage.Also, credit to Jalen Milroe, Alabama's quarterback, who's really gotten better throughout the season has gone on. If you remember, he was benched in week three of this season, and he's now been playing lights out. I think this will be probably the best defense that Washington will have faced if it is Alabama. I like Nick Saban in these big games. So, if it's Alabama and Washington, I got to go Alabama, but I love what Washington has done. Credits to Kalen DeBoer.
