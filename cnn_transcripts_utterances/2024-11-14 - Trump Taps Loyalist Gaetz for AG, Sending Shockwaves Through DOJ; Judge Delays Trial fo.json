His pick for attorney general is raising perhaps the most eyebrows. Florida Republican Matt Gaetz could soon be in charge of the Justice Department, an agency that he's long been critical of, as well as the target of.But choosing a Cabinet member is one thing, confirmation, of course, is another. And some of Trump's selections could set the stage for some Senate confirmation fights, even with Republicans in control. CNN's Kristen Holmes is live for us now in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, how is Trump's team responding to this blowback? Not exactly arms wide open from his own party.",

These are things that they're trying to get out as quickly as possible. I do think we're going to have some new names as early as tonight. But when it comes to that blowback, one, I was told that they expected it. They were not a hundred percent sure that everyone was going to come out in any way and support Matt Gaetz or Tulsi Gabbard, for that matter. That instead, they believed that this was Donald Trump's mandate to deliver on some of the promises that he said that he was going to deliver on, like completely dismantling the Department of Justice. And Donald Trump thought that Matt Gaetz was the right person to do it.Now, I have spoken to a number of his advisors who say that they're clear-eyed on the prospect that Matt Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard might not be confirmed, that they understand that, that they're going to do everything they can to get them confirmed, but that they also understand that this process, this is just the beginning of the nomination process. And nobody is kind of in disillusionment that there was going to be some pushback or blowback to these particular candidates. And just to give one example, someone told me that they were very much waiting for the meltdown, and then they saw it and watched it unfold. So this idea that Donald Trump's team wasn't expecting it, they knew exactly what they were doing when they made this decision. And the other thing to point out here, you know, there's a lot of speculation as to Donald Trump going rogue, did he make these decisions outside of his normal transition process. Well, he certainly did in terms of Matt Gaetz himself was not on any shortlist. He hadn't been part of the parade of lawyers that we were told were brought in to sit for an interview with Donald Trump. But when it comes to his team around him, he was with some of his top advisors on the plane yesterday when all of this unfolded. And that includes his chief of staff, Susie Wiles. They were in these conversations, they walked through what it would look like, what the reaction would be, and then they still decided to announce it as he was landing back in Florida. So that's just something to keep in mind with all this speculation that Donald Trump wasn't prepared or the team wasn't aware of how controversial Gaetz was. Clearly, they were at this point aware of it and have been kind of relishing in it a little bit as they've watched the coverage unfold.",

And eventually the Department of Justice, after two years, decided, okay, we're going to throw in the towel. Why? They didn't really have any hard evidence. And the evidence they had by way of witness testimony against him came from compromised witnesses. One of them was former tax collector in elected position in Central Florida, who, sorry, I set my alarm, I apologize for that, who was an old friend of Matt Gaetz, had been incarcerated and had been a one-man crime wave and was totally unreliable. Among the things that he went to prison for was falsely smearing a rival as a pedophile. And now he's saying, oh, well, Matt Gaetz is the pedophile. Well, it was that guy.The other person was the alleged victim who apparently gave contradictory statements, both to federal investigators, according to sources of ours, as well as in a civil-related matter that had recently unfolded. Those two things stacked together just led the Justice Department to say, well, we have no real hard evidence and the evidence by way of the witnesses isn't very credible, so they threw in the towel.

He likes the way Matt Gaetz defends and advances him, not only on television, but in rallies.And if you look at Matt Gaetz in congressional hearings, he's built a reputation of being one of the members of Congress who's best at questioning witnesses, boxing them in and being able to use his time on the stand, so to speak or up on the dais. Now, he's never really been on the other side of this in a confirmation process, but he was a debate club champ. He does have a quick acid tongue. That's part of the reason some people don't really like him. And whether he makes it through the confirmation process or not, everyone in Trump's team believes that this is at least going to make pretty spectacular television.

And now we're starting to see the real world impact of that promise. A federal judge is delaying the trial of a Capitol riot defendant from Kansas that was set to start next month, citing the quote, real possibility the incoming president will pardon him. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is tracking this story for us.Katelyn, what else did the judge say about this decision? Yes, so this is just a judge that had a hearing today on one of the hundreds of January 6th riot cases in D.C.'s federal court. It was Judge Rudolph Contreras, who's very well-respected. And he said, you know, there is a real possibility that Donald Trump could pardon these rioters and that there needs to be a conservation of resources to put off a valid reason to not have this trial in December that was set for William Pope. Now, Pope is notable, not for what he did on January 6th, he's charged with some misdemeanor offenses related to it, but how he asked for this. He doesn't have a lawyer. He was writing to the court on his own. It's called pro se in court. And then the way he articulated his need to push the trial back was he said to the judge, essentially there's a mandate for Donald Trump. He's promising to pardon people like me and I've tried to convince the government to do this, the prosecutors, but they seem foolishly intent on vindictiveness in this final hour, want to take me to trial. This is a final opportunity to make peace and to take two weeks off in December. So that was his pitch to Judge Contreras. Judge Contreras said, though, there is reason to postpone this trial. We saw Devan Cole, the reporter I was working with on this, who was in court today for that hearing, also noticed another judge in D.C.'s federal court postponing another trial, but not everybody that is trying this to move their court proceedings back, waiting to see if they're going to be pardoned, is being successful. There was another judge as well today who just said he wasn't going to delay a sentencing of a January 6th rioter that is upcoming before the Trump inauguration in January because it's irrelevant to the court's independence and the legal obligations of judges who are seeing these cases through. It's just not something that they need to do as far as sentencings and other proceedings go. Those are going forward, but the trials now do appear to potentially be put on hold.",
