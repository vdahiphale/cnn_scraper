Certainly, the special counsel is arguing that Donald Trump should be put under new restrictions as part of his release for these charges that he's cases here in the Southern District of Florida. They say that he should have a gag order and that it should be put into the terms of his probation release -- or from the probation office.And that's what the former president is pushing back on. They say that this is an attack on his First Amendment rights. And of course, bringing up the fact that he is not only -- not only campaigning, but going on a debate stage later this week. The former president is beating on the CNN debate against Joe Biden. The special counsel cited a number of things in their arguments, though. They pointed out that shortly after the Mar-a-Lago search, back in 2022, an armed man attacked an FBI field office in Cincinnati. And then they said more recently, another Trump supporter, they said, made threats against the FBI. Threatening to slaughter their families. Hunting them down. And they said that while the former president acknowledges the impact of his words on his supporters, he takes always no responsibility for the impact of that rhetoric, which of course, you know, Jim, he has been doing a lot of lately.",

And so that one, after the -- after the gag order finally -- hearing this afternoon, we expect that she's going to take a few days before we actually hear from her.

Thursday's showdown will be the earliest presidential debate in modern history, maybe in all of U.S. history, and the stakes are undeniably high. Much of the national polling shows they are locked in a race that is too close to call. So how are the campaigns spending these final days before the debate? Join me now are CNN's Alayna Treene and Kevin Liptak. And, Kevin, you have some new reporting on how the president is preparing for Trump. He's preparing for all versions of Trump.",

Is it the pugilistic, interrupting, yelling Donald Trump or is it a more restrained, more presidential version of the candidate that you're going to get? And what we've been hearing from Biden's advisors is that they're preparing for both.You know, President Biden's up at Camp David. He's going to eventually do these mock debates. And they basically want to be ready for whatever Trump shows up at the debate stage. So, today is day four. President Biden has been up there for a while already. We don't actually expect to see him before he shows up in Atlanta on Thursday. You know, I don't think it's any secret why the Biden campaign is preparing so intensively for this debate. They think the stakes are very high. But they're also aware that they can't afford an underwhelming performance. They know that any kind of, you know, mental slip, verbal slip is only going to be amplified underneath those lights on the debate stage. And that is why I think they've -- they're putting so much work into this preparation. And we did get sort of an insight in this memo that we got over the weekend into the three points that President Biden is going to want to emphasize. One is abortion. And this has been the most galvanizing issue for Democrats throughout this election. And they do really want to lay the overturning of Roe v. Wade right at Donald Trump's feet. You know, there's the issue of democracy and protecting democracy. That's obviously been the underpinning of the entire Biden campaign so far. So certainly, Biden's going to hammer away at that. And then the third is the economy, which in a way is the most risky one for President Biden. He is vulnerable on this issue, despite the economy doing pretty well. A lot of Americans say that they just aren't feeling it. And his strategy is going to be to try and make the point that Trump's economic plans would only benefit the rich. So, you can bet that out there at Camp David, President Biden is hammering away trying to sharpen his points, specifically on these three issues. But certainly, in anticipation of what he's going to face on the debate stage.",

One, that they think -- you know, trying to take it out on CNN and refs and saying mainstream media is setting the expectations too low. But also, we know that for months now, Donald Trump and his team have argued that Joe Biden is essentially senile.They're acting like -- or they've said that he struggles with mental and physical acuity. They've tried to point out that maybe he can't even stand on stage for 90 minutes. Now, they were trying to change the narrative. They're trying to argue that Joe Biden is a worthy debater, exact words Donald Trump used in a podcast interview last week. We're seeing others say that he's potentially taking performance-enhancing drugs. Things that have -- are you know baseless accusations. All of these things are I think, setting in because there is a little bit more panic, I think going on in Trump world about Joe Biden having a week-long boot camp to prepare for this.

And I think of the State of the Union.But he's also had milder, quieter performances on an everyday basis at some of his you know, policy stops. So, there are two Joe Biden's that we have seen over the course of you know, the last several months. They are very much hoping that this is the State of the Union Joe Biden, who is you know, energetic. But certainly, there's no evidence and I don't think the White House is going to dignify the allegations that he's going to be dragged up on the debate stage with a response.",

The Dali passed by the wrecked bridge as it heads to Norfolk, Virginia for repairs. The Coast Guard says there's now a 500-yard safety zone in place around the ship. The Dali had been struck for two months -- or had been stuck I should say, for two months while workers removed the tangled frame of the bridge and refloated the ship's bow. Six construction workers were killed when the bridge came down. Investigators are still looking into the cause of that crash.
