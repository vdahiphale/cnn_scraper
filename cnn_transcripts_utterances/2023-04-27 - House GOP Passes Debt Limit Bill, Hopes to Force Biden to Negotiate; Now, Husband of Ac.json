On Wednesday, House Republicans passed a bill that would raise the nation's $31.4 trillion debt limit by an additional $1.5 trillion. But to do that, Republicans wanted spending cuts. Because in this bill to passed include repealing green energy tax credits, ending student loan forgiveness and killing new funding for the IRS.The non-partisan congressional budget office says that the bill would trim government deficits by $4.8 trillion over ten years. The final vote in the House was 217 to 215, with four Republicans voting against the bill, which you add it all together, that's just the right number for Republicans to still pull it off and pass it. Despite that success, we are no closer to resolving this crisis. This bill has no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate and President Biden has repeatedly said that he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling. Speaker McCarthy, he's challenging the president to change that position. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (D-CA):  So, what's changed, Mr. President? You've gone so far as you won't even negotiate to put America in debt? That's not how the leader of the free world should act. That's not how American wants you to act. You said at the very beginning we had to show you a plan, even though the Democrat had shown no plan. Not only that we show you a plan, we're the only one to pass a plan. So, I think it's up to you now, whether the economy goes in any travel, it's you, because the Republican raised the debt limit, you have not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, a quid pro quo? SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK):  Well, I think we've seen that the House has advanced a proposal. It passed. I think the president needs to take a look at that. Keep in mind it has not even been 24 hours since this measure has moved through. So, let's not declare this dead. What has to happen are conversations, discussions between the speaker and the president, and real discussions, not discussions that are held through the media right now.

ANGUS KING (I-ME):  Well, there should be discussion, but they should be in context of the budget negotiations, that's what really this all about. The debt ceiling should not be used as a leverage and threaten the, really, a catastrophic problem for our entire economy. The debt ceiling was raised three times during the Trump administration without a great deal of excitement and we ought to do it again. This isn't about -- somebody, one of the leaders in the House yesterday said, we're not going to give Joe Biden a blank check. That's a misstatement of what this is all about. This is not about future spending. This is about whether we pay bills we've already incurred. At the end of the month, you don't balance your checkbook by tearing up your credit card bill, you pay it. And not do that would just, as I say, be catastrophic. So, yes, we need discussions but that's what budget negotiations are all about and let's have those discussions, but not in the context of threatening a financial catastrophe on this country and indeed a lot of the world. BERMAN:  Senator Murkowski, just very quickly, I saw you nodding when Senator King said there shouldn't be an argument about giving President Biden a blank check. What were you nodding about?",

They need to be at the highest level and they need to be sooner than later. This X date, whatever that date may be, it's our reality.

It would call on the Supreme Court to name an individual to handle complaints for code violations and it would give the Supreme Court authority to initiate investigations if a justice violated that code.You say, Senator King, you want to help the Supreme Court help itself, but didn't the court just tell us it doesn't want to help itself? Did Justice Roberts, the chief justice, just sent a letter that all nine judges there signed saying, we've got this, we don't need to change anything?",

And that's why, in my view, it's relatively benign in terms of how the Legislative Branch reaches into the Judicial Branch to tell them what to do. We're not doing that.What we are trying to do here, though, is to help rebuild I think some of the credibility gap, the integrity gap that we're starting to see right now. When our institutions are not viewed as fair, as transparent, even if you are the nine black robed justices sitting on the highest court of the land, people want to know that there are protocols, that there are rules, that there are standards and that there is a level of transparency there so that they can basically count on that. So, again, this is not radical legislation. This allows the court to determine what their code of conduct will be. It will be available for all to see. But why push back on this and say, no, no, no, what we have in place is good enough now? I think if you ask the American public if they think that some of what they have seen of late is okay, they would say, no. And they would further go to the point that they thought that the Supreme Court also had a judicial conduct of code, as does every other level of the judiciary in this country, as does the executive branch, as does the legislative branch. So, I think what we're doing is just bringing the Supreme Court to where most Americans expected they were with the judicial code of conduct.",

But at this point, it's unclear what the status of the case is. We know our colleague, Evan Perez, reported last summer that prosecutors had whittled down potential charges to a few tax crimes and a charge of false statements related to the purchase of a gun where Biden allegedly did not disclose his issues with addiction. But since then, this is the first public event, the first public occurrence related to this investigation since then. And right now, he obviously has not been charged and it's unclear if he will.

There is a trend across the country right now, Republican state lawmakers pushing to restrict the medical care that transgender youth are allowed to receive. The Human Rights Campaign says by its latest count, there are more than 110 state bills that are currently in the works, barring transgender people from accessing gender-affirming care.Here is some of what is happening across the country. In Tennessee, for example, the Justice Department is challenging a state bill to prohibit gender-affirming care for minors. In a complaint file just yesterday by the Justice Department, DOJ says that the legislation denies necessary medical care to youth based solely on who they are. And the DOJ says that it is a direct violation of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause and they want the court to block the law from taking effect on July 1st. In neighboring Missouri, a state judge has temporarily blocked the state's limits on gender-affirming care for minors and adults, but that is temporary move. The judge says that she wants more time to review briefs and announced that a decision could be made by next Monday. As medical care for transgender youth divides state legislatures more and more, we're seeing former Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade, who is also a father to a transgender, he has weighed in. Listen.
