And Biden today is leaving the White House and Washington behind for a multiday fund-raising swing out West, hoping for more money ahead. Let's get over to the White House. CNN's Arlette Saenz is there. Arlette, the campaign co-chair was just on with us, and he says that one way you always measure enthusiasm is through contributions. We know they say that and hope that, but what does that all mean for this campaign right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the campaign is really hoping that they can continue this fund-raising momentum heading into November, as they have really seen some sizable hauls coming into their campaign war chest.It all comes as the campaign is bracing for quite an expensive campaign, which -- against who they expect to be the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump. But those numbers that you ran through, $42 million in January alone, along with $130 million cash on hand, gives Democrats a bit of advantage at this moment in time. So far, they have outpaced the former president, as well as other Republican rivals in the GOP primary, when it comes to fund-raising. But what this fund-raising number also speaks to is the fact that these donors within the Democratic Party, those high-dollar and small grassroots donors, still are standing firmly behind the president, even as there are anxieties about his reelection bid. Today, the president is set to depart for -- in just a few hours for California, where he will embark on a three-day fund-raising swing, taking him through Los Angeles, also Silicon Valley, as well as San Francisco at an event with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The campaign is expecting this could be quite a lucrative haul for them over these next three days, one source telling me they could raise as much as $10 million in this three-day span. That speaks to some of the success that they're having among high-dollar donors. But the campaign has also been pushing and trying to boost their support among those grassroots small-dollar donors. They note that January was their most successful month to date when it comes to those small-dollar donations. And just to run you through a few of those numbers, they had 422,000 unique donors over the course of January; 97 percent of the campaign's donations since their launch have been under $200. And they have also found that 158,000 donors have committed to giving money to this campaign each month. That gives them a bit of hope when they're looking at those small- dollar donations heading into November's election. The campaign is really using this as a measure of the enthusiasm they feel they're receiving from voters. One campaign spokesperson said -- quote -- \"This haul will go directly to reaching the voters who will decide this election. That's reason number 355 million that we are confident President Biden and Vice President Harris will win this November.\" That 355 million reference is a jab at former President Trump, who will have to pay that amount in the wake of that New York civil fraud case. But what Biden campaign donors and campaign officials have consistently pointed to is that they also believe that Trump is a fund-raising advantage for them. They can point to him in their small grassroots pushes online, as well as in courting those high-dollar donors, as they are bracing for what could be a very expensive race. Some people think it could come -- go up to about $2 billion in the end.",

They are literally buying what Joe Biden, what President Biden, is selling, because that's why they give. They're giving because they support this man, because they want him to get reelected, because they see him as the one who is going to continue to boost the economy for their families, for a brighter future for their children, and the one who's going to protect our rights and freedoms, and the one who's going to protect our democracy and our Constitution and the United States of America. So, to me, this news today, Sara, speaks volumes and speaks much louder than all of the polls that we have been seeing, than all of the anonymous chatter and quotes from other Democrats who are so worried about Joe Biden's age. And all of that will absolutely have a place in the discussion of this campaign. That's not going to go away. But I think what we should focus on right now is the fact that Democrats, and, frankly, I think more than Democrats, Republicans and independents who understand what an existential threat Donald Trump will be to this country if he is allowed anywhere near the Oval Office again, these are the people who are literally giving their money. They are buying what Joe Biden is selling, because they want this country to be a better place, and they see Joe Biden as the one to do that.",

He's not going to let anybody pressure him into doing or saying anything that he is not ready to do.I think what we should focus on is what he has said about Donald Trump, both publicly, as well as privately. He believes that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, is a threat to this country. So I am pretty confident that, even though right now today Senator Manchin is not ready to endorse a Joe Biden presidency, I believe that, as we get closer to the general election, when everyone understands the contrast that this is going to be, that this general election is going to be, again, between a man who will continue to boost our economy and focus on the future, a better future for Americans, and someone who is a fraudster, a sex offender and who is only in it for themselves, I believe Joe Manchin, as well as millions of other Americans, will endorse Joe Biden, either through words, through their money or through their vote at the ballot box.",

So I used to think everybody was going to get in line. I just -- I don't know. She doesn't sound like somebody who wants to do that. And, today, I'm reading that she's apparently going to say she's going to stay in the race well beyond South Carolina and Super Tuesday, even if Donald Trump amasses the delegates necessary to be the presumptive nominee.
