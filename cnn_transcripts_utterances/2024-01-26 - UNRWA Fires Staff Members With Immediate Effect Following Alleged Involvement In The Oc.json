In a moment, reaction to a ruling by the International Court of Justice in the genocide case brought by South Africa against Israel. But first, a shocking scandal involving the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. The UNRWA is firing staff members with immediate effect following alleged involvement in the October 7th terror attacks in Israel. The agency says information was provided to it by Israeli authorities and that the decision to remove staff immediately was to protect the agency's ability to deliver aid to civilians in Gaza. UNRWA says that it has launched an investigation into the matter. CNN has asked the Israeli authorities and UNRWA for information on the nature of that alleged involvement in the October 7th attacks. Also, The Hague just hours ago -- the U.N.'s top Court ordering Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts as it wages war against Hamas in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the Court in hopes of ending the conflict. However, the ICJ stopped short of ordering a ceasefire, though telling Israel to report back within a month to show how it is complying with the Court's order. Israel's Prime Minister reiterated that Israel has a right to defend itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

UNRWA responded to this post and said, quote, \"making serious allegations in the public domain unsupported by any evidence or verifiable facts and support thereof may amount to misinformation\".

What they are also saying is they are calling these shocking allegations, that's according to Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, and he's also making clear that anyone involved, quote,\" will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution\". Though he is also making the distinction here by saying that the reason why they fired them is in particular to, quote, \"protect the agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance\". And I think ultimately, for UNRWA, while they say they are certainly shocked by these allegations and they are clearly taking action here, they don't want the focus to be on this. They want the focus to be back on the plight of millions of people in Gaza. And that's why, as part of this statement, Philippe Lazzarini turned back the focus to what is happening in Gaza, saying that these allegations come as two million people depend on life-saving assistance provided by UNRWA. So, clearly that agency concerns that these allegations could potentially result in a loss in funding. At least for now it has resulted in the U.S. temporarily suspending additional funding, which seems like more of a kind of accountability measure to ensure that the U.N. is going to follow up on this rather than stopping funding altogether. But clearly concerning allegations from one of the key U.N. agencies that is involved in trying to stem what is certainly a humanitarian crisis in Gaza at the moment.",

The South Africans are now saying that they will want to discuss this at the U.N. Security Council or that the permanent members and others should do that. And they've called on the Israeli government not to slow down or, their word is, frustrate the application of this interim order. It's a binding order, but of course it's not enforceable, Bianna.

Hamas, for its part, says that it will further Israel's isolation on the world stage. But of course, in Gaza, people were desperately hoping that it would include an order for a ceasefire. That isn't going to happen. Some people did point out that the ICJ did basically say that Israel should take all measures within its power to prevent the killing of members of, in its rather awkward wording, the group. They're talking about the Palestinians, keeping in mind, of course, that as of today, the death toll in Gaza in 112 days of war has now exceeded 26,000. The ICJ also told Israel to do what it can to prevent the deliberate infliction of bodily and mental harm. Of course, more than 60,000 people have been wounded. And in terms of mental harm, the trauma certainly of the children in Gaza is beyond measure at this point. But while all of this goes on, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate hour by hour, minute by minute. And I have to warn our viewers that the report they're about to see, they may find some of the images disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over):  Once again, the wounded are sprawled on the floor of Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Victims of what a civil defense official says was Israeli tank and machine gun fire on a crowd of people waiting to receive desperately needed humanitarian aid. People were going to get food and flour because they have nothing to eat, he says. Then suddenly, tanks appeared and started firing shells at people. Hamandarif was injured in the hand and leg. They shelled us four times, he says. Wednesday, at the same spot, the Kuwait Circle in Gaza City's southern outskirts, there were scenes of panic when, according to eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire during the distribution of aid. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment, but has not yet received a response. To the south, thousands are streaming out of Khan Younis, where intense fighting has been raging for days, leaving, however they can, traumatized by what they've seen and what they've lost. This is the third time we've moved, she says. All they have left in the world piled onto a shopping cart. This is as far as you can get safely from Khan Younis. Between a sea of tents and the sea, some supplies are available. Close to 90 percent of the people of Gaza are now displaced, many now living like this. Winter rains have turned parts of this makeshift camp into a muddy pond. I'm looking for our things, he says. What they have found is anger at the men who pose as their leaders. Look, Ismail Haniyeh, let him see us, shouts this man, referring to Hamas' political leader living in Qatar. The war has raged now for more than 110 days. For three and a half months we've been on the run, says Iyad Abu Musaid. Let us go back to our homes. We're sick of this life. Death would be better. According to the forecast, another winter storm is coming. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on-camera):  And that storm has actually reached us. That's winter storm Daniella. It's also headed for Gaza, as well. And if you thought the conditions in that report were bad, they're just going to get worse in the coming days. Bianna.",

Of course, the Court has stopped short of ordering a ceasefire, which some people had hoped as sort of the only like reliable remedy to improving the situation. But in some sense, there are not a lot of surprises here. It is a finding that looking at Israel's actions in Gaza, a charge that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention is not implausible.

And unfortunately, the provisional measures thatreally concern how Israel conducts hostilities in Gaza are vague enough to potentially be possible because basically they say that Israel must ensure that in the conduct of hostilities it doesn't violate the Genocide Convention. But it has always claimed that it doesn't, and the threshold for violating the Genocide Convention is quite high. The provisional measures that concern humanitarian assistance are a little bit more concrete. Here, the Court really very stringently said Israel must provide assistance and it must report back in a month about that. The Court also amplified today the statements of humanitarian actors like the WHO and UNRWA, which describe really in graphic detail the catastrophe in Gaza. So, the Court seems to be very serious about that and it's a concrete measure. And to comply with this measure, Israel arguably has to change course. So, I think there is some hope there that particularly actors in Israel that think that are misaligned with the government's stance on the siege, that these actors now have a fresh argument to lobby internally in Israel for a lifting of the siege.",

In some sense, it's a rebuke, and it is also a rebuke to the governments of the world that support Israel in its actions in Gaza, because assisting in an internationally wrongful act like genocide is itself internationally wrongful.

A reminder of our top story this hour, the UNRWA is firing staff members with immediateeffect for alleged involvement in the October 7th terror attacks in Israel. The agency says information was provided to it by the Israeli authorities and that the decision to remove staff immediately was to protect the agency's ability to deliver aid to civilians in Gaza. CNN has asked the Israeli authorities and UNRWA for information on the nature of those alleged involvement in the October 7th attacks. The October -- the State Department says that it has also temporarily paused additional funding to the agency following these allegations. And we'll continue to follow this story. Meantime, across the U.S., it has been shaping up to be an active weather day. That seems to be the case so many days now. Residents along the Gulf Coast are facing possible severe weather with the threat of flooding. And on the West Coast, a strong atmospheric river event is expected to bring heavy rain over the next week. In New England, where they are already dealing with the effects from two rare back-to-back storms, icy conditions are expected today. Take a look at these iconic fishing shacks, which stood for over a century and were part of countless poster card shots. Well, the sea has claimed them amid the extreme weather. Communities along that stretch of the East Coast are now part of a new climate reality. CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir joins us from Portland, Maine. And Bill, we've been talking about these unprecedented, never seen before, never experienced before types of storms now and weather experiences with you for a few years. But the question of how it impacts residents, and how they change their lifestyle, really, is top of mind right now and it's something that you've been working with. Typically after a storm people just rebuild. How are people that you've talked to handling this new reality?",
