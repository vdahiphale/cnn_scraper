The NYPD is requiring all officers to be in uniform starting today. CNN's Brynn Gingras is in New York. Hi, Brynn. How else is the city preparing? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera)You can see the barricades that are up all around this courthouse and even across the street, and the police officers as you just mentioned in full uniform and a very large presence. Obviously, this is not typically normally what we would see outside of this particular courthouse. 35,000 police officers, doesn't matter the rank or the position, everyone from the NYPD told to be in uniform today. That is a presence of police just in case anything should happen. Inside that courthouse, Amara, I'm also told on the floor where this arraignment is likely to happen, it's pretty much shut down to particular people. There are security there making sure anyone who shouldn't be on that floor is not. So, that is already beginning today. Of course, a lot of this preparation behind-the-scenes, intelligence officials looking into the chatter, online discussions on message boards and social media about a possible mobilization of protests or demonstrations. That's all being analyzed at this point with police ready to respond in case something should come up today, going in all the way until Tuesday and after. And my colleague John Miller also reporting that there are discussions, of course, between all the parties, Secret Service, the court officials, the NYPD about how this arraignment will happen, what does it look like as far as the motorcade for the former president coming to this building being booked, and then actually going through the court proceedings. He's also told a dry run is expected today. So, listen, no credible threats from what we're hearing so far. But, of course, this is a huge Police Department huge law enforcement presence here ready to react should anything pop up, Amara.",

      "sentences": "Well, you just miss -- mentioned John Miller, so we'll get him right after you. Brynn Gingras, thank you very much.And joining us now is CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller. John, good to see you. Yes, tell us more about what you're learning in terms of this coordination. Obviously, a lot is going to go into this. Your reporting of a dry run happening today. What more can you tell us about the behind-the-scenes events that are going on? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, as Brynn was talking about, you know, it's not your average surrender of a white-collar criminal defendant. You know, you've got somebody under Secret Service protection, who's a former president of the United States who has to be moved in his secure motorcade from wherever he starts out to the courthouse. He has to come into the district attorney's office and be booked. And then he has to be brought to a courtroom after his fingerprints and mug shots are taken for an arraignment. And there's a couple of ways to do that. In that massive building that you see on the screen next to me, there are public hallways, there are back hallways that prisoners are moved through. So, the purpose of the walkthrough today is to let the court officers who actually control that building and security in that building, work with Secret Service and NYPD to say, we'll bring him in this way, he'll go here, then we'll transport him either this back way or through the normal channels to this courtroom and then this is how we will get him out of the building. So, the walkthrough today is to make sure that everybody's on the same page, court officers, NYPD, and the Secret Service detail that protects Donald Trump still. That it's up to everybody's standards about how they want this done and how to keep it secure.",

Going here yet, Donald Trump calling for that. You do see some social media posting about it. But you don't see a groundswell of people saying that they're coming.So, so far, that hasn't materialized. And it still could. We have the whole weekend to go through on Monday and whatever messaging may come from the Trump camp in between. Number two. The anti-Trump protesters. And even if you have a small group of one and a small group of the other part of the choreography for a police department is keeping them separate so you don't have a clash outside that attracts you know, attention and disorder, even if it's not with a large group of people. And the last piece is you know, just following the information on various dark corners of social media where they've been seeing threats against the district attorney, threats against the courthouse, threats -- to assess those threats and determine, you know, which ones require further investigation, which ones you know, appear to be hot air.

CNN's Carlos Suarez is outside the church where that funeral will be held. Hi, there, Carlos. What more do we know about today's service?CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Amara, we know that that funeral service is scheduled to get underway at three o'clock local. And we're told that the church here behind me can accommodate over a thousand people. We're expecting family, friends, and loved ones to show up here to remember nine-year-old Evelyn Dieckhaus. An obituary that was released overnight of the child describes her faith as being pure and that her prayers were sincere. She was described as just being a beacon of joy to her family. Now, on Saturday, we're also going to see a funeral service for nine- year-old Hallie Scruggs. She was one of the three children that died in this shooting. We're also expected to possibly see some more of her family. We know that her father, the lead pastor of the school's church, he was heard in one of the 911 calls that was released yesterday. In that call, you can hear the father telling a 911 operator that he was going to go inside of the school after hearing that there have been a shooting. It does not appear that the father at any point during that call was aware of the fact that his daughter had been shot. On Saturday, we're also going to be seeing another funeral service. This one's going to be for 61-year-old Cynthia Peak. She was a beloved school teacher. And then the remaining funerals, Amara, we're told are going to take place on sun -- on Sunday, and then as well on Monday and then on Wednesday. Amara.",
