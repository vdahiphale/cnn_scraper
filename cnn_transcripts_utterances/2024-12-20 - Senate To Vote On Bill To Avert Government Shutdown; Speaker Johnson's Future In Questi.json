Just hours ago, the House held its own vote to fund the government and avoid a chaotic start to the holidays. It wasn't clear if the plan would actually get across that finish line, though, but it did with a final vote of 366 to 34. It caps a two-day wild scramble for House Speaker Mike Johnson. He was trying to get a solution after Donald Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed a bipartisan agreement on Wednesday. Democrats then voted down a plan yesterday that included Trump's demand to suspend the debt ceiling. Here is what is in this new bill. It will fund the government until March 14th. That means Trump will have to deal with this again in his first 100 days in office. It also provides billions in disaster relief and aid to farmers. But one critical thing that's missing, there's nothing in there about the debt ceiling. Now, you may remember that Trump was threatening to primary any Republican who voted to fund the government without addressing the debt limit. So how is his feeling and his party bypassed what he wanted tonight? Well, a source is telling CNN it seems he is resigned with the outcome. Even though he is not happy, the debt ceiling was not included. For Elon Musk, well, he is publicly speaking out. He says Speaker Johnson -- quote -- \"did a good job here,\" given the circumstances. He was one of the circumstances. Okay, that's fine. And as for Johnson, he says he was talking with both Trump and Musk in the run up to the vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, obviously, this has been a long day on Capitol Hill. When we started this morning, it wasn't clear that House Republicans were going to be able to unite behind a plan. It wasn't clear Mike Johnson was going to be able to put anything on the floor that could have the votes to pass.But a couple of hours ago, the House was able to do their job. Now, the Senate is beginning to work this process on the floor. But it does take a long time for senators to have a series of votes. We expect seven votes on the floor tonight. Typically, this first vote is an opportunity for lawmakers to get back to the Capitol. Some of them maybe had left the premises for a little while, while a time agreement was getting figured out. Now, they're getting back to the Senate floor. After this, we can expect that likely, because senators are anxious to get home for the holidays, because it's late, they may try to vote very quickly, perhaps 10-minute votes for the following ones but, obviously, Laura, this is a less than ideal situation because we are pressing right up against that deadline. There may become a period of time where funding technically lapses even though senators are on the verge of passing this spending bill that has been hard fought this week on Capitol Hill.",
