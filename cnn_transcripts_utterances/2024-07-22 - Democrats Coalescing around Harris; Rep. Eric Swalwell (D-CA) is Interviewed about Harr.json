That comes after months of internal - or, excuse me, after a month of internal disagreement over whether or not they wanted to stick with Biden. And so many Democrats that I've been talking to over the course of the last 48 hours are just ready for that internal disagreement to end. They are ready to unite. They are ready to get ready to continue working. And I just want to note that that's obviously in stark distinction from what you're hearing from Republicans who are preparing and readying their attacks against Harris, but also saying that the president is no longer fit to serve. That is what Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is arguing. You also have Nancy Mace, a Republican, saying that she will bring forward a resolution to start the 25th Amendment, saying that Harris should take over now. I would just note that we still have not heard from the top Democratic leaders in the House or Senate, Chuck Schumer or Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the House, but we are hearing from other leaders, including Pete Aguilar, Catherine Clark, the next two Democrats in leadership in the House of Representatives, and they are saying that they are going to do everything that they can to get behind Kamala Harris, to support her and make her the 47th president of the United States.

There are two key things that I actually want to hear today that come from the Secret Service. And it's really transparency and accountability. On the transparency side, we really need to understand, in the post-incident management of the shooting, you know, what happened. You know, what went wrong. What have they identified to date that they can share that won't impact any criminal investigation? And what are they doing to rectify that? And when it comes to accountability, I want to hear it again. I want it reinforce that the director of the Secret Service is taking full accountability for those security lapses and not shifting any type of blame on local resources, other government agencies that were involved into the security plan on that day.
