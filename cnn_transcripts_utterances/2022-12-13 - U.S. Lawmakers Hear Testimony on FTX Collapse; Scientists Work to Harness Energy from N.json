Now already in disgrace and under arrest, there are more dramatic developments for Sam Bankman-Fried the Founder of the bankrupt Crypto Currency Exchange FTX has been indicted on eight criminal charges including wire fraud and conspiracy. The Former Crypto Celebrity was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday and U.S. prosecutors have announced criminal charges. He also faces civil securities fraud charges. All right, right now a House Committee is holding a hearing on the collapse of FTX. The company's new CEO John J. Ray III is testifying. Ray took over for Bankman-Fried last month. I want you to take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN J.RAY, FTX CEO: The FTX group's collapse appears to stem from absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company entrusted with other people's money or assets.

He says these are quotes literally there was no record keeping whatsoever employees would communicate in terms of invoicing and expensing on Slack. He then goes on to say that QuickBooks was used. This is a nice tool for basic accounting for small businesses, not for a multibillion dollar company. And he says there was really just one person controlling this, you know, no board for multibillion dollar companies sorry. And he also said when he compares it to Enron and other bankruptcies, and restructurings that he's had to oversee. He said the difference with this one is he's dealing with essentially a paperless bankruptcy, very difficult to track and trace all the assets. And as you can see, the Q&amp;A here is ongoing. We're learning so much about it. We already had the written statements, of course.

Of course, the risk legally is that there could be an inconsistency with when what he said, and the evidence that may come out as these investigations go on as it goes to trial. So that is a major risk. And I think that might have sped up the whole process, frankly, with all of these regulators and authorities wanting to sort this out rather quickly because he hasn't stopped talking. It's probably not working in his favor. We're not hearing much from him now. We do wonder whether we'll see him at this, of course extradition hearing in Palmer's in the coming hour. It's just nonstop Eleni. It's been most classic story and actually the most interesting part, perhaps the fact that SBF let's not forget. Only around six weeks ago, was the poster boy of crypto currency. He was the legitimate face of crypto exchanges. FTX was a well-regarded one of the biggest exchanges in the world.

That, you know, when he was asked about the regulatory environment, I think a few weeks just before this implosion happened, he said and he was boasting 37 countries to regulate FTX and more than 90 regulatory bodies overseeing the company.

Anna Stewart we'll be catching up with you as the story evolves progresses over the next few days. Thank you so much. All right, moving on to markets now. Wall Street and European stock markets are roaring higher, and that's after U.S. inflation cooled considerably in November. U.S. consumer price growth slowed to 7.1 percent last month.

But we've officially entered into a bull market territory in early trading. UK, also a higher we've got the DAX in Germany sitting 1 percent in the green as well.

Now, nuclear fusion creates energy in an entirely different way. Unlike fission, which splits apart heavy elements like uranium, fusion fuses, lighter elements like hydrogen to get there releasing energy in the process. There's no harmful radiation, and the only byproduct is helium. To fuse hydrogen, it must be subjected to enormous heat and pressure to convert it into a state of matter called plasma. The engineering challenges to create and contain this plasma have been difficult to overcome and that's led to a running joke among sciences that fusion power is 30 years away, and always will be. But this feeds is creating a lot of excitement and enthusiasm. The bottom line, we are at least one step closer, Rene Marsh is following the story from Washington for us. I guess the question now becomes, are we going to see this scaled, changing our lives in our lifetime? Or are we still 30 years away because we've created it in a lab? How do we scale this?",

It's always 30 years away. But many people that I've spent time speaking to that is the prediction those 30 years from now, we could see this being used on a wide scale. But still as amazing as today is and we don't want to take away from how big of a deal this is? There is still such a long way to go so many other hurdles. To your point, how do we create even more power for the entire world? How do we harness that power and harvest that power? How do we then get that power to the electric grid, all of those things have not been developed yet? And then, of course, there's the regulatory aspect of this that would have to follow as well. So that all being said, you know, it could be decades before we're able to power our homes with this source of energy. But it is we should not mistake that we can't get there without what was announced today. And so for that reason, people are excited about the possibilities of this new form of clean energy, especially as we have been talking so much about the climate crisis and the need to pivot away from dirty fossil fuels. This is that. This is the opportunity to do that because as you so nicely lay out at the top, this source of energy is clean, and produces nothing more than helium. And as one researcher pointed out to me, we put that in children's balloons so that's not very, very harmful so a great day for science and mankind.",
