But they also have an added burden, a special burden to be mindful of civilian infrastructure, particularly hospitals and residential complexes like that where we don't want to see them become scenes of battle. So, nobody wants to see fighting in a hospital. So it does add an extra burden on the Israelis to be more careful, more deliberate.

So Israel would have early intelligence would be able to see if something like that is being launched once again above ground and be able to have enough time to scramble its forces and prevent that from happening.

There's confusion about this entire incident. All indications to me and of course, I'm applying a little bias to this, but indications are that the Russians have used this plane for other purposes. And in fact, it was tracked the 24 hours before going into Iran, picking up some type of equipment passing over Egypt, in the Red Sea, and even into Syria before it came into the Belgorod airspace. In addition to that, I am unfamiliar, I don't think Russia has any -- has done any prisoner exchange using aircraft. They like to put the Ukrainians on a bus, ship them from wherever they are, make it as uncomfortable as possible as they're sending them back to Ukraine. So actually taking a transport plane and not filling it completely out. By the way, there were 63 allegedly prisoners or 65, I guess, and seven crew members on this aircraft will hold over 200 passengers, 270 I think is the load and having been on an aisle 76 they're not going to waste that kind of aircraft on just that limited number of personnel.

Both men are united in their very tough criticism of Israel but while Turkey has aimed to prevent conflict from spreading across the Middle East, Iran's proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen have used the war in Gaza as a chance to strike at Israeli and American targets in the area, even commercial shipping lanes.

But the prosecution on the other hand, of course, argued differently. They've been seeking the death penalty since the beginning of this trial in September of last year.

Now, the judge, as we saw this morning, has sided with the prosecution and has sentenced Aoba to death. In its reasoning, the judge said, and I quote, \"The loss of 36 people is too serious and tragic. In an instant, they were engulfed in flames and smoke. And before they had time to escape, they fell on top of each other or had difficulty breathing due to intense heat.
