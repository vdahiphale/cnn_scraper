He has a long relationship with former President Donald Trump, and also a lot of experience with these so-called catch and kill deals. Now, an agent for Daniels, about a month before the 2016 election, reached out to AMI, where David Pecker was the chairman, and then David Pecker reached out to Michael Cohen, because Daniels wanted to go public with her story. Now, two weeks have passed in this period and Michael Cohen had not finalized the deal. David Pecker reached out to him, according to court documents, and urged him to finalize the deal, saying, quote, or it could look awfully bad for everyone. So, David Pecker certainly at the center of this deal and this arrangement. And, you know, as we've seen, they've brought in many witnesses to provide testimony. Last week was the last time the grand jury heard testimony. That was with Bob Costello, a Trump witness. So, this is the DA's office putting on, you know, a strong witness here to send another message, who can really talk about how this deal started, the relationship with Trump, the timing issues here, in the urgency to get this deal done. Now, Pecker has immunity both when he testified as part of the federal investigation that led to the criminal charges against Michael Cohen, and also testimony for -- he also has immunity for his testimony in this case. He was before the grand jury for about an hour yesterday. And that grand jury is scheduled again to meet tomorrow. Jim.",

It's called election interference. What they're doing is, if they can't win at the ballot box because I'm leading everybody by a lot in the polls for every Republican, frankly, and every Democrat by a lot, including Biden by a lot, and they can't beat you that way, they're going to do this kind of stuff.

It helps him justify a loss. I think Donald Trump has a suburbs problem, right? He's going to have his 30 percent, 35 percent based in the rural areas of the country that come out and vote for him, but he still has to convince the suburbs. And, you know, us here in Georgia, we saw how that played out. Brian Kemp convinced the suburbs to vote for him. Herschel Walker didn't convince the suburbs to vote for him and he lost.

A similar percentage don't really want Donald Trump to run. So, I do think there is a lane out there. History shows us that things should start solidifying by now, but this is going to be like no other election cycle. I think somebody like a Ron DeSantis, a Nikki Haley, or others could -- could really start to rise up and put forward looking policies on the -- on the table, right?

That happens at the end of April, and it runs to the end of July.We're also hearing from his right-wing ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was saying that Netanyahu promised him that if the reforms don't go through with negotiations, they will be pushed forward as they currently stand, which would give the Israeli parliament, and therefore the politicians in power, unprecedented control over the supreme court. Now, the opposition has welcomed this temporary pause because they have been calling now for months for a halt to the legislation, that they could have actual negotiations over this. And there are reports that negotiating teams are being formed amongst the coalition, as well as the opposition teams, to meet at the Israeli President Isaac Herzog's residents where he will act as mediator. But of course, if they plan to bring this forward in the next parliamentary session, that's only a few weeks from now. There's Passover in between. And that's not a lot of time to get these negotiations done. And then, will people accept those compromise reforms? And then also the question is the protesters. The protesters who have been taking to the streets, who still have a lot of energy, and a lot of organizational power behind them, they vowed to continue. There's more protests planned for today. More protests planned for later this week. They essentially do not believe Benjamin Netanyahu when he says that there will be a break, when he says that he wants to heal the divisiveness, that he wants to prevent a civil war. They say that they will continue their protests, continue taking to the streets until these reforms are completely taken off the table. Another thing to keep in mind here, Jim, is that last night was the first time we saw the protesters who support the reforms who support Benjamin Netanyahu, take to the streets.

But not the version that Netanyahu had proposed, which would have essentially rendered the supreme court neutralized and given all the power to one branch of government.So, there is a compromise version, but not one that will satisfy both the far right of the Netanyahu coalition and perhaps deal with his own legal problems, and the concerns that the protesters have raised about one branch of government with all the power.",
