It began, as you say, with those airstrikes on the command and control center that Israel says was being used by the Jenin Brigades, a militant group affiliated with Islamic Jihad.Israel now saying that it has 10 more targets in the Jenin refugee camp, 10 infrastructure targets, before it can say that it is job done. And as you say we've seen the toll so far both in the damage to the streets there, Israel saying it was tearing up those streets because there were IEDs, improvised explosive devices, that were on those streets in order to deter Israeli forces. We've also seen the death toll, 10 Palestinians killed so far. Israel says that at least nine of those were militants with Israel also saying that it detained almost 120 Palestinians inside the camp. And we know that 100 have been wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 20 of them critically. So this operation continues. Airstrikes are continuing, Israel saying that it is continuing to discover weapon storage facilities. It discovered earlier this morning a shaft, it says, where -- which was being used to store weapons underground. It says that it's destroying operational rooms and also confiscating multitudes of weapons as well. Now, this operation has been condemned by the Palestinians, by the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Emiratis. The United States, for its part, has reiterated its support for Israel's right to defend itself, while highlighting the need to protect civilians.

The SCO is a broadly pro-Russian regional security grouping led by Beijing and Moscow. One U.S. defense analyst says many of the leaders at this summit looked to Russia and China almost as models for how they want to run their societies as authoritarian regimes. Vladimir Putin is scheduled to address the summit less than an hour from now in what will be his first appearance on the global stage since the Wagner Rebellion. Experts believe the Russian president will use the forum to project an image of power and reassure Moscow's partners that he remains firmly in control. And CNN is covering every angle of this story. I'm joined now by Vedika Sud in New Delhi, Clare Sebastian in London, and Mark Stewart in Tokyo. Welcome to everyone. So Vedika, as the host of this online summit, what is Prime Minister Modi hoping to achieve and delicate balance between these participating nations and of course here's a partnership with the U.S.?",

      "sentences": "It's a tough one, Rosemary. Moments from now, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is chairing the SCO summit this year, will be addressing the other leaders in this virtual summit. For him, this is another opportunity to showcase the growing and emerging power that India is now seen as on a global stage.But along with that, India for a while now has been navigating, if I could say, rough terrain, rough diplomatic terrain in the region and beyond. And that's essentially because for India, it's a fine balance that Modi has to maintain between the East and the West. Now, the timing of this SCO summit is highly significant. It comes weeks after the Wagner insurrection in Russia, as well as a highly successful meeting between the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the U.S. President Joe Biden. And Beijing as well as Russia both have been monitoring the developments that took place in Washington, D.C. very closely. Everyone knows that the West needs India because it's seen as the counterweight to China in the region. But all these nations are also very, very aware of the fact that India is very close to Russia. And that's essentially because it gets its oil from there, and more than 50 percent of its weapons are imported from Russia. And that's why India needs both the East and the West, especially with its highly independent foreign policy. Now, the concern with a lot of experts in the region is that both Russia and China will try to make this bloc an anti-Western grouping. And that is something India will have to face. And it will be the biggest challenge, rather, that India will have to face at this point. It's something it will push back against, because it wants to be seen as a non-aligned country with its partners across the world. And that something that Narendra Modi and its government has been striving to do over the past few years. What's also important to note here is that the nations that are members of the SCO summit have not come out publicly and condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially in the U.N. resolution. India till now has maintained that this needs to be solved and resolved peacefully. Narendra Modi has gone on record to say this is not an era of war. So clearly it's a fine balance that India has to maintain here. Rosemary.",

And in China, that is no exception.China, along with Russia and Soviet republics, is a founding member of the SCO. Yet China in particular is dealing with its own economic struggles. And as we have seen, sometimes subtly, sometimes more overt, it's leaning on the West to try to jumpstart things. So, the response that we have seen from China just on the international stage on a broad sense may also be reflected at this SCO conference. So far, China has not directly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and instead is calling for diplomacy. Yet, as we heard from one analyst who talked to CNN, this analyst stressed the importance of Russia or of China, that is, not wanting to do anything that would make itself an even bigger target of NATO. This is a conference that is certainly being watched across China. In fact, it was the focus of a recent commentary in Xinhua, which is the Chinese news, state news agency. I want to read just a portion of that commentary because I think it sums up where China fits in this global picture during this conference. It says, today's human society is undergoing accelerating changes unseen in a century. Regional conflicts are raging. The Cold War mentality and group politics are resurfacing. And so are unilateralism and hegemonism. Economic globalization has encountered headwinds. A more turbulent and intertwined world is calling for a clear SCO community. So the real challenge for China, for Russia, and for all of these member states, including India, is how to show this unified front. Yet at the same time not offending the West too much because it is depending on the West in many cases for future growth and for future development.",

But nonetheless, there is the use of force each year, and which leads to deaths at the hands of the police. So there are rules that govern that. And those rules have been loosened over the years, so there will be questions about whether those rules ought to be tightened again.It's a question -- that's a question that the French can look at, independent of whether or not minority populations are disproportionately targeted. So I think that those conversations are certainly going to be had, as well as, you know, the more underlying causes. Why do people feel so angry in these neighborhoods? What is it about France?

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine's much anticipated counteroffensive now well into its fourth week. The frontline's ever more intense. But the gains so far are small and incremental. Ukrainian forces are pushing forward in the south, liberating just over 150 square kilometers. That's only 60 square miles. But as Ukraine advances, the country's deputy defense minister says Russia is stepping up attacks in the east. The enemy is trying to force our troops out of their positions, but is receiving a worthy rebuff, she said in her latest update. On several fronts, Russian forces are managing to move forward. Now on the offensive in the town of Svatovets in the Luhansk region. Back in Moscow, Russia's military leaders continue to project strength, even after the recent mutiny by Wagner mercenaries. SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): These plans failed primarily because the personnel of the armed forces showed loyalty to their oath and military duty. The provocation did not have impact on the actions of the groupings of troops. The servicemen courageously and selflessly continued to solve the tasks assigned to them. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Russia's assault on Ukraine also continues further from the front lines, hammering civilian infrastructure. Monday, four Russian drones were launched at the northeastern city of Sumy, hitting two residential apartment blocks at a local administrative building. That attack killed two people and injured at least 19. Rescuers are determined to quickly clear up the aftermath. Just as Ukrainian forces tell CNN, they're determined to keep inching forward.

But let's remember now, that role now falls to China, because Putin's status is radically diminished in the world. And it would show if they were meeting at this summit in person.",

Gershkovich last had access to U.S. officials back in April, a month after he was first detained. Kylie Atwood tells us more about the visit.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Evan Gershkovich was visited in prison for the second time by the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Lynn Tracy. That's according to the spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. And this is only the second time that Lynn Tracy has been able to visit Evan. Of course, that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who was detained in Russia earlier this year, facing charges of espionage that his -- he, his family, and the State Department, the Biden administration have all said are bogus, have denied their credibility. But he's still in a Russian prison, his pre-trial detention period has been extended through at least August. And there have been multiple requests that the State Department has put into the Russians to try and see Gershkovich to gain consular access multiple times, those requests have been turned down, so it's significant that Ambassador Tracy was able to visit with him this week. And according to the spokesperson at the State Department, Gershkovich is in good health and remains strong, of course, despite the circumstances. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department.

One million barrels per day through August, and adding in Russia's announcement of a cut half that size for the same month, it takes around 1.5 percent of the world's oil demand off the market for the month of August.Saudi Arabia has already made hefty cuts to its oil output in an effort to bolster prices amid concerns of a global economic slowdown. Now, so far, its efforts haven't really been rewarded. Brent crude is still trading below the $81 a barrel handle, the price point at which Saudi Arabia can balance its budget according to the IMF. Russia's announcement comes after the OPEC Plus member already agreed to a 500,000 barrel per day cut in March. Given it then produced more oil than it said it would that month and again in April, the market may take a more skeptical view on whether Russia will meet its new target. For Russia, various bans, restrictions and a G7 oil price cap have already limited how much it can earn from its oil and that currently trades around $20 less a barrel than Brent Crude. So perhaps it has less of an incentive to cut output, but doing so could ease tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia and maintain unity in OPEC plus. Anna Stewart, CNN. London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
