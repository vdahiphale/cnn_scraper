And Davidson laid out the back and forth, how they ended up selling Karen McDougal's story to AMI. At the end of that negotiation, Michael Cohen gets involved. And Davidson testified, it was my understanding that this was being done to protect Donald Trump's campaign.

But something overshadowing all of this, Donald Trump has a decent chance of being re-elected president in November. And he has sworn retribution and revenge against his political enemies.

We're keeping a close eye on that as Biden has said relatively little about it so far. As we wait for President Biden to begin speaking, we are also closely following the developments in his predecessor, Former President Donald Trump's hush money trial here in New York.A reminder, it is Keith Davidson who is on the stand. That's the attorney who negotiated these deals for Stormy Daniels. He just said something important. Talk about how Michael Cohen was complaining about a \"Wall Street Journal\" story about Donald Trump and Karen McDougal because it's timing so close to the 2016 election. We have all of our experts here with us. Judge Konviser, I would like to start with you because we're listening to this line of questioning with Keith Davidson and the prosecutors where he's saying that Michael Cohen is very upset when a story came out about Karen McDougal and Donald Trump and their relationship in the \"Wall Street Journal\" just four days before the election actually happened. And what we're seeing right now is that Keith Davidson texted Dylan Howard from the \"National Enquirer\", the night of the election and said, what have we done? Dylan Howard responded, \"Oh, my God.\" It seems very clear, the prosecutors are trying to tie all of this to that date of November 8th, 2016. JILL KONVISER, FORMER NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE:  That's right. The prosecutors, of course, have the burden of proving this case to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. And in order to do that, they need to convince them that this whole arrangement had to do with whether or not this was going to affect the election, that's their theory, as opposed to just cover his tracks because he was cheating on his wife. So, the closer these texts get to the election, the more people from the campaign or who eventually work in the White House who are involved in this are going to be the focus of the prosecution to show that this was about something bigger than just a man cheating on his wife. This was about the concerns the former president had about how this would look on the campaign trail.",

So, there was a lot they could bring out from him that would help the defense case.And so, with a witness like that, and I think we're probably going to see it with this witness, there's a lot that he's saying that the defense will embrace. And they will, elevate, you know, things like Cohen's obvious dissatisfaction with Trump at this moment. Things like, someone was commenting earlier, the fact that they never saw Trump sign this. That Trump wasn't a party to this. There's a lot of material for the defense to work with. And also, I'm -- I would imagine that we'll see the defense also attacking Cohen's credibility through this witness in many ways.

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, what the prosecution is doing right now is they're taking the sting out of the bad facts in the case. They're not going to wait for the defense to bring this up. They know it's coming out.And so, prosecutors will often bring up these, what I would call, bad facts. Like he didn't get paid back. Like he didn't get a job in the White House. Because it's coming out one way or another. You don't want the jury to hear it from the first -- for the first time from the defense, as if you're hiding from it. Really, you have to embrace all your facts as a prosecutor, the good, the bad, the ugly, and then tell the jury what it means, ultimately, in summation. So, these are the facts of the case. It is what it is. And the defense is going to use this as a way to show Michael Cohen has an axe to grind against Donald Trump.",
