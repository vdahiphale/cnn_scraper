You don't use them as a prop.That's what Donald Trump is doing when he's going to Michigan to talk to these UAW workers. He's using them as a prop to distract from the fact he is not going up on the debate stage. And we're seeing Joe Biden saying I'm the pro-union president and he goes out there yesterday and speaks to them. Donald Trump, and what we're hearing, is he's going to use this opportunity more to go after Biden for his electric vehicle policies. And look, the reality is Donald Trump is a free-market candidate. He is for the free markets and for businesses. So for him to go there and say, I am, all of a sudden, pro-union, it's not going to really sit well. But he can use this as one opportunity to say I'm for the working person. It doesn't really gel with his policies of the past.",

He said, \"Hillary Clinton has a slogan, 'I'm with her. I'm with you.\" That can be a powerful message. It certainly was in 2016. Given the weakness that Biden has with some of his core voters on this, union voters, it's an opportunity for Trump. Does he do it in a ham-handed fashion and go over the top?

Video posted in social media showing rowdy crowds barging into stores, stealing merchandise and leaving widespread damage.Here you can see looters even pouring drinks onto stolen Apple products. Police say multiple stores were hit and more than a dozen people were arrested. And all of this is coming as a wave of retailers say they're struggling to contain store crimes that have hurt their bottom line. Target, the latest to announce the closing of multiple stores in major cities across four states. Let's talk about this with CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller. Let's talk first about these store closures. Nine Target stores. What are these stores dealing with? We're talking about cities like San Francisco, Portland, Seattle. There's one in east Harlem as well. What are they dealing with when it comes to theft and organized crime? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, they're dealing with organized retail theft, which is groups of people that actually make their living this way. And we're seeing this new trend, which you kind of described a little bit, where a group of 30 or 60 people will come in a caravan of cars, do a smash-and-grab or just a grab and go, as they like to call it. And that intimidates employees. It intimidates shoppers. If you look at the surveys that the National Retail Federation did this year, 81 percent of store employees believe that organized retail theft has become more violent than it was in the year before. And 54 percent of them believe that criminal justice reforms, which make these crimes misdemeanors, where you're not held on bail or you're not going to pay bail, where you're essentially going to get a ticket and be let go, where you're not going to face jail time, has encouraged the increase.",

Initially, what we saw was a peaceful protest to deal with charges that had been dismissed against a police officer. And looting began shortly after the protests ended. Police say what they're investigating here is a possibility of a caravan of vehicles that was going from location to location. How does that work? How are they coordinating?

They're not part of the marches. It's not like they broke away from the marches and went to loot stores in a spontaneous way. These are actions that are planned out by groups. It's all done on social media in advance. They target stores. They line up the cars, they switch license plates to be undetectable. They post lookouts on scooters, and they will move in rapidly and try to break into the stores and take everything they can run away with and move out rapidly. In this case, they made a number of arrests. And they're working with the video, license plate readers and everything else in Philadelphia to see if they can make more.",

Which listed the address on his driver's license, his parents' address, because it was his only permanent address at the time. Lowell goes on to slam Republicans, saying, \"We expect more occasions where Republican chairs twist the truth to mislead people to promote their fantasy political agenda.\" That's the stock that Hunter's legal team is putting into these revelations from House Republicans -- Boris?",

We do know that across adults, this was the survey of more than 1,000 across the United States. About one in four, 23 percent, said they definitely plan to get the updated Covid-19 vaccine. Another 23 percent said they probably plan to do so. But that means that more than half said they either probably or definitely won't make plans to get the updated vaccine. I will say, with older adults, 65 and older, a larger share of them said they do definitely plan to get vaccinated. That number, 34 percent of them, said they definitely do have plans to get the updated vaccine. And we know, with children, we tend to see a smaller share among parents in this survey. More than half said they don't plan to get their child vaccinated. So these numbers are interesting to watch as we see the rollout of updated vaccine continue -- Boris?",
