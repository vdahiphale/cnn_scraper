Ukraine is not commenting, but it says that its air defenses worked against the large-scale attack, intercepting all 18 Russian missiles launched, including some of the most advanced in the Kremlin's arsenal. CNN's Nic Robertson is live for us in Eastern Ukraine. Let's go there now. Nic, bring us up to speed on what we saw overnight in Kyiv.

The Patriot missile system is the epitome of the strength of that defense. So Russia wants to target it. Indeed, Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, has this evening said that he believes that this is what the Russians were trying to do, target that defense system. And that was the analysis last week as well. Russia gave the defense systems, the air defense systems in and around Kyiv an extreme test, six hypersonic missiles fired from aircraft to the north of Kyiv, nine cruise missiles fired from ships in the Black Sea, and three of the -- Russia's large Iskander S-400 missiles fired to the east from Russian territory. Now, these hypersonic Kinzhal missiles go 10 times the speed of sound. So, put it into context. Ukraine has said that it managed to defeat all the attacks on the city last night. This is a significant accomplishment, given what was fired at it. However, we don't have further details yet on the damage, such as it may be, to the Patriot system.",

CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is following developments from this hearing. Donie, what's the big takeaway here? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER:  Yes, Brianna, I mean, I think you said it there. Really, the questions and the discussion we heard over the past few hours up on Capitol Hill just showed you how wide-ranging the implications of this technology can be, from jobs, to election misinformation, to national security issues, even to the music industry, where we have seen famous artists having their voices being dubbed and replicated now using A.I. And Sam Altman, who is the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, he was not shying away from both the power and the dangers of this technology. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What he actually said in that part of the -- of his opening statement was created using ChatGPT, so really just trying to underline here how powerful and how potentially convincing this technology could be.

And, really, what they're trying to do is to try and better define the contours of a negotiation. And what we have seen so far emerge is that there seems to be some agreements about the need for caps on federal spending going forward, positive discussions about clawing back some of those unspent COVID relief funds. But there are still a lot of sticking points. And one of those sticking points, as you mentioned, is this notion of work requirements and whether or not those could be added to any of these social programs, tightening those -- some of those work requirements. So that's going to be a key point of those negotiations happening today. In terms of how much progress is going to be made, that is really anyone's guess at this point. I mean, we know that that last meeting between the president and those congressional negotiators didn't go great. All you really had was both sides reiterating their talking points that we have heard in public so many times. Now, the president over the weekend, he said that he's an optimist as it relates to these talks. You heard the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, kind of downplaying the notion that there has been progress. So we will see where they emerge after this meeting. But, certainly, in terms of the public pressure, the White House is trying to continue to build that up. We saw a memo from the Office of Management and Budget, the director, Shalanda Young, talking about the fact that these cuts that Republicans are calling for, if they exclude Veterans Affairs, defense, homeland security, that would amount to 30 percent cuts on every other area of the federal budget. And the president himself is now also taking to Twitter saying: \"If America defaults on its debt, our economy would fall into a recession and our nation's global reputation would be damaged.\" He also warns once again that this is a manufactured crisis. And he urges House Republicans to stop playing brinksmanship, which is, again, a familiar refrain that we have heard from the president. And, ultimately, they do hope that they can make progress in these meetings today, but the president set to leave for that foreign trip tomorrow. And so, critically, it's going to be important to see how much progress can actually be made before the president heads abroad -- Brianna.",
