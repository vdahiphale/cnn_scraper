      "sentences": "And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news unsurvivable. That is the exact word officials are using right now, as Hurricane Helene has now grown to an extremely dangerous category four hurricane, bringing with it potentially, really historic storm surge levels, right now expected at 20 feet. Lets just look at the scene right now is a live camera that we have in Matlacha, Florida, trees right there right now, you've got up to 130 an hour gusts coming through that area on that bridge. We have seen cars coming and going really even in these past few moments, which is pretty stunning. Many bridges have already been closed. This is the Skyway Bridge, as you're looking here, which is now completely submerged. Imagine being in one of those cars. And right now, darkness is descending on the area, more than 200,000 people in the dark without power. Right now, there is a sheriff asking people who do not evacuate to write their name and date of birth on their arms or legs so they can be identified. And that the storm is hitting on precedent and warm waters. And that's what's really like this high-octane jet fuel as they're calling it, with the storm intensifying and speeding up so rapidly right now, we do expect 60 million people across 12 U.S. states to feel the effects of Helene over these next hours and days it is now one of the largest storms to go to the Gulf of Mexico in the last century. This image is that storm from the International Space Station and of course, the larger the store in the more catastrophic the damage when you add up the wind and the flooding and the rain. And we do have some new pictures from inside the storm as it's rapidly intensifying this from one of the hurricane hunter aircraft, as you can see in part of the viewfinder there. And the Florida capital Tallahassee bracing for what they're calling a dead on hit. Tallahassee, in fact, this is an interesting thing, least in known history, has never faced sustained hurricane force wind and that, of course, has officials fearing complete destruction in this moment, thousands of trees could come down massive power outages just an absolutely chaotic and horrific scene possible in Tallahassee. And there are new warnings tonight across all of the south. Tennessee, Georgia, the Carolinas, all right now preparing for life-threatening flash floods in Georgia, people being told to stay off the roads. In Asheville, North Carolina, 100 miles inland, evacuations are already underway. They are being told that they will be seeing one of the most significant weather events to happen in the modern era. We do have reporters across Florida tonight. Chad Myers also standing by with latest forecast as the storm is about to formally hit near Tallahassee. I want to start with Derek Van Dam joining me now though from Apalachicola on the Florida panhandle. And Hurricane Helene, Derek, heading your way, going to be arriving, as I said, the formal arrival soon. What are you seeing? What do you expect?",

And also, of course, all of this happening in darkness in the night. In terms of the time that the storm is striking. Carlos Suarez is joining me now on the phone. He's been in Gulfport which is just a southwest of Tampa tonight. And, Carlos, I want you to know, you've had to move locations because of flooding coming up and a very rapid deterioration that you were witnessing where you were before. So what -- how fast how has it changed? CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well, Erin, to kind of give you a sense of exactly where we were. We were in Pinellas County, as you mentioned, that for the southwest of the Tampa Bay area, in part, that we've been the last couple of years for a couple of other hurricanes because we knew that that area is a low-lying area. We knew in the past to hurricanes that we've covered there, that that was an area that would flood. So, when we got here this morning, what was interesting is there was already flooding, right? And, of course, the storm at that time was way off the coast of Florida, is nowhere near southwest Florida, but we knew that some of the rain that had fallen overnight, along with some of the high tide, that this was going to be a little bit different than the previous storms that we've covered. And then probably around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon as that hurricane got a little bit closer to the north of southwest Florida from Fort Myers and Naples, and got just to the southwest of us, you really started to see those strong winds pick up. You started to see the rainfall and then all of a sudden in a matter of just I'd say maybe hour or to the water from the bay which has been slowly trickling over and breaching the seawall there. It just started to completely flood the area and we really had to move a few blocks to the north in order for us to be a little bit safer from where we were at the time. And now we've made the decision to go ahead and pull back. We're trying to get somewhere safer within Pinellas County. And that because several of the bridges that connect Pinellas County to the south and Bradenton and Manatee County, as well as some of the bridges that connect out to the Hillsborough, which is Tampa -- in the Tampa Bay area? Those bridges have closed because the sustained winds at one point or another have reached 60 miles an hour. And so, right now, we're in the process of just trying to find a safe place where we can join some of the CNN programming.",

Again, this is a storm that has been labeled unsurvivable.Chad Myers is OUTFRONT in the CNN Weather Center. And, Chad, unsurvivable is the word that were being told so when exactly does the storm formally hit as far as you see it?

Do that now, do those things while you still have power, you got to think about them, but there are still things you can do to help yourself out. If you're going to close your garage door and you're going to have wind to 80, make sure there's nothing that can push that garage door into the garage, push something up there. It could be your car.

We have them spread out all over the county. We have our personnel in place as well. We've called in our mutual aid agreements from all over the United States, nine states far away as Oklahoma City. They're sending electric and utility crews to help us out. So we have tripled our workforce prior to the storm. We expect to increase our workforce to five times the normal workforce after the storm recovery. So, the residents of Tallahassee have been preparing all week as well.

Talking about rain, we are above average with our normal rainfall. The ground is saturated, more rain comes, is going to loosen the trees. As you know, Tallahassee is internationally known for our beauty in our live oak trees and that helps bring trees down.But when you have category four sustained winds, yes, you're going to have significant damage to the electrical grid two structures here in town, and it's important that we speak the truth to the residence we must take this extremely serious.

He has been intent of the biggest name storms and many others. And he runs the popular Mike's Weather Page, which is a hurricane tracking website. So, Mike, thank you very much. I appreciate your time. So the storm here that as we understand it from where you're standing south of Tallahassee, what do you expect to happen there when you hear the mayor talking about well, they feel like they're a little bit inland and therefore that 20 feet of storm surge doesn't directly come to Tallahassee. MIKE BOYLAN, STORM CHASER, MIKE'S WEATHER PAGE:  Yeah, I'm going to really beautiful little town here, talked to a bunch of the locals that live here. Really community feeling, location and they're all kind of kind of cautiously scared. Nobody's ever seen this storm surge prediction in this area. So there's definitely a lot of tension where I'm at, and they're calling for 20-foot of surge in the storm striping. And as you guys have mentioned.

And you also shared what you saw in Tampa Bay near Safety Harbor, and then you also took pictures of trees already down in Oldsmar, Florida.Now, back to what I mentioned before, you're one of the people who really understands what a storm can be because you directly been in the path of ten of the biggest storms.

We've been talking all season about the water temperature has been very warm and it's proving powerful. Storm is going to have far-reaching effect. And, you know, we don't get a lot of these cat-4s and who knows that its going to go even higher in size is what scares, you know, Ian was a four, we saw what that did. And another thing that I'm concerned about is everybody so focused on this center line eye. But this system is so big, you know, Ian, we had hurricane winds 80 miles apart. So there's a lot of folks effective, even if Tallahassee gets a little the city goes a little bit to the east. But as the mayor said, it's tough.

So that's been a concern all along those high waters combined with those strong winds bringing down some of the trees we have in this area with those power lines is why we've seen the sheriffs office put out those words of a mandatory evacuation over the last few days. And why even earlier today as you guys have been talking about, they had that message about if you decided to stay, if you didn't evacuate, taking that permanent marker, writing your name, your date of birth, other information on your arm or leg, very sobering message about just how dangerous this storm can be in this part of Florida when it hits.",

We've seen Florida highway patrol, sheriff's deputies making the rounds, continuing to knock on doors of those who may have chosen to say, but at this hour especially again the sun going down, not a lot of people out and about thankfully.

If this storm makes landfall about 25 miles south of where we are on the coast as a category 4, 30 miles per hour, winds could still be 110 miles per hour when they pass right over this city and that could just be a huge, huge problem.

There had had closed it. And so at this point, if you're in Pinellas County, which is home to Clearwater and St. Petersburg, as well as Gulfport. You really can not crossover into the Tampa area and you can also not go south into Bradenton. And so what we've done is we've now set up here in St. Pete, where in driving around trying to find their location to go live. And you can see that that storm surge is still pushing its way in. Our meteorologists are telling us that considering where the numbers are right now, were still looking at another four feet of storm surge. That was really the problem that forced us to leave where we were in Gulfport because as soon as some of that severe weather moved in, as soon as the hurricane was out, just to the west of us, the water just kept pushing in at a really fast rate of speed. And it was coming to the point that it just wasn't safe for us to not only be where we were, but our equipment, our cars, we had to push back a couple of blocks where we felt it was safe enough, but then our meteorologists let us know, look, you're still in the thick of things, even as this storm continues its path north, and its not going to hit Pinellas County directly. It's going to be a well off shore, well over 100 miles to the west of us. You are still going to see all of that wind. You're still going to see all of that rain and more importantly, you're still going to see those forecasts four feet of storm surge, and then come around midnight 1:00 in the morning.
