But as of last night, police said to us, we just don't know why this man started firing last night.But I will tell you a little bit about more about how exactly this came to be. It all started around 8:30 last night. Philadelphia police got a call of multiple gunshot victims in the Kingsessing area of Philadelphia. That's in the southwest from where we are right now. Officers arrived. They did find gunshot victims, but then they also heard a number of gunshots. And the police commissioner really described this chaotic moment of officers arriving on scene, hearing gunshots and chasing the gunman by listening to the sound of his gunfire. Eventually, officers were able to apprehend him. I should say they did it without firing a shot. It's something that Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw mentioned and highlighted last night.

Larry Krasner, he's been in office since 2018, and Danny said exactly correctly, rates of shootings and homicides spiked from time he took office until now. They're down a bit this year, from last year, but nearly doubled from when he took office in 2018 up through 2019 on through 2021.

I want to bring in retired Army Major Mike Lyons. Mike, we've seen a couple of incidents like this. They seem to be, to some degree, accelerating. What do we know about these five drones? MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  So, Russia claims Ukraine has struck two targets. One, basically surrounding Moscow, a civilian airfield on the west side and then a special forces group on the east side of Moscow. Conveniently, it doesn't hit Moscow, had the capability to do that. Color me skeptical on this one, and the fact that the only capability Ukraine has to do, these are the Turkish TB2 drones. And given they're counteroffensive right now, this is not worth it. This is not worth them wasting this resource here. If you see this video that the Russian media releases, some guy pointing at the sky at something that we can really hardly see is what's out there, we could try to think that that's a TB2 Turkish drone that's in the Ukraine inventory or not.

These groups are arguing that Harvard's admissions process, the preferential treatment that these kinds of applicants get, violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act.They say that this preferential treatment goes largely to white students because they make up nearly 70 percent of these legacy applicants. And a district court has found the preferences that they're given to be sizable and significant. And this complaint includes a lot of data. They use admissions numbers to try to make their case. And here's some of the things they found. They found that in the class of 2026, nearly 2,000 were admitted out of an applicant pool of just over 61,000. That's an admissions rate of just about 3.24 percent, so very, very low. But if you were donor related, so related to a donor, the admissions rate for you was seven times higher at 42 percent. This was for a period from 2014 to 2019. So the numbers are kind of looking historically. And then this admissions rate for legacy applicants, so someone who had a parent or relative who went to Harvard was six times higher, so about 33.6 percent. And as you mentioned, the timing of this is important because it's coming less than a week after the Supreme Court limited the use of race in college admissions. And so these groups are arguing that given that ruling now, it's even more imperative to make sure they eliminate any policies that disadvantage students of color. They argue that that's what this legacy admissions preferences do simply because so many of these legacies are white. And part of this is because college admissions is a zero sum game, of course, if a legacy applicant gets a spot, that means that someone else who may not be related to someone who went to Harvard, may not be related to someone who donated to Harvard, is trying to get on their own merit, that leaves the spot not empty for them, so they can't get in if that spot is taken by a legacy applicant. Here is one thing they said in the lawsuit. They said experts have concluded that removing legacy preferences would increase admissions for applicants of color and that approximately one quarter of white students admitted would not have been admitted if the donor and legacy preferences, among others, did not exist. And so they say if Harvard gets rid of these legacy preferences, then they're going to see admissions rates for black, Latino and Asian-American students rise by 4 to 5 percent with each of those groups, and that they would see admissions among white students fall by 4 percent. So, they're saying, look, other schools have done this, other schools have gotten rid of this unfair treatment. It's time for Harvard to do the same.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think, look, it flows naturally, logically and legally from the opinion last week that legacy admissions are on their last legsI guess I will say, though, two caveats, number one, the courts, including the Supreme Court, are going to apply more scrutiny to an explicit discriminatory system, affirmative action, whether one likes it or not. They explicitly say, what's the person's race? And then assign certain value to that, versus a system like this one, as Athena just laid out, which has what we call a disparate impact. It doesn't, on its face, say we're going to make differentiations based on race, but it has a disparate impact favoring white applicants. Courts are going to treat those a little bit differently. The second thing, and let's remember, the Supreme Court does not have to any case it does not want to take. And so the question is, will they have they need four votes to take a case? Will they have those four votes? But I think reading even the majority opinion, striking down the affirmative action practice last week, I think it's clear if you sort of do the logical math, that it's hard to justify legally or logically ongoing legacy admission policies.",

And I think you saw Republicans and Democrats come out after the Supreme Court ruling and agree from a 30,000-foot level that perhaps legacy admissions should be next. What's your sense of things?",

      "sentences": "I think this goes back to what Ketanji Brown Jackson said, which is that there's the impact of race in real life, and then there's the way that you approach it in the law. For legacy admits, they've had a head-start, right, in this race, and the reality is that they are more likely to be white. The institution discriminated against African-Americans for the longest. The first three African- Americans who came in the 1850s had to be expelled because their white classmates refused to take classes with them. So, it was never necessarily about merit or whether you qualified to go to the institution. It was about whether the institution was willing to have you there.Privilege compounds like money in a savings account, right? And so there's a population right now that has this advantage, and so you have to address it. We've seen the impact at other universities, and the truth is that admission rates do drop for legacy when you take that off the table.",
