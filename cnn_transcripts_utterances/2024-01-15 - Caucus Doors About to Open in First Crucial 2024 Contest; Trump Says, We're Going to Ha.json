      "sentences": "Well, he has had a tremendous grip on this Republican Party, but tonight will be the first time that voters have a chance to weigh in and decide whether they would like him to essentially have a rematch with President Joe Biden. Of course, Iowa is the beginning of the road. The question is, by the end of this evening, will it be the end of the road for some candidates?There is no doubt that the Trump Organization has been preparing for this evening for months and months. They have built a significant ground organization. I have seen it. I've been inside their headquarters. It is dramatically different than it was in 2016, when many of their supporters admitted not exactly knowing what an Iowa caucus was. Now, they do know that. They have precinct captains in all of the 1,657 precincts that are spread out across the state. Of course, the other campaigns are also working extensively on the ground. Wolf, but let's think of a little bit of history here. The Trump campaign has been really trying to manage its expectations. They are expecting to win. Virtually, every Republican here also expects Trump to win, but the question is by how much. The biggest winning margin in the Iowa caucuses so far is 13 percentage points. That came back in 1988 with Bob Dole over Pat Robertson. So, the Trump campaign is saying that would be a win, but there's no doubt that the bar is slightly higher than that given the fact that he was up 28 points in the latest Iowa poll in yesterday's Des Moines Register. So, there certainly are high expectations. But, Wolf, as we talked to Republican advisers looking at this race and the race as it goes forward, really a central question is, does the former president surpass that 50 percent mark? If he does, that certainly sends him on perhaps a glide path to the nomination. There have long been three tickets out of Iowa. Wolf, depending on the order tonight, if Ron DeSantis would happen to come in third place, there could just be two tickets out of Iowa. But for now, at least at this hour, campaigns are still calling all of their supporters, trying to make sure that they will get out to the caucus sites now in just two hours time. Wolf?",

They aren't saying if that means coming in number two or number three here in Iowa, where she is battling it out with Ron DeSantis to try and become the one who is competing with former President Trump throughout the rest of the Republican primary.Now, one of the things that Haley's camp felt was important today was the fact that she got out and she actually saw voters here in Iowa in a number of events across the state all within driving distance to Des Moines, of course, because the weather has been so awful over the last few days, they didn't want to get stuck in another part of the state. But one of the things that surprised me when I was at those events earlier today is that there were a number of undecided voters who were in the audience. They were listening to Nikki Haley. Some of them are looking at New Hampshire. They see she has momentum there. That's one of the reasons that they're thinking about supporting her here because it could boost her into New Hampshire in a really formidable way. But not all Iowans feel that way. Of course, some said that Iowans make their own decisions and Nikki Haley telling them over the course of the last few days that Iowa is going to set the tone for the Republican primary.",

Again, Donald Trump came in second in Iowa. The rest was history after that. But this is what it was still competitive. This is the test tonight for Haley, DeSantis, anyone else running against Donald Trump. Can you prove he's vulnerable? Can you make it competitive?So, the gold counties here, that's Ted Cruz, especially for Ron DeSantis, rural America has become Donald Trump's foundation. Can you compete with him among farmers and evangelicals out here? For Nikki Haley, it's a test too. Can you come in a strong second or third in these counties to prove the knock on her? She's only getting moderates and independents. She can't win conservative voters. It's a test for her. One other way to look at it, though, if you come in and look at it this way, if you look at the -- oops, that doesn't want to work for me there. All right, let me come out of this and come out and then sometimes she gets it. She is the total population of the state, right? You see these lighter red counties, might be hard to see at home, those are places Marco Rubio won, right, in the place. That's where you have big numbers. People don't have to drive as far to the polling places. That is Haley's bread and butter. She must win in the suburbs.

It's first. Then we go to New Hampshire a week from now. Then we go out first week of February to Nevada. There's a primary and a caucus. The caucus gives the delegates. Nikki Haley might win that primary, doesn't really matter for delegates. Trump has the state party pretty wired. They think he's going to get that. Then you go to Nikki Haley's home state here February 24th.So, six weeks from now, we will have four contests in the books. If Donald Trump is four and O, we really might not have to talk about Super Tuesday, we might not have to go into March.

And I don't mean his physical stature, I mean his loyalty, his lack of follow through, his lack of principle.

In the heart of the GOP, the primary electorate, that's true.

This kind of thing happens where if you have a loss, it takes the wind out of your sails of inevitability.
