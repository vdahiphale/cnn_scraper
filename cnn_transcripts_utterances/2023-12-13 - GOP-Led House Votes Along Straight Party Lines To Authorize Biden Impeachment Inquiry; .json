The House takes a major step in votes to authorize an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, but do they have any evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors?Also, Judge Tanya Chutkan overseeing the federal January 6th case against the former president today hit pause on the proceedings, raising the question, will it ever go to trial at all? And later, cofounder of the conservative group, Moms for Liberty, gets caught up in a sex scandal of her own, and now the school board where she serves wants her gone. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with tonight's historic vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry into President Biden that House Republicans have been pursuing now for months with little or nothing so far to show for it. President Biden tonight called it a baseless political stunt. The vote, 221 to 212, was entirely along party lines. Pushing for it earlier today, House Speaker Mike Johnson said tonight, tonight's action was, quote, \"called for and appropriate,\" which is certainly a change from the Mike Johnson of four years ago, who believed the exact opposite when the subject of the impeachment was Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R), HOUSE SPEAKER: The founding fathers -- the founders of this country warned against single-party impeachments, and they had a very specific reason for warning us against that. They said that it would be bitterly divisive, perhaps irreparably divisive for the country. And that's what's happened now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So that was four years ago. When Mike Johnson said that, he had already seen plenty of evidence against the former president, including sworn testimony from ex-administration officials that the former president had tried to pressure Ukraine's president into investigating or at least announcing investigation into then-candidate Biden and his son, Hunter. That wasn't enough for him then.This time though, it is different. There is next to no evidence of impeachable offenses, yet he is on record all the way back in August saying, and I quote, \"The evidence and the allegations against President Biden are the worst in the history of the country. It's not even close,\" he said. Now, keeping him honest, in addition to lumping allegations and evidence together, he is the one making the allegations, along with a number of top Republican committee chairman, which lends an echo chamber quality to it all. But even for Republicans who are not making allegations and who say they just want answers, it's worth examining what the search for answers has yielded so far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R), CHAIRMAN, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Today, the House Oversight Committee is releasing subpoenaed bank records that show Hunter Biden's business entity, Owasco PC, made direct monthly payments to Joe Biden. This wasn't a payment from Hunter Biden's personal account, but an account for his corporation that received payments from China and other shady corners of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So far, in fact, they've uncovered no evidence that what Hunter Biden has been saying and said again at the Capitol today is not true.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON: My father was not financially involved in my business, not as a practicing lawyer, not as a board member of Burisma, not in my partnership with the Chinese private businessmen, not in my investments at home nor abroad, and certainly not as an artist.

And that's what's motivating this here.When you contrast it, as you alluded, the overwhelming evidence that we had that President Trump had withheld hundreds of millions of dollars from Ukraine to extort President Zelenskyy into helping his presidential campaign or the evidence that was before all of us in Congress, so President Trump's incitement of a violent attack on the Capitol is subject of the two impeachments of Donald Trump to the lack of any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Joe Biden.

And so, they're putting the country on this train destined for nowhere. And so, you know, by contrast, you know, we did a thorough investigation. We waited until the evidence was rife even to begin a formal inquiry. And we see none of that happening here. This is an impeachment in search of a reason for being.

Over the course of the last few months, you saw a lot of these Republicans in those Biden districts saying, you know, this isn't where our focus should be. So they don't want to take that vote, and they know that it potentially jeopardizes their majority in the House. So, you know, I think ultimately what happens here is I agree that Republicans have sort of put themselves in a weird box because either a group of them -- enough of them -- if they took a vote, would exonerate Biden -- great for Joe Biden -- or you put these vulnerable members who then have to go back to their constituents and explain the vote under the gun and having to vote for this thing. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to me as a political calculation for the House. I think -- for the House Republicans, I should say.

They're not going to be -- there's not going to be a call for a vote on the question of whether or not to impeach the president because I don't think that's the ultimate objective here, at the end of the day.

And that sort of culminated in the 2020 campaign with the debate moment with Joe Biden standing on the stage next to Donald Trump, Donald Trump coming at him in the debate and Joe Biden saying, I'm proud of my son, I love my son. And I think every person watching this debate right now knows somebody who has struggled like Hunter has. It's incredibly powerful. And so, I think Hunter doing this today, first of all, calling their bluff and saying, I will absolutely speak to you in a public, televised hearing, and them saying no was smart on his part.

The Supreme Court has announced now they're going to review whether the obstruction charge can be applied to January 6. Two of the four charges against Donald Trump, federally, are that charge. So, if the court says, obstruction does not apply to January 6th, Jack Smith loses two of his four charges in that case.

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey Anderson, his message to Iowa voters was fairly clear. He's telling them that it wasn't just about the primaries and the caucuses, but it was really about the primary election, pivoted to Joe Biden, using the unpopularity of Biden to galvanize voters ahead of these caucuses. With just five weeks out, and his message was fairly clear. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We're just 33 days away from Iowa, first in the nation. I wonder how you got that. You got that because of me. First in the nation caucuses, and we're going to keep you first in the nation for a long time. You know, the Democrats bailed out. And without Trump, you wouldn't be first in the nation anymore either, but we kept you right here where you belong. You're going to be here for a long time, first in the nation.
