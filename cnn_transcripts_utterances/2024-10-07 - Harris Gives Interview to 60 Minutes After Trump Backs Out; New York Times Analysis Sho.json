Let's get straight to what America is talking about, two very different answers on one American crisis. Tonight, we watched some course correction. You'll remember when you'd be hard pressed to find an interview or maybe a media appearance with Kamala Harris. Well, that has all now changed. The Democratic nominee, she is trying to make sure that you can't miss her, whether it's on T.V., on your radio, in your podcast feed. Well, tonight's stop, it was an extended sit down with 60 Minutes where she said this about border policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

North Carolina is underwater, Hurricane Milton is bearing down on the coast of Florida and she took the time on Saturday to tweet about how we're sending $157 million in aid to Lebanon.This follows on the weird idea and ultimately dumb idea that Joe Biden had to build a $230 million appear, which broke apart for us to deliver aid out there.
