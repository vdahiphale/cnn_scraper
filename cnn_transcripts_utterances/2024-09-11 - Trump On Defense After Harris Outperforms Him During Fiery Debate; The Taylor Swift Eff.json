We're breaking down the pivotal debate moments, voter reaction, and what it all means for the final 55 day sprint to Election Day.Also tonight, the Taylor Swift effect, how much will the pop music icon's endorsement of the Harris-Walz campaign impact the presidential race? Plus, there's breaking news we're following right now, life threatening storm conditions in Louisiana as Francine strengthens to a category 2 hurricane and nears landfall. CNN is on the scene where millions of people right now are under a state of emergency. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer.

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: When you don't win, it's like a fighter. When a fighter has a bad fight, gets knocked out, or loses the fight, the first thing he says is, we want a rematch. I would do NBC, I'd do Fox, too. I do Fox too.

Kristen Holmes reporting from New York, thank you very much.We also have some new information on the post-debate strategizing going on inside the Harris campaign. CNN Senior White House Correspondent M.J. Lee has been working her sources for us. M.J., what are you learning? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, the Harris campaign was certainly on a high last night after the debate, but today back in Wilmington at the campaign headquarters, it very much is back to work, even as the campaign has been trying to strategize on ways to capitalize on the momentum that the campaign felt last night. The campaign does not believe that the debate fundamentally changed the trajectory of the race. In other words, they still believe that this election is going to be incredibly close, and they also believe that a lot of the hard work is still to come in the weeks that are left until Election Day. This is how a senior campaign aide I spoke with earlier put it. They said, it'll be incredibly close. We cannot take our foot off the gas, even when the moment feels really good. That, of course, again, is a reference to last night. Nobody on the Harris team, Wolf, right now is saying all of a sudden they feel like this is a race that is a 45-55 race. They still believe this is going to be incredibly close to 50-50 race practically. And this is a team, remember, that very well remembers that the 2020 election was decided by tens of thousands of votes in a number of key battleground states. And that is, of course, why we are going to see so much time and resources and effort being poured into a number of those battleground states. You take a look at the states that we are going to see the vice president and her running mate traveling to in the coming days, states there like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin, it kind of tells you where the focus of the campaign is and where they believe this election is going to be decided. Of course, the vice president herself is going to be hitting the campaign trail and also attending a number of significant fundraisers in the coming days. We'll also see whether the campaign got a fundraising boost coming out of last night. And lastly, that big Taylor Swift endorsement coming last night, we are told that the campaign did sell out of the friendship bracelets that the campaign started selling last night. The campaign is being very tight-lipped about whether they might try to do some kind of event, something to capitalize on that endorsement, but clearly very happy about that. Wolf?",

Lee reporting for us, thank you very much.There's certainly a lot to unpack with our political experts, and let's start with David Chalian. The Harris campaign clearly thinks they had a very good night last night, and they did have a very good night, but they're also tempering, as we just heard M.J. report, tempering expectations about how much this currently changes the race right now? What's your analysis?",

So, they're obviously being cautious in their approach to assume that it's not going to change the trajectory of the race. But there are two things there. One, obviously, guarding against complacency, making sure that -- think about it, Wolf, in all the battleground states and all the structure and organization that they built on the ground, the ground troops up through the party leadership, they want everyone working every day.You saw it from all their high level surrogates on social media immediately. You know, the Michelle Obama's and Hillary Clinton's and Barack Obama's the world that we saw at the convention were out saying, yes, she did great, but now it's time to get to work. So, they were all sort of singing from the same songbook. The other piece is it's reality. It is going to be a close race. We haven't lived in a world without close races. We are a closely divided country. There are seven states that will determine this election. Probably, you know, just tens of thousands of votes across those seven states will determine the outcome.

So, she's not scared of him. But to me, before you do another debate, get out here and talk to us in the press. I mean, don't be scared now.

She's going to be out there trying to replicate what we did in '16 by going to these small counties and convincing people. I think that's what she should do.Listen, that's what I'm going to advise President Trump to do, visit a lot of places in Pennsylvania, small places, manufacturing shops, restaurants, you know, shaking hands and kissing babies.

In this case, crowd size is not Donald Trump's worst issue. It's just an irrelevant issue. And it allows Vice President Harris to say he is only interested in himself and talking about himself.It was a lot of missed opportunities, Wolf. I don't know how much new people learned about Donald Trump, although arguing that immigrants are eating pets from the debate stage probably is going to get some attention. For the most part, viewers have seen this kind of rhetoric from Donald Trump a lot, and he does these things at rallies as well.

We're going to be talking with voters no matter where they are, small towns, big cities, rural communities, asking for their vote, talking to them about the Harris-Walz vision of a new way forward and inviting them to be a part of that, to see themselves in it and to participate in our democracy.

The vice president herself has been very clear that this is a campaign that is running from behind, running as an underdog. And, yes, there were some moments in last night's debate that really were head scratchers. If you were listening or trying to listen to anything that former President Trump was saying, but that the American people out here that are going to be -- that are really up for grabs, what I call Kamala curious voters, they really want to understand what kind of leader Vice President Harris is prepared to be, the vision that she and Governor Walz want to bring forward for the American people. And contrast that with what we know to be former President Trump's policy agenda, and those are being articulated in Project 2025. And so that's going to be our work. That's going to be our focus.

I think she has a steady handed, gifted leader. She also mentions LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body. She signs it \"Childless Cat Lady\", a rebuttal to Senator J.D. Vance's criticism of Democrats without children. Swift also slammed Donald Trump for re-posting these fake images, implying she and her fans support him.
