Recall that during the debate, the former president raised that multiple times and each time the vice president would pivot to another issue or, in one notable moment, to his rallies. But yesterday she took on the issue head-on, particularly the amplifying of baseless claims about Haitian migrants by the former president and his vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, calling that rhetoric harmful and hateful, and also saying it's a crying shame. But she also made the point -- and this was notable -- that these tropes are not new. Take a listen.

So let's first talk about this. Donald Trump says only consequential presidents get shot at. His campaign is fundraising off the second assassination attempt. And he's blaming Democrats for the assassination attempt. While at the same time, Republicans and Democrats are saying hey, we've got to tone down this rhetoric. Here's how J.D. Vance kind of responded to that call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You have to ask yourself what is the point of these criticisms, right? When you are criticizing somebody's rhetoric, when you're criticizing what somebody said, are you trying to tone down the violence or are you trying to silence them? And I think that was is so consistent about the attacks on Donald Trump, not just over the last campaign but the last 10 years, is there is an explicit effort to try to shut him up -- to silence him. And ultimately, now two people have tried to take that silencing to its logical endpoint. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are people who wanted to take away his social media accounts. People who wanted to take away his ability speak. So that's absolutely true. Now, whether you could draw a line between rhetoric and what happened in Pennsylvania, I don't know that we know that yet because it's still very unclear what that shooter was doing. The guy in Florida, a little different story. But the truth is Republicans today feel like that a lot of things are allowed to be said about Trump and when something bad happens everybody wants to be hands-off about it. And he has to be made to answer for his own rhetoric, which I think also, at times, needs to be dialed back as well. So look, he's been nearly assassinated twice.

And the prosecutors are talking about him bribing a hotel security worker. There was no criminal investigation. This was just a matter of personal embarrassment because he and the person in the video were in the midst of a 10-year relationship that was difficult at times, that was toxic at times.

And so they can identify what those vulnerabilities are, often connected to you're a sex worker so you don't deserve justice, or you are a foster kid and you don't deserve family.

This was something that the people investigating this case already took to a judge and used trying to keep him behind bars as we await the next hearing, which is going to be set for Monday. Right now he's charged in a criminal complaint with possession of a firearm -- two counts of possession of a firearm because of this attempted assassination. But it's very possible that more charges could be on the way -- John.",

That appears now the question and choice before Congress about the Secret Service after Sunday's assassination -- apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump -- the second attempt in less than 60 days.This morning we are also learning that the White House made an appeal to Congress last month to help boost resources for the agency. There's a lot of talk about what this means for the agency now. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House tracking all of this for us. Arlette, what did the White House ask for? What are you hearing about this?",
