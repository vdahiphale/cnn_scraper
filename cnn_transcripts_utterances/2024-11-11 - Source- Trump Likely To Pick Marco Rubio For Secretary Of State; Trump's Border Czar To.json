I'm Kaitlan Collins, live from West Palm Beach, tonight, where the announcements about who Trump will surround himself with, in a second term, are seemingly coming in by the minute.We've just confirmed here, at CNN, from a source, that President-Elect Donald Trump is expected to pick Florida senator, Marco Rubio, to be the next Secretary of State, meaning he will be representing U.S. interests around the world. The New York Times first to report, late this evening, this. And of course, as I should note, always with Trump, nothing is final until it is final. And it's not clear that an offer has been formally extended to Rubio yet. But what we do know, tonight, is that Rubio is someone who was in the running to be Donald Trump's running mate, earlier this summer, and he had since made it clear that he was interested in potentially joining Trump's cabinet, if it was for the right role, sources told me. Now, with this pick, Rubio would become the top diplomat for the U.S. And it also shows how far Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, in their own relationship, have come, from their former days as primary opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): There is no way we are going to allow a con artist to take over the conservative movement. And Donald Trump is a con artist. He is wholly unprepared to be President of the United States. Donald Trump is a con artist. He would be a disaster for America. He would split our party in half. The party of Lincoln and Reagan cannot have as its nominee someone who refuses to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One reason that people feel that Rubio could be a good fit for this position, is how he sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Foreign Relations. He has deep foreign policy experience here. And what this would look like tonight, as what we are also learning about another staffing decision, is what Donald Trump's national security portfolio, in a second term, is going to look like. We are also told that Trump has chosen, as his next National Security Advisor, Florida congressman Mike Waltz. That is the first Green Beret to ever serve in Congress. And tonight, we are looking at this picture of what this is going to mean for when Trump is back in office. Both Waltz and Rubio are major hawks on China. Could be a sign of what that is going to look like. I want to start this evening with CNN's Jim Sciutto, who is joining me on the phone, on this breaking news. Jim, I just want to first get your take on hearing that it doesn't appear this is formal yet. But if Trump is leaning in this direction, and that is what all of our sourcing is indicating, at this hour, what the significance of a Marco Rubio, as a Trump pick for Secretary of State would be, in your view. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (On Telephone): One, it very much, Kaitlan, puts China at the center of Trump's foreign policy, the combination of Rubio and Waltz, both of whom are big China hawks. Rubio's portfolio in China goes back years. He's drawn attention to China's trade practices. He's pushed for restrictions, on selling advanced technology to China. He's highlighted China's mass incarceration, and forced labor, of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. As well as China's intelligence gathering inside this country. So, he has a deep and long resume on China. And listen, shouldn't be surprising given that Trump himself, of course, has made China a target, both of his national security policy, but also his economic policy, the discussions during the campaign of imposing significant tariffs on Chinese goods. And this would bring to his team, a Rubio and a Waltz, two individuals with history there and focus on China. I'll say this as well, that given the concern about some of Trump's foreign policy positions, particularly among Democrats, the outgoing Biden administration, but also some more traditional Republicans, I think it's safe to say that both Rubio and Waltz are not out-gear (ph), as it were, right? That their positions on China are very common with other Republicans. But also, frankly, it's a bipartisan position, right now, in Washington, a far more aggressive China policy, both in terms of national security and trade. Their positions on Ukraine, for instance, Rubio has been a skeptic of--",

And on this breaking news, I also want to bring in CNN Anchor and Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju. Because Manu, as we were looking at this, I just want to note what Kristen Holmes is reporting, on top of this. She says that she heard from a source this morning, who thought Trump was leaning toward Ric Grenell, of course, who served as his acting Director of National Intelligence. Before that, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. We know Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee was also in the running for these two positions, though he seemed to have fallen out of the contention a few hours ago. Manu, though, when you look at this, if this is what Trump ultimately formally goes with? And a caveat there, just because it's Trump. I imagine Rubio, would have a pretty easy time getting confirmed in the Senate.",

      "sentences": "Yes, no question about that, Kaitlan. In fact, if it were Ric Grenell, that could potentially have been a problem for some Republican senators here.Rubio is different, though. He is more -- he's one of the -- he's been a long-time senator. He's got a lot of allies in the Senate Republican Conference. He's one of those senators, who has straddled both the Republican establishment world, and the Trump MAGA world. And he has despite of all of his criticism against Donald Trump, back in 2016, he has very much aligned himself and been a chief defender of Donald Trump, through his four years in office, and on the campaign trail and the like. And his foreign policy views do align, to some extent, with the Republican establishment. But he also has broken with them as well. He did vote against the big foreign policy bill of this past year. That was a $95 billion aid package that included aid to Taiwan, aid to Israel, aid to Ukraine. He called it legislative blackmail, that bill. He contended that it was -- it should not have been all tied together. Shouldn't -- should have done more to -- should have went after border security issues as well, even as Ukraine was clamoring for that money, at that critical moment, earlier this year. So, he has broken from a lot of his colleagues, including the Republican leadership, on that issue. But he is very much on Trump's side here. And assuming this pick goes through, I do expect him probably have no problems to get confirmed. But if he is confirmed to this post, then that opens up a vacancy in Florida for a Senate seat. This would give the governor there, Ron DeSantis, the ability to name a replacement to that post. So would not affect the current balance of power, right now. But I can tell you, without talking to too many Republicans, at the moment, with this news just breaking, I will be talking to a lot of them tomorrow, I can expect many of them will be happy to hear this news. If it does happen, Marco Rubio getting this major pick, for Secretary of State, someone they believe can carry out America's foreign policy effectively on the world stage. Kaitlan.",

Now, two Florida lawmakers, it sounds like, are going to be inside the Trump administration. On that with the House margin. Of course, House Republicans were waiting to see if they have the majority here. It was already a pretty slim margin. I mean, obviously Mike Waltz is in a pretty safe Republican district.

Well, you're right. We don't know exactly they do have the majority yet. They aren't tracked to getting the Republican majority. But potentially, we're looking at anywhere from 220 to 223 seats. We'll see what ultimately plays out for the Republicans. But each time they lose a member, it gets closer and closer to making it harder to pass bills, because if they lose one or two votes, on any single bill, that could stop the entire Republican agenda.

I hope, though, that in this process, they're actually going to be able to -- if they're going to cut a deal with Russia, to cut a good deal, whatever that looks like, but one that makes sure that Ukraine is able to defend itself into the future. In terms of Israel, look, this is continuing to be just a really complicated issue. There's no doubt that I think they will be -- they will put less constraints on Israel from this administration. I don't think that's a question. And probably will be much more aggressive at confronting Iran, because the current administration was -- has been kind of like living under this idea that they can somehow resurrect the Iran nuclear deal.

You're talking about a level of attack against immigrant community that is horrifying, but also terrible for the economy.

And that can be very, very reckless. So it's not -- look, get whoever you want around you. But maybe follow the law, maybe respect the process and maybe respect human rights.",

As you can see here, one person replied, quote, I wanted to change -- \"Wanted change so I went with Trump and blue for the rest of the ballot to put some breaks.\" Others said, quote, \"I feel like Trump and you are both real.\" One said, It's real simple... Trump and you care for the working class. My source tonight is the Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. And it's great to have you here. Because we hear this from voters a lot, that they see Trump as being for the working-class. And I know you said, on Capitol Hill, today, at a press conference, that you thought your party failed to get its message out. What do you think went wrong in terms of that? Was it just the messaging part of this? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Kaitlan, it's good to be with you. I think it's a couple things. And I think we're still looking at all the data, to make sure we understand. But I do think that not enough voters heard Democrats, talking about how we would make their lives measurably better, on an economic realm, in the economic realm. And they also saw too many Democrats as being sort of, willing to preserve the status quo rather than taking on a system that is clearly rigged against working people. I also think it's interesting when you look not only at split-ticket voters, as Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez was doing, but also at the ballot initiatives that passed. These were in Trump states, where people went around state government, and went directly to the ballot, because they felt that even their state government was not delivering for them. What were those issues? They were the populist, popular economic issues, like raising the minimum wage, like paid sick leave, that were absolutely essential to people doing better. And so, I think, we can take these lessons immediately. We will have a very good opportunity to showcase who this Republican majority is going to be for, this Republican White House is going to be for, when we deal with the tax -- the Trump tax scam is going to come up for an extension next year. That is a tax scam, where 82 percent of the benefit went to the richest, wealthiest people. Working people got crumbs.

There are all kinds of challenges. People can't get processed quickly enough. The broken system has not been fixed. And what I think, even if you look at polling today, despite the very xenophobic comments against immigrants, what you will see is that voters want a solution. They want this thing to be fixed. They don't want cruelty, which is exactly why in the first Trump administration, when Tom Homan engineered, as you reminded people, the zero-tolerance policy, separating kids from their parents, people did not want it.

Let's go back to our business. Let's get that economic agenda, which we actually know what it is. We've had a proposition agenda at the CPC, for some time, and it includes all of these things, including taking on these big corporate monopolies, taking on price gouging, rate -- you know, investing in housing. These are critical things that will lift people up, in addition, of course, to minimum wage, paid sick leave, the things that passed on the ballot in Trump states. We can get those done.
