Even though the Israeli military has secured the northern part of the Gaza Strip, Pamela, they're now moving their efforts to the central part of Gaza and the south. The problem with that is that you have around 2 million displaced people who are also gathered in those areas.And so over the last two 24 hours periods, so over the last 48 hours, we've had some of the deadliest -- in terms of civilian death toll, some of the deadliest incidents that we've seen, 250 people killed from Christmas Eve through Christmas, and then 241 for the following 24-hour period after that. Also, new numbers from the Israel Defense Force, 161 now confirmed dead since the ground operation in Gaza began 20 days after the October 7th attacks. On October the 27th, of course, those attacks killed 1,200 Israelis. And so far in Gaza, the death toll is now getting closer and closer to 21,000 people, according to the Hamas- controlled health ministry. The number of injured more than double that, nearly 55,000 now, although CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that this is going to be a very long conflict ahead, that soldiers may be having to fight for many months. Even if there is a dialing down of the intensity of the operation, there's still going to be a lot of Hamas militants embedding themselves within the civilian population. And Israel says if there are Hamas militants, even if they're underneath somewhere where people are sheltering, that is still a legitimate military target under international law. And that is what makes this war unprecedented in the eyes of the Israelis. The fact that basically you're dealing with an organization that deliberately puts civilians in harm's way is not concerned, apparently, according to the Israelis, about the rising death toll because they know that the pressure is continuing to grow from around the world for Israel to offer more concessions to Hamas to get the hostages handed over. Still more than 100 of them believed to be alive and in custody and bring this war to an end. Now, in The Wall Street Journal, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did write an op-ed, peace where he talked about the three prerequisites for peace. He said that Israel must destroy Hamas, must demilitarize Gaza and de radicalize the whole of Palestinian society. That is not going to happen anytime soon, Pamela.",

And that would include women who are still held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, but that did not come to fruition. Now, what we know is that U.S. officials and Qatari officials have been in close touch, Qatar serving as a mediator in all of this, the president also speaking with the emir today.

Hopefully, this more punitive attack, this stronger strike, will deter these forces, all the Iranian-backed forces, frankly, from striking U.S. forces on the bases.

Who knows, Pam. This is a really -- this ball is still in the air. It will obviously go through the schedule that Jessica laid out and will be heard by the D.C. Circuit. If Trump loses at that level, he has two options. He can ask the D.C. Circuit for a rehearing in front of the entire court. He's not entitled to that, so they might turn him down. Or he could go right to the Supreme Court. And the question of whether or not the Supreme Court will even take the case, I think, is a relevant one. So, we'll have to see what happens.

Threats using interstate commerce against public officials in the course of doing their job almost says that a specific person has to make a direct threat against another specific person, saying, I am going to kill that person, or something very close to that. So, what the FBI can do here, of course, is trace these threats back to the origin, see who needs to be interviewed. That sends a message in and of itself. But you have statements from Donald Trump about judges and prosecutors in almost every case he's involved in, some of them extraordinarily harsh, that kind of normalize this language.

And what we're seeing with this rhetoric he's put out in the last few days, he is really sending a message to his base that you knew what you got when you voted for me back in 2016. I have not changed. And he's really trying to encourage them to get out. On the other side, there are many people that are frustrated with that and ready to turn the page and get away from this toxic, divisive type of language. That's why they're looking at other candidates, like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis.

And we know he has this absolute preoccupation with Obama and everything that Obama got done.But, I mean, this is a strategic error on his part. I mean, this is an incredibly popular piece of legislation. People can feel the difference that it makes in their lives. We've seen over the course of the last few elections that taking the position that you're going to repeal Obamacare is a loser. I mean, we've seen essentially every other Republican, every other elected Republican walk away from this as a policy. So, as you look at what Donald Trump is doing this week with this really heated and hateful rhetoric and tripling down, quadrupling down, I've lost count, on repealing Obamacare, this is not a good general election strategy for him. And this is where it would be, I think, smart to see some of the other Republicans running against him try to really go hard on this case that he is a terrible general election candidate. I don't expect any of them to get a profile in courage award for taking on what he did on January 6. But if you look at what happened in Colorado last week or a week-and-a-half ago now with him potentially being removed from the ballot there, that was an opportunity for Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley to say to the Republican base, this guy can't win a general election. And so the more we see him making this kind of aggressive rhetoric, talking about acting as enemies, the weaker he gets.

Important, of course, to underscore that Navalny, his legal team and supporters have consistently denied the charges laid against him. They say they believe this is a politically motivated attempt to stifle Navalny's criticism of President Putin -- Pamela.",

But elsewhere, along the U.S. southern border, there is no letup to the unprecedented surge.CNN's Rosa Flores has the story from Eagle Pass, Texas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the migrant caravan forms in southern Mexico with thousands from Central and South America, the scene on the U.S. southern border in Eagle Pass, Texas, has changed. The areas where thousands of migrants were waiting outdoors to be transported for immigration processing last week were emptied out this week. The flow this morning appearing to be down to a trickle. A senior Customs and Border Protection official telling CNN that while the scene in Eagle Pass has improved, the agency is not out of the woods yet. CBP is still grappling with elevated numbers of migrant encounters on the U.S. southern border. More than 11,000 migrants are waiting in shelters in northern Mexico, 3,800 in Tijuana, 3,200 in Reynosa, 4,000 in Matamoros. Many hoping to enter legally but some opting to cross illegally, say community leaders. U.S. federal authorities report of the seven-day average of more than 9,600 migrant encounters in December. That number was 6,800 at the end of November. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is scheduled to meet with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador Wednesday in Mexico City. The Biden administration is expected to put pressure on Mexico to do more to stem the flow of migrants. To deal with the flow, CBP has temporarily suspended operations at several ports of entry in several states to reassign personnel to process migrants. This as CNN learns from a CBP official, that the surge is in part driven by pseudo-legitimate travel agencies abroad that promise trips to the U.S., but instead connect travelers to smugglers self of the border. That might explain this recent scene in Arizona. I work for CNN. Now, I'm wondering where you're from? What country are you from?",

Now, long after that statement, you have Apple saying he strongly disagree with this decision and we are appealing. In other words, it's not exactly final.Now, this is all about the technology that Apple uses in its watches to read blood oxygen levels. It's a light-based technology. It's a technology that California-based company Masimo says is rightfully there. This is covered by a patent. Now, the two companies have to speak to this issue for years but in late October, the U.S. international trade commission which is a group that advises the White House and Congress on issues like these sided with Masimo and which ruled this technology does infringe on those patents. Now, there was a 60-day review period where the Biden administration could have intervened and be told the ruling that ended at midnight with the White House opting not to get involved, meaning, that the ruling is now in effect. It applies to the Series 9 and Ultra 2. That means for consumers if you are looking for those models you likely won't find it on Apple Stores or in Apple Stores or the Apple website. You could however find a different retailers because retailers tend to sell what they have an inventory. But, they can't restock. As for what it means for Apple -- well, analysts say that, financially, it's actually not a massive blow, but that the optics here are not a good look. It's a black eye as one analyst told me. And because Apple says that it's appealing, it's also unclear whether this ruling is really final or just in place for now pending that appeal. The only time will tell -- Pamela. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
