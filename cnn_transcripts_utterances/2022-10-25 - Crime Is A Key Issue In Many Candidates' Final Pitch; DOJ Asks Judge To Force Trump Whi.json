That amid a secret court fight Trump has been waging to block former advisers from testifying in front of the federal grand jury investigating January 6th.Back with us now to discuss, Scott Jennings, Karen Finney, and Ron Brownstein. You know, as we are talking about the greater issue of democracy in peril, the president now is saying, of course, that democracy is on the ballot. We know that abortion is on the ballot, crime is on the ballot and a number of issues.

Obviously not. But it is a mistake to say that that is not a factor also in itself. Clearly, one of the reasons I think Democrats have been able to close, not eliminate, but reduce the enthusiasm gap and also hold on to so many white-collar voters who are also facing inflation and lowering 401(K) is because there is a genuine concern about what the Trump movement means for the future of American democracy.

One of the things that he had mentioned in the diary entry, which news flash to our prosecutors and evidentiary rule followers that a diary entry is no longer evidence that you can actually include because credibility is the issue for Scott Jennings.(LAUGHTER) But I will tell you about this, and that is he mentioned that Alito wrote a memo for the Reagan administration in which he spoke about why he felt Roe v. Wade ought to be overturned. And then he told Kennedy, according to the diary entry, that he did that because he wanted to essentially conform his viewpoint to secure a promotion. That was the reason why Alito, he believed, was not somebody who could conform or configure your viewpoints for promotion. What might you do for a ten-year position?",

According to the lawsuit, Jenny Mitchell used L'Oreal products from around 2000 until March of 2022. She was diagnosed with uterine cancer in August of 2018 and underwent a full hysterectomy the following month.The lawsuit comes days after a major study found frequent use of chemical hair straightening products could put women at a higher risk of developing uterine cancer. We reached out to L'Oreal numerous times for a response but have yet to hear back. Jenny Mitchell joins me now along with her attorney, Ben Crump. Jenny, Mr. Crump, so nice to see both of you but not under these circumstances. Can you just help us to understand, Jenny, what it was like to have seen the study that came out linking, according to the NIH, uterine cancer to some of these products? What did that feel like hearing that? JENNY MITCHELL, PLAINTIFF IN LAWSUIT AGAINST L'OREAL:  It felt like I was reliving it all over again. It was hard to hear, but it was shocking.",

Let's not have any of our little girls use any more of these chemical relaxers because we believe, based on the science, there is a direct and proximate cause that two to one, they have a stronger chance of being diagnosed with uterine cancer.
