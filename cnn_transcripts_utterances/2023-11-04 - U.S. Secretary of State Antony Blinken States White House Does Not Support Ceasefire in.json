We'll get to you in a minute, Wolf.We begin this hour in the Middle East where calls for a ceasefire are growing as Israeli forces close in on Gaza City. Today, officials from several Arab nations called for an immediate ceasefire following a high stakes summit with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. But Blinken had the U.S. position clear. Now is not the time for Israel to hold back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  It's our view that the ceasefire now would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on October 7th. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just a few days ago, senior Hamas officials said that it was their intent to do October 7th again and again and again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Everything they say I think we have to take a step back and ask ourselves, can we trust Hamas as a credible source. Certainly, we think the answer is no.In this case, as we provided information, we did identify a terrorist threat inside those ambulances. We provided information where even in Hamas courtyard, we see Red Cross ambulances sitting there. We know, and this is not a new thing. Since 2014, Haman has been taking ambulances and hiding their terrorists inside of them, making the most cynical use of important medical assets for their own terror use. It is extremely difficult to fight against. Again, I think it just once again shows that this is Hamas's play group when they know that Israel would respond. The first thing they said is how can we get world opinion on our side? Let's show blown-up ambulances. And that's what they use as their Uber. It's just ambulances to go around Gaza. And if you identify an active threat, we of course will eliminate a threat that's an imminent threat.

And we see incoming Hamas artillery fire directly at the position of that corridor that leads into the safe zone which had to be closed off.And, again, it is one more time where not only are we trying to get civilians out of the way. Hamas is trying to keep them in the way because they know as soon as those civilians are gone, Wolf, we are able to continue with our objectives and immediately eliminate them.

I cannot think of another situation that would more require a country to go to war in order to defend itself.And as Secretary of State Blinken said, even the Hamas spokesman was bold enough to say that they are preparing as of these recordings, they are performing additional scenarios for October 7th against Israel. And therefore, the greatest thing that we could do is defend our civilians. The only way to do that is to destroy Hamas. This is a clear case of self-defense.",

It took about 20 minutes of driving into Gaza, this armored personnel carrier making frequent stops to look around and check for possible threats from Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip.

And now, Wolf, the question is, will they go actually inside and do the kind of potentially very bloody, very deadly urban combat that would be required if, indeed, they want to go in and clear out that city of Hamas. That city is, indeed, a Hamas stronghold, Wolf. But one thing was made very clear to me, is that even as there are certain points where they believe are the front line positions of Hamas fighters, they also know that these Hamas fighters can pop up anywhere in the Gaza Strip because of that network of underground tunnels. And it was very clear to me in my conversations at this military base today that those soldiers, that is their number one concern is those underground tunnels which they have been working to clear. These soldiers at this post inside the Gaza Strip, they were also working to establish what they said is a humanitarian corridor to allow civilians from the northern part of Gaza to escape to the southern part. Of course, what we also know, Wolf, is that in recent days and weeks, Israeli forces have been bombing residential areas of Gaza where they say there are underground tunnels beneath those residential building. But as they are targeting those Hamas militants, Wolf, we also know that there have been a number of civilian casualties.

And there are not a lot of points of commonality there. He said they do all share the same objective, which is to get this conflict to end with a sustainable peace. And he said they also agree on the need for humanitarian assistance to urgently reach the population in Gaza that so desperately needs it.However, there is still clearly a major divide on one of the biggest key issues here, and that the calls for a ceasefire. We saw the Egyptian foreign minister, the Jordanian foreign minister standing there next to Blinken at a press conference after that summit today and again call for that immediate ceasefire, and very strongly condemn the Israeli offensive in Gaza. Blinken doubled down on the U.S. position, which is that it is not a time for ceasefire right now. They are aligned with the Israeli approach, that this would give Hamas time to regroup and potentially re-attack. Instead, the U.S. has called for what they are saying is a humanitarian pause to allow aid to get in, to allow civilians to leave. But we saw Israeli officials yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu in particular, just reject this entirely. They said they would not seek a pause, they would not seek a ceasefire until Hamas releases those hostages. We know this is something that Blinken brought up in his meetings in Tel Aviv yesterday. He also brought up the rising violence in the West Bank by some of these extremist settlers. That was something else that was discussed at the meeting today. And another big focus of this trip is the attempt to stop this conflict from widening, from broadening into the region. He said that was discussed at today's summit, and each of the members said they would use their influence to stop that from happening. Here were Blinken's exact words on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  Throughout this conflict, countries across the Middle East and beyond have played an essential role in preventing its spread. Today, we all agreed on the importance of using our respective influence and capabilities to deter any state or nonstate actor from opening another front in this conflict or taking other destabilizing action.

Gali ran into the shelter with her husband, Tzachi, their nine-year- old son, Shahar, their 11-year-old daughter, Yael, and their 18-year- old daughter, Maayan.

After murdering their daughter, Hamas terrorists also took Gali's phone and livestreamed the rest of her family being held hostage on the floor for hours and hours.

And the kids asked Tzachi what -- are you bleeding? And he said no. And then he just nodded his head and I had to tell the kids that they just killed Maayan, and it's her blood. And then the kids started crying and shouting. And they said to the terrorists holding us hostage said, don't kill us. Please, don't kill us. And they were filming it all the time. I realized that now, but I didn't know then. And I was still in shock about Maayan.And then the red color, the alert started shouting that their missiles coming. And I told them, I tried to jump to the shelter, and they said no, no. You're staying here. He said don't worry, our commander knows we're here so he won't shoot some missiles in here you're safe.

And everybody who is saying you can just displace them and put them in other countries does not seem to understand that Palestinians are not Egyptians, they are not Jordanians, they're not Iraqis. They are Palestinians. And so the idea that you can just displace 1.4 million people, now close to almost 2 million people, kill tens of thousands of them, and then not actually meeting any military objectives, and then say we cannot have ceasefire, it just makes me wonder what the end course is, where are we heading, and are we doing it this way.Additionally, I'm not seeing a lot of people talking about the fact that with the medical system collapsing, with the lack of water, with the lack of food, we are going to start seeing people dying en masse as a result of disease and hunger, and all of that.",

Every day I literally get news of another family member or loved one that has been killed as a result of these airstrikes. They are saying I don't understand why them and why they are being targeted this way. There is no Hamas here. We have heard from medical experts who have worked in these hospitals saying there's no Hamas here. We keep hearing from people on the ground there is no Hamas here.And so the question then becomes, how surgical is this targeting, especially when we see entire buildings leveled, when we see people under the rubble, and we see children dying en masse. I personally just very much struggle with that.

It's coming from a place of deep, deep, deep pain. I cannot, as a Palestinian begin to explain what it feels like to be watching this and be incredibly helpless. It's not just happening in Gaza. It's happening in the West Bank. People are seeing it. And I've also never seen a coalition this broad for Palestinians in my life. And it's not because they are pro-Hamas or any of that kind of sort.
