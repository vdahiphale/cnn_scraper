Garland grilled the attorney general, facing a barrage of questioning from the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans and Democrats grilling the attorney general on a host of issues including Hunter Biden.Chicago's mayor is out. Lori Lightfoot falls short in her reelection bid. Crime the number one issue. Is this a warning sign for Democrats? And a Trump slump. New CNN reporting on Donald Trump's allies pressing to get House Republicans to endorse his 2024 bid, and so far, they are not getting what they want. We begin the hour though with the attorney general on Capitol Hill facing sharp questions on a range of critical issues. Merrick Garland defending the integrity and the independence of his Justice Department. At a time, some Republicans suggested is somehow weaponized against conservatives. The attorney general agreeing much more can be done including, getting tougher on social media companies to deal with the fentanyl scorch. And he said, he was keeping his promise to stay walled off from the investigation of the president's son Hunter Biden. And he said that Trump holds over U.S. attorney handling that case, at full authority to follow the facts wherever they lead. CNN's Paula Reid has been tracking this hearing for us and joins us now live. Paula, let's start with the investigation of the president's son Hunter Biden. This came up when Merrick Garland was confirmed as the attorney general, and he said today it's being handled Trump holdover in Delaware. I have nothing to do with it, but he has full authority.

And the former president of the United States who said he is going to run for office again, and their possible his handling of classified documents.

The Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, conceding last night after she failed to make the cut for a spring runoff. The city has not ousted the city mayor in 40 years. It's fresh evidence Americans are fed up with violent crime and how their leaders are dealing with it. The two top vote getters advance now to the runoff. Brandon Johnson and Paul Vallas, excuse me, both are Democrats. They agree public safety is the top issue, but there is a big divide. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL VALLAS, (D) CHICAGO MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Public safety is the fundamental right of every American. It is a civil right. We will have a safe Chicago. We will make Chicago the safest city in America. BRANDON JOHNSON (D) CHICAGO MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Paul Vallas is the author of the Tale of Two Cities. He is backed by the same forces who have done nothing as crime has paralyzed our city. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's what Brandon Johnson had in mind. He's a cook county commissioner, and he is backed by the teachers' union. You could see the divide instantly last night. How does this play out particularly on the crime issue going forward? TESSA WEINBERG, GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS REPORTER, WBEZ CHICAGOAnd so, voters, I think, you know, rightly want to see it addressed and candidates have talked about ways to, you know, pour more resources into the police to attract more recruits, or a lot of candidates like Brandon Johnson have talked about ways to address the root causes of violence, like poverty, or mental health. And so those been some kind of the - some of the different approaches we've seen. But, you know, we've also seen whenever it comes to talking about other issues, like the economy or public transit, it seems to continually go back to crime as candidates say, to you know, attract more people back to downtown or fill offices, need to work on our crime problem, or to get ridership back on the CTA that we need to address violent crime. And so, it's definitely been the defining issue so far. And I think we're only going to see that and continue to be the issue that defines the runoff election come April,",

I think that was clear that, you know, a runoff was going to happen. And, you know, it was a question of whether she can make it. She, you know, was the historic mayor when she was elected in 2019, like you said, and, you know, I think she put a lot of emphasis on, you know, investments and things like the south and west sides and equity was, I think, a major driver of her campaign.But a lot of her opponents, despite those achievements, you know, pointed to failed campaign promises that she didn't act on, or, you know, sometimes just pointed to personal critiques of her tough negotiating style, which I think sometimes lost her allies, for example, on city council. And so, I think, you know, a mix of the, you know, historic levels and intense levels of crime we've seen. Plus, some of those others really were driving voters to want to see something different and want to see some change. You know, her election night party last night, which I was at, she said she's, you know, still has her head held high and, you know, voters I talked to, were disappointed there to see her go and pointed to the fact that they, you know, the fact that she is the first black woman and openly gay mayor, you know, that wasn't lost on them.

Congress has a lot of power over what the District of Columbia whether it's the mayor or the city council, they can enact things, Congress gets involved as well. And that's the D.C. crime bill would overhaul the criminal code in D.C. The original criminal code was drafted by the Congress back in 1901.The new policy would eliminate most mandatory minimum sentences. It allows jury trials for most misdemeanors, reduces maximum penalties for burglaries, carjackings and robberies, the law would not take effect for three years. The mayor, the Democratic mayor did not like every provision of this, but the city council went over her head here.

But also, as it has been a concern of vulnerability for Biden, and that's why you've seen him trying to distance himself from some of the, you know, some of the progressive moves, you know, distance himself from defund the police.

This is John Thune, remember the Senate Republican leadership. It's a runner with a lot of the American people. They look at the cities today and they say they're not safe places.I think it's a problem for Democrats to oppose something that would make some of the larger population centers more safe. Now, you could argue, OK, then call timeout, try to strike a compromise deal. That doesn't work in this town, because they probably can see an opportunity here to score points. Joe Manchin, democratic West Virginia on the ballot next year, says I'm going to be with the Republicans on this one. A, can the Democrats on Capitol Hill do anything? There's the math just act against them. And Franco raises a great point. What does Joe Biden do? Say, I don't want to mess with the democratic city, or I want to burnish my credentials going into 2024? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yes. I think the math is starting to look not so great for Democrats being able to stop this Republican proposal of overturning those changes in D.C. It does put President Biden in a tough spot because Democrats have been saying for decades, leave D.C. alone, let themselves govern. We think they should be a state. But I think Joe Biden, quite frankly, probably, he's not on that progressive side, D.C.'s progressive city council is which decided to go forward with some of these changes to the criminal code. And I think Joe Biden probably isn't completely comfortable with it. So now he's conflicted between protecting D.C.'s independence versus allowing these changes to go into effect that, a lot of people do have concern about thinking that it sends the wrong message, not so much that the conversation wasn't necessary, but lowering mandatory minimum sentences at a time where D.C. crime is going up, sends the wrong message is what they said.",
