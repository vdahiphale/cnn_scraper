New test results from the nation's report card show in most states fourth and eighth graders are falling behind in reading and math. The math scores are historic, the worst decline ever recorded, with roughly 25 percent of fourth graders and 38 percent of eighth graders performing below the basic level. The lowest of the three achievement levels for the test. Students who were already struggling in school showed the most dramatic drop off.

They can go into a federal court, bring a civil lawsuit and ask a judge to issue an order requiring Donald Trump to testify. The problem with that though is the calendar. The key date to watch here is January 3, 2023. That is when a new Congress takes over. If that's a Republican Congress, of course the committee is done. But even if not, this committee has shown that they understand they have to be done by then. The fact of the matter is, they just don't have enough time to get a civil lawsuit done by January of 2023.The other option is criminal contempt. The committee, and then the House of Representatives, can vote to hold Trump in contempt if he defies them. Timing is not as much of a problem here because, again, focusing on that key date of January 3rd, they don't have to go through the courts. As long as they vote contempt before them, and they have plenty of time, then the case goes over to DOJ, which will have to decide, do we bring criminal charges. Now, we've seen this four times already. DOJ is two for four. They charged Steve Bannon, of course, who was convicted and just sentenced on Friday to four months in jail. Peter Navarro was charged. He has trial next month. But DOJ opted not to charge Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino. So, what would DOJ do? They're 50/50 so far. We'd have to wait and see.",

No less than George Washington, Abe Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt. The committee, actually, in their subpoena, mentions Theodore Roosevelt and quotes him saying that a former president is just a private citizen, has an obligation to testify if called by Congress. And most recently Gerald Ford, who testified as president in 19754 about his pardon of Richard Nixon. And then again in 1983, in a more ceremonial capacity. But none of them were subpoenaed.There have, however, been congressional subpoenas on presidents and former presidents. Back in 1848, Harry Truman was subpoenaed about the red scare. He refused to testify. Most recent, Richard Nixon was subpoenaed by Congress for those infamous White House tapes. He actually fought that in the courts and won. But then he got a criminal grand jury subpoena, fought that in the courts and lost, and then resigned a couple weeks later. So, we will have a major legal battle ahead here.",

This time it was a clean sweep.I'm going to go to Philadelphia first, though, meanwhile, because it was an incredible scene there. You know, they gave Bryce Harper $330 million in free agency a few years ago hoping he'd get them back to the World Series. Did just that. Down one, runner on, bottom of the eight, just crushed that ball. The 43,000 fans there just going bonkers. The bullpen even jumping around like they were little kids when Harper hit that ball. Phillies win 4-3, beating the Padres. They now head to their first World Series since 2009. Philly fans taking that celebration to the streets too. Police actually had to grease up those streetlamps to try to prevent fans from climbing them, but no grease is stopping an excited Phillies fan, as you can see right there. Meanwhile, the Astros heading to their fourth World Series in the past six years as they completed that sweep of the Yankees. Short stop -- rookie short stop Jeremy Pena once again coming through. A huge three run blast. That tied the game in the fourth. He was your ALCS MVP. Seventh inning, this was a tie game. Alex Bregman coming through with the RBI single. Pena's score. That put the Astros up 6-5. That would be your final. The Yankees crowd that was chanting, we want Houston, less than a week ago, just stunned as they lost all four games of this series.
