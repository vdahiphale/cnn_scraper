      "sentences": "And I'm Kalyn Collins live from West Palm Beach tonight where we have just gotten a burst of breaking news out of Mar-a-Lago as President-elect Donald Trump has announced his major picks for big cabinet positions, including army veteran and Fox News Television host Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense.Hegseth is someone who served overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned 2 Bronze Stars. Though, as some of my sources are noting tonight, when asked about this pick right off the bat, he has no prior government experience. He's now been chosen to head one of the most sprawling and critical positions in the federal government. Hegseth, is someone you may remember, as an outspoken voice who was initially noticed by Trump, according to my sources, years ago when he was on Fox News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS WEEKEND\" CO-HOST: We're not going to left -- we can let the left come over, control, and destroy our country. These charges were crafted to completely disable Trump. That's exactly why all of these indictments are happening now. Make Trump look like a criminal, then next year in 2024, trap the leading Republican in court. When I was reporting for Fox &amp; Friends yesterday morning on the ground, I said a couple of times, you know, this feels like a constitutional tinderbox. Mail-in-ballots, ballot harvesting, going past the constitutional prerogatives of state legislatures, that option has been taken from them too. And so what do what do folks expect to happen? This is the result of, you know, a frustration that a lot of people feel that I frankly wasn't surprised. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The pair that you see here has now been tasked with slashing regulations and restructuring government agencies. But as you know, there are still a lot of questions this hour over how that's going to work because they will not be government employees, based on what we have heard and what this sounds like, and it won't actually be a government agency, which is something that would require congressional approval. All of this is coming, though, after Trump said earlier he had picked former Congressman and the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, as the next CIA director. Also have new reporting tonight about one position that has been at the forefront of Trump's choices that remains unsolved tonight, that we have not gotten any announcements about, and that's the job of attorney general. Now Trump has thought about who he would install at the Department of Justice if he won reelection for months. But now after he has met with several candidates at his Palm Beach Club, the incoming President, I am told, is still wrestling with his decision about who to put in that job. Trump has solicited the opinions of those in his inner circle at Mar- a-Lago. He's been making phone calls, I'm told, on the matter. He even met with at least one candidate today. But Trump has yet to come to a decision, mainly because he has not encountered anyone that he feels checks all the boxes that he's looking for. A source told me earlier, really, right now, Trump has no favorites. Of course, he was most irritated with his two that he picked the last time he was in office, and that's why he's putting so much emphasis on this choice tonight. My inside source tonight is Trump's longest serving National Security Adviser who also served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations before that, John Bolton joins me now. And, Ambassador, it's great to have you here. Just we are just getting this Pete Hegseth announcement. What is your initial reaction, for him in the role as the next Secretary of the Department of Defense?",

I do think this is a loyalty choice or really the better word we should be using is fealty choice, that Trump feels perfectly comfortable that, Pete Hegseth will do what he asks him to do.And that puts in the spotlight why along with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense position will be one of the most critical in a Trump administration. What will Pete Hegseth do the first time Trump tells him to put the 82nd Airborne onto the streets of Portland, Oregon? Now what I hope Pete Hegseth does overall is get a massive increase in the Defense Department budget, which we need in a, challenging world. And if they can cut the domestic spending, even more so that we don't increase the deficit, that would be important too. But I think history will judge a Hegseth's secretaryship on how much he gets the defense budget up. And with Donald Trump, you never can tell.",

That didn't work out very well. So there's no guarantee.Now the way to compliment a Hegseth's nomination is to do what Richard Nixon did in 1969. He named Mel Laird Secretary of Defense, and David Packard of the Hewlett Packard Corporation as deputy secretary. So if you get somebody from the defense industry who knows how to help fix the Department of Defense, and a lot of reforms certainly could be made in the procurement area, if nothing else, that would actually help save money that could then be plowed back into better defense programs. Whether that's what's going to happen, obviously, we don't know. And it highlights one point. For all these cabinet nominations, obviously, they're the heads of their departments, but it's going to be very important who the deputies and undersecretaries are.

It's certainly within the Trump Administration's power to get rid of the woke programs and that sort of thing. But I don't think purging generals is the way to do it. I think you do it, by taking control of the department and getting rid of the, approaches that you don't like. That's true in any government department.

I'm told he's still wrestling with this decision after meeting with several of them. He met at least one of them today, but he has yet to come to a decision on what has been one of his biggest focuses over the last several months.Joining me now is CNN's Evan Perez, who has also been following this very closely as our Senior Justice Correspondent. Evan, obviously, you know, we covered the Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr era. There's a reason Trump cares so much about who this pick is going to be and what they're going to do. What is the latest that you're hearing on this search process as its playing out? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, I think you see some of the people who are, vying for the position, who are now, like, you know, essentially, you know, going on television. You see, you know, people on, like, Mark Paoletta. You see, you know, they are all going in because they know that Donald Trump is watching television, and they want to make sure that they are at least heard. But what you heard, Kaitlan, is absolutely the truth, which is that, you know, the former President wants to make sure that he gets this pick right. And so he's getting all of this advice from outside of the Justice Department. And so, one of the things that -- like, you know, the things that he's keeping in mind is, you know, the priorities he has, which is that he wants to make sure that these, executive orders that he's going to issue on day 1, that those things are defended in court. He wants to make sure those investigations he wants to launch are being, you know, at least launched or at least being supported from the Justice Department. And so those are the things that are top of mind for the former President. And so, what we expect is that, you know, this is going to take a few more days, but you see people who are now, you know, at least making sure that the former President sees themselves, you know, as essentially auditioning for this job. Matt Whitaker was on Fox News this afternoon reemphasizing what the priorities are if he becomes the Attorney General. He was there before as an Acting Attorney General. And so we don't know where he's going to land, but the idea that this is the most important job and therefore one of the toughest jobs in the incoming administration is absolutely one of the things that I think everyone is focused on.",

But are you worried about the margins in the house given that two of your Republican colleagues have been picked to serve in Trump's administration? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Well, first, Kaitlan, let me say, President Trump made a great selection in Elise Stefanik for UN Ambassador and Mike Waltz for National Security Adviser. These are two tremendous members of congress who will do a phenomenal job in the administration. Obviously, anytime you, lose members throughout the course of a Congress, it makes it, you know, a tighter margin and we've been living through that in this Congress. We have passed a lot of bills through the house, in a divided government, that frankly, Chuck Schumer and senate Democrats refused to move. I think by having complete control in Washington with the White House, the Senate, and the House, it will make it easier to pass legislation with small majorities, but, obviously, there's very little room for error.

And frankly, hopefully, many of my Democratic colleagues do not engage in resistance 2. 0, but actually work, with House Republicans and Senate Republicans to address many of the problems that we're facing as a country. The American people spoke loud and clearly on last Tuesday that they want us to move in a different direction.",

As you know, the government spent 7 trillion in last fiscal year. Over 5 trillion of that went to health care, veterans benefits, Social Security.

My political sources on what that meeting is going to look like tomorrow tonight are former South Carolina State Representative Bakari Sellers and Republican Strategist Brad Todd. It's great to have you both here because, Bakari just looking at what this meeting is going to look like, to feel like, to sound like we'll have a pool spray at the beginning, which, for those who aren't on White House lingo, means reporters will get to go into the room. The cameras will be there, microphones will be there right at the beginning. What are you going to be watching for? BAKARI SELLERS (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Just Joe Biden's body language and tone. I believe that that Joe Biden is trying to bring back, or at least go out on many of the norms that he's known the White House to have, Washington, DC to have. It's going to be a clear dichotomy on the screen. Donald Trump is someone who, doesn't believe in any norms. He doesn't believe in any structure as we know by the fact he didn't have this meeting 4 years ago. Joe Biden is trying to show that he's dignified. But I will tell you this, you're going to have 2 men in that room, and one of them beat the other one, and the other one has this sense that he was cheated out of that race. And so it's going to be a you you're going to be able to see the egos in both of these men even through the cameras.",

Now there are 7 Americans stuck in dungeons in Gaza right now, and, I guarantee you those hostages are going to be walking and talking on American soil, or else there's going to be hell to pay, before going with Donald Trump as President. And so but Joe Biden has been supporting the Israeli people, and I hope that they will talk about that collaboration.

Now whether or not she, you know, runs for Governor of California or whether or not she's a professor or whether or not she runs for President again in 2028, whether or not she just chills with Dougie (ph) and, like, kicks her feet up and joins a couple of corporate boards.

And as we know, Ron DeSantis will be out of a job in 2 years when he's no longer governor. He's term limited. And a lot of people think that he could appoint himself or appoint a placeholder, someone like his chief of staff or, maybe the attorney general of the state for that role when he's ready to run for secretary or for senate, a place where he could, you know, potentially serve out the rest of his political career. But he learned this morning that this seat would be open. And throughout the day, it was communicated to him through allies of Trump that Lara Trump is interested in the role.

But they see him as someone who has not been loyal, you know, the way that Ric Grenell was with him for the past 8 years, whereas Marco Rubio ran against Donald Trump. You know, he actually branded the Never Trump movement really. And, they just don't see how he could pass over Ric who has been fundraising. He's very close to Melania Trump with the Log Cabin Republicans. And, there's still a little bit of a war going on. You can see it even playing out online among, the grassroots, the MAGA right saying that Trump should not be passing over Ric Grenell for Marco Rubio, and that's perhaps why there's a bit of a holdup in terms of announcing it publicly because he knows there might be some backlash from the right. COLLINS: Yeah. They seem to be hoping he could change his mind on that. What are you hearing overall though? Because with Rubio, if he is the Secretary of State pick, Mike Waltz as the National Security Adviser, the Florida congressman. I mean, I've heard from some people who in that America First world who did not see that being the prevailing world view coming out of Trump's top picks. They thought it would be much more explosive in the sense of this very much America First, maybe not typical picks.
