      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with a major development in the war in Gaza. After months of intense fighting, Israel says it is withdrawing its ground forces from the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel described the area as a major Hamas stronghold and it put together its biggest ever military division for the operation there as the city became a key battleground in what is now a six-month war. We're also so learning that Israel's planned reopening of the Erez Border crossing in the north of Gaza is being delayed. It would have allowed more aid to flow into Gaza. Today's developments follow a call last week between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sources tell CNN during that call, President Biden gave Netanyahu a list of things he wanted to see done to ease the human suffering in Gaza. And it all comes as Israel marks a grim milestone, it has now been exactly six months since Hamas attacked. The Gaza ministry of health says more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war. We've got full coverage for you, Priscilla Alvarez in Washington. Nic Robertson in Jerusalem, and Ben Wedeman in Beirut. Hello to all of you, Priscilla, you first, what more we learning about this call that happened between Biden and Netanyahu.",

In fact, it was only put on the books after the deaths of those World Central Kitchen employees earlier in the week. And now sources are telling us a little more about what unfolded during that 30-minute call between the two leaders. President Biden had asked, are requested that there be changes in Israel's war against Hamas.For example, opening up a crossing in Northern Gaza, as well as a port for humanitarian aid and ramping up supplies. Now, a person familiar with the call said that the response by the Israeli prime minister sure. To all of that was that it was going to get done. But President Biden went even further saying that it needed to be announced by the evening, and that is in fact what we saw these really security cabinet approved those message of -- those measures are hours after the call. And up until this point, the White House has welcomed what they have seen on the ground, but they also note that it can't be the end of it. National security spokesperson John Kirby talks about all of this earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're bringing them out for recuperation to prepare for whatever their next assignment might be.So the Israeli government is saying while they're pulling them out, the war is by no means done. And in fact, we were close to where they were pulled out. We saw dozens of tanks and armored fighting vehicles, scores of them in a field. The troops had already been bused away to take a break. But down at the border fence wire where we were and Palestinians inside of Khan Younis reporting still aerial strikes, their bombs, being dropped in that area, which we could see and we can see those explosions we can hear the fighter jets. We could see the detonation. So while the troops have been pulled out and it's a significant withdrawal which potentially, potentially can have an impact on the negotiations said are expected to continue. [14:05:03] Again, the very slow negotiations, by the way, they expected continue again involving the head of the CIA, the head of Mossad, the head of Egyptian intelligence, the Qatari prime minister who the Qataris, the Egyptians also talking with Hamas separately, could -- could potentially bring about some change towards agreement on ceasefire. But what's happened by no means goes to what Hamas has been talking about. You wouldn't expect it at this stage. But the Israeli defense force, making very, very clear they're keeping a substantial force in the north of Gaza, the 162nd division, the Nahal brigade as well. So there's a very big four, seven again, close the border in the north, we can hear detonations and gunfire going on at the Erez Crossing where the Israelis say they don't have the logistics in place yet for supplies to go through. I would just add one small sub detail to that. We've seen in the last few minutes on social media platform X, that COGAT the Israeli body that oversees aid trucks into Gaza. They say they've set a record today of 322 aid trucks going into Gaza. These would be by the southern crossings and they say 70 percent of those 228 contained food. This is not something -- these are not figures. We've had run down by and confirmed by the U.N., yet.",

In the English version, it starts talking about readiness for the transition, from defense to offense. In Arabic, the translation is preparing to move from defense to attack.Now when you go down further in the text, they're talking about both in English and in Arabic about putting the equipment and having the personnel in place should the need arise. But what we've seen certainly in recent days is that for instance, yesterday, Hezbollah managed to shoot down what's known as a Hermes 900 drone. That is a drone that -- it's an attack drone, but it has the capacity to collect and relay information, a very powerful, sophisticated drone that Hezbollah took down with the surface to air missile. Earlier we heard of before the weekend that for instance, the Israelis had canceled the all leaves for combat units, and it also called up reserves for air defense units. So certainly attention seems to be a building particularly in the aftermath of last Monday's Israeli attack on the run-in embassy. But we did hear from the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah that the response will come from Iran. So there's tension all around of a possibly run in response to Israel and also of hostilities, increased hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel -- Fredricka.",

They did some preemptive power outages, like Camila was saying ahead of the event to help cushion that blow a little bit.But here's a look at some of the wind gusts from yesterday, 96 miles per hour. White Ranch, Colorado, 91 miles per hour. In Buckeye, 88 miles per hour. And rocky Flats, even in parts of Oklahoma, 61 mile per hour wind. So, very intense winds with this system. We've had high wind warnings in place since yesterday, but they're starting to get dropped as those wins relax a little bit and the rest of these alerts will expire later on in the day as the winds continue to lose though light enough. So you can see that we could still find gusts 30 to 40 miles per hour through the early parts of the afternoon today are across some of these Plain States and Colorado, but look at how things really calmed down as we go into the day today and then into tomorrow, the winds do really start to relax with that dry air in place.

It was tragic to have seven aid workers in three vehicles that were marked as aid vehicles targeted and killed by the IVF.But this is not the first or only time the IDF has been trigger happy and careless. You know, they killed three Israeli hostages who were speaking Hebrew and waving white flags. They've killed people seeking shelter in churches and mosques and refugee camps and hospitals. This is unacceptable behavior and there has to be accountability. And Jose Andres made another point, Palestinians are entitled to their own homeland. The official policy of the United States government is that we favor a two-state solution. The problem is the Israeli government opposes a two-state solution. We do not share the same long-term goals. That has to be rectified. And so I applaud President Biden for coming down hard on Bibi Netanyahu, and insisting that the United States is prepared to condition future aid, if certain conditions are not met in terms of humanitarian relief, in terms of civilian casualties, and in terms ultimately of the long-range solution, which has to be an independent state for the Palestinian people. WHITFIELD:  Do you think it's possible to -- and using your words -- to rectify this issue, if the U.S. is on board with a two-state solution however, Israel, under the current administration does not. If there is not that that goal, that is shared how in the world can there be any rectifying of these issues?",

We have a ten-year $3.8 billion a year military arrangement now. And we are pouring billions of dollars in supplemental military assistance to help Israel with its own military capability and defend itself.We have a right to say to that partner that we have concerns and those concerns not only need to be respected, but frankly they need to be given very serious consideration by the Netanyahu government. So far, we've gotten the back of a hand from Netanyahu. That that is an unacceptable -- a proposition is an unacceptable basis for a relationship. And Israel has to understand, the current Israeli government has to understand. It is putting the U.S. relationship in serious peril if it continues to ignore the grave concerns were raised about half the Palestinian population.",

For South Carolina, they're trying to have a perfect season with the national championship going undefeated if they win up tonight, and for Iowa led by Caitlin Clark, of course, this would be the first national no championship that they would bring home to Iowa.Now listen, Iowa came off of that such nail-biting game against UConn right here on this court. It's possible they're going to be a little tired as they face the Gamecocks led by Dawn Staley. Of course, they have some spreadable depths to their bench. They got some taller players, which Iowa doesn't have. So it's going to be such an exciting game to watch. And remember that last game on Friday night, those broke audience records as you just mentioned. But listen the anticipation with even building for the practices both these teams held to practice on Saturday as you practice in front of us, sold out arena here. So this is just an incredibly exciting again. We're happy to be here. And, of course, we will see soon who is the national championships were one of the most exciting women's basketball season yet -- Fred. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I think also the world we got to know now her last year during the during the NCAA tournament, but she was a great high school player, you know?

She's very close to her family. She's very close to her friends that she grew up with and I'm sure that that is helpful in quieting some of that noise and blob that's always around her.

She pointed out that her life has been miserable. I really felt bad for her and I love the fact that a teammates came up and spoke on how behalf again, she invited some of the scrutiny, no doubt, but she didn't invite it to the degree that she received it.
