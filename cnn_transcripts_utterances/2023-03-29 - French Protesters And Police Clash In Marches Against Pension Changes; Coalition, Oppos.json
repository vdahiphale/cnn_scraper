The French Interior Ministry estimates more than 700,000 people participated in the protests. A lower number, though, than demonstrations earlier this month.

The alliance between Israel and the United States is unbreakable and always overcomes the occasional disagreements between us. My administration is committed to strengthening democracy by restoring the proper balance between the three branches of government which we are striving to achieve via broad consensus. Israel is a sovereign country which makes its decision by the will of its people. Here's the direct part, and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends. Now, Paula, there is a lot to unpack there. Let's start with his reference to occasional disagreements. I think it's pretty clear that this is more much bigger than just an occasional disagreement, given how direct and how strong Biden spoke. And also the prime minister made a reference to the will of the people. Well, the will of the people, there are some real questions as to whether Netanyahu would win an election if it was held today.

That's a kind of a crazy route to go.Israel has had a long history of rejecting the involvement of foreign countries, particularly on the left, mostly countries from the European Union, getting involved in issues about Palestinians on the West Bank and so forth. So Netanyahu's picking up an old trope here that over to the international community, once again meddling in our affairs.

He has allowed the issue to take over his administration. It's the issue of Yariv Levine, who is the Minister of justice, and Simcha Rothman, who is the Chairman of the Constitution and Law and Justice Committee at the Knesset.I don't think that Bibi himself is as diehard committed to these issues as they are, but he cares about them. Many Israelis do think that there is room for some judicial reform. I'm talking about Israelis in the center. Some Israelis on the Academic Left recognized that the Israeli Supreme Court under Justice Aharon Barakin the 1990s became a rather activist government and had taken for itself tremendous liberties in terms of the kinds of issues that it would get involved in. So many people think that there actually is room here for some real judicial reform if it's done slowly, if it's done as a process of national conversation, and if it doesn't go too far. The analogies to the United States, which is another game that Netanyahu and his colleagues have been playing, of course, is a very silly analogy. The United States has a bicameral Congress. It's got the House, it's got the Senate. Israel has a unicameral Knesset. There's only one body in the Knesset. In the Knesset, the Legislative and Executive branches are essentially wrapped up into one the ruling party and the Prime Minister.

The incident happened in Juarez, and that is just across the border from El Paso, Texas.There's new video now showing the moment the flames and smoke spread throughout that facility. CNN's Rafael Romo has the latest, and a warning his report contains graphic content. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): One by one, Mexican soldiers pull people out of the building. It quickly becomes tragically clear there's nothing they can do for some of them anymore. Mexican officials say more than three dozen migrants, mainly from Central and South America, died at this detention center after a fire swept through the building late Monday. Surveillance video from inside the detention center, obtained by CNN, shows how quickly the flames spread throughout the holding area after inmates set mattresses on fire. It also appears to show that those detained were behind bars with the gate locked. Calling the fire regrettable and sad, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said. The fire started Monday at 930 in the evening, hours before officials say 71 migrants living on the streets of Ciudad Juarez had been taken to the shelter. The president added that the fires started after the migrants found out they were going to be deported. As a protest, the president said, the migrants put mattresses from the shelter against its door and set them on fire. They never imagined this was going to cause this terrible accident, he said. As first responders tried to save victims at the shelter, family members desperately tried to get any news from their loved ones outside the building. They're not telling us anything, this woman said. A relative of yours may die and they don't tell you anything at all. We've seen they've been pulling people out and we have no idea if they're alive or not, this man said. Ambulances have left one after the other and we know nothing. And they give us no information. Located across the border from El Paso, Texas, Ciudad Juarez is a transit point where many immigrants from different parts of the world arrive daily, hoping to cross the Rio Grande to seek asylum in the United States. ROMO (on camera): As it has been the case with other border towns in Mexico, there have been multiple riots and tense situations in the last few years due to the fact that there aren't enough shelters that can accommodate all of these migrants and many end up living on the streets. ROMO (voiceover): Through a statement, the Guatemalan government says 28 of its citizens were among the dead. Irregular migration, the statement said, carries with it a number of risks that have once again become evident. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we've seen successive administrations try to -- just try to hold that back to stop these increases we've seen at the border. And I think what the United States needs to do as a nation is perhaps set limits on asylum and rethink whether we want to continue to have this type of asylum system that has no caps like other forms of visas or other work permits do. There are set numbers for refugees. Asylum is not constructed that way. And secondly, the administration must tackle the incredible backlog we have on asylum cases. Right now it takes about 4.3 years start to finish for an asylum case to be adjudicated. Now, anyone possibly see that as a functional system.

Wesa's support for girls' education is happening in a country where the Taliban have banned girls and women from high school and universities. And of course, that's just one of the draconian restrictions imposed on women since the Taliban returned to power almost two years ago. Now a newly released human rights report from Amnesty International notes that Afghanistan is the only country in the world that bans girls from secondary school and women who have protested have been dealt with severely. Despite all this, our next guest says it is time to try and re-engage with the Taliban. Mahbooba Siraj is a Nobel peace prize nominee and the executive director of the Afghan Women's Skills Development Center. She is also the subject of the upcoming film titled \"The Noble Guardian\". I want you to take a listen.

I really don't know how long that country can go on like this. How long we can go on the way we are, how long the girls can be in Afghanistan and their homes locked up and not being able to do their education. That is not going to -- this is not the right way to go.

This is the drill that North Korea always reacts to the idea of American and South Korean marines storming a beach on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang sees this as a dress rehearsal for an invasion. Now, the South Korean and American line has always been that this is defensive in nature. 2,500 U.S. marines and sailors, 3,000 South Korean marines and sailors working together on one large scale joint drill.

We gained rare access behind the scenes of this training, flying out to the U.S. amphibious assault ship, the USS Makin Island. On the back of North Korean missile launches and disputed claims of simulated underwater nuclear weapons tests, this is a drill that will be watched carefully in Pyongyang.

The pair left the U.K. in 2021 in part over what he described as the toxic British media. This is just one of several suits that Harry has brought against British newspapers. Harry's teenage years and early relationships were blighted by the newspapers invasion of privacy, according to his legal team. In the court documents seen by the press association, his lawyer says suspicion and paranoia was caused by Associated Publication of the unlawful articles. Friends were lost or cut off as a result and everyone became a suspect. The lawyers representing Harry and several other claimants said in a statement last year that the crimes they alleged in the lawsuit quote \"represent the tip of the iceberg\" and that many other innocent people remain unknowing victims of similar terrible and reprehensible covert acts.
