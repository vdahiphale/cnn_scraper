All of the placement of things, all the colors, all the furniture is all very intentional to be able to build the best space that we can for the kids. Many have experienced terrible tragedies, rape, murder, harassment, kidnapping, domestic violence. Schools are the way to be able to help them heal and also help them prepare for what their life is going to be like. I want to prevent as much heartache for the kids that I experienced. My family's case is the case of many refugees and migrants. It was never a choice to leave our home. When we arrived in the United States, I became a very quiet child. I started finding my way through being involved in the school. Anytime I get a chance I share my immigration story. There's always that switch that happens in their eyes. Being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of. This is a moment in your life. This is not your entire life. This is a crisis that's not going to stop anytime soon.

For Adam Pearce that moment came on New Year's Eve in 2009 when a friend called and said that his brother Kevin, a world-class and Olympic-bound snowboarder, had hit his head on a halfpipe. Adam raced across the country, quit his job, and became Kevin's full-time caregiver, helping him learn how to walk, talk and reconnect his brain and body to the life that he loved. About two years into Kevin's difficult recovery they took a yoga class and something shifted in that class for Kevin and they decided to figure out why and how to help others. In 2014 Adam co-founded the Love Your Brain Foundation, which offers free training courses and classes in yoga, retreats for patients and their caregivers, and contributes to new research about the brain. To date they have supported more than 34,000 patients and their caregivers. That's comfort and connection for those who know what it's like to receive that terrifying call, and to those who struggle to find a way forward where they can begin to believe that this new life will be OK.

She was an outdoor-loving camper one moment and the next having a stroke in her shower.After being hooked up to machines for months, they discharged her in a wheelchair, with a traumatic brain injury. They declared her unable to work. Coming from a military family, which instilled a sense of true service for her, Stacey fought back the suicidal despair, and she worked with a local agency to get a job at the VA Medical Center. On her way to and from this truly life-saving work, Stacey saw homeless veterans behind the strip mall. One day she handed a woman a hygiene packet, and the woman tossed it back to her and said, I'm homeless, where am I supposed to shower? Stacey knew where, her jeep. Because of her love of camping, it had a shower hookup. And that's when Stacey started Off-Road Outreach. And Off-Road Outreach provides dozens of homeless veterans each week with showers, fresh produce, clothing, and also connects them to services. Life hit Stacey hard. But she's up. She's showing her city how to give back, and she is literally showering it with her love. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STACEY BUCKNER, OFF-ROAD OUTREACH: A lot of these veterans, they are deep in the woods. I have several veterans that I've actually been looking for that got displaced. It's not that they don't want to be found. They don't want to be in the public eye. Hey, what's up, baby? How you doing? Gaining trust is really, really important. We didn't have the half sizes, so we got the next full size. It takes boots on the ground to get back there, find them, and meet their needs. Coming out of the hospital with a traumatic brain injury, I had a stutter. No one wanted to hire me. You wonder, why are you still here? But I just thought, you know, God did not put me here to be living that same life I was living before. Eventually, I did find a community resource for adults with disabilities. They took a chance on me. I saw a gap in services for homeless veterans, and I just thought, you know, I can do something about that. Let me know when you're ready and I'll start the shower, OK? We provide clothing, food. There's a full kitchen in the back. We also do laundry. Your pants are almost done spinning, baby. For veterans, we do wrap around services.",
