He has appeared on camera two times.And by stressing, we mean we're going to get boots in the woods, we're going to let him know we're there, we're going to leave no rock unturned, we're going to check every little hiding spot, and should we miss him, we're going to go back in again the next day and try to keep him moving. One of the tactics we did use, like you mentioned earlier, was we elicited a statement from his mother. And she said, essentially, we love you, do the right thing, turn yourself in, we don't want to see you get hurt. And that was broadcast to him over a loudspeaker from the Pennsylvania State Police helicopter and some of our patrol cars.

So, I think we're all incredibly lucky, and certainly that homeowner and his family is, that it didn't go that way. But that could happen at any moment in any one of these days that this search continues. It seems that he is moving at night and probably laying low during the day, which would be the smart way to do it, but he has got to keep repeating this activity of trying to supply himself with sustenance and some level of shelter. It is a very wooded area with large homes on large pieces of property surrounded by woodlands and manicured lawns and things like that. So, there's plenty of places for him to hide. The simple fact that he was able to get beyond their announced perimeter into kind of the next section south of that area tells you that his sense of movement has not been impeded yet.

The president has made clear that he doesn't want this trial to go forward anytime soon and he's going to do everything he can to throw sand in the gears, the former president, and slow this thing down and make motions and try to get, you know, appeals rolling. He's going to have a very hard time doing that, but he will try and throw everything he can at that. Now, I think this whole Chesebro move and Sidney Powell seeking a rapid trial, speedy trial, is going to cause problems as well because now that they've moved forward, they have to have their trial done under Georgia law or begin by a date certain in early November.

Good to see you both tonight, gentlemen.I got to say, congresswoman, I'll begin with you, look, he's going all in on the economy on the NFL opener. Not sure people want to see that. Maybe they want to see Doritos commercials. I just don't really know. But the truth of the matter is there's a new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll that finds only 37% of voters approve of his actual handling of the economy. He is out of slogan, right, Bidenomics. Can he actually win without turning that 37% number around?",

Bakari, on that notion of trying to sell it, trying to convince people, I mean, is this as something as reductive as, look, the Democrats have got to be better on messaging, or is there something more here? I mean, the U.S. has seen inflation and unemployment drop during Biden's first term. They also saw some historic highs because of COVID disruption. So, the convincing part of things, how does he do a better job of convincing people to feel that things are getting better?",

It was a global problem that we saw the Inflation Reduction Act. We saw the infrastructure bill bipartisan, both pieces of legislation. We've seen Bidenomics actually work.Now, this is not going to be a national election either. And so, Joe Biden has to sell this message in Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, those states which are going to drive the electoral college. And even more specifically, he's going to have to drive this message to African American voters, particularly African American men and Hispanic voters because while criminal justice reform and all of these other things may be of what some of his white progressive vendors may tell him, we do know that economics matters to these subgroups as well. You have to drill down on, you know, pocketbook issues. And I believe he has a message to tell. He has a story to tell. But I think Adam would agree with me on this point, that you can't tell that story from 1600 Pennsylvania. You literally have to get out on the road. You have to pound the pavement. You have to kiss the babies and shake the hands and do all of those things that politicians are notoriously known to do. And he's going to have to allow -- people around him are going to have to allow Joe Biden to be Joe Biden. That comes with faux pas and mistakes and all. But he's going to have to sell this message outside of D.C.",

But also, one big hurdle, of course, here, when you get to the policy aspect of it, and congressman, you know, in order to convince voters is one thing, but then it's getting voters to have their votes counted and how the districts are actually drawn such that it might be advantageous for you to do so or not.You know, tonight, Alabama is appealing a decision from a federal court that blocked the state's congressional map after that state failed to create a second majority black district -- from the Supreme Court's order, by the way. Why do you think Alabama is not following the court's instruction? I mean, is it a matter of, look, the Supreme Court just not respected in the same way or that they can time this out, game this out, and be able to get past the election?",

When we've gotten to where Donald Trump, frankly, has gotten us to a point where the rule of law is kind of minimized, it is now not a big deal to basically ignore a court order. And that's a frightening thing to me. And so, look, I think there's got to be real -- I'll say redistricting reform in this country. Let's be honest, it's not going to happen anytime soon in most places. I'm a victim of it from the Democrats, by the way, twice. But yeah, I think you've got to follow through on what the courts say. They're just going to keep running the clock. This is really bad for democracy.",

The motion now comes about six months after he was convicted in the 2021 murders of his wife Maggie and his son Paul.Now, according to the filing, the clerk of the court, Rebecca \"Becky\" Hill, allegedly tampered with the jury by advising jurors not to believe Murdaugh's testimony. They're also alleging that she pressured the jury to reach a quick guilty verdict and claimed she misrepresented information to the judge in order to remove a juror. Now, Murdaugh's attorneys claim that Hill did all these things. Why? Well, to secure herself a book deal, they say -- quote -- \"in media appearances that would not happen in the event of a mistrial\" -- unquote. Her book is called \"Behind the Doors of Justice: The Murdaugh Murders.\" It was published in late July. Now, lawyers were also saying that in the motion along with at least three sworn affidavits, including one from a juror and another from a dismissed juror. Earlier today, Murdaugh's attorneys explained how they say that book I just mentioned led to this new filing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Listen to what they said.Quote -- \"that she had told the jury not to be fooled by the evidence presented by Mr. Murdaugh's attorneys. She also allegedly instructed the jury to watch him closely immediately before he testified, including look at his actions and look at his movements, which understood they thought to mean that he was guilty.\" So, if that's true, how shocking is this?",

Many watched the trial. Many were riveted by the trial, lasting six weeks in surprise, and perhaps none really surprised at a three-hour verdict.But the reality is that you have to have a jury that is locked in on the evidence, making conclusions and drawing those conclusions on the evidence without any undue influence from the outside. And when that undue influence comes from an elected clerk, allegedly, it presents a significant problem. So, I suspect that the judge will at a minimum hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there's any meat to these allegations. And if so, we could indeed see a new trial for Mr. Murdaugh, who we see there.",
