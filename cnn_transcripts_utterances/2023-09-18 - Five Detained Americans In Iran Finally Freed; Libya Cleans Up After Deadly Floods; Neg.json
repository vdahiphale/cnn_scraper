We have the very latest for you. A grim toss rescue crews in Libya are working to recover the dead after floods ravaged the port city. We have a special report from our team in Derna. And then negotiations between the United Auto Workers and automakers are ongoing, but there is no breakthrough it seems as the first strike hit all the big three drags on. But first, this evening, U.S. President Joe Biden says years of agony, uncertainty and suffering are finally over for five Americans who were imprisoned in Iran. They are right now on their way home as part of a deal that represents a breakthrough and delicate as well as indirect diplomatic negotiations. These were some of the prisoners, first steps right there towards freedom, and they came at a steep price. The U.S. not only agreed to release five Iranians who were held in American jails, but also free up $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds. The Biden administration is stressing that the money is not a ransom, it'll be used only for humanitarian purposes. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Idyllic seafront is now a staging area where they deliver the dead, but Adiza(ph) not had time to process what she survived, she's been here since last Monday preparing the dead for burial. This is the hardest thing she's ever had to do, she says. She's recognized the lifeless faces of family, friends and neighbors. \"Is this Derna, it will forever be heartbroken\", she says. \"We lost our finest, people used to come and look at our flowers, our jazz men, now they've come to a broken Derna.\" At a cemetery outside the city where more than a thousand victims have been buried in mass graves, they prepare for more. No family here, just strangers who prayed for the dead. But there is no time to stop, the bodies just keep coming. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
