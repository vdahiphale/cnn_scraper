Now we don't know exactly what he was doing, you know, where he exactly was when he was captured just a few moments ago. But we know that he had been on the run for five days. And we do have images that were just tweeted out from the Hinds County Sheriff, Tyree Jones. These are the photos of Jerry Raynes as he was taken into custody just moments ago.So now, Boris, the focus remains on the two other escaped detainees. The search for them continues. The belief is that they are still somewhere in central Mississippi. And as you also know, a fourth detainee, he was killed in a police shootout yesterday.

The whole idea here with Trump -- and this has been going all the way back to even 2016 -- he's been threatening to not be a part of debates for a very long time. And some of it is about injecting this idea that he's not going to put himself on that platform to be scrutinized, frankly.And a lot of times he does end up -- I mean, he did end up doing them. Although there were probably historically in the last two cycles fewer debates than we would normally see between general election candidates. But Trump ultimately decides to do them in part because he knows he needs the platform too. It's one of the few times in American politics when you have pretty much the entire country's undivided attention. No one likes attention more than Trump, and I think he also understands the power of that attention more than most people, so these threats are designed to kind of keep people a little bit on their toes. But I doubt that at the end of the day, he won't at all participate.",

Jean Carroll back on the stand for a second day of testimony in a New York courtroom. And she is being cross-examined now by Trump's legal team in this defamation and battery trial against the former president.Carroll alleges that Trump assaulted her in a dressing room in a department store in the 1990s. He denies the allegation. He calls it a hoax and a con job. CNN's Kara Scannell is live for us outside of the courthouse in New York. Kara, can you tell us what else E. Jean Carroll has said today. Kara Scannell, CNN correspondent: Well, Brianna, there was just a fairly intense exchange between Trump's attorney Joe Tacopina and E. Jean Carroll -- who is now in her second hour of testimony. Tacopina was focusing in on Bergdorf Goodman, where this alleged attack happened. Having E. Jean Carroll go through the attack again and asking questions at every step of the way. One area that he really focused on, was he asked her if when she was being attacked why she didn't ever scream out for help. I'm going to read you a little bit of the back and forth between them. At one point Tacopina said -- he was present her about why wasn't -- why she didn't scream. If she was really being attacked, wouldn't she scream. And she said: You can't beat me up for not screaming. He said: I'm not beating you up. I'm asking questions Ms. Carroll. Then they continued to go back and forth over whether she was screaming or should have screamed. And she said: I'm telling you he raped me whether I screamed or not. At that point her voice was cracking. She also said that, you know, the reason why many women don't come forward is because they get criticized for not screaming. Now this back and forth continued where he then asked her, so you didn't scream while you were getting violently raped because you didn't want to make a scene? And Carroll said: That's right. That's probably why I didn't scream. He then continued to go on and press her about the struggle inside of the dressing room. He said -- he pointed out to her, you were wearing 4-inch heels during this whole struggle. And she said: I can dance backwards and forwards in 4-inch heels. He pointed out that her tights. She said that she was wearing tights that Trump had pulled down before he raped her. And he pointed out to her that she said that her tights never ripped. And Carroll said, no, they never ripped. He said they were flexible tights. And he also asked her about a purse. And she said that she was hold a purse in her hand during the attack, which she estimated lasted about three minutes. And he said to her you never dropped your purse, you never put down your purse. So, he's really focusing in on every step of this alleged attack trying to find any weaknesses in her testimony or at least raise questions among the jurors' mind about what happened. You know, but this was a fairly intense exchange. They took a short break. They'll be back in about five or ten minutes from now. She'll be back on the stand answering more questions. There's about another hour left in the court testimony this afternoon -- Brianna.",
