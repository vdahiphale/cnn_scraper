And in the Senate, Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, plans to gather senators tomorrow to discuss Biden's reelection bid.

The congregation here and the church leadership was quite friendly to President Biden, acknowledging some of his debate slip-ups and saying that he should not let people question his age. One of the pastors here trying to describe President Biden as a young whipper snapper. Now, after the president spoke at this church to that predominantly-black congregation, he moved on to that campaign office where he delivered impromptu remarks. It did not appear the president was using a teleprompter as he talked with these campaign volunteers about what's at stake in this election. He said that this election will boil down to simple politics, blocking and tackling and also argued that he has seen enthusiasm in the days since his debate. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's mac and cheese and brisket being served already. We're in a union house courtyard basically. And we see a lot of supporters behind the camera, more filing in around here. And again, it's all part of that show of force that Arlette described in this crucial state of Pennsylvania. And specifically this particular prevent is pitched by the campaign as more of a casual, informal, unscripted event. You can see behind me this is where the president is expected to speak. There are no teleprompters up there behind me. It's all to put him in these situations to ease concern after that debate just a few weeks ago. But first I want to describe why this location and really the larger trip here in Pennsylvania is so particularly important. We're in Dauphin County, right? This is where Harrisburg is and Dauphin County, Philadelphia; Allegheny County where Pittsburgh is, Joe Biden if he wants to win the state of Pennsylvania again, he really has to juice the numbers in these particular areas. But Fred, it's interesting, not only is Dauphin County important but the campaign told me that some of the other areas that are perhaps redder adjacent to Dauphin County think Lancaster County, think Cumberland County. If the Biden campaign wants to be on offense and wants to play in trying to chip away at some of the Trump support there, I was in Lancaster County last week and I spoke to a volunteer who said yes, you might know it because it's where a lot of Amish folks live. But there are younger people who are more progressive, more Democratic leaning coming into these areas. We want to turn them into Biden voters. So that's kind of the overarching theme that we're hearing in this most recent trip to Pennsylvania. We all started from the governor's office. The governor is expected to meet with the president. That's Josh Shapiro, very popular in the state. But we shall see how he does here and these unscripted events in just about an hour, Fred.",

Basically, the parliament now, if these projections are right that were seeing, is it going to be divided into approximately one-third, one-third, one-third -- the far left the center, and the right.And the one thing that President Macron succeeded at was basically keeping the far-right out of power. That was one of the goals of throwing the election. But even so, it's going to make it very difficult to govern because you have three blocs that are going to be competing for power. None of them have an absolute majority. The relative majority goes to the far- left coalition. It's a loose coalition of parties that go from extremists on the very far left to center left. And it's so -- such a loose coalition that they can't even decide who the prime minister would be if they come to power. They have to have 289 seats to come to power, they have 192, which that's the highest score anybody had in terms of possible seats in the projection. So it's real massive in terms of governing. But in terms of what the goal was from Emmanuel Macron and in terms of keeping the far right out of the power, it seems to be that he succeeded at his gamble, Fred.",

His latest book, \"A Red Line in the Sand\" is available right now. All right. David, wow, this is interesting.

You know, it is certainly, as Jim said, he's quite right, it could very well prove to be a hung parliament.But what's really interesting I find is what happened to the far right. It basically collapsed. They basically -- they don't even have barely a third of the seats in parliament. You know, it's is very interesting, I've covered the far-right, the Marine Le Pen and her father Jean-Marie Le Pen back to the 1980s when they first emerged. They have never gotten past about a third of the vote. That's about all there is left in France who are prepared to vote for the extreme right who are basically bringing back what's left perhaps of Vichy or you know, Nazi, or what have you., rule. They can't see taking their country and turning it over to them again. So they don't ever get much more than about a third of the vote in the first round or in the second round for that matter. So the result is they're often just squeezed out. They are apparently, from what I can see from French television on my other screen here, they look like they are just shocked and they should be. Actually they shouldn't be, they should really understand what's going on. But look, it's the highest turnout since 1981 in terms of elections, the French people are riveted by this.",

In a sense, turning it over to just say Donald Trump perhaps. It works in France, because it's not something that really the French people had even really contemplated before this last set of elections. Look, what's going to happen right now, I think is we have 18 days until July 18th -- less than 18 days -- July 18. That is when the new parliament convenes and that's when a new precedent to the parliament -- effectively the majority leader has to be chosen or the speaker should we say the speaker of the house. That's when they have to be -- that's the first going to be the real test of who actually holds the power here and that's a very important moment because what we have to see is the left -- the so-called left includes everybody from the Green Party. And you know, sort of the center left, all the way over to the far left, the communist. Some of these are going to be able to be peeled away by ensemble (ph), which is Macron's Party, to form some kind of a, a majority of sorts. But it's going to be a majority that goes from issue to issue, from vote to vote. So in any given moment, perhaps the budget in the fall, or perhaps some other major education the program or whatever, it comes before the national assembly. If that's voted down the government gets a vote of no confidence and they had to start all over again. Macron has to put together a new government, a new prime minister. (CROSSTALKING)",

You can see all of that lightning over Houston, 55 (ph) mile per hour winds in the center of the circulation. We're also finding that this satellite image has been looking much more organized over the day. When I was doing some reports this morning, 6:00 a.m. the satellite kind of looks like a mess. So it is very much intensifying and organizing pretty quickly. The radar again, like I said, you've got outer bands that are coming on with heavy rain, lots of lightning, any of these that have little isolated thunderstorms could rotate. We have a tornado threat as we go into the afternoon and evening with this. Wind gusts are starting to pick up. You have got wind gusts getting up to 32 miles per hour in Galveston, 30 miles per hour in Corpus Christi and we'll continue to find the core of these very intense hurricane force winds swirling onto the coast overnight night tonight and into tomorrow.

That's how warm these ocean temperatures are. Hurricane warnings are in effect. You've got tropical storm warnings stretching as far north as Houston and then even farther inland for these very intense winds. We're looking at these winds up to, you know, 75 miles per hour, getting in pretty deep, again the chance of tropical storm-force winds increasing, including places like Houston, Galveston. This red is the hurricane-force conditions near Matagorda Bay that are possible. This will churn some storm surge talking about up to six feet possible. This is dangerous and life-threatening.

You recall about a month ago or so, President Biden too much fanfare made this announcement that Israel had signed up to the ceasefire proposal, and that Hamas was -- just down to Hamas to accept it.Now, up until the last couple of days. And when beheaded confirmed from the senior Hamas official, Hamas was still insisting on a full Israeli ceasefire, a full cessation of hostilities before embarking on the first phase of this multi-face ceasefire for hostage release deal. It now seems that Hamas is entertaining the possibility of no longer sticking to that point, and that would seem to remove one of the main obstacles for this deal going forward. And that is perhaps one of the main reasons why optimism is surging perhaps to its highest level since the first ceasefire took place, all those months ago, back in November. And today, of course, a very symbolic day, that its nine months to the day since the Hamas terrorist attacks. And since those are hundred and 16 people who were still believed to be in captivity, about a third of whom are dead were kidnapped. Now from Israel's perspective, we also heard in the last hour from Prime Minister Netanyahu, putting out a statement saying that its thanks to his insistence on going ahead with the Rafah ground operation, despite criticism from the U.S. administration and others, pleading with Israel not to go forward. Netanyahu saying that that is why Hamas is now -- is now effectively reneging on its previous red line on insisting on a full cessation of hostilities, Netanyahu also outlining four points including that Israel should have the right to go back to fighting after the initial ceasefire, also insisting as the terms for, as the price for Israel doing a deal, but there'll be no returns says Netanyahu of armed terrorist to the northern Gaza Strip, no smuggling from Egypt of arms from Egypt into the Gaza Strip to Hamas. And finally, that is throw will maximize the number of live living hostages that would be released as part of this ceasefire agreements. So as I say, Fredricka optimism possibly at its highest level since the last ceasefire in November on what is the nine month anniversary from those Hamas-led terrorist attacks.",

But now, there are new signs of hope from hard science on lifestyle interventions to earlier detection and intervention.There are new tools to battle this disease. In a documentary called \"THE LAST ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT\", airing tonight on CNN, chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta looks at Mike Carver, a man who seemingly reversed early onset Alzheimer's. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  It's a pretty incredible story, Mike Carver. He was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's in his mid 60s. He's now in his early 70s and living a pretty normal life. I mean, that is not typically what you hear when someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. You expect that there's not a lot that can be done. Maybe you can slow down the progression. But the idea that he was able to actually reverse some of the signs of cognitive impairment as you heard from him and his wife, that's pretty extraordinary. Now, one thing I'll point out as you look at what the clinical trial entailed was just how quickly these changes happen for him. He was big meat eater, but when out of vegan diet, 30 minutes of exercise, daily, three times a week of strength training one hour daily stress relief, and three times a week of these online hourly support sessions. That's a lot or not that much depending on your perspective. But he was able to do it and he saw the benefits. And again within 20 weeks, within five months, it just speaks to how biodynamic the body is. It can get bad pretty quickly, but it can also improve pretty quickly as well. At the same time that you hearing about these new trials on lifestyle changes, there has been some new developments with regard to medications as well. Another medication improves approved by the FDA, Donanemab. To give you some context here was about a, 29 percent slowing of cognitive decline with these medications. But there were also potential side effects, 37 percent brain bleeding in the Donanemab group versus 14 percent in the placebo group. And then there is the price tag of these medications. I mean, it's mind numbing sometimes I think about $4 trillion we spend on health care every year. The numbers that you see on their screen, tens of thousands of dollars for these drugs are surely going to add to that. And that's part of the reason it was so exciting to see the results of this early lifestyle intervention. We've known for a long time lifestyle interventions can reverse heart disease. People didn't believe it at first, but now it's well known. We're starting to see that same enthusiasm for lifestyle changes impact on brain disease. So very excited about the documentary film and hope you get a chance to watch it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
