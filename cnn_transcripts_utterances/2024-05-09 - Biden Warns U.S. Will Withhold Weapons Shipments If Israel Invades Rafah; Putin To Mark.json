And that is what we are seeing at the moment right now.We are also seeing pictures from the ground, which shows the devastation of some of those airstrikes, and frankly, they're pretty hard to watch, whether it's people running with children in their arms, some looking semi-conscious or unconscious or bleeding. And then inside the hospitals there, it looks like absolute chaos. We also know that people are on the move at last count, there were 50,000 or so people confirmed to have moved out of Rafah. And there's also one hospital, the biggest one in Rafah that is effectively in the line of fire and has been emptied out and shut down for the moment at least. It's been relocated now to a central part of the city, in obviously much more makeshift conditions that they're working in. They don't have the specialties. They don't have an ICU. They don't have the same number of doctors working there as well. There are two other smaller hospitals that are operating. But again, they are all only partially operating at the moment. And so the again, going back to the shipment of weapons, the U.S. is trying to make clear that look, it doesn't support any kind of operation, large scale operation in Rafah, when they don't have a plan, at least in the US's version how the U.S. sees things.
