I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, breaking news this hour, just moments ago, you watch it live right here on CNN, the House voted to pass a short term funding bill that will keep the U.S. government open for 45 days. That bill includes disaster -- natural disaster aid but does not include funding for Ukraine or the border. The last minute Hail Mary from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy seems to have worked in the House but the shutdown has not yet been averted. It is now up to the U.S. Senate to pass this proposal. Let's get right to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. Manu, what is the latest you now outside position to talk to anybody who comes and goes what's being said.",

      "sentences": "Look, this is a frantic day that government shutdown could be now averted after Republicans reverse course. Speaker McCarthy capitulated after indicating for some time that he would not move forward with the government funding bill if it didn't cut spending, if it also if it didn't include funding for border security measures.But he ultimately was forced to do so even though this bill passed with a significant amount of Republican opposition, even though more than half of his conference did support it the final vote of the 335 voting yes, 91 voting no. Ninety of those were Republicans who voted no One Democrat Mike Quigley of Illinois who voted against it because it did not have Ukraine funding. But one of the things that lawmakers were saying, I appreciate it. He's trying to get this -- trying to interrupt my live shot here. But there has been a lot of opposition from some of those conservative hardliners who warned against cutting a deal and working with Democrats. That's what they were saying to Speaker McCarthy. Don't cut a deal with Democrats. Don't rely on Democratic votes. But this is exactly what happened here on the House floor. And that is one reason why there's concern among McCarthy's allies that there could be a vote in a matter of days to try to oust him from the speakership. I had a chance to catch up with some of these members about whether or not they're going to push for his ouster. Many of them are not saying when it'll come down quite yet, even though they expressed dissatisfaction with the Speaker over his handling of the spending talks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO): I have confidence in the way this place is supposed to operate. And that's what we should have pushed for, 12 individual spending bills. This bipartisan muscle memory of governing by continuing resolutions and omnibus bills needs to come to an end. But it shows that the UNA party is alive and well. And there are too many members here who are comfortable doing things the way they've been done since the mid-90s. And that's why we're sitting at $33 trillion in debt. That's why I have constituents who are frustrated because they can't afford gas in their car because they can't afford the high cost of living. The mortgage rates where they're at because of this inflation and the reckless spending that comes right here from Washington, D.C. So this is something that we have got to get under control. We should have forced the Senate to take up the four appropriations bills that the House has passed. That should have been our play to find more than 70 percent of the federal government to keep our military personnel paid, to keep our brave men and women on our border patrol paid. We should have forced them to come to the negotiating table and come to conference and hash out our differences with these four appropriations bills before there was another payday that was at risk of being missed.",

Congressman Gaetz, if he does move forward with need Democrats to vote to oust the Speaker would need five Republicans to do that if there was an unprecedented vote in the floor, something that has never happened before in American history.But that is an issue for days ahead. The Speaker said he's willing to have that fight on the floor, if it comes to that which is expected. Now the next thing to avoid a government shutdown, though, is the Senate. The bill will now go over to the Senate side, there needs to be an agreement of all 100 senators to vote to keep the government open for another 45 days. But as you can see, in 45 days, we can be right back to where we were at a very frantic, frantic effort to avoid a shutdown maybe averted for now.",

But this stopgap measure wouldn't have made it, you know, wouldn't have received any passing had it not received Democratic vote. So which is it? You know, want the government to keep functioning, but do so without Democratic support, you know, otherwise he'll be punished. It's a little confusing, like a lot confusing.",

But Congress rarely meets at September 30th deadline, typically needs a stopgap measure to avoid a shutdown.So essentially, left Kevin McCarthy with very little room to maneuver, if those members weren't going to vote for a stopgap measure he needed Democratic votes in order to keep the government open.

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, I just spoke to a White House official who tells CNN that it would likely support that compromise continuing resolution that would keep the government open for 45 days, for a few reasons. Number one, it would keep the government open and it does include disaster relief funding and authorization for the Federal Aviation Authority.Number two, this official says that it does not include the 30 percent across the board spending cuts that many Republicans were pushing to be included in previous short term bills. And number three, there's a belief within the White House that Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker has previously stated his support for funding Ukraine's defenses and that they believe that he will make good on that in separate measures, even though it is not included in that short term bill that just passed the House. Now worth noting, the White House had previously lent its support to a Senate broker deal earlier in the week that did include $6.2 billion in funding for Ukraine. But officials are acknowledging that without a path forward for that deal in the House, that their priority is keeping the lights on in the government their priority is compromised and averting a government shutdown at all costs. They believe this relatively clean short term bill that would have bipartisan support would likely have support within the administration and certainly is seen as a welcome development is one that was relatively unexpected just a few hours ago.",

But this kept the government open.This gave us the $16 billion of disaster aid, being from Florida, being in hurricane season, being a former Director of Emergency Management, that disaster aid was critical. FEMA needed those resources to help communities, cities, counties, states that had been affected by hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires. And so, you know, this was, you know, 90 percent of what I would have liked to see, so I'm not going to let perfect become the enemy that good. I'm going to live to fight another day.

And so, you know, as a Democrat who got 90 percent of what he would have liked to see, I voted for it, by the way, so did every single solitary other Democrat except one Democrat.And that's because we understand the catastrophic failure, it would have been to close the government. I mean, remember, they -- we didn't have to get here. You know, this is the same crew that, you know, almost, you know, took us off the cliff with the debt ceiling, took us right to the brink of defaulting on our debt.

We had the president's aide veto it and end up signing it. We weren't heard parents across the country. They'd get arrested when they go school board meeting simply because they wanted to talk about what was happening. We passed the Parents Bill of Rights. We ended the pandemic, when they said the Senate wouldn't take it up and the President wouldn't sign it.We passed the most conservative border security bill in the history of Congress. We passed an energy bill that would make us energy independent and create more jobs, lower inflation. We were able to get the largest cuts in American history during the debt, we're able to cut more than $2 trillion, get work requirements that the President said would be a red line, get NEPA reform for the first time in 40 years and put a provision in there we put a 1 percent cut across the board if the House and Senate doesn't do their job. We got the Senate at least to pass approach bills in committee. They just have a hard time getting it to the floor. So the one thing I've learned is get things done, bring others along.

But our Fred, we wouldn't have had this last minute, like almost literally last minute, full cave, on a continuing resolution if Kevin McCarthy had not been worried about his job all this time.The option of passing a clean resolution to keep the government open while negotiations continue for 30 days, or 45 days or 90 days. That option has been available all the law -- all along, it didn't just come up this morning. And so when you hear him suddenly pivoting away from describing that step, as you know, that would be surrender, that would be giving away our leverage to saying, all I want is to stand up for the American people. And that's what I did today, that shows what a last resort this was. And Fred, I would say also, a number of times he was talking about the border, the number of times he was baiting President Biden going after Hunter Biden in this sort of circuitous digression from the actual matter at hand.

Of course, the President, the Democrats in Congress also support funding for Ukraine.But the bigger risk is that it just sort of falls further and further down the list of priorities for Congress to deal with some urgency. And that's part of why it's so important to sort out in the next few days or next couple of weeks, what the House is actually going to look like if there's going to be a new speaker, or if Kevin McCarthy is going to remain the speaker, but with a fundamentally different power dynamic where he basically concedes that he's going to need to reach out to Democrats a lot more.

There's no question about it, the position that the speaker wanted the House to assert, which failed in a -- by in a stopgap measure yesterday would have cut federal spending pretty significantly among domestic programs are taking a significant hit under his plan. Also would have included new border security measures. But because of those cuts, Democrats voted against it in unison yesterday. And then also and 21, Republicans voted against it yesterday, which means it did not have the votes to move ahead.And the Speaker had to essentially back off of those -- that those demands and those provisions in the bill, this proposal that just passed the House extends current funding levels. That is something that the conservatives in his conference were railing against wanted to fight back against to cut deeper spending. So he had to back off of that did include disaster relief. That is something the White House had pushed for $16 billion to deal with natural disasters. But the speaker did not put in funding for Ukraine in this measure. And that is going to be a huge fight with enormous global implications here in the weeks ahead. Just moments ago, when the speaker talk, he did not indicate how he would deal with the issue of Ukraine funding suggesting perhaps it needed to be tied to border security money as well, but not giving any clear or sense of when this could happen, even as he said professed support for the Ukrainian cause would not say how Congress would deal with this very, very significant issue, even though there is overwhelming support for funding Ukraine here. So even though the Democrats didn't get everything they wanted, in this proposal, it was much -- at the end of the day, it was essentially a clean extension of current funding levels, not the cuts that they were fighting against. And the government likely will stay open once the Senate acts, potentially within the next couple of hours here to keep the government open for another 45 days. Fred?",
