We'll have the very latest on the conflict from Tel Aviv. Then, concern grows for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as his team says he's gone missing from jail. Plus, the special counsel investigating Donald Trump goes directly to the Supreme Court to resolve whether he has immunity from prosecution. We'll explain of course what that means in just a moment. But first, as dire as the situation is in Gaza with no end in sight to Israel's war on Hamas, U.N. officials say they expect things to get much worse for Palestinian civilians warning that hunger is prevailing as epidemic diseases unfold.

And it comes at such a critical moment for the war itself, where officials say the war appears to be at best at a stalemate. U.S. officials have said that Ukrainian forces have not made the kinds of advances that it had said it hoped to make. And, of course, there is the issue of additional U.S. funding that Capitol Hill and some lawmakers would very much like to be approved. But that stands at a total impasse right now as Democrats and Republicans are fighting over the very sensitive political issue here in the United States of immigration and border policy. One U.S. official I was speaking to saying that this is actually an issue that they believe Vladimir Putin is watching very closely. You know, they took note of the fact that last week when a vote to advance this package actually failed in the Senate, there were celebratory messages that they were seeing on Russian state media TV. So, that is something that they are pointing to as just a sign of how closely Russia is actually watching this. And then they're speaking to sort of the broader message that all of this would send, not just to the Ukrainians who are very much wanting this extra funding and saying that they desperately need it, but also just the -- speaking to the strength of the international coalition, not to mention the would-be aggressors, I am told, who are taking their cues from this basically if there are sort of the bad actors that are waiting to see what happens here. If they get the message that it's basically OK to invade another country, that the U.S. and other coalition countries wouldn't have the country like Ukraine's back, then what message does that send to some of these would-be aggressors, again, that are very much sort of watching everything that is unfolding. So, for so many reasons tomorrow is going to be very heavy on symbolism, but in terms of the actual effects on the war itself, obviously the ramifications are incredibly huge.",

Now, though, we are seeing significant support coming from members of the Harvard community. In just the last few hours, we've seen multiple statements of support backing Claudine Gay. More than 800 signatures were gathered by Black Harvard alumni, again supporting Gay, arguing that no one understands that Harvard needs to state against hate more than Claudine Gay, who is the daughter of Haitian immigrants. And the Harvard Alumni Association's executive committee put out a very strong statement saying that they, \"Unanimously and unequivocally support Gay,\" adding that they have full confidence in her leadership during what they call a difficult time. And all this is on top of the now more than 700 Harvard faculty members who are urging university officials not cave to political pressure by partying with Gay. And what's interesting is that some of the people who've signed this petition, they've actually been quite critical of Claudine Gay and the hearing last week. That includes noted Harvard legal scholar Lawrence Tribe, who was very critical. He slammed Claudine Gay last week, calling her testimony before Congress, deeply troubling. But he did sign this petition. So, I asked him why. And he told me in a statement, \"Once external pressures, whether from ultra wealthy donors or from politicians pursuing their ideological agendas, override the internal decision-making processes of universities, we are on the road to tyranny.\" And Tribe added that he fears that history could be repeating itself here. I also spoke to another Harvard faculty member who said Claudine Gay doesn't have any problem on campus. He said, \"She has no problem managing the campus. Her problem is managing the donors.\" So will all of this be enough to save Claudine Gay's job? It's too early to say. But what is clear is that unlike Liz Magill at Penn, Claudine Gay has a notable amount of support internally, just when she needs it the most.",
