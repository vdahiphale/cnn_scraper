Well, Jake, as you just reminded us, the president has long been dismissive of polling showing that many voters have a lot of serious questions about his age and his mental acuity. But as he went on to tell me in that February press conference, his main argument has really been I need to be the Democratic nominee because I am the most qualified. I think after Thursday night's debate, it has become infinitely more difficult for the president and his advisers to sort of outright reject those concerns about his mental acuity and his age.And I think it's also fair to describe the last three and a half days or so as the campaign having been in full crisis mode. We know that they have been on the phone nonstop, fielding questions, messages and worried concerns about exactly what happened on Thursday night and also just asking the question of what is Plan B. And for right now, the campaign is basically saying there is no Plan B. The president is going to remain on the ticket. We know that he spent the weekend at Camp David with members of his family, and the family has very much been encouraging him to stay in the race and to continue fighting The campaign is saying it is not even a remote possibility that the president is going to drop out of the race. But it is clear that the family is frustrated with how some members of his team handled the debate. We know that there were private discussions about whether some senior advisers should be fired, though I think a lot of people would argue that maybe it isn't the advisers that should be blamed. It was simply the president's bad performance. I think even more, though, than the inner circle that is around the president that is famous for being insular, it is going to be the president's family that is going to be all the more influential on any decisions that do come about his political future.",

But I think the caveat is that that is now. And we don't know what's coming in the next several days, particularly as both the campaign and just Democrats overall are waiting on data.They're waiting on research and polling to come in to actually get a full picture of the post debate damage from the president and his lawmakers. Some of them have told us they think that the down ballot impact will be more determinative than perhaps anything else, that if data shows that he is going to risk the House remaining in Democrats hands, then that could lead to the dam breaking and some lawmakers starting to say publicly that they do need a plan B.",

And we have to look at these two moments in contrast.The \"Philadelphia Inquirer,\" the most important newspaper in the swing state where I spent the weekend campaigning, watched that debate and concluded that the political party whose leadership should be going to their candidate and saying, in the interest of our nation and in the interest of our party, you should be stepping aside, sir, is the Republican Party because Donald Trump gave no reasons for folks to vote for him and a lot of reasons for folks to vote against him. The next day, Joe Biden, our president, gave a forceful and clear and engaging speech on a campaign stage at a rally in North Carolina. And he's had strong days ever since. Everybody has a bad night. And I think that was a weak debate performance. I don't think anyone in the campaign is disagreeing with that point. But I've been urging, and I expect that this will be moving forward, for the president to reassure folks in the media, the general public, the many editorialists, and others who've expressed concern by doing unscripted, casual engagements with journalists, with small groups of voters, a town hall, so that you can see what I've seen with our president in the last few months and, of course, the last few years. He is engaging. He is capable. He has an incredible record as president. I don't think you would dispute that, Jake. But the core question is whether what you saw in those few moments of the debate and over much of the arc of that 90-minute debate was someone having a difficult night or someone who is no longer up to the job. As he said on the stage in North Carolina, he wouldn't be running if he weren't confident, he's up for the job.",

Frankly, you can put up a dozen clips of me, of you, of anybody who's on TV, who speaks publicly all the time, losing their train of thought, misstating who they're about to introduce, not having a fluid moment. And if we're honest with each other, Jake, every time Donald Trump speaks in front of a rally, there's long stretches where he is saying nonsense, where he's talking about whether he'd rather be electrocuted or eaten by a shark, where he's saying nonsensical things about forests bursting into flame or windmills causing cancer.So, to take that little clip and say, aha, Senator Coons, be honest, you know that our president is somehow mentally unfirm, and yet to not put-up dozens and dozens of much more alarming examples of the former president. Let me cut to the chase with what I think is a simple but important moment of testimony here, Jake. Only former President Trump has a vice president, secretary of defense, chief of staff, national security advisor who say he is not morally fit to be president and refuse to support him. The whole cabinet of our current president, the entire Senate in the Democratic caucus, every governor I know who already supports Joe Biden still supports Joe Biden. And we interact with him and work with him regularly. So, do all of us who are in public life and speaking regularly have slips and moments where we don't finish our sentence properly or misidentify exactly who we're introducing? Absolutely. But I have been saying to the campaign senior leadership, our president needs to reassure folks by doing some unscripted, engaging public events soon. Otherwise, we're going to keep having this exact exchange until the cows come home and maybe until November, which I frankly think is a disservice to our country.",

I think that we've been doing that since 2015. And obviously, we have also been covering the many people who worked in the Trump administration who have not endorsed Donald Trump.If you want to talk about a candidate-to-candidate matchup, I understand that's not really what I'm talking about. And I don't think it's fair to compare you or me losing our train of thought with whatever we saw on the debate stage on Thursday and that little clip from two weeks ago. But let me move on to one other question, because there is this question of what if? What if the Democratic Party decides to do something that that you obviously don't think is wise? The Biden campaign wrote in an e-mail this weekend that if President Biden were to drop out of the race, quote, \"we'd switch to candidates who would, according to polls, be less likely to win than Joe Biden, the only person ever to defeat Donald Trump,\" unquote. Then the e-mail goes on to show polling from, to be honest, partisan pollsters that shows Vice President Harris, Governor Gavin Newsom, Pete Buttigieg, and how they match up. To be frank, they're only one percentage point behind Joe Biden in those head-to-head matchups with Donald Trump. So it does not actually look as though there would be that much of a difference between the guy who has been president for three plus years and has been spending tens, hundreds of millions of dollars running as a Democratic nominee and the people who haven't even been running.",

Networks probably would cover it live. He'd be able to answer all these questions. It's not a crazy thing to expect a president to do. And the fact is, you know that. The campaign knows that.

David, thanks so much for joining us. So in your column, in your article, you write, on President Biden refusing to step down, quote, to ignore the inevitability of time and aging doesn't merely risk his legacy. It risks the election and most important puts in peril, the very issues and principles that Biden has framed as central to his presidency and essential to the future, unquote. There are a number of high profile editorial boards and columnist who have called for Biden to step down. It does seem as though however, that top Democratic officials at least publicly are rallying around the President to stay in the race, despite what we all saw Thursday night, despite the polling, quite frankly, that's been pretty clear for more than a year or two that voters want another option. Why such a disconnect do you think? DAVID REMNICK, EDITOR, THE NEW YORKER: Well, I'm coming to you from Tel Aviv. I'm not in Washington, in the thick of it. But it's, you know, I've never written anything that felt, or very few things that felt so hard to write on a human level. I think Joe Biden is a very decent man. I think he's been a, in many ways, very effective president. But, you know, the time has been what it is for human beings. And that's very hard for him to accept, because he's in the position of trying to fend off the return to the White House of someone who in so many ways is malevolent, racist, lies, and all the things that we know about Donald Trump. I totally understand why I received so many notes from readers who were so anxious about speaking for, quite frankly, the truth of what was in front of our eyes at this debate, but is an indelible set of images. It wasn't just one stumble. It was a pretty terrible night. And it gave the impression, and I think it's the reality that Joe Biden is, you know, he's not Superman. He's -- nor is he even a young 81. And he's proposing to be president until he's 86. And that is dangerous. And I think he's going to lose a lot in the coming weeks and months if he stays in, and that risks a very terrible outcome.",

Because we're talking about not just the next few months, we're talking about the next four years and more. And the world is in terrible shape in so many ways, whether it's climate change, the Middle East, Ukraine and Russia. We could go on and on.And the opponent is so malevolent, I totally understand the stakes. And I think he, and I know he does, and it's on the most human, almost Shakespearean level, he has to face this profound, profound decision, and I understand the resistance to it. And I think it's going to come down to his family and a very small circle of people. I don't think the fact that somebody wrote a column in \"The New Yorker,\" \"The New York Times,\" or \"The Washington Post\" is going to be decisive. I think it'll have to do with the family, his advisors, and also whether the poll numbers plummet and the money stops coming in. And I think there's a lot of people who are very anxious out there. And this is such a profound moment in American history that really deserves reconsideration. I say it with no joy, no mockery, but it is a profound decision that he has to make.

But rightly or wrongly, he will say that he's come to the end of this phase of the war, whether he's getting what I don't mean, rightly or wrongly, but to be truthful or not. And it will start treating this less as a ground war as the management of an insurgency.He will claim that Hamas and Gaza is now a defeated army, but remains dangerous and insurgency and from outside Gaza, the Israeli army will continue to have raids and try to control the situation, that does not solve the problem at all. And the problem is profound. And also, the problem extends to the fact that there is an occupation that has been going on for more than a half a century. And it is a problem that cannot be avoided or evaded, I totally understand, profoundly understand the grief and trauma in Israel as well as the grief and trauma that the Palestinian people have suffered to such a tremendous degree. But until there is forward, profound forward movement on the Palestinian question, until the Palestinian people have some sense that there is that a new reality, a better reality, and more just reality is ahead. I'm afraid that this terrible, terrible ongoing situation will go on in one way or another and it will erode both peoples these Israeli public situation is now awful, degraded, the cabinet is filled with people who are annexations, the annexations that essentially come down from the hilltops of the West Bank, and they're in the Cabinet Room. That's the reality and it controls politics here. And until that fever is broken in Israeli life, as -- that there will be no healing, and this is going to just take a long time to reverse.",
