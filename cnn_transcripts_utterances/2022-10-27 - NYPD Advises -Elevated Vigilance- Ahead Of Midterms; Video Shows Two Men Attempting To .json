      "sentences": "All right. We're less than two weeks to go until the midterms and Democrats are pounding the pavement trying to retain their majority in Congress as Republicans are hoping for a red wave.President Obama is heading to Georgia this weekend to give a boost to Democrats campaigning there, and he'll join President Biden for campaign stops in Pennsylvania next week. Joining us now to unpack the most competitive races that we are watching, CNN Politics reporter and editor-at-large, Chris Cillizza. OK, what are you watching? CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN POLITICS REPORTER AND EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  OK, I want to start big picture first so people know what we're talking about. All right, I'm not -- you don't have to count all these. There are 35 of them. There are 21 Republican seats up; there are 14 Democratic seats up. So, right off the bat, you see Republicans have more vulnerability but not all these seats are competitive. Let's go to the top tier. These are the three I think, Brianna, that are going to decide majorities. This is a D seat -- Nevada. This is an R seat -- Pennsylvania. This is a D seat -- Georgia. OK, Paul Laxalt -- excuse me, Adam Laxalt one point ahead in polling averages. Fetterman -- John Fetterman -- a lot of talk about him lately -- the lieutenant governor -- two points ahead. This one surprises me a little. The polling average here is plus-five for Raphael Warnock. Obviously, Herschel Walker has been hit with allegation after allegation after allegation. This seems to suggest that it's having some effect. Now, there are other races that I think we should watch. Ohio -- Tim Ryan -- amazing. This is an R seat. Oh, that's a terrible R. Let's do a better R. This is an R seat. Tim Ryan has run a great campaign. They are tied -- J.D. Vance and Tim Ryan -- a little surprising. This is a race nobody talks about. This may be the underdog race of the election -- North Carolina. Ted Budd, the Republican is winning, but Cheri Beasley is running competitive -- plus-four. In Wisconsin, this is looking like a missed opportunity for Democrats. Mandela Barnes, the lieutenant governor, was ahead for much of this race. Now, Ron Johnson ahead by 3 1/2. And then there's this. I don't know what to make of this one, honestly, Brianna. Mark Kelly has run a really good race -- very well- funded. He's running against Blake Masters. We've talked a lot about Blake Masters. He's up by six, but this is -- this margin -- I'm just going to do a down arrow because it's closing a little bit. So, these -- you go with these three and these four, you've got seven -- and that's, I think, where the majority is going to be decided.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I call them the sleeper states. These are states that both parties thought might happen. They don't look like they're going to happen. But again, I don't -- 12 days out, I try not to rule anything out.So, in New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan was seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbents going into the election. Republicans didn't get their candidate, Chris Sununu, the governor of the state. She's up eight. Now, I think that that's probably in a comfortable margin. Same thing with Michael Bennet. This is a swing-ish state -- Colorado. He's up six. I think that's probably enough. You'd rather, obviously be up 16 than six, but being up six is better than being up none. This is the one that I'm most stunned by. If you had told me at the start of the election we'd be talking about Chuck Grassley, who has been in the Senate longer than I've been alive -- and I'm not that young -- if, yes, you told me that he was only going to be up three points on a guy named Mike Franken, who is running as the Democratic nominee, I'd be really surprised. And then, we always talk about Florida. Florida is a swing state. It's a state that has seen massive amounts of spending. This race was one that Democrats hoped would come online. Val Demings, a congresswoman with a police background -- a really great resume -- raised a ton of money. It just doesn't look like it's happening. So, she's down 11. I want to just jump -- I want to show you two more just to keep an eye on and I'll do it fast. You've probably heard about this race. Kari Lake, a very prominent election denier, is running for governor. This is a tie but it's moving in the right direction for Kari Lake. So you could have a very prominent election denier as the governor of Arizona, a swing state. [07:35:00] And then this one -- sort of surprising. New York is not a swing state. If you're a Democrat you usually feel pretty good about running for statewide office in New York. But Kathy Hochul, the governor -- she's only up four points on Lee Zeldin. Crime attacks have really hurt Republicans -- Democrats, excuse me, in New England in the northeast. Just keep an eye on it. If Kathy Hochul loses it's going to be an incredibly good night for Republicans, or even if it's close, it's probably going to be a good night for Republicans. So that's all of them to watch for, at least for the moment. We've got 12 more days.",

Now, it says the department is now aware of any specific threats to candidates, election workers, or at voting sites, but warns, as we have seen, hostile rhetoric and really just an abundance of generalized threats in chat groups, for example, encrypted messaging channels. And that, they say, can create just an echo chamber and an environment for possible violent action. Now, the bulletin -- it just goes on to list rhetoric the intelligence community is already seeing online. And it mentions the political climate specifically, of course, in the aftermath of January 6. I want to read that part to you. It says this. \"In the aftermath of the U.S. Capitol riot on 6 January 2021, REMVEs and AGAAVEs emphasized potentially threatening actions at the local level, encouraging the intimidation of municipal officials, school board representatives, and election staffers. Given the elevated domestic violence extremism threat landscape throughout the U.S., uniformed members of the service are advised to maintain heightened situational awareness when deployed citywide in support of the upcoming midterm elections.\" So, again, this is something that goes out within the intelligence community and in the NYPD. Of course, we will see this in a broader way nationwide with homeland security. But certainly, this is now out there as we get closer to the midterms -- Alex.",

There are shallow graves where men or women are dumped, supposedly, and they would likely start there and see if the dogs can scent on these properties.
