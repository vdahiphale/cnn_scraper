He joins us now. So, Ivan, tell us, what is the latest on the count as it continues? IVAN WATSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The counting is very much underway. The magic number here in the votes for the lower house of parliament is 272. That's how many seats a party has to win to get a majority in the parliament. Now, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, and his BJP, that party, have won majorities in the past two national elections, 2014 and 2019. They had 303 seats in the 2019 election. And he was predicting that his bigger alliance would win more than 400 seats in this election, the preliminary results, Rosemary, suggest that that massive blowout from the BJP is not what is taking place, that, in fact, this election looks, again, according to preliminary results, a bit more competitive. The larger bloc led by Modi does look like it will win a majority, but it is possible that his party will not win a simple majority. And, in fact, that the opposition led by the Indian National Congress is performing much better than expected. Now, the exit polls that were published on Monday, they triggered record gains in the Indian stock markets. What we are seeing today as the results are starting to trickle in and suggesting that it is not going to be a huge blowout win for BJP, instead we are seeing an opposite kind of sell-off in the Indian stock market, where the stock markets are down as of noon today by more than 6 percent. And I think that highlights the fact that the results so far in this election are not as everybody had initially expected and certainly not as Narendra Modi, the prime minister of the last 10 years, had predicted.

We heard yesterday from the U.S.' ambassador to the United Nations confirming that the U.S. has circulated a draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council in support of this three-phase plan. Of course, as we heard from Biden on Friday, this plan seeks to really check off the key priorities that have been put forward by both the Israeli side and Hamas over the course of this three-phase plan. We would see, for example, an exchange or a full release of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas, a release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.We would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas. That is something that Hamas has long pushed for. The return of Palestinian civilians to all parts of Gaza, including the north, and crucially, a full and lasting ceasefire. And that is something that, of course, many in the international community continue to push for. But as you mentioned, Rosemary, there is some concern over where Israel stands. Now, President Joe Biden framed this proposal, this announcement, as a deal put forward by the Israeli government with the support of the Israeli government, though he acknowledged on Friday that there would be factions within the government, particularly within the far-right segments of the Israeli cabinet, that may oppose this deal, that may want to see a continuation of the war, that may, in his words, want to see a full occupation of the Gaza Strip. And we have heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that they had not seen a full deal that that full deal had not been announced, but also that the Israeli government would not agree to a full and lasting ceasefire without its crucial conditions being met first, namely the full destruction of Hamas. That is something that President Biden again touched on on Friday. He said that the U.S. assessment is that Hamas has been downgraded to a point where they were not able or are not able to carry out an attack, such as we saw on October 7th. Again, a key priority of the Israeli government. We also heard from an Israeli government spokesperson who went on to say on Monday that the war will be stopped for the purpose of returning hostages, and then we will proceed with further discussions. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter. It is not an option. Now, despite these comments, the U.S. State Department has said that it is confident the Israeli government will agree to this proposal. We've also heard from the State Department urging partners, including the Qatari government, to put pressure on Hamas to also accept the terms of this deal. And of course, as we know, there has been mounting pressure domestically in Israel on the Israeli Prime Minister's government to focus more on the release of hostages, to establish a ceasefire to see the full release and return of hostages held captive in Hamas. But also, of course, there has been a huge amount of international pressure as we continue to see the civilian death toll in Gaza mounting, now topping 36,000. Real fears, of course, over what the future could look like for Palestinian civilians if indeed this war continues. Rosemary?",

Israel made a proposal in the form of a list of principles, and then it agrees.President Biden then packaged it, and fearing, because he knows Mr. Netanyahu's tendency to mendacity and manipulation, he figured that Mr. Netanyahu would oppose to it and then claim that it was never made. So, Biden stands up last Friday and makes it public. Israel, then, is in a predicament. Well, Netanyahu, rather, is in a predicament, because he can't pass this, but he can't reject it. So, what he's doing is procrastinating, which is his modus operandi on everything and always. Right now, what he's doing, Rosemary, is trying to stall and attach stipulations and conditions in what seems to be an effort to elicit a rejection from Hamas, you know, it's a blame game. So, he can say, well, I had my reservations, but I agreed to it. They rejected it. I don't think it's going to work.

He knows that he reached a point on the road where he has to fork that he can no longer avoid. So he's going to take the deal with reservations, hoping something will happen, ask the Americans to add the Saudi dimension, meaning that he will give some faint, half- hearted commitment to a peace process, lose his coalition, make this a caretaker interim government, which cannot be toppled, and then stall for time until after the American election without really committing to doing anything.

In just a few days, some 373 million eligible voters across Europe will elect a new European Union parliament. And the E.U. and several member countries are investigating suspected Russian disinformation campaigns ahead of the vote. One cybersecurity company warns that Russian networks are using artificial intelligence and deepfakes to spread false information about the climate, energy and other critical issues.

Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become the country's first female and first Jewish president. She faces a huge challenge in fighting crime and gang violence.

Her parents were leftists, according to a biography by journalist Arturo Cano, in which Sheinbaum says that she grew up talking about politics all day with her parents. But her first career is academia. She has a PhD in environmental engineering, focused in renewable energy and climate change. Her introduction to politics happened in 2000, when she became Mexico City's environmental minister under the head of government Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. She became part of his team during his three presidential campaigns, and in 2018, when he won the presidency, she was elected chief of government of Mexico City. She pledged to continue the policies of Lopez Obrador with a five- point plan, increase public safety, free public education, fight poverty through social programs and a higher minimum wage, better regulation of water resources, and transition to renewable energies.

CNN senior White House correspondent MJ Lee has details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The border, of course, is one of the most politically fraught issues here in Washington, and what sources briefed on this executive order tell CNN is that this is an announcement that could come from President Biden as early as Tuesday, and that what it would allow the administration to do is effectively shut down the U.S.-Mexico border to asylum seekers if the number of daily crossings crosses a certain threshold. Now, we are told that unaccompanied children are expected to be exempt from all of this, but that would be worrisome to a lot of immigration advocates who say that that could actually have the result of incentivizing and encouraging some families from sending children to the border on their own. Now, President Biden would be using an authority that's called the 212-F authority. This was a regulation that was actually used by former President Donald Trump during his administration, and he received a lot of criticism, including from many Democrats at the time, so it's not hard to imagine President Biden getting criticized for hypocrisy, for leaning on this authority himself. And, of course, very hard to ignore the politics that are at play here, given that border security is one where President Biden and Democrats have gotten so much criticism for and really a lot of pressure to do more to get a better handle on the border. The timing, of course, is really significant as well, given that we are just a couple of weeks away from that first presidential debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. Now, the White House is not confirming this forthcoming announcement that we expect again on Tuesday, but a White House spokesperson said this in a They said, as we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system. Now, the big caveat here, of course, is that there could still be some final changes that are made to the final text of this executive order, but when it does come, it will be sweeping, it will be a significant political announcement, and President Biden is certainly hoping that it is something that could strengthen his political hand before November.

Claudia Sheinbaum received about 58 percent of the vote. But what does she bring to the table and will she chart her own course or be guided by her mentor, Lopez Obrador?CORREA-CABRERA: Well, Claudia Sheinbaum has been a very effective politician. She was mayor of Mexico City, and she did a pretty good job. She's a very capable professional politician, social leader, political leader. She has demonstrated it throughout her life. What we're talking about is the project of the fourth transformation, which goes beyond Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, supposedly. She's probably going to rule the country in her own terms, because in the presidential system, presidents have the power. So Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is a very popular president that set up the foundations of the project of the fourth transformation. Claudia Sheinbaum promised to build the second floor of the fourth transformation. She will do it in her way. She's very pragmatic. She's very disciplined. I think that she's going to follow the steps of Andres Manuel, but at the same time, she's probably will be more pragmatic and less radical.",

But the main challenge for Mexico is the problem of security and security and violence. Claudia Sheinbaum has been very successful, was very successful when she was mayor of Mexico City in that regard. She promises to expand that success to the whole country. But the country is very complex. The criminal world in Mexico is very complex. And the presence of criminal paramilitary groups of transnational organized crime are very different, the structure than the ones that we observe in Mexico City. There's a huge challenge. She promises to maintain the military, overseeing public safety at the federal level, monopolizing the public safety at the federal level. That has not been a successful strategy. But at the same time, she has more governors of Morena, so she can coordinate better. We'll see what happens. She has a strong team. But at the same time, this team has been there and Mexico has not been able to solve its problems. So this is a big issue, the issue of water, energy. She's going to be pragmatical. She's going to collaborate within the framework of North America. We can foresee that. And the capacity that the government will have without checks and balances will probably facilitate some of the coordination problems that have been faced, that other presidents have been facing during this century.",
