Sinema has been a key player during the Biden administration, was key to legislation that has become law, such as the infrastructure law, as well as the CHIPS and Science Act, codifying same-sex marriage. Also tried to push forward a bipartisan border security deal that Republicans blocked earlier this year.But she's also been someone who has faced relentless criticism, mostly from the left flank, because of her defense of the Senate's filibuster, efforts to try to weaken that filibuster rule to allow legislation to pass along a simple majority. In the last Congress, she rejected that. And her and Joe Manchin and the like prevented that from essentially being changed. As a result, she's faced a lot of pushback. She also decided to become an independent and caucus with Democrats. And she weighed whether to run for re-election as independent. But announcing just moments ago it was time for her to step aside from the Senate because of what she said is this - because of her concerns about the state of our politics, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-AZ): We've arrived at that crossroad and we chose anger and division. I believe in my approach. But it's not what America wants right now. I love Arizona and I am so proud of what we've delivered. Because I choose civility, understanding, listening, working together to get stuff done, I will leave the Senate at the end of this year.

Right now, Ruben Gallego, who's a progressive Democrat, is running in the Democratic primary. Kari Lake, a conservative Republican, running in the Republican primary. If she were to run, it was unclear how that would impact things. One side believe it could help the other side.And I just talked to Sen. Steve Daines, the Senate GOP campaign chairman, who believes that this will actually bolster Kari Lake's chances. The concerns being that Sinema could have siphoned away some moderate Republican vote who may not have been willing to support Kari Lake. Of course, the Democrats see it the opposite side. But nevertheless, Arizona is going to be one of the most significant races to watch this November, something that could determine control of the United States Senate and will have huge ramifications for the next president, whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump. So this moment, significant for the Senate, significant for the makeup of the chamber, the deal-making that happens in this body, but also for who controls it come November, guys.",

And this is an in-person voting location. Now, I'm stressing that because it's one of 150 places you can vote in person today and there has been a slow but steady trickle of people. Why not that many? Because most people in this state vote in drop boxes or by mail.You can actually vote in a drop box here today. You can show up with your ballot already filled in and put it in that box right there, then walk out and go about your business here in beautiful Colorado. If you do want to vote here today, you get your ballot over there. You fill it in and you put it in that box separately right there. Now, Brianna, I can show you here. We have some sample ballots. You mentioned Donald Trump, the Supreme Court ruling where the Supreme Court said that states can't bar Trump from being on the ballot for being an insurrectionist. You can see his name is on the ballot right there. It would have been on the ballot anyway. It has been on the ballot because of a stay in the earlier court ruling, but the Supreme Court just clarified that. On the Democratic side, one thing I want to point out, you can see in the small print at the bottom, non-committed delegates. In Michigan, uncommitted votes became a little bit of an issue there. Doesn't seem to be the level of campaign here for uncommitted voters, but if that number does get above 15 percent, they would have delegates at the Democratic Convention. We have seen voters here. We did have a chance to talk to a few of them more than a hundred feet away from the doors here. That's the rules. Listen to what they said about why they were here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The other thing that they're hoping for is that there's a definitive enough win tonight that it essentially forces Nikki Haley out of the race.Now, they are keenly aware that Haley has said - has not said what she would do after Super Tuesday, but they are not banking on her dropping out. They've already pivoted to a general election. Something interesting we just heard from Jess talking about those suburban voters in Virginia. All of this information that is coming out of Super Tuesday is information that Donald Trump's campaign is going to take into a general election: Who is showing up to vote? Where are people voting? What does enthusiasm look like within the Republican Party? They are going to be compiling all of this data as they try to figure out where they want to put their resources heading into November.

SANCHEZ: Let's pivot to the voting that's happening today and Super Tuesday. Brad, before we came on, you were walking us through where on the map today Nikki Haley has the best chance of winning some delegates. What do you think the minimum she has to accomplish tonight is to keep her campaign going?",

And so if she feels like she's still raising enough money, and in this day and age that means money over the internet, it comes in as small and moderate donations, and it happens instantaneously reacting to the news, I think that's the question.The question is not how many delegates she wins tonight and she could win some. She could win some in Northern Virginia. She - I think Vermont is an opportunity, I think Utah is an opportunity for her, Minnesota might be an opportunity. So she could win a few delegates, but I think really the question will be does she believe her donors will be there tomorrow?",

We know that a third party race would unfortunately - a third party candidate would unfortunately hand over the election to Donald Trump.So do they go over to Joe Biden, like the voter we saw in the block before who said he would hold his nose and go vote for Joe Biden? Are some of her supporters going to go to Joe Biden, and are some prominent voices that don't believe in Donald Trump in the Republican Party, are they going to hold their nose and vote for President Biden?",

The first are self-identified Republicans who really just wish Donald Trump was not the direction their party was going, but at the end of the day, I think in a general are probably going to come home and vote Republican. They will hold their nose and they will vote for Donald Trump. That's most of the self-ID'd Republicans.But you've had in places like New Hampshire and in South Carolina, a lot of disaffected Democrats, some independents participating. They hate that they think their choices might be Biden and Trump, and they wanted to do whatever they could to not have to face that choice in November. Those voters, I can see a sizable number of them actually winding up and going to Biden.",

I think if they have the chance to vote against him in the primary, it's much easier for him to bring them home in the general. I know it's a little counterintuitive, but I think when you are a primary candidate who has a section that's unhappy, you need to let the horses run a little bit and so I think ...",
