It's another controversial choice for the administration. Rivals are reuniting. The President-elect returned to the White House. With President Biden offering a smooth transition. And closing in. Typhoon Usagi is rapidly intensifying as it approaches the storm-batted Philippines. Tonight, we're always going to talk about robots and the rise thereof. Boston Dynamics is teaming up with Toyota to speed up A.I. research. We'll talk about that and a great deal more in the hour ahead. We begin with Donald Trump making his triumphant report -- a return to Washington, where he visited the White House for the first time since he left office. The meeting, of course, was with President Joe Biden. After the meeting, Mr. Trump announced he's picking the Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz, to serve as his Attorney General. Congressman Gaetz has been under House Ethics Committee investigation. The president-elect also picked Tulsi Gabbard to be the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence. She was a Democratic Congresswoman. She later left the Democratic Party and campaigned with Donald Trump. Stephen Collinson is with me to pull the strands together. Start with Matt Gaetz. The first question, of course, is whether he is confirmable in that role, because he is controversial, and even though Donald Trump has the majority in the Senate, does he have enough?",

Even in this long run of Trump's controversial cabinet picks and picks for White House staff, Gaetz caused horror and shock in the Justice Department and among senators and lawmakers. So, your question about the confirmation is a very good one, perhaps that's one of the reasons why Donald Trump has been talking about getting Republican senators to cooperate with him on a mechanism known as recess appointments by which he can get people confirmed by bypassing the Senate when the Senate is not in session. Whether Democrats would go along with any of that is very difficult to see. But you're right, shock, horror at this appointment.

For DNI, it's Tulsi Gabbard, former Democrat and veteran of the Guard for head of CIA, John Ratcliffe, but he is former DNI. Colonel Cedric Leighton is with me. Let's start with Hegseth.

Pete Hegseth, I know, has some virtuous qualities in the sense that he did do some work for veterans' organizations. And he, as you mentioned, served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The problem comes that he has never led a large organization, whether it be in the private sector or in the government, and he -- besides his military experience, which, by the way, was with the Army National Guard, he has not had experience that, you know, is related to the government, either in a military or civilian capacity at the very highest levels.",

But what they then do is they'll promote based on merit, and then they will check to make sure that they have promoted people fairly and equitably, and they will also determine whether or not they've promoted people of all the different backgrounds as much as they possibly can. But that's why I -- you know, you have underrepresentation of some groups within the highest ranks of the military and overrepresentation of others.

First of all, Peru for APEC, then Brazil for the G20, andsomewhere along the way he'll become the first sitting American president to visit the Amazon. His visit comes at a rocky time for U.S. as the world leaders of bracing for the second Trump term. China's trying to topple the U.S. as the top trading partner to Latin America. Stefano Pozzebon reports from Bogota. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, REPORTER (voice-over): Business speaks a new language in South America. Gone are the days of Washington's backyard. China is now the top trading partner for the region. Few places represent this shift like this brand-new mega port in Peru, with a Chinese state-owned shipping giant COSCO as its controlling shareholder. It's inaugurated on Thursday in a joint ceremony at the Presidential Palace with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The port is part of a multibillion-dollar Chinese investment in Peru, and CNN got a sneak peek ahead of the opening. These massive cranes will run 24/7 once the port is operational in 2025, and allow COSCO's megaships to travel to China directly rather than stopping in Mexico and California, reducing shipping times to Shanghai by 15 days. It's going to be a game changer, says Carlos Tejada (ph), a spokesperson for the Chinese conglomerate. Of course, there is a geopolitical impact because we used to have to send our goods to North America, and that's no longer the case. Competition between China and the U.S. is in full show this week, as Peru hosts the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Both heads of state are in town, but one is clearly ahead in the game. PARSIFAL D'SOLA, FOUNDER, ANDRES BELLO FOUNDATION: We're going to have, throughout the APEC Summit, a triumphant Xi Jinping opening the port and the participation by President Biden with. To be honest, I don't know, much of an agenda, especially given the results of the election. It's a huge win for them, and this is not only happening in Peru. POZZEBON (voice-over): Twenty-two countries in Latin America are now part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi is a signature policy on global infrastructure investments, according to the Andres Bello Foundation. An entire continent who could find itself in the crosshairs of the looming trade war between Washington and Beijing. Donald Trump is not in Lima this week, but his plans for Chinese-owned companies in the region are well known. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: They think they're going to make their cars there and they're going to sell them across our line and we're going to take them and we're not going to charge them tax. We're going to charge them, I'm telling you right now, I'm putting a 200 percent tariff on which means they're unsellable. POZZEBON (voice-over): What a second Trump presidency will mean for South America remains to be seen. Trump wasted no time in demanding Mexico to do more to stop migration at the border in a phone call last week.

From 110 to 240 in 24 hours. Almost unheard of for that type of rapid intensification. And then, it moves on up toward Taiwan, not as a typhoon, but certainly a rainmaker for the eastern coast of Taiwan. So, two-to-three-meter storm surge coming on shore here. And in the areas up here in red, I know it's a small area, but 140,000 people live here in that Signal 4 region. And then we have Man-yi, the next storm system still to the east, heading to the Philippines, again. And 204, 233, 235 kilometers per hour. That's only five or so, 10 kilometers an hour from being another super typhoon. And that one's a lot closer to Manila, not just kind of glancing blow up toward the top. So, yes, a lot of rain, a lot of wind and a lot of damage. 150,000 people will see wind damage, but you have to get away from that shore. If you have three meters storm surge, nine feet to almost 10 feet going to be over the heads of many there. So, they're going to have to retreat into the mountainous areas there. There's our rainfall estimates as well. Could see some spots, 500 millimeters of rain without a doubt. There goes the wind across the northern part there of Luzon, and there's the next big storm. They're very, very close to Manila as it works its way across. And now, closer to the Caribbean, a 90 percent chance of something developing in the Caribbean. It already has kind of a name, potential Tropical Cyclone Number 19, and it will likely turn into something that will make significant rain for Nicaragua. I mean, we're going to talk about her right -- the Honduran coast here is going to see between 500 and even a thousand millimeters of rainfall because the storm isn't going to move for four days. All of those white spots greater than 500, greater than a half a meter of rainfall in an area that has topography. And then, all of a sudden, all that water has to run back down. Where does it go from here? Does it get into the Gulf of Mexico? We're not really sure. It's going to spend a lot of time down here, likely being torn up by the mountainous areas here of Honduras and Guatemala, but we'll have to see if that does make that run toward Florida.

Now, you make a very good point. There are tens of thousands over 100,000 attorneys -- or not attorneys, employees at the Justice Department in total, and the vast majority of casework and day-to-day decisions get made by those folks who are nonpolitical actors. But when it comes to the biggest decisions, should we appoint special counsel? Should we target this person? Should we open an investigation on this high-profile person? Those will go through the attorney general's desk without question. So, that's where the real danger lies. You know, I have -- I am not a subscriber to a lot of these doomsday scenarios around Trump's upcoming second term. I think they're largely overstated, but this to me is a real cause for concern.",

ANDY HARRIS (R-MD): Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Look, the president came down and started the day by coming down and asking for unity, asking for making sure that we deliver for the American public what they asked for last week. And obviously, we know that -- now we know what the leadership's going to be like in the Senate. We know what our who our speaker designated is right now. And we've been able to work across the conference to eliminate the controversial issues that could have divided us and move forward together to deliver on the president's agenda. That's it. That's what the American people expect us to do. And the first steps were taken today very concrete steps. And look, we're behind the president and I want to thank Dusty Johnson for working to make us unified, to go together to deliver for the American people with Mr. Trump as the president. And with that, Dusty. REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): First, I want to say thank you to Speaker Johnson, who has cultivated an environment where members know that they can try to work together to move the ball downfield. And I want to thank Andy Harris. This started because Dr. Harris reached out this morning. He said, listen, we got to cut a deal. We need to come together. Unity is important. We sat down. We began to negotiate. We spent more than an hour together. We made good progress. We understood that by -- we had an opportunity to set the motion to vacate at a higher than number one, that motion to vacate will be set at 9:00, in return for getting rid of some amendments that probably would have divided this conference. Andy did a good job of explaining to main street leadership why those amendments would have divided the republican conference. So, where are we at today? We are just as Dr. Harris said, because of this agreement we are in a better position to move forward the Republican agenda, to make sure that Speaker Johnson, South Dakota Senate leader John Thune and our president, Donald Trump, have an opportunity to go forward and do good things for America. This is exactly how we're supposed to come together. M. JOHNSON: I want to thank these gentlemen again. We're going to have a press conference here in just a few moments with all the new elected leadership. And we'll answer questions there. But wanted to hear -- you to hear that straight from these chairmen. Thank you both so much for all your hard work and we'll be right back with you. OK.",

So, I feel we need to be very precise in our wording and mention it the way it is. And on the other hand, I feel people are overplaying it in the sense that they're using very, very big words on how to describe it for their own political -- for instance, for their own political gain.
