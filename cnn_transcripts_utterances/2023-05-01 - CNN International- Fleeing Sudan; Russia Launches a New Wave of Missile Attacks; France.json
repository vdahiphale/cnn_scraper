CNN's team is on the ground where evacuees are being processed live in just a moment.Also ahead, First Republic Bank becomes the second largest bank failure in U.S. history. We'll ask how that happened despite a $30 billion lifeline it received and in just five days, King Charles will be crowned in Westminster Abbey and look at what to expect this week. The devastating conflict between rival military forces in Sudan is now in its third week. It doesn't appear to be any end in sight despite the extension of yet another so called ceasefire. Witnesses tell CNN explosions were heard in at around the Capital earlier. On the ground, the situation is quickly deteriorating, with the U.N. warning of a humanitarian breaking point. Thousands of foreign nationals have been evacuated from Sudan to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, including 100 Americans that's where CNN, Larry Madowo joins us now live, Larry, what they telling you?",

But those were communicated to the U.S. Embassy, that we'll be communicating with them and helping them how to get out of the country.But the first U.S. run naval ship arrived here in the USNS Brunswick, and it had about 100 Americans on board. Some of them are here that you see here, but the vast majority were Americans, but they're also about 24 Brits on there, some people from Germany, from Australia, from Scotland, and from all over the world. And you see what happens here is they get processed and then they go over across the other side to get their passport stamped, then they spend a couple of days in Saudi Arabia before they can move on to mostly other parts of the U.S. and across the world. And so many of the people we spoke to are grateful to the Saudis for helping set this up, but also grateful that they can leave. But there's also a sense of heartbreak and loss, almost survivor's guilt that they have the chance to leave because these were here all Sudanese dual nationals with another country which means that the power and ability that they can leave the country but for so many, they can leave Sudan this 45 million people were stuck in that. I spoke to one mother who's got two young kids this is her response to this crisis. There so many children had to live through this?",

Yes, they are very scared to now.Such a heartbreaking situation but the beauty of it is this seventh child's childlike innocence here when he says some of these kids who don't understand what's going on one of them. One of the families here has a three-week old baby that was just born at this conflict was beginning. And so they made the calculation that it was the best decision for them was to leave. The Saudis said that they have so far evacuated about 5200 people from about 100 nationalities using this shuttle service almost they're running between Port Sudan across the Red Sea here to Jeddah. But there's so many more people in the Port Sudan, Max, who haven't had a chance to leave hoping to get into one of these ships across the Red Sea to safety to whatever countries they're from.",

Or they weren't so effective, as you said out of 18, incoming 15 were taken down. But again, those few that got through, causes huge destruction are those 34 civilian casualties.You mentioned five of them were children, a lot of buildings, apartments, shops, schools, were damaged in the Dnipro region in the south and east of the country. What we have seen here and our experience in the City of Uman, and just south of here, where 25 civilians were killed by Russia's last round of big strikes. On Friday, the resilience of the community, but humanity of the community that comes together. The people are not being cowed, if you will, by these acts of Russian aggression. They are in fact, responding with help for their community, but also with some anger. This is a couple of people we talked to in the aftermath in Uman. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

It's not what's been destroyed that matters he tells us. It's the lost lives. We sent photos of the destruction to our distant relatives in Russia, so they can see what the Army is doing. They didn't reply, he says. (ENDVIDEOCLIP) Resilience, I think is the word there, Max. And this is what I think will be happening today in the citizen places that have been damaged again, their medical services will come in, they will help treat the injured. There'll be counseling perhaps there will be immediate support to try to give people somewhere to live to put clothes on their backs if they've lost the clothes where their houses have been burned down. But the reality is it's not denting people's desire here if you will, to see the country to see the country take bad Islam to have that counter offensive that is somewhere in the not too distant future, Max.",

And also, regulators were not aggressive enough, honestly, with some of the red flags that they had seen. First Republics is a different case altogether. It had so many uninsured deposits that cater to wealthy people along the coast and businesses along the East Coast and the West Coast. And it had account holders who had a lot of money that were above that was above the insured limit. And so when there started to be concerns about banks, people took their money out of the bank, you know, they wanted to just keep the insured limit so they lost $100 billion in customer deposits and it just turned out to be a fatal blow.",

FOSTER (on camera): For many in Britain, the coronation is about more than just another public holiday. There'll be street parties up and down the U.K. and thousands will come here to Buckingham Palace to witness the famous balcony moment to see for the first time the newly crowned King and Queen. Many more will line the streets for the coronation procession just as they did for Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago. The King and Queen will travel in this gilded carriage accompanied by a huge military procession.
