That was an effort that they scrapped in January setting bad timing, but he definitely has a lot of tricks up his sleeve that are his own. I do think one thing that's worth noting though, about Lachlan, which is a little bit different than Rupert. Lachlan, age 52 is really looking at this landscape from a far more digital perspective than Rupert was. I think it's very important to him that Fox has a foothold in streaming, you know, Fox apart to be a free ad supported streaming platform. I think you'll see more of that under Lachlan's reign. HOLMES: Yes. Yes. Great point. So yes, succession, Lachlan is the leader. But his other children, predominantly, the oldest three is after Lachlan, they have their voting shares.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's no secret that there is growing geopolitical tension between the U.S., and Russia and China. All three powers routinely conduct military exercises, clearly trying to demonstrate their strength to each other. And it stands to reason that eventually this competition would start to bleed into an area that I think many people haven't really thought about since the end of the Cold War. And that is their nuclear arsenal. CNN has gotten an exclusive look at the serious investments that all three governments -- China, Russia, and the U.S. -- have put into their nuclear weapons testing sites. The world's three most powerful militaries -- the U.S., Russia and China -- have all been expanding their nuclear testing sites in recent years. The evidence revealed in these commercial satellite images obtained exclusively by CNN. These are the Russian, Chinese and American nuclear testing sites. Novaya Zamiya, a Russian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean; Lop Nur, a dried up salt lake in China's Xinjiang region; and the Nevada National Security site in a desert northwest of Las Vegas. Images from each location show new tunnels, roads and storage facilities constructed within the last five years.
