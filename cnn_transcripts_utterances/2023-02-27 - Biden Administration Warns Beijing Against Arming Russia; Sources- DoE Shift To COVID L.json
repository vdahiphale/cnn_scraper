CNN has just learned the reason for that updated report, three sources telling CNN that the Department of Energy's shift was based in part on the information about the research that the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, the Chinese CDC in Wuhan was doing around the time of the outbreak on a coronavirus variant. CNN has previously reported that the lab was studying coronaviruses in bats, but it's unclear how closely related the variants were to the strain, which started the pandemic. As for the Energy Department's new assessment, it is described as low confidence and it's a minority view, apparently within the Intelligence Community. That said, it still sparked new calls today for transparency from China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

How is that different from what was already known about the work that the lab was doing?DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Anderson, I don't know if we would need more information because we had already known that the two labs in Wuhan, the Chinese CDC, as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they were studying coronaviruses. That was an active area of research for them. And so in order to have more evidence in favor of the lab leak theory, we would have to find that the samples that they were working with in the lab were genetically linked, and were genetically the same as the ones that caused illness in those individuals infected with COVID-19 initially, and we don't have that information. I think the bigger issue here is that we know that there are two plausible theories. We know that there's the lab leak theory, there's also the animal spillover theory, there are data points in both directions. But if both are plausible, then we also need to protect against the next pandemic by working to protect the world against both of these possibilities. So in a sense, it's an all of the above approach, if the goal is actually to improve human health, which is we have to improve laboratory biosafety and at the same time, reduce the likelihood of spill over from animals to humans.",

Intelligence officers don't like coincidence, Anderson.The idea that there were two labs there that were working in this field of all places, is certainly suggestive. But the question that you pinpoint is, was this something milled in a lab? Was this something that could be weaponized? Is that why it spread so fast? Or was this a natural occurrence? And, you know, even going back to the Director of National Intelligence, the National Intelligence Council, the gray beards of the entire spy world and their conclusions, when you go back to the original report, four Intelligence Agencies believed that it was a natural exposure from an animal. One Intelligence Agency, which we believe was the FBI said with moderate confidence, they believed it was a leak from the lab. And three remained unable to coalesce around a given theory because of the Intelligence gaps, the things that we didn't know. So the Department of Energy coming over, gives us a signal, but a confusing one, when they say low confidence.",

And I think we're at that point where I just don't really see the Chinese government at any point soon, opening up their investigative logs and letting independent researchers in.

How important do you think it is to understand where this virus originated? THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK POST\": You know, Anderson, I listened to the previous conversation. We know two things for sure. One is this virus emerged from Wuhan, and the other is that from the very beginning, China has not cooperated in giving international investigators particularly the World Health Organization, the raw data, the raw data that they would need to determine exactly where this virus emerged from and that's been the case from the very beginning.",

I think there are some Chinese officials, military people who are probably saying, you know, the Americans have been sticking it to us all year. They stuck it to us on semiconductors, they stuck it to us on Huawei, our companies, and meanwhile, they've been asking us to stay out of the war. Maybe we should ask them, have a little fire, scarecrow. What if we, you know, threw some weapons into this thing? I guess that is from one school, but I think there's another school that recognize Wait a minute, we've been under COVID lockdown for three years. We decided we're finally going to open up again to the world, invite foreign investors here, send Chinese business people, students and academics out into the world.

It's a hunting property belonging to the Murdaughs. And when the jury goes there, they'll be able to see everything that they've seen in pictures throughout this trial. They'll see the feed room where Paul Murdaugh died. They'll see how close that was to where Maggie Murdaugh's body was found.They'll see the golf cart path that Alex Murdaugh said he took from the main house down to the kennels and back that night and just how close those two buildings are. They'll probably see the gun room where authorities seized all those guns. They'll see the shooting range, but these are all the places that they've seen in pictures.

There's a real loss of control, though, that happens, you know, anytime the jury comes out of the jury box and out of the courtroom.There's a famous example from the O.J. Simpson trial where the jury actually went to O.J. Simpson's house and the defense attorneys had changed the art and the photographs on display to make it seem more appealing to the jury of so they thought. So there's a loss of control and the potential for sort of prejudicial impact on the jury one way or the other based on what they see. And of course, it's not exactly as it was the night of the murders. And that's one of the things the prosecution pointed to in opposing this was just to say, for example, the trees have grown more between the house and the kennels. And I gather one point maybe could the defendant have heard gunshots? If other people were there shooting his wife and his son, would he have heard it from the house?

And again, everyone was wondering why there were two different type of weapons, then I think the state has to own it.

Generally, prosecutors need to convey confidence in their case and their theory of the case and to sort of switch in the last minute I don't think is going to go over very well. But I do think this two shooter theory is going to resonate with the jury because as a matter of logic, and there's always been this question of how could the defendant, if he were acting alone, have used two guns, two really large guns? Why would he use two guns to shoot his wife and his son in very close proximity and in time?And so I think the jury's likely been wondering about that. And now there's expert testimony in the record that the defense can point to and say it's not just a matter of common sense. And you wondering about this from logic, but now there's an expert who's told you he thinks that the evidence is more consistent with there being two shooters than one.",

And quite honestly, once they finish their job, they're out looking to try and put together the investigation.
