The findings are in, but will the public see them?CNN THIS MORNING starts right now. We're going to begin with yet another grim reminder that our nation is suffering from what seems to be a never-ending crisis, a problem that is unique to America. California is reeling from three back-to-back mass shootings. Investigators say a gunman killed seven people at a mushroom farm and trucking facility in a small northern California city of Half Moon Bay. The suspect under arrest. The sheriff says it is believed that he was a worker at one of the locations. Our nation as a whole has already suffered nearly 40 mass shootings this year alone, and it is still January. This deadly month coming after 647 mass shootings last year. Objectively and tragically is an American crisis. Our Veronica Miracle is live with Half Moon Bay this morning with the very latest. Good morning to you. What do we know? VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Don. Some more disturbing news here out of Half Moon Bay. We know that these two shooting locations where this massacre took place happened about five- minute drive from each other. And people work and live at these locations where this took place. It was in the afternoon after school had gotten out, so authorities say that children were present when seven people were killed at the first location. There were four bodies that were discovered by deputies. One person still critically injured in the hospital. And at that second location, three bodies were discovered. And about a little over two hours after that first 911 call came in, a deputy found 67-year-old Chunli Zhao at a police substation where they were able to take him into custody. The mayor saying that those victims are believed to be farmworkers and some of them are Chinese. Very disturbing similarities here at the Half Moon Bay mass shooting to the one in Monterey Park, two suspects who were both elderly Asian men, a lot of disturbing similarities there. Don?",

Hundreds of documents with Trump versus dozens so far with Biden. Also, the way these two have interacted with the Justice Department. Former President Trump is under investigation for possible obstruction. There were also concerns that documents were being moved, which is why the Justice Department executed a search warrant to try to uncover classified information. But also, I don't want to downplay the significance of the Biden investigation. With each new discovery of classified information, legally and politically the risks for him continue to increase. So the attorney general, he has a real challenge here to try to convince the American public that these cases are both being handled in a similar, fair manner.

One is they use NATO standard ammunition, 120 millimeters which makes it a lot easier for NATO allies to provide that ammunition. They have more than the Soviet-made stuff that go to the tanks that Ukraine relies on now. But the problem is it requires, in general, I've spoken to former tank commanders, more support, more training for the crews, that kind of thing.

So, a lot of angry Taylor Swift Fans and, you know, you're talking about the Senate meeting they're holding today. And I think the real question, is Ticketmaster a monopoly? That is, I think, the question that is being asked. And it's being asked, because take a look at the Ticketmaster's share of the market for ticketing and live events, it's 70 percent plus. Major concert primary ticketing. Look at this number, 80 percent plus. So, basically, when it comes to getting your tickets for stuff like Taylor Swift, you got to rely on Ticketmaster because there really aren't really many more options than that.",
