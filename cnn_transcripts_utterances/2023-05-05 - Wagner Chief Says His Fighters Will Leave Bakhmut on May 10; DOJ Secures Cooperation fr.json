HILL:  This morning a significant development in the Trump classified documents investigation. \"The New York Times\" reporting federal prosecutors have secured the confidential cooperation of an insider witness who has worked at Mar- a-Lago. This unnamed witness has reportedly provided investigators with a picture of the storage room where the material had been held. We don't know much else at this point, though, about what prosecutors may have learned from this insider. All of this, of course, part of the broader Justice Department investigation, looking into whether Trump ordered boxes of sensitive materials out of a storage room. That, coupled with reporting you saw first here on CNN about prosecutors showing interest in Mar-a-Lago surveillance tapes, raising questions about where the investigation stands this morning. Let's bring in CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. So Paula, what do -- what should we take from all of this, particularly this new insider witness \"The New York Times\" is reporting about?",

      "sentences": "I'd be cautious about \"The New York Times\" story. It's a big splashy headline from a group of very strong, award-winning reporters, but they don't provide any information about who this person is or what they have provided to investigators beyond a picture of a storage space.And even the story itself says this could be significant, but little is known about what this person has provided. Now, as CNN has reported, pretty much everyone who's ever -- works at Mar-a-Lago right now has been subpoenaed. Everyone from waiters to people in operations, to the director of security. And it's unclear if this person's cooperation is providing some sort of significant evidence or if they're just providing something like pictures of the premises that they may have been asked for by investigators. But as CNN first reported on Wednesday, investigators right now, they are really focused on whether they have all of the security footage from Mar-a-Lago that they need to determine what exactly happened to classified materials once they went down to Florida. We also broke the news that they had -- reportedly had subpoenaed two top security officials, Matthew Calamari and his son, Matthew Calamari Jr., to ask them what exactly happened to this footage after it was subpoenaed. Now, on that footage, the footage they have received, they see something significant in this investigation, something they really narrowed in on, and that is a junior Trump aide, Walt Nauta, and another employee moving boxes out of a storage facility. We subsequently learned that some of those boxes did contain classified materials. And investigators understandably have had a lot of questions about why Walt was moving those boxes out of that storage space, who directed him to do that, where did they go? It's our understanding that Walt has talked to investigators multiple times but has at times given inconsistent statements. People familiar with this investigation on the Trump side say, Look, Walt Nauta, is not cooperating and without his cooperation. It will be very difficult for the Justice Department to bring any case against the former president. But all of this reporting, both from \"The New York Times,\" from CNN, it's clear this is still a very active and ongoing investigation. Even yesterday, we saw new witnesses going before the grand jury.",

The White House needs the debt limit raised, period, end of story. By the way, so does everyone else in the entire country. The entire economy is at stake here and not a lot of time to do it. The issue right now is the White House thought they had a negotiating position that, one, would help them in the near term. They thought they had precedent. The adults in the room would all say, why are you negotiating over the idea of default? This should not even be on the table. This shouldn't be a point of leverage. We should move away from this. The problem right now is Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the House Republicans, passed a bill. Kevin McCarthy has leverage, because he has a bill that's actually passed.

      "sentences": "What an unexpected twist that happened yesterday.So Carroll's attorneys rested their case after calling 11 witnesses. You know, Carroll herself testified. Trump's attorneys said they were not putting on a defense. They thought about calling an expert witness, then didn't. And Trump's attorney had said that the former president was not coming. Then of course, these comments overnight were hanging in the air all day yesterday until the end of the day. The judge asked Trump's attorney, Are you resting your case? This was outside the presence of the jury. He said, yes, I am. He said, does Trump waive his right to testify? He said, Yes. And then the judge said, Well, I'm going to give you until 5 p.m. anyway, kind of acknowledging that Trump's attorney can't control his client. So he's saying, you know, Just to protect the integrity of this trial, I'm going to give you until 5 p.m. to say for sure whether you want to do this. And the judge said, It doesn't mean I'm going to grant it, but I'm going to allow this space. And -- but they then went straight into conversations about the schedule, how closing arguments will take place Monday, and the jury will get it as soon as Tuesday.",
