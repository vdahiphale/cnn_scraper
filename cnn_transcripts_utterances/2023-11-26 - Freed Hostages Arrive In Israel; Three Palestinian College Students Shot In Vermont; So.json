We'll get to you in a moment, Wolf.Now to our breaking news, 13 Israeli hostages are now back in Israel. They were released by Hamas after being abducted and held prisoner in Gaza for 50 days, and among those released today, dual Israeli- American citizen, Abigail Edan who is only four years old. She is the first American released since the four-day truce began between Israel and Hamas and that got started on Friday. We're told 12 of the hostages were taken through the border fence directly from Gaza to Israel, while one was airlifted by helicopter to a hospital. An additional four foreign national separate from today's deal arrived in Egypt earlier today. That group includes three Thai nationals and a Russian-Israeli dual citizen. There are also celebrations in the West Bank where 39 Palestinian teenagers have now been released from Israeli prisons as part of today's agreement. As the truce nears the end of its third day, we are seeing more humanitarian aid arrive in Gaza. Egyptian officials say at least 120 aid trucks entered Gaza through the Rafah border today. Let's hand it over to Wolf in Tel Aviv -- Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right, Wolf.We saw the convoy of 12 Israeli civilian hostages newly freed, coming from right down this road after they entered Israel directly from the Gaza Strip, making their way this way towards the Hatzerim Airbase where they are being helicoptered off to hospitals across Israel prepared to receive them.   This was a different procedure than we have seen over the last two days when Israeli hostages went from Gaza into Red Cross custody and then into Egypt via the Rafah Crossing before coming into Israel at that Kerem Shalom crossing at the intersection of the Egypt-Israel- Gaza border. Why did things change, Wolf? We are told that it is because of the condition of Elma Avraham, an 84-year-old Israeli woman who was taken hostage on October 7, she was actually directly medically evacuated by helicopter from the Gaza Strip and towards a hospital in Israel. Tonight that hospital, Soroka Hospital, in Beersheba says that she is in serious condition saying \"her life is in danger.\" But those other 12 Israeli hostages then just enter directly from near kibbutz Be'eri into Israel. Beyond that, though, Wolf, today, the process went fairly smoothly, which was a big change from yesterday when we saw hours' long delays as there were disputes over the entry of aid into Gaza. There were also disputes I'm told behind the scenes over one of those child hostages not being released with her mother. But beyond that, Wolf, there are now questions about how this moves forward. We are now on Day 3, tomorrow will be Day 4 of this fragile truce between Israel and Hamas, which is set to facilitate the release of 50 Israeli hostages over those four days. And now, there is the question of whether this truce will be extended. Ten additional hostages per day will result in additional day of truce hundreds more aid trucks entering Gaza and also the release of three Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons for every one civilian hostage. Israeli officials have already told me that they intend to seek an extension of that truce. They want to see more hostages released. And Hamas tonight, Wolf, is saying in a statement that it is also seeking an extension of that truce. Of course, what is hanging in the balance, Wolf, is the lives of more than 180 hostages still captive inside Gaza, as well as the potential entry of hundreds more aid trucks desperately needed in the Gaza Strip.",

And so, she has come up repeatedly. It has been a top concern for this White House and for this president. So clearly relief for this president, knowing that she is now released and as you mentioned, he was emotional about this, and again, went on to say that he wished he could be there for that reunion.

As of now the agreement is set to expire tomorrow, and Hamas also released three Thai nationals and one Russian-Israeli dual citizen.Let's bring in retired US Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, the former Commanding General of the US Army - Europe. General, thank you so much for joining us. Let me get your assessment. Has this truce, this temporary truce, this pause that as we're calling it benefited either Israel or Hamas militarily? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET), FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE US ARMY - EUROPE: Well, look, of course, when this pause does end, it will be very difficult for Israel to resume operations as they were doing before the pause. The Hamas strategy from the beginning has been about these hostages. The Israeli strategy has been about destroying Hamas. And so it looks like the US, the United Nations, and other countries are for now going along with the Hamas strategy focused on the hostages. And we even heard the president say as much earlier today. Hamas, of course will string this out as long as they can, but with more promises of hostages being released. That's probably why we've seen so few or only one American released so far, because if they continue to hold American hostages, that will keep the US focused on this and keep the US putting pressure on the Israelis. On the other hand, the Israelis, I think could change the entire narrative. I doubt this would happen. But if they were to change the narrative and say, we've decided, we do accept the idea of a two-state solution. We'll begin negotiations for that as soon as Hamas releases all of our hostages, and then we will focus on also cracking down on their right wingers, the illegal settlements in the West Bank. This is how Israel can change the entire narrative. But right now, Hamas has the advantage.",

They would get this from observation as well as from talking to refugees who had moved south from the northern part of Gaza.On the other side, the Israelis, of course, would be using all of their various intelligence collections platforms, even with the limitations to which they've already agreed. And I would also imagine that they have debriefed or spoken with some of the hostages who have been released that might be able to provide some insight about where, what other hostages are still out there.",

Now, does Hamas have these hostages or are they held by other groups within the Gaza Strip? That appears to be one bone of contention. The other big one is about aid coming into Gaza. This deal has a ceiling baked in, 200 trucks maximum can come into Gaza everyday through the Rafah Border Crossing in Egypt. Many of the Arab Street and many within Palestine, within the Palestinian community would like to see a lot more trucks coming into Gaza being cleared by the Israelis and then allowed to be distributed within the Gaza Strip. Because before October 7th, about 455 trucks came in every day into Gaza. Today, the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA has said that they would need at least 200 trucks coming in daily for two months to meet the needs that they're seeing across the Gaza Strip. And they just told you the last hour that the idea that some places are in more need than others is inaccurate. The needs are overwhelming, and it's everywhere, not just in northern Gaza and the southern Gaza. Everywhere people need water, people need food, people need fuel, people need cooking gas. And so if this were to be extended, there would have to be a lot more aid coming into Gaza and Hamas has got to release a lot more hostages to make this happen -- Wolf.",

We've been through 50 days of just for themselves, but this coming from the October 7th attack that caught Israel by surprise. And so, the Egyptian involvement in this cannot be understated. It's very important and President Biden has said that he has been in contact with the Egyptians, with the Qataris always making sure that every time there's any diplomatic engagement, the Egyptian are involved, Wolf, so best -- it is going to be very important if there's going to be truce expansion here.",

They say at this point, it is still too early to establish a motive, but we have already heard from Muslim and Arab- American communities who says they believe that this is likely a hate crime though again, police are still piecing this case together.Here is what we know directly from Burlington authorities. It was yesterday evening that these three young men, before dinner they were walking near the University of Vermont, though they did not attend there, when who police describe as a White male approached them with a handgun, opened fire, shooting them, injuring them, the three of them currently in the hospital. We do know that the Institute for Middle Eastern Understanding who has been in close contact with the families of these young men, they've confirmed the identities of them now identified as Tahseen Ali Ahmad, who you saw there, in that photo on the left; Kinnan Abdalhamid, who was in the center of that photo, we can put it back up for viewers. And also Hisham Awartani, who is seen on the right. I have a little bit more to share with you what we know about that young man who's seen on the right. We do know that CNN has actually reached out to the Ramallah Friends School in Ramallah, which is where these three young men actually attended school before coming to the US, and we understand that the family of Awartani, specifically, his mother, who is still in the West Bank, is trying to make her way here to the United States to be with her son, though he's in stable condition. We do know based on what we've heard from official sources that he apparently has a bullet lodged in his spine, and so you can just imagine what's happening right now for the mother of that young man, and really the families of all three. But again, we have to underscore what we know from authorities, which is, though they're looking into the possibility that this is likely a hate crime, Burlington Police who is handling this investigation say they're not ready to say that quite yet, but certainly know why that would be one of the priority concerns.",
