Let's start with the idea that an impeachment inquiry is not about evidence, or launching an impeachment inquiry is not about evidence. This is what we've heard from some Republicans. In historical context, is that true? PROF. MICHAEL GERHARDT, UNC LAW SCHOOL: Generally speaking, it's not true. Impeachment inquiries have historically followed investigations which have found credible evidence of presidential wrongdoing. Based on that evidence, then the House proceeds to initiate an impeachment inquiry of the president. That's what happened with Richard Nixon. It happened with Bill Clinton.

And right now, even based on the comments that you just shared from some Republican House members, they don't think there's evidence yet.

But, Erica, it is not a surprise that this is how that January 6th exchange went. He described it as a fringe conspiracy because that is exactly what it is, it is a - it's a conspiracy. And we - and I knew that he would come into it defending it. But one of the things that we wanted to point out to him that led to that exchange was that one of the defendants who's going to serve 11 years in prison cited his use of this conspiracy on the debate stage last week -- and I wanted to know how he responded to that. So, I think folks who watched it last night would have seen, you know, pretty combative exchange, in part because I think that they're just, obviously, on the right right now. And you heard it from the crowd. There is a lot of openness, if not support, for this idea of January 6th. But that aside, I mean I think one thing that I thought was - was interesting in all the other parts of the town hall, this is Iowa. This is a very conservative state. This is a state with a lot of incredibly religious people where the evangelical right is a huge part of it. And he got a question from our audience last night about his faith. He is the only candidate in the race who is not a Christian. He's Hindu. His family came from India. And he was asked about how, you know, his faith would play a role in his candidacy and in his presidency. Ramaswamy was, obviously, armed with an answer. But I think some of the people in the audience were surprised by how well versed he was in Biblical language. He went to a Christian school growing up. I think there was some interesting appreciation for that approach from him. And it just gives you a window into how a candidate like him is trying to make inroads in this state, predominantly white, very conservative, very Christian, not normally amenable to, you know, a brown, Indian man, but he's trying to get at that in other ways as well.",

And, actually, it's for that reason that, you know, when I asked Ramaswamy about whether he thinks the Supreme Court should ban Mifepristone at a national level. To be honest, the answer was not straightforward. He wanted to take this to the administrative side of things. He says, the -- this is about the role of the federal government in regulating drugs. He did not want to make this about abortion per se.I pressed to be clear for the audience. Do you think that the abortion pill should be banned? And he said, I think the Supreme Court will do the right thing. So, look, to me that says that even in this state, which is very conservative, most people in that audience probably oppose abortion, this is still not something that Republican candidates want to be talking about explicitly. They have to talk about it. Their base cares about it. But many of the candidates right now are trying to find this sort of compassionate conservative viewpoint that will give them flexibility if they make it to a general election given that in all these red states that have put referendums out to the public about what they should do about abortion, they have defended abortion rights even in red states.
