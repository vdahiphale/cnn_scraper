Listen for yourself to his assessment of the race. As CNN is learning more tonight about why a big name just pulled out of the veepstakes. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With 99 days left until Election Day, and just 49 of those until early voting begins, there's breaking news on multiple fronts, tonight. And in the Vice President's search of her vice president, potentially, North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, has just confirmed that he has removed himself from consideration, saying in a statement that it wasn't the right time, for him to be on a national ticket. Now, he had been near the top of the VP watchlist. So this is notable. And we'll have more in a moment from our sources about why he withdrew. But there's also breaking news on the other VP front tonight. And that's a recording that was obtained by The Washington Post that reveals Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, telling a private audience something very different than what we've been hearing from the Trump campaign, publicly, about Vice President Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch. The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might say, Kamala Harris is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Do you agree with J.D. Vance that Harris does have less baggage than Biden does? GOV. MAURA HEALEY (D-MA): Well, clearly, J.D. Vance is scared, and Donald Trump is scared. I mean, Donald Trump's gone in the direction of bailing on debates. J.D. Vance is now squirming, and making the comments that he's making. And they should be scared, because Kamala Harris is tough, smart, compassionate. I saw her. I worked with her, as attorney general. And they have every reason to be running scared, at this point. She's an excellent candidate. She'll be an excellent President. Look what she's done this week, Kaitlan. I mean, uniting the Democratic Party, over $200 million in grassroots fundraising, record numbers of voters registered. And I think more than anything, just this palpable enthusiasm for her candidacy. So, no wonder that they are running scared, and saying all sorts of things, and crazy things, and cringy things, like the former President just said about her age. It's just par for the course of these guys. And I think women, across the country, when they hear someone like J.D. Vance say what he said, when they listen to Donald Trump?

I also think that because she's been an attorney general, her job was to stand up, and fight for ordinary Americans, everyday people, right? Fighting against people trying to take their homes, or banks trying to rip them off, or insurance companies that refuse to pay. And I saw that up close and personal, working with her, through those years. And I think that that's the appeal right now, of someone like Kamala Harris, is that she gets it. Donald Trump's going to cut taxes for the rich, and take care of himself. But Kamala Harris is about making sure that people have lower prescription drug costs, making sure that women have access to the health care that they need, and make sure that we're growing an economy that will work for middle Americans. It's as simple as that. And, look, she's made the proverbial case in the past. She knows how to do that.

And little girl said she'd been at basketball camp. And then the VP asked her, what position she played. And little girl said to her, well, I don't know. I like every position. I don't like defense. And the VP joked whether -- she put her arm around her, gave her a big hug, and she said, you know, I like offense too. And it was just this moment of such warmth. It's who Kamala Harris is.

So, I applaud President Biden for coming forward and taking action. I think it's pretty funny and comical to be lectured at, by the likes of Speaker Johnson, on this one, to be honest with you. I don't know what will happen. But substantively, given the court and its stature, or diminishing stature right now, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to look at.

This is a younger, attractive, well-spoken woman, who just has this pop culture sort of vibe to her that Donald Trump kind of felt like he owned that. When it was him against Biden, it's like, oh, I've kind of got the memes and the TikTok on my side. She's dominating him in those spaces. And she's also out-organizing him. That is a huge thing. Like, as we're speaking, there's these White men for Kamala Harris, and all these calls that have been happening. They don't have that operation that she does. And that's organic. That's actually just genuine excitement. I'm personally, as a Republican, surprised by how phenomenal she's been, since she launched. She was not going to be, who I'd say was, the most competitive against Trump. And she's proved to absolutely have confounded him.",

And it comes as investigators are seeking to get Trump's perspective, on what he saw, the day of that attempted assassination. This is all coming, as we are getting newly-released text messages that show that not only did law enforcement spot, the attempted, the would-be assassin, more than 90 minutes before he opened fire. They also lost track of him. At 05:14 p.m. on that day, an officer actually took photos, of the suspected gunman. 20 minutes later, he sent the images, to a group chat, and wrote, \"Kid [leaning] around building we are in... I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you\" want to \"notify\" Secret Service \"snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.\" It was at 06:11 p.m. when those first shots were fired. Joining me tonight is CNN's Senior Law Enforcement Analyst, and the former Washington, D.C. Police Chief, Charles Ramsey. And Chief Ramsey, just when you look at this timeline, and you hear that message of the officer saying that they lost track of the gunman, what do you make of that?",

But nobody challenged him. The fact that now he's saying he had a range finder? I mean, back in my day, we used to call that a clue that maybe there's something that you really do need to take seriously. I mean, why would you need a range finder, unless you plan on doing something, like take a shot at an individual? I mean, this is a former President of the United States. The security has to be tight. You can't say with a 100 percent certainty that you can always protect every single individual, a public figure. There are a lot of factors that go into that. But you sure can make it a lot more difficult. And it was way too easy, for this individual, to take a shot at the former President. And so, there has to be an in-depth investigation.
