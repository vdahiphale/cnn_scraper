The governor signed that bill into law yesterday banning most abortions after just six weeks. CNN's Dianne Gallagher. She's been following the story. Dianne, this, of course, does not strike down this law for good but it does temporarily block it. How long, and what happens from here?",

      "sentences": "So, Jim, we don't know for how long at this point. Judge Clifton Newman today granting that injunction which temporarily blocks that new abortion law banning most abortions after six weeks from going into effect until the State Supreme Court can review it or some other legal action by that state court is taken. Now, this is something that to people in South Carolina sounds familiar because the state Supreme Court actually did strike down a very similar six-week abortion ban earlier this year.In fact, that was something that was discussed many times in both the House and the Senate, while they were arguing and debating this particular legislation with opponents of the legislation saying that it was not different enough from that original bill -- that original law to sustain another Supreme Court challenge. Now, just 24 hours really after the governor signed this bill into law yesterday, well, that is when the judge made this decision. I have a couple of statements that are still kind of coming in right now. South Carolina's Republican Attorney General Alan Wilson telling me we are considering all our options. We've defended the like -- the right to life in court before, and we're prepared to do it again. The Senate President Thomas Alexander also a Republican, saying I remain convinced that the heartbeat bill is a cons -- is constitutional and that the state Supreme Court will agree. However, the president of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, Jenny Black says that our doors remain open and we are here to provide compassionate and judgment-free health care to all South Carolinians. We have a long fight ahead. We will not stop until our patients are again free to make their own decisions about their bodies and futures. Now, look. Jim, there has been a change to the state Supreme Court in South Carolina since they initially struck down the first six-week abortion ban. The author of that opinion was at the time the only woman on the Supreme Court, she has since retired. In South Carolina, once a judge becomes 72 years old, they must retire and be replaced by a man. South Carolina is the only state that does not have any women on its state Supreme Court. And look, lawmakers told me last week -- the end of this week that they thought that they had tweaked this language enough to where it could get by on this new state Supreme Court. That's still to be determined on when they will take this up and what that action will be, Jim. But again, this now means that abortions are legal in the state of South Carolina up to 20 weeks until some action is taken on this new law making it again the most lenient of most states when it comes to access in the Southeast at this point, as neighboring states, including here in North Carolina have passed more restrictive legislation after that Dobbs rulings that the U.S. Supreme Court handed down last year reversing Roe v. Wade.",

They're actually collecting burning debris, putting the fire out, and then taking it away in dumpsters.Now, two people were killed here. The local authorities, Boris, are saying that's nothing short of a miracle because the -- it could have been much, much worse. But the numbers in this clinic were down because one medical shifted left and the other medical shift hadn't got underway. So, there were fewer people there. [14:05:05] But the majority of people in there that were injured in terms of profession, certainly there are six doctors at least who were injured and two people killed. A total of 30 people were injured in what was -- according to the World Health Organization, there has been a systematic targeting of medical facilities and medics across the country throughout this war, with nearly a thousand occasions being recorded by the welfare -- health -- World Health Organization, excuse me. And we saw, of course, a similar pattern in Syria where the Russians were absolutely systematic about the destruction of medical facilities. But this is also a civilian area anyway, where it's difficult to see at night but we're surrounded by residential buildings. There's an apartment block there. There are several more over in that direction, Boris. And for -- because of the targeting of civilians, and above all, the targeting of a medical facility, the French government -- and no doubt other elements within the international community already describing this latest attack as a war crime, which President Zelenskyy inevitably almost calls a terrorist crime, Boris.",

You know, in just looking from afar at that building, that was a thousand-pound or greater bomb that hit that thing.It was a missile or a bomb or something but it was huge. It wasn't just a small thing. And it was purposeful because that hospital is in the middle of a very large town, Dnipro. And again, it just summarizes the Russian way of war.

By way of comparison, there are 24 billionaires -- individual billionaires on the Forbes real times billionaires list that have a net worth greater than that. We begin with CNN's Jeremy Diamond at the White House. Jeremy, as you know, several Democrats say they will not support any agreement that has work requirements for benefits such as Medicaid or food stamps. The president has expressed openness to at least making those requirements stricter, perhaps lowering the age. How is the White House managing that difference there?

And if you need -- if you -- if you want to get something passed here, you're going to need to ensure that we can bring along our caucus. And the same thing falls on the Republican side where you know, both sides here are really working to try and come up with a deal that they can sell to enough of their caucus in order to get some kind of a bipartisan agreement here. Now, there's no question that there has been frustration from some House Democrats with the potential for work requirements to be included in this deal and some other matters. Also some frustration with White House messaging with some of the -- which some of these Democrats see as pretty lackluster so far. But you know, ultimately, there's a recognition that this is going to need to be bipartisan. And look, both sides are working towards this agreement. We've seen potential agreements starting to emerge in terms of a two-year debt ceiling raised in exchange for two years of spending caps. But we know that so many other sticking points still remain, and so there is ultimately no deal until everything is agreed to here.",

Republicans are trying to push for additional work requirements for people who benefit from those programs. Democrats had pushed back. There are a lot of House Democrats, Senate Democrats were concerned about that. The White House inside the room has not gone as far as what the -- what the Republicans want. They've talked about this discussion, but it's very clear that they have not reached any sort of consensus about how they're going to resolve that major sticking point.

She talked about her being a 10-year-old pregnant girl from Ohio. She also referenced the gestational age of this fetus because the reason the girl had to travel from Ohio to Indiana is that Ohio had implemented a six-week ban and she was passed that date only by a few days.They did that of course after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. And so now, this doctor, Caitlin Bernard is going to be fined $3,000. She'll get a letter of reprimand. But this is important, she will be allowed to continue practicing. Now this decision came after a very long hearing. It was more than 14 hours long before they even went to deliberations. I watched much of it and it was fascinating to watch. You're seeing the two sides arguing over what is considered protected health information under HIPAA. That's the federal law that protects patients' privacy. The case as I said, seems from this interview, the state's HIPAA expert argued the information that Dr. Bernard provided a 10-year-old from Ohio who's pregnant could allow that 10-year-old to be identified. Of course, the HIPAA expert on Dr. Bernard's side argued the opposite saying age, state, and pregnancy status are not considered protected health information and are not included among the 18 examples of that kind of information under HIPAA. Dr. Bernard testified that she didn't violate these laws. And she also didn't violate her own hospital's policy. She also had this to say. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. CAITLIN BERNARD, INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH: I don't think that anybody would have been looking into this story as any different than any other interview that I've ever given.
