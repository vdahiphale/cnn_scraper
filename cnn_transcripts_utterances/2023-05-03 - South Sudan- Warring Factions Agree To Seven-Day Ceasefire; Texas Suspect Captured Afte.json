Under this agreement, a seven-day long truce will take effect Thursday.Officials from South Sudan also say both sides have agreed to send representatives to peace talks. But where and when those talks will happen is yet to be decided. Six ceasefires so far, at best bringing a lull in the conflict but the sound of gunfire and explosions continues to be heard, especially in the capital, Khartoum. More than 500 people are confirmed dead in more than two weeks of fighting. But with bodies left piling up in the streets, the real death toll is certain to be much higher.

And as CNN reports, adds this condition, those who do not act on their deviant proclivity will not be punished by law. There are some other minor changes as well.[01:29:47] President Museveni wanted some provision for rehabilitation, what's known as gay conversion therapy. That doesn't appear to be there. But for the most part, this is the same bill passed by parliament a few weeks ago. So will the president sign it into law. And if so, then what happens? CLARE BYARUGABA, LGBTQ+ ACTIVIST AND ADVOCATE: Yes, we think that the president will sign it into law. But as activists and as human rights organization in Uganda we do hope that said, we will demand for the protection of LGBT individuals as well as the protection of human rights each inherent -- for the inherent rights of each Ugandan.",

So while they may have removed the clause penalizing the identifying of being LGBT, it still has a clause that would put me and other individuals in prison for life simply for having consensual, same-sex adult relationships.It also has a death penalty clause, what they say is aggravated homosexuality. It also has a very draconian clause that will target human rights organizations, doctors that provide lifesaving care for LGBT individuals under the promotion of homosexuality clause that is still in the bill. And as far as rehabilitation, it is true that they call rehabilitation will tantamount to therapy. It will tend to amount to acts like corrective rape, because what happens within the criminal justice system against LGBT individuals is unimaginable.

So the Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon that they would be willing to send an additional 1,500 troops to support the Department of Homeland Security's efforts there to help manage that expected surge. Now, importantly, these troops are not expected to perform a law enforcement function at the border, meaning they won't be out in the field, day to day, engaging with migrants. But they are expected to help CBP, the Customs and Border Patrol officials, as well as DHS kind of free up resources, so that that department can then perform its law enforcement functions. So what does that mean? That means that essentially these troops would be doing administrative tasks. They will be doing things like data entry, warehouse support, logistics, things that will essentially keep them behind a desk. But still, the fact that the Department of Homeland Security requested this additional support really underscores just how concerned the administration is about a potential major migrant surge on May 11th, the day that that Title 42 pandemic law is set to expire. And we should also note that these troops are only expected to be there for 90 days. And the administration -- or the Pentagon, I should say, is trying to figure out a way to kind of rotate some of those troops out, and replace them with National Guard troops, so that those active duty service members don't have to be on the border for the full 90 days.
