The former pontiff passing away after what the church calls a period of ill health. Benedict was the first pope to resign as the leader of the church in nearly 600 years, stepping down back in 2013.

So it's a very important legal proceeding. But the arrest took place yesterday morning at 1:30 in the morning right here in northeastern Pennsylvania. Why so far across the country? Because in the press conference yesterday, we heard this is his home, this is where he lives. He does have an apartment, however, in Pullman, Washington. Authorities confirmed that where he is a doctoral student in criminal justice, but he graduated with a master's degree last May right here DeSales University, which is about 10 miles away from here, and that was in criminal justice also. We're also learning more about him in regard to when he was at DeSales University here in northeastern Pennsylvania, that he volunteered for a research project that had to do with the aspect of emotions and feelings. Someone who is committing a crime, how they go through that emotional experience and how they assess it and assimilate it within them, which is a very interesting aspect to all of this. But we do know that the search warrant, according to a source close to CNN, that search warrant affidavit, which is sealed now. But we are learning it was based on the DNA that connected him to the crime scene as well as that white car that we have heard about for so long that was spotted in the vicinity near the time that those four students were so brutally murdered.",

When you look at this entire picture, we know that the parents, as you mentioned, are in jail, in custody right now, and that 11-year-old Madalina Cojocari is still missing.So let's talk about a timeline here because that's what makes this case so interesting. So you're looking at video from November 21. This was the last time we've been able to capture video of her on surveillance video on a school bus. So that's your first timestamp right there, November 21. And then you would have to go to November 23, two days later, when we know that she was report -- last seen by her parents. That's at least what her mother told police. She last saw her on November 23. This is a missing person's poster, an alert sent out by the FBI. And you can see pictures of her there, her height, her age, what we know about her. So the 21st, we see her on the school bus. On the 23rd, her mother says she was last seen. But there's a big gap here, and that's part of the issue. On 11/23 -- November 23, last seen by her parents. But it wasn't until December 15, almost a month later, that she was reported missing by her mother. She went to the school and told them that she hadn't seen her daughter in weeks. That's only after the school started asking questions like, hey, we haven't seen her. Where's your 11-year-old daughter? We haven't seen her in weeks. The school district then immediately called police. And then on December 17, both of her parents, her 33-year-old mother and her 60-year-old stepfather were both arrested and pending this charge in North Carolina for not reporting a child missing, which is a crime in the state of North Carolina. You just can't have your kids disappear without saying anything about it. So that's why they're being held. And now you have this massive manhunt, some 250 leads. Police tell us that they've knocked on more than 200 doors trying to find her, trying to find any surveillance video, photos, anyone who might have seen or heard from her. And Phil, when you think about this timeline, what's also alarming is that we've had major holidays without having Madalina anywhere around. You had the Thanksgiving holiday, anything, and now Christmas, and still no sign of her. Phil?",

This was already scheduled before the news of Pope Benedict happened, but afterwards he's going to come out here and view the nativity scene, which is right there in the middle of St. Peter's Square.So that's why you see a lot of people gathering, so they can get a glimpse of Pope Francis and probably we expect to hear something from him at some point this evening, if not tomorrow. He'll also be holding mass for New Year's Day tomorrow. With regard to Pope Benedict, we know that beginning on Monday, they will have a lying-in state in St. Peter's Basilica. You might remember for John Paul II that happened and the crowds where in, I want to say, millions thronging here in 2005. They will start that on Monday. The funeral is on Thursday, 9:30 in the morning here in St. Peter's Square. So there'll be several days of viewing and people paying respects to Pope Benedict. I don't imagine that it will be anything like what we saw for John Paul II. He was a different kind of pope. He himself requested a simple mass for his funeral. I don't know if you can do anything very simply at the Vatican, but we'll see how they manage that. I certainly think Pope Francis will want to give him a proper send off with all of the honors due to a pope.

You have to remember that Pope Benedict, he was pope for eight years, but he was a major figure in the Catholic Church for many years before that.One of the most important things about him is he was the last person to participate in the Second Vatican Council, the last living pope or cardinal. And that was a major moment in the life of the 20th century of the Catholic Church. And he was an intellectual, Phil. So his real legacy is about the writings that he did, the theology, as we say. You know, what he himself said he thought the most important thing was about people continuing to believe in God, finding a way to understand God. And that God stay in this world, remember, that he lived through the Nazi regime. He lived through communism. His personal experience was one of regimes that wanted to get rid of belief in God. And he saw the totalitarian sort of vacuum that was created for that, the sort of search for power, if one didn't believe in a God, that was his whole point. Then we could talk about his papacy and some of the things he himself said. He wasn't a good manager, but he still managed to do many things during his papacy.

He also claimed and carried huge losses that practically eliminated his tax burden and claimed questionable loan agreements with his children.

Republicans have clearly criticized the release as a political effort. But big picture here. When you think about the broader context, why does this matter? STEVE ROSENTHAL, SENIOR FELLOW, URBAN-BROOKINGS TAX POLICY CENTER: Well, Trump pays very few taxes. We saw in the 2015 to 2020 period, zero taxes in 2020, and really negligible taxes earlier. Looking back over three decades, Trump's paid very, very few taxes. And it's important, actually, to see the returns that the committee released, because tax returns are a window into a person's financial character. We learn whether a person is generous, whether a person has financial conflicts, whether a person views taxes as a shared responsibility or a sport.

And if you go back to the 1990s and 2000s, he loses tens and hundreds of millions of dollars.Now, we can't tell precisely with the most recent years, how many of those losses are genuine and how many are fake. But when I've looked closely at the losses from the 1990s and the 2000s, they look inflated. This is not a lawful application of law. This is not depreciation.

So this has grown very rapidly. Having said that, this doesn't close the issue because TikTok can still be used on anybody's personal phone. There's no laws against that. Congress does have pending some legislation that would completely ban it in the United States, as might India has done. But whether that's going to go through or not, is very unclear.",

You know, the White House, from a communications perspective, is very cognizant of the need to get their message out on TikTok. And yet, obviously, White House officials don't use the app themselves on their government phones.But TikTok is huge. It has a billion users worldwide. One third of Americans use it. Do you think it's feasible to have or to push for an outright ban for all users in the United States? How do you see this kind of playing out? GERSTELL: Probably not. My guess is we probably won't get to that point for two reasons. One, the one you pointed out Phil, which is that it's immensely popular. The fact is, two out of three -- two out of every three American teenagers use it. One out of every three Americans generally use it. So it's immensely popular. It's not intrinsically evil. There's a lot of fun and useful information on TikTok, and so taking it away would be very difficult for just popularity reasons. Secondly, there's a First Amendment concern. We've taken steps to limit Chinese technology in the United States. We've banned Huawei telephone equipment, for example, for national security reasons, and it's taken some other steps about Chinese surveillance technology in the United States. But we haven't really taken a position on a communication social media app that way. And it raises some First Amendment questions which we'd have to work through.",

I recognize the value, but like many others in the national security arena, I'm concerned about the risks, and I just simply don't use it at all. As for my kids, well, first of all, we have to make the assumption that they'll listen to Dad's recommendations, which is not at all clear in terms of social media, but let's assume they did.And I would tell them really three things. I would say, number one, think carefully about whether you really need this app and what devices you're going to use it on. If you use it on a phone that already has your Social Security information, your financial information, credit cards, et cetera, you're probably taking a big risk. If you could limit your use to some other device, a laptop that doesn't have all that, you're taking a step in the direction of a little more safety. Not totally, but it's a factor. Secondly, I would say don't share contacts, your Facebook contacts, your Google contacts, your phone's contacts with the app. The app just automatically does that. It vacuums up your other contacts, and you're just asking for trouble in that regard. And you can, using TikTok settings, negate that possibility, turn off that sharing feature. And then finally, don't log into -- I would tell my kids, don't log into TikTok through another social media app. You can log into it directly. If you log in through Facebook or Snapchat or Google or Instagram or whatever, yes, it's true, you don't have to remember another password, but, wow, you are just connecting two vacuum cleaners together.
