A power pact, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un striking a major deal, as CNN speaks to people inside Russia about Trump's promise to end the conflict in Ukraine. And John Avlon, he is back OUTFRONT. And tonight, he'll tell you what he learned from the campaign trail, where he spent every day and why he is full of hope. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, rewarding loyalty. Donald Trump wasting no time paying back his strongest supporters tonight. Moments ago, asking the Florida Congressman Mike Waltz to be his national security advisor. Waltz is a longtime and vocal Trump supporter, retired colonel in the National Guard, former Green Beret. Also, Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner who is returning as deputy chief of staff of policy. Even more power than he had in the first Trump administration when he had quite a huge influence. And his devotion to Trump though ever since, has been extremely loud and very clear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That is really the epicenter of where everything is going on. We're told that many people are booking hotels, booking these rental properties, trying to maneuver their way in with members already of Mar-a-Lago to get their way in, to appear in front of Donald Trump, one to try and get their names in front of him for these potential roles, but also to try and influence him as well. Now, I think your point about loyalty is so crucial here from every single pick we've seen, Donald Trump announce in the last 48 hours or so, they have all been people who have been loyal to Donald Trump, and I think the timing of their loyalty is also crucial. That is what I am told in my conversations with Trump advisers. It's the people who did not abandon him after he had left the White House in January of 2021, after many people had distanced themselves from the former president following the January 6th Capitol attack. These people Stephen Miller, Susie Wiles, Mike Waltz, Elise Stefanik, all of them stayed loyal to Donald Trump and we're seeing them be rewarded right now. Now, I think I do want to talk a little bit about Mike Waltz, because him being the national security advisor is a big deal. I think he's going to have a very big portfolio and a lot to dig in on, especially given the wars right now in the Middle East and in Ukraine. Now, he is going to be the first Green Beret to this role. He served in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Africa, you know, he's going to have a lot of experience from the war side itself. But again, he has also been one of Donald Trump's biggest defenders. You've seen him on television over the entire campaign coming out, particularly after all of the drama around Donald Trump visiting Arlington cemetery. People saying that he was in the wrong for appearing at a certain grave sites. Mike Waltz was out there defending Donald Trump. So that's a big thing. He's also been seen at Mar-a-Lago. Now, another person we've seen at Mar-a-Lago is Elon Musk. You're absolutely right that his influence is incredibly great right now with Donald Trump. And also, I'm told from my discussions with people familiar with this, is that many lawmakers are calling up Elon Musk, and he's also calling up lawmakers right now as the jockeying continues, particularly as we're looking at the formation of that Senate leadership fight, and Musk putting his finger on the scale there for Rick Scott.",

The one thing Trump did well it was kind of dastardly from a Democratic perspective, but he did it well. He identified he put himself on the side of the people who were outside going against the institutions. Democrats have to not defend institutions that people don't think are taking care of them. So it's time for Democrats to figure out how do they get on the right side of those institutions. And what I'm worried about with the administration is and the Clinton administration which is where I started when I was a kid.

You've just seen it from Fico, who runs Slovakia just in the last couple of hours. You wouldn't have seen that before Trump won the presidency. So right now, Putin understands that he has the ability maybe to drive a wedge in Europe and start to get some normalization of relations from countries that consider him a pariah.

What I want is to get things that I want individually with all countries around the world in bilateral relations, and I'm going to do that with the Russians. I'll do it with the North Koreans.

      "sentences": "Some riders carry Chinese flags, others sing the national anthem. State media even released this viral video students chanting about their passion.Then came the crackdown. Authorities closed key bike lanes this weekend, citing safety and traffic concerns. Bike sharing companies issued warnings. Some colleges restricted students from leaving campus. All temporary measures police say. Authorities insist the situation became unmanageable. Traffic disruptions from abandoned shared bikes, massive youth gatherings, all of it happening in China, an authoritarian state led by a party that itself came to power with the help of mass movements, often led by students. From Tiananmen Square in 1989 to the COVID lockdown protests of 2022, large organized student gatherings rattle the ruling party's nerves. Even if participants insist they are not political. It also happened in Shanghai, the site of huge Halloween celebrations last year. This year, heavy crowd control, police escorting away plenty of people in Halloween costumes.

They were excited to see students out there having fun, going to get those delicious soup dumplings and yet when it got too big, too popular, we now have this.",
