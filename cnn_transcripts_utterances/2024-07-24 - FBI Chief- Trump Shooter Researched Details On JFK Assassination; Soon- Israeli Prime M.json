Netanyahu's unpopularity at home in Israel, the enormous Palestinian suffering in Gaza, and the U.S. optimism, about a possible ceasefire deal.How is the prime minister going to balance all of this when he speaks to lawmakers in the next few minutes, who are deeply divided over Israel's war in Gaza. FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, \"FAREED ZAKARIA, GPS\": You have characterized it exactly right, Wolf. It is a controversial speech at a controversial time. And the best way I can put it in context is to quote Ehud Barak, a former prime minister of Israel, predecessor of Bibi Netanyahu, also from the right side of the political spectrum. Who said Bibi Netanyahu is doing the speech for two reasons, both of which are highly political. One is to shore up his own position at home where, as you say, he is not only unpopular but there is a growing movement on the right from people like Naftali Bennett to replace him. The second is to embarrass President Biden at a time that President Biden is pressing him to accept a ceasefire deal, to change the military strategy in Gaza, which many people regard as having been counterproductive. So the reality is he is doing it at a time that's fraught both for him at home, he's also causing controversy and causing divisions in Washington. But Benjamin Netanyahu has always played the card of what -- what will help him in the short term survive and thrive. It's worth trying because, you know, you never know. You live for the next day.",

Given that, and also, I just want you to weigh in on what we've heard from our reporter out on the streets with some people protesting outside, talking about the need for a ceasefire, talking about the need for a partner, a negotiating partner that will bring peace and bring a sort of civilized society, if you will, into Gaza. Can you just talk about the reality there? Because that might be missing here in this discussion. Hamas is still a terror organization, is in charge of Gaza. So what needs to happen and what does the prime minister need to say today to acknowledge that that is something that he would like to have if he actually might address that?",

Because what he has done -- I mean, the international courts are trying to get an arrest warrant for war crimes, right? This is hardly your normal visit of a world leader. And I think what's happened is a horrific attack on October 7th by a terrorist group, Hamas. But the response has been almost equally horrific, 40,000 people almost, 70 percent women and children killed. This is not a response to Hamas. This is a collective punishment of Gazans, of Palestinians in Gaza. And that's wrong. And that's not going to bring about peace. And that's certainly, right now, not returning the hostages.

Because Benjamin Netanyahu, again, is not here, I think, to try to win U.S. support or do anything. He's here to take care of himself, which is, quite honestly, what Benjamin Netanyahu does best. I even -- I really wish that we would listen to the vast majority of people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. The longstanding U.S. position has been a two-states solution. Netanyahu does not support that. And I don't, you know, really think that this is a good idea to have him here today, especially as international courts are literally really trying to get arrest warrants for war crimes.

This is about taking care of Netanyahu. And I'm way over that. BLITZER: On the domestic political front -- I don't know if you saw our brand-new CNN poll just released last hour, which shows the vice president, Kamala Harris, within the margin of error in a match show up with Donald Trump, higher numbers than President Biden's numbers against Trump before he left the race.

Well, now they've got a spin off with someone with energy, with an agenda that the American people want. They don't have to just vote for the same old. They now have this other opportunity.

I mean, a lot of them we're saying that the police are denying him their First Amendment rights to march a little bit more toward the capital, where we know the capital and its very close environs have been cordoned off, fenced off. That we could see when they we're marching up here that they we're not going to be able to get past this point. And they got a little frustrated with that. Hence, the confrontation a short time ago.
