While speaking on Capitol Hill, Yellen pointed to some of the positive headlines that we have been seeing, like a healthy job market, cooling inflation. Yet, many Americans say despite these apparent signs of improvement, they just aren't feeling it. With a recent CNN poll finding a majority of people believe President Biden's policies have actually worsened economic conditions in the country.Let's talk about this with CNN's Matt Egan. All right, Matt, what stood out to you the most during this hearing today?",

We've got -- it's been 50 years since we've had a string of unemployment rates this long under 4 percent. And job creation remains utterly robust.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

And even some of President Biden's biggest critics are changing their tune a bit.Former Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow, he apologized for wrongly predicting a recession. Now, none of this is to say the economy is perfect. Even Yellen, she acknowledged that inflation remains a problem, that families are suffering from high prices. And there are some risks out there. Even as Yellen was speaking, we saw that shares of New York Community Bank Corp fell by 15 percent. As she was speaking, those losses have accelerated down by about 25 percent right now. This is a regional bank. It's lost more than half of its value over the past week after warning of major losses and surprising investors with a quarterly loss. Now, this is bringing back some bad memories of the banking crisis last March. Back then, the big concern was spiking interest rates. Now the concern is empty office buildings and what that means for the $20 trillion commercial real estate market. The big problem here is that obviously a lot of people are working from home these days. So that means that some office buildings are vacant. And inevitably, some landlords, they're not going to be able to pay their debt. So, some banks are going to lose money here. Now, Janet Yellen was asked about this issue. And she said U.S. officials are monitoring the ongoing stress in the banking market very closely. She said that she is concerned about real estate losses. And she did concede that some banks will be stressed by this problem. So, Brianna, we need to keep an eye on this, even as a lot of the other economic indicators out there are positive.",

I think both sides want to, you know, develop their relationship, get it back on track. And any -- anything that comes out of it, anything that could be inflammatory that hits the public gets in the way of that. So, I think they've intentionally not responded to our questions or anyone's questions about that meeting. Maybe they see it as private.

Blinken says he's bringing Hamas' response to Israel on what will be his last day -- his last stop of a days-long trip to the Middle East. We have CNN's Alex Marquardt here with more on this.

      "sentences": "Well, Blinken in that press conference has said there's still a lot of work to be done, but he said an agreement is possible. And what I'm told by someone who is familiar with these discussions is that the counterproposal by Hamas was not a yes or a no, we reject the deal that's on the table, that it was, in this source's wording, reasonable.And the reason it was reasonable is because Hamas had been expected to demand two big things, an end to the war, which Israel is not willing to do, and the removal of Israeli troops from Gaza, which Israel is also not willing to do. So, what this tells me is that all the parties are now working towards a middle ground, a pause in the fighting, where we will see, at least in an initial phase, hostages released. There are more than 130 hostages who are still believed to be held in Gaza. At least 30 of them are believed to be dead. And so, this is moving in a positive direction. The prime minister of Qatar said that the response from Hamas was positive. This was a long- awaited response because we knew that there had been a meeting in Paris about a week and a half ago when everybody but Hamas had agreed on this framework. So, we've been waiting for this for about a week and a half, and here they've come back with something that, from the sounds of it, moves the ball forward. Now the next challenge is going to be taking this Hamas proposal, and we don't have a ton of details on this, to the Israeli government. And then, of course, the assumption is if the Israeli government were to approve of it, then a deal could be put into place to get to a humanitarian pause. The thinking is it would extend around six weeks at least at first, and the first wave of hostages could start coming home.",
