It was all about how he was complaining about retribution and vengeance and telling the American people, if this can happen to me, it can happen to you, which we all know that's just garbage and gibberish. And if you want to look at polls, let's look at the polls that have come out after this conviction that says that the majority of the American people, including independents, say that this was a fair trial, say, don't believe all of the lies and conspiracy theories coming out of Donald Trump's mouth and of his MAGA allies' mouths saying that this was rigged. So, the more that Donald Trump and his MAGA allies and lemmings and puppets try to continue to focus on that this was a rigged system, that this is all about Democrats trying to take down Donald Trump, it plays into that message that Donald Trump is in this for himself, that he's in this to try to stay out of prison, and that frees up Joe Biden and his campaign to continue communicating the message that he is in it to continue to help the American people.",

But Joe Biden has to continue to lean into this immigration issue and find a balanced approach, strong border security, which Democrats have all always been about, as well as expanded legal pathways. That's what the American voters want. And that is the real solution. But we know that Donald Trump and Republicans absolutely do not want to solve this issue.

If you look at how many people actually said, look, my symptoms went away completely in the MDMA group versus the placebo group, the results were even a little bit more promising. You had about 71 percent of people who - in that - in that MDMA group who said their symptoms went away completely versus about 48 percent in the placebo group.
