I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.The House of Representatives is about to begin voting on a high stakes government funding package that is looking to push through once again at the 11th hour. In the nick of time, both chambers have to pass the bill by the end of the day to avoid a partial government shutdown. It's not clear if Speaker Mike Johnson has the votes just yet. He's facing backlash not just for Democrats but from within his own party. One Congresswoman saying the Republican majority is, quote, a complete failure. Those aren't the words of a progressive. They're from none other than Marjorie Taylor Greene. She says she is done with this Speaker of the House. But the big question hanging over Washington right now is, can the legislation make it through the Senate and its sausage making process before the midnight deadline. CNN congressional -- chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill for us. Manu, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, this bill is expected to pass according to top Republicans but not without some pains, particularly coming from the right. The far right of the House Republican Conference is absolutely furious at their leadership for cutting this deal. Remember, this deal was about six months after the fiscal year actually began. And they had approved short term extension after a short term extension, ultimately keeping the government open, kicking the can down the road.That first short term expansion led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy after a revolt from the right flank. Now Speaker Mike Johnson, the new speaker, had to cut a deal with Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader in the Senate and the White House to fund the rest of the federal government to the end of this year. And that is what a number of Republicans on the right are concerned about. They believe this deal does not go far enough and cut spending. And the process, this bill was unveiled yesterday morning at 3:00 a.m. It's going to have to pass today in order to avoid a government shutdown by midnight tonight. And they say there's simply not been enough time to review this 1,000-page bill. And that is one warning from one member in particular, Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia who's suggest that perhaps this could be an effort to try to oust Speaker Mike Johnson because of the way he has handled this. And she just took to the House floor also raising major concerns about this bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Madam Speaker, it is the will of our voters and it is the will of Republicans across the country that this bill should not be brought to the, that this bill will absolutely destroy our majority and will tell every single one of our voters that this majority is a failure.

Manu Raju up on Capitol Hill, thanks so much.In the meantime, clock also ticking for Donald Trump, he now claims he has $500 million in cash just days before his massive bond payment is due in a civil fraud case. Until this morning, the former president was adamant that it was impossible to come up with that kind of money after 30 insurance companies refused to underwrite his bond. The New York Attorney General has already taken the first steps toward possibly seizing Trump's assets. And joining us now is defense attorney, former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. You know, Shan you know, it's hard to follow the bouncing ball here with Donald Trump. He's previously said I'm a billionaire, I have billions of dollars. Then he was saying just a little while ago, he doesn't have the money that raising this half billion dollar bond payment would be impossible. Now he's saying he does have the money.

Adam, I do want to ask you about all the Trump stuff in a second. We are watching this vote in the House right now to avert a government shutdown. And I guess we should note that Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has sort of threatened with a motion to vacate that she may make a maneuver to oust the House Speaker Mike Johnson, because some of the folks in the Freedom Caucus are furious over, you know, this deal that they've cut.

The idea that the Democrats aren't going to get anything is pretty ludicrous. And this is just how government works, the Constitution. This is what the Constitution, you know, pretend. So is she going to try a motion to vacate? I don't know. In a way, I think it could be interesting if she does to see if Mike Johnson just says, OK, fine. That's delayed, because you can delay that motion to vacate. And by the way, since you're doing that, the next bill I'm putting on the floor before we go to recess, is the Senate Foreign or the Senate Foreign Aid Bill. That would be an interesting reaction.

He was basically a ceremonial job. But he was doing this to threaten them. He wanted Mike Pence to bear the brunt of this illegal activity and take it off his own shoulders.We see Donald Trump do this all the time. He brings other people into his charade to try to get them to take the hit look at all the people that are in jail around Donald Trump except Donald Trump. So it's sad. And Mike Pence gets a lot of credit again for not just doing the right thing that day.

We need to pursue this. A year later, after we've already done the investigation and they had more tools at their disposal, so I think it's fairly obvious that they were delayed.
