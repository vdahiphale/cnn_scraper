Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. We are now just 22 days until election day. Millions of early votes already have been cast in a race that new polling shows is getting tighter than ever. Over the weekend, the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll has Kamala Harris with a slim 50-to-48 lead among likely voters nationally. No clear leader. Just last month, Harris had a five-point lead in this same poll. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's going to be a tight race until the very end. And we are running as the underdog, so we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work! Hard work is good work! And with your help, in 23 days, we will win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The fact is that I think you asked anyone in the Harris campaign in July and August, they would say they expected this race to come back, that there was a little bit of a sugar high.And the Trump campaign felt the same way, too. They felt that this was a 50-50 race in the very beginning. And really, it just comes -- and that's actually why these last three weeks are so critical. Because the fact is that Kamala Harris has only been on this national stage in this way as a nominee for 90 days. How she performs these next 90 days -- most people have made up their minds about Donald Trump. It's really about how she performs these next 22 days that could determine this race.",

This was always going to be a really tight race.And I do think it matters how she performs the next 22 days. People don't know her. And so, watching her leadership style, watching how she reacts as some of these attacks in the polls, I think, shows what she's going to do as a president and how she's going to be a leader. And I think people who -- who are undecided are watching her and making sure that she's up to the task. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, the series we've seen of polls over this weekend with NBC and others, I mean, have belied, I think, the strategy that we have -- the strategy tone we've -- we've seen over the last week or two of the Harris campaign. Far more anti-Trump messaging. The housing plan isn't really going anywhere now. And you also hear a little bit more about kind of a little bit more trolling now. I think they realize they're in a desperate spot, including the fact over the last week they've really made this really outsized push for male voters. You see the gender gap and a lot has been talked about our gender gap. They have a gender gap, which according to the NBC News poll, was wider than ours is.",

In 2016, he ran on, you know, migrant crime, as well.In 2018, during those midterms, he said there was a migrant caravan coming to the border when there wasn't, and they lost the 2018 midterms. In 2020, he also ran on this kind of anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it again. It is -- it has gotten worse the closer he gets to November. And I think that, you know, he and his campaign are also -- part of his strategy in trying to convince the American public and trying to convince his base that eventually, if he gets into office, then they shouldn't be surprised by what he does. He's saying out loud that he wants to potentially use the National Guard; that he wants to conduct mass deportations; that he may very well even use the National Guard against American citizens. So, the American public shouldn't be surprised if he and Stephen Miller end up pursuing that. On the race tight -- you know, the race being tied, it was always going to be tight. And yes, maybe right now it looks like it's leaning a little bit towards Trump. But there's some recent polling that I think is striking in terms of Harris is still ahead of Trump when it comes to, when voters are asked, who do you -- who do you think cares about you the most? They say her, which I think is interesting. And also, I was just in Arizona and Nevada. And there are a number of Republican women that I spoke to, lifelong Republicans, who said they're not voting for Trump this time around. And a lot of that has to do with abortion, and a lot of it has to do with his character. And so, economy and immigration may rate high on, you know, when you're asking for head-to-head polls. But a lot of times when you talk to voters, they make their decision based on character.",

Fortunately, they were able to pull the man to safety. And then there's this. Oh, my God. Apparently humans not the only ones needing rescue. People in Lithia, Florida, wrangling a pig that had escaped and was wandering near a gas station. As you can see, the pig had no interest in going. In the wake of Hurricane Milton, dozens of other animals have also been rescued from floodwaters. Wow. All right. Time now for weather. Time to finally get out those jackets.
