In the past few hours, California, California's Secretary of State, released a certified list of candidates Thursday night for the March 2024 presidential primary that includes former President Donald Trump.California's lieutenant governor worked to remove the former president from the ballot based on his involvement in the January 6th insurrection. This came hours after a second U.S. state barred Trump from the ballot in its Republican presidential primaries. The decision based on the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says in Section 3, officials who, quote, engaged in insurrection cannot hold office in the future. Maine's top election officials said the bipartisan group that brought the challenge provided compelling evidence that the January 6th, 2021 insurrection occurred at the behest of Trump. Colorado made a similar decision a few weeks ago, and another challenge is pending in Oregon, but other states have rejected the move. The chair of Maine's Republican Party said Secretary of State, Shenna Bellows, simply doesn't like Trump. But Bellows insists that the U.S. and state constitutions left her with no choice.

You see that you have different states that are saying he did not engage in an insurrection. Then you have the decision by Colorado. Now you have the decision from Maine and you have many pending decisions from other states that are also looking into it. So it's difficult to set one set standard to make that determination. Did this former president who's been twice been impeached, who's been four times indicted, did he engage in an insurrection? We already know that the January 6th Committee determined that he did. You have Colorado courts that said that he did. And now you have the secretary of state of Maine say you engage in an insurrection.

A hospital director says 21 people were killed after an apparent Israeli strike on a residential building in Rafah.An Israeli military spokesperson says Rafah is supposed to be a designated humanitarian area, but claims Hamas fighters are hiding among the civilians. The Hamas-controlled health ministry says the death toll in Gaza now exceeds 21,300 all since October 7th, though CNN cannot independently verify those figures. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says talks to free the remaining hostages in Gaza are ongoing. He met with hostage families in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Ronen Neutra's son was serving as a tank commander near Gaza, and he's been missing in action since October 7th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We are, Bianca. This report outlines the tragic sequence of events that led to Israeli soldiers killing three Israeli hostages on the battlefield in Gaza on December the 14th. What this report outlines is missed clues, missed opportunities to rescue these three hostages, missed things like a note saying hoshiya, save us, scrawled on a piece of paper, or SOS help three hostages being written on a building and that being captured by drone footage.What seems to have happened, according to this report, is that the soldiers thought that when they saw these three hostages wandering around the battlefield shirtless, holding up a makeshift white flag, that this was an attempt by Hamas militants to entrap them, as they had done in the past, to go into a place where they could then be ambushed. What seems to have happened, according to this report, is that the soldiers, when these three hostages came out, they fired at them. They killed two of them. A third ran into a building and then called out for help in Hebrew. The commander called for the hostage to come out, ordering his soldiers to hold fire. But two of them didn't hear the order, apparently because of the noise from a nearby tank, and shot and killed this third hostages. So Israel says that it failed in its mission in this situation, and it has drawn lessons and conclusions, in particular, the possibility that hostages could be just wandering around the battlefield rather than be hiding in tunnels or only being able to be reached by some kind of special operation. And Bianca, it's also worth noting the context here, which is that since Hamas kidnapped more than 200 people as part of its murderous rampage through Israel on October the 7th, only one hostage has been rescued alive by Israeli soldiers, that of a female soldier. No other hostages have been freed by Israeli forces. Only those hostages released by Hamas as part of that exchange, during that truce, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. Only those ones have been released alive to Israel -- Bianca.",

Now, we've already seen attacks from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, firing drones and missiles towards Israel's southern city of Eilat. And we've seen pretty much since the get-go Hezbollah, which is also an Iranian proxy, firing from southern Lebanon towards Israeli positions and Israeli communities.Tens of thousands of people there in the north have been forced to leave their homes and cannot go about their daily lives. And just on Thursday, more than 50 attacks, missiles, rockets, drones fired towards Israel, including one that set off air raid sirens in the suburbs north of Haifa, one of Israel's most important cities, home to Israel's biggest port. And the situation, I think, Israel is getting to the point where its patience is running out. It feels that it has been relatively measured in its responses to Hezbollah so far. But as Benny Gantz said on Thursday, as we also heard from the foreign minister Eli Cohen, we've heard from Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, from the defense minister Yoav Gallant, if Lebanon doesn't rein in Hezbollah, or if Hezbollah does not rein itself in, then Israel will be forced to take matters into its own hands. And that would mean another front opening up for real, rather than this kind of war that isn't a war, that's been going on for weeks now and has yet to be, I suppose, declared as another official front. But there are grave concerns that this will escalate, and this could be perhaps a much serious -- a more serious war than the one that's going on in Gaza, at least from Israel's perspective -- Bianca,",
