We're in the final hours of voting in a high-stakes special election in New York's third congressional district. What will the outcome in this one swing district tell us about what might happen this November? Plus, $95 billion in aid for Ukraine and Israel passing the U.S. Senate at around 5:30 this morning after an all-night session. But in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson declares aid for those U.S. allies, all but dead. Democrats do have some options to force a vote though, and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries will join us soon. And dumb, shameful, un-American. President Biden unleashing a blistering response to former President Donald Trump's comments about NATO. We'll play that moment for you in a sec. (MUSIC) TAPPER: Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we're going to start with our political lead. A monster nor'easter is colliding with a battleground special election for a single House district up for grabs in New York. In the context of a razor thin Republican majority in the House. Right now on Long Island and parts of Queens, the fight for New York's third congressional district is in its final hours. Yes. This is the vacant seat previously held by a serial fabulist, Republican Congressman George Santos, who was ejected from Congress in an extremely rare vote. Democrat Tom Suozzi, who represented that district for three terms, he wants his seat back, but he has to beat Republican newcomer Mazi Pilip to get it. This race has national implications and could provide both parties with a preview of how Americas suburbs and battleground areas might vote come November, voters have been primarily focused on the issues of inflation. The war in Israel and Gaza, and abortion rights throughout this race, but no issue has proven more important than immigration and the border and the migrant crisis that's playing out in nearby Manhattan. A lot is on the line. Joining us now is CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox, who's live for us in East Meadow, New York, at the headquarters of Republican candidate Mazi Pilip. Lauren, you recently heard from the candidate, from Ms. Pilip. How does she feel about her chances tonight?",

It wasn't like this a few hours ago, it was empty. And that's because of the weather here.People walk in, they come to one of these tables, they get their ballot. There are seven election districts here in this town, precincts. You pick up your ballot, you vote, and then you end up putting it in one of the machines. Now, as we've been saying, the story here today is turnout, and to give you some perspective, Jake, in the third congressional district in 2022, I'm going to slow down because I'm going to walk into a voter here. And there were no voters here before, in 2022, 192,000 voters voted on Election Day in the third congressional district, 192,000 Election Day voters two years ago. Today, as of 3:30 p.m. only 39,000 voters voted on Election Day versus about 80,000 who voted early. Now, as one of these voting machines, I was telling you before, people vote, they put their ballots into these voting machines. I can't shoot the screen behind you, but in this machine, 149 people have put in ballots. There's a number that accounts how many ballots but to be the 150 of the ballot in this voting machine. There are seven of them. You can get a sense and of how few people haven't voted, even though it is crowded here now, you're dealing with dozens of votes in each machine as opposed to hundreds, maybe even thousands. If this was a more a busier election day, I'm just going to make my way outside here, Jake, because were going to talk to a voter. We can talk to voters inside. And again, it is really remarkable that were in the myths of all these people now, because a little bit earlier, there was no one here. They waited for the storm to end.

This is a maybe a local special election, but it has overriding national consequences if Tom Suozzi wins, Speaker Johnson's margin is cut even further. It's down to a few votes. And we saw what happens when you can't count on your margin when they fail to impeach Secretary Mayorkas last week. So it's a real psychological blow.

Democrats have actually been overperforming and they've actually been leading President Biden by an average of about 4 percent in those specials.But this is different. New York 3 is different and it's different because of what we just heard on this broadcast by your guests. There is a massive, deep concern about immigration. And why is that? Why is it salient here? Not as salient elsewhere? Because every several days, there's another headline about a caravan of busload of migrants arriving in New York sent by Governor Abbott in Texas and others. There are photographs, you turn on the news. That is the dominant narrative. And, Jake, particularly in a special election where you don't have a lot of time to refine your message and take control of the message, you are reacting to real time headlines.

And I think Trump was reflecting that a little, that kind of squeeze again, negotiating here position of toughness, and look, Americans realized that the reasons that the Germans and the French have eight- week vacations in the summer and they've got great health care and universal education for everybody is because we, the United States taxpayers, have been bur -- shouldering the burden of defending the European continent for 50 years.

We had a U.S. official just a little earlier saying that those talks were productive and serious, but did not arrive at any sort of breakthrough that would result in a final agreement though negotiations are said to be ongoing.The major sticking point the matter of disagreement at this stage according to another U.S. official familiar with the matter is the ratio of Palestinian prisoners that would be exchanged for hostages, Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas. A lot of pressure mounting from the international community and we have heard from Hamas official telling CNN that the next 24 hours will be in assessing the state of those negotiations. All lies, of course, very much still on Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, and the potential for a ground operation there, and what that will mean for those talks and negotiations -- Jake.",

The woman seven-year-old son, whom she had brought along with her was critically injured in the crossfire and now the shooter's mother-in-laws speaking out, calling it a completely preventable horror. CNN's Ed Lavandera has been following the story closely and joins us now. Ed, we know police are still working to determine a motive. What more are you learning from the shooter's mother-in-law?",

The mother-in-law of 36-year-old Genesse Moreno, the woman who was shot and killed here by two off-duty police officers says that her former daughter-in-law suffered from mental illness.And she also detailed the extent to which the family tried to seek help for her over the years. She spoke with CNN affiliate KHOU. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALLI CARRANZA, MORENO'S FORMER MOTHER-IN-LAW: She threatened her husband's life. She threatened mine. She threatened to kill her own son, and we still couldn't get intervention. We asked for help from CPS or Child Protective Services, family services. We've asked for help from police and received it many times. But she was still allowed to own guns. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And when family members seek emergency protections, there doing so for their own sake, but for the sake of the person who is ill.The mother, she said, reached out to Child Protective Services multiple times. We reached out to Child Protective Services here in Texas, they say that because of privacy issues, they are not allowed to comment, but they are investigating.

And he said, I will -- I wouldn't pretend -- I'm paraphrasing here, but something along the lines of we wouldn't protect you, the U.S. wouldn't protect you.

Poland is spending 4 percent of their GDP on defense. We recently welcomed Chancellor Scholz, who visited with a dozen senators before he met with President Biden. They have dramatically increased their defense spending and welcomed millions of refugees from Ukraine and help lead the work in NATO and in Europe to arm and support Ukraine. For the president of the United States, former and possibly future, to say intentionally that he would willfully throw our NATO allies to the Russian wolves if they didn't pay up suggests that NATO isn't a collective security treaty, but a protection racket where he is shaking down our allies for them to increase their defense investment.

The worst attack on Jews in the world since the Shoah is something that is worth doing. But it stands in stark contrast to the humanitarian cost of this war. President Biden has consistently called on Prime Minister Netanyahu to change the conduct of their campaign against Hamas, to one that reduces civilian deaths and consequences, and there been significant steps in that direction taken by the administration. Jake, I hope and pray that the urgent negotiations to release hostages and achieve a ceasefire will succeed in coming days. That's the path I hope we are on.",
