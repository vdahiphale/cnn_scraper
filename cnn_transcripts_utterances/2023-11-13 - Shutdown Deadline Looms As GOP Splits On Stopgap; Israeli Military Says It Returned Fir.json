And then the big question is, what will Hakeem Jeffries do, the Democratic Leader in the House who has remained quiet on this issue so far? Will they supply the votes to carry it across the finish line? Dana, one big test will be tomorrow when they vote on the first procedural vote to set the parameters for floor debate. Typically, Democrats vote against that procedural vote. And typically Republicans vote for it. If more than three Republicans vote against that rule on the floor of the House, then it will require Democrats to carry it across the finish line. So those are the questions are still remaining. But at the moment because of the decision not to include spending cuts, the expectation is that they will get this over the finish line. It will be bumpy, but they could get there. The question, though, is what will the White House ultimately do? What will Democrats ultimately do? And how big is that opposition on the right? Dana?",

What's unclear, though, is how many have left the hospitals themselves. These hospitals, which are supposed to be sanctuaries from the fighting and become shelters as people try to find a safe place. Shifa hospital itself, in addition to struggling to treat 650 or so patients in the hospital has thousands of Gaza is taking shelter there. It's unclear if they've been able to evacuate, many of them who've -- we've spoken to simply feel too terrified to leave the hospital. In terms of the Al-Quds Hospital, that's the second largest in Gaza, that already shut down its medical services. Over the weekend, as you point out, Israel says there were Hamas militants embedded in the civilian population there. And that led to a firefight, the Palestine Red Crescent Society says there was a Red Cross convoy that tried to leave the hospital, but had to turn back because of Israeli bombardment in the area. So this just gets it how difficult it is to leave what is very much the middle of a war zone with ongoing active fighting.

We give you a lot of credit, Dana, for trying to get the Prime Minister to take responsibility, but he won't do it, right? Israeli journalists have asked him, you've asked him, other reporters have asked him, he won't do it. And I think there's two reasons why. First is, I don't think he believes that he's responsible. As we saw just about two weeks ago, in the middle of the night, as Israeli Special Forces were going into Gaza to rescue an Israeli female soldier who had been taken hostage, it was exactly at that same time on a Saturday night, two weeks ago that he decided to tweet, The heads of the Shabak, Israel's Internal Security Agency, the head of military intelligence never told me, he said, that Hamas was going to war. They had always told me that Hamas was deterred. How do you do that in the middle of the night when Israeli Special Forces are going to risk their lives in a very complicated operation? So he won't -- he thinks that, a, he's not responsible, but, b, is he gives us insight and his inability to answer the question.
