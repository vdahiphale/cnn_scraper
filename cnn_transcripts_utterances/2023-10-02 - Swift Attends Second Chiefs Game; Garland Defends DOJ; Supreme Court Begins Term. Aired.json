First of all, a major Second Amendment case. Back in 2022, the justices really limited what states can do on gun control by saying that judges would interpret the statutes based on the text, history and tradition of the Second Amendment. And that caused a judge - a set of judges down in the southwest part of the country to strike down a federal ban on gun possession if someone has had a domestic violence restraining order. So it's a case where the federal government has come up and appealed and said, look, we can still look to text, history and tradition of the Second Amendment but states in the federal government still must be able to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and citizens who are not law abiding. So that's an important case where we'll get some more clarity, I believe, in this upcoming term on the reach of the second amendment. Another case involves - a series of cases involves the power of federal regulators, for example, over the environment, public safety, consumer choices. And tomorrow, Poppy and Phil, the justices are going to hear a case that involves the federal agency that was set up after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from scams. And this involves a challenge to its funding mechanism, which doesn't really - they don't get much - the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau doesn't get money through the regular appropriations that Congress would do each year, but rather from the Federal Reserve system. And there's a question on that agency's - the constitutionality of that funding. But it would - it - if the court rules against the agency, it could jeopardize the last 12 years of decisions that have protected consumers when it comes to mortgages, credit cards, car loans. And then finally I want to mention one - another one already on the calendar, and this involves social media companies and whether states, in this situation Florida and Texas, can limit what platforms, such as Facebook, are able to take down from their platforms - content that they - they might find would be misleading or false. And it's a big First Amendment question, Poppy. MATTINGLY: Joan, the court may also take up the case on Mifepristone, right? The challenge to the availability of the commonly used abortion pill. We've been talking about this now for months. This would be the next major, dramatic abortion related case. The first since Dobbs. How do you think the court's going to handle this?",

This one will be different, I think, Phil and Poppy, because it not only involves the abortion medication drug Mifepristone, it involves the federal Food and Drug Administration's authority to use its own expertise to say what drugs are safe and effective.So, you've got two things a stake here, the availability of this drug that's now used for most abortions nationwide, but also the federal agency - again, it goes to federal regulatory power, that's, right now, tasked with deciding what drugs should be put on the market.",

The high Sunday in Minneapolis/St. Paul, 92 degrees. That broke the record for an October day. It was about 26 degrees above normal. Organizers said the heat made it just to risky to run this year.
