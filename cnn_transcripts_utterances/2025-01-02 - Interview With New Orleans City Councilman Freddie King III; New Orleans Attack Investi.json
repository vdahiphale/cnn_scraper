Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry visited the scene of what has become the deadliest attack on U.S. soil since the 2023 mass shooting in Maine. At least 15 people are dead and dozens are injured after a man rammed a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street just hours into the new year. The FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism and says the attacker had an ISIS flag in his truck at the time. He was an Army veteran from Texas and was killed in a firefight with police. Let's go straight to New Orleans and CNN's Ryan Young. Ryan, what is the latest on the investigation?",

And I can tell you right now, as I set by the way here, they just brought in some heavy machinery and trucks to block the road. They have been cleaning that up all morning long as the FBI finally released the street, this investigation still ongoing. I talked to a sanitation worker who said the scene behind that truck was so disturbing, he will never forget it. Now, of course, the FBI is investigating Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a U.S. citizen from Texas, an Army veteran who had an ISIS flag on the back of that F-150 as it barreled down the road. Take a listen to the superintendent talk about why the barriers weren't in place when this attack happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNE KIRKPATRICK, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: Well, they were not able to be up and running and that is because it was under repair. We were aware of this issue and that's why we were using patrol cars. That will be changing today. We will have much heavier equipment to harden these softer targets. So the city had a multimillion-dollar package for repairing this infrastructure, obviously, in time for the Super Bowl, but it was not complete at the time of this event last night.

Also, you can see the headline of the paper this morning, as this talked about the act of terrorism. But, moving forward, you can see fans of both Notre Dame and Georgia filling the streets here before the game time, but a lot of focus now on the next steps and making sure everyone stays safe as they continue this investigation.

JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, they're just developing the facts now. So they wanted to caution everybody not to jump to conclusions.

And, unfortunately, when you have somebody who has something to live for with that on their mind, it's difficult to plan and plot out every step. But what we can control is what's going to happen moving forward. What we're going to do now is look to see, maybe should Bourbon Street be pedestrian-only? If so, for how long? Maybe just timed for deliveries to happen. Maybe put in bollards, protected bollards on the sidewalk. I think everything is up for discussion now. There's no -- nothing off the table. Another thing I want to talk about and have this conversation with our local and state lawmakers is this permitless carry right now.
