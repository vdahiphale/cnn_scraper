And sometimes, it can totally get out of hand or be hijacked. But it's everyone right in this country.But that's not the case in so many other countries right now like in China, where thousands of people are risking their lives protesting the government's oppressive zero-COVID policy and what may be the most widespread demonstration since Tiananmen Square in 1989. People are chanting, we want freedom. Many and very poignantly are holding blank sheets of paper, their way of suddenly protesting without being accused of writing or displaying messages deemed illegal by their own government. And in Iran, hundreds of people have been killed amid the regime's brutal crackdown against peaceful protesters. Brave Iranians have been talking and taking to the streets for more than two months now demanding freedom and women's rights, one of the most significant and consequential challenges in the republic since at least the 1979 revolution. And what is all described have to do with the World Cup? We're going to talk about it. I want to bring in CNN global affairs analyst Susan Glasser, CNN politics reporter and editor-at-large Chris Cillizza, and CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan. I'm glad that you're all here. And looking at this, I'm happy to say, when I first saw the blank pieces of paper, for some reason, that was so impactful and really touched me. I'm thinking about in some instances the luxury that we take for granted of being able to address grievances and speak truth to power. And just to have this image of people holding it up as this silent and voiceless oppressed population, it meant something. What did you think of it?",

These are young man, the U.S. men's national team, they're Title IX males, they are the ones who a few months ago actually gave up some money so that the women's team, obviously more famous, more successful, could actually have equal play.So, these are very different young men, they're not like their dads or their grandfathers, and they are very comfortable talking about these issues while they are also playing the game that they love. U.S. soccer, for example, has a rainbow shield. Red, white, and blue is on the uniform. But the rainbow shield, in honor, of course, of LGBTQ rights, a very big issue in Qatar, the host nation, that is being displayed in the team hotel, Laura, and the team parties and other things like that. So, the U.S. national -- men's national team, U.S. soccer, have really from the get-go have wanted this to be about more than soccer. Obviously, now it is a big controversy. No one is kicking the United States out of the World Cup. FIFA needs the United States and those TV ratings. But it does present an incredible tableau on which to play a soccer game tomorrow.",

But I'm thinking about, you know, it's important and utility, you know, a part of our public political discourse.And it is the classic thing like, you know, if it didn't exist, we have to invent it. I know there are various attempts to do that. There's a new start-up post where you see, you know, I think they have a waiting list of like 150,000 people. You have people talking about this other platform, Mastodon, but then that's too complicated. The problem is that it has become many things. But one of the things that Twitter is, is a very and invaluable tool for the spreading of real-time information. I'm thinking about following the war in Ukraine and all the people who are posting there. It is invaluable again to see what is happening in real time. Protesters in Iran are bypassing and using VPNs in order to get on Twitter, in order to communicate.",

That is sort of the relationship I feel like I have with it. The toxicity -- Elon Musk didn't invent the toxicity on the Twitter. The toxicity has been there. I think he has given more leeway for that to grow.But the thing that I was thinking about, how my usage changes, I am more wary of everything that's out there because of the questions about verification. It just seems -- as a journalist, is this actually fill in the blank congressman who has released a statement? Is this actually Mitt Romney has released a statement or is it something that looks a lot like Mitt Romney? I think that is what I'm -- it has made me even more wary of, is this information good? And to Susan's point, you do use it as in the moment information source. So, you know, it takes away from that a little bit.",
