But actually, the comparison needs to be made in that order. The thing is that, if you look at people in France around the age of 60, 62, 64, half of them are not working anymore. They've been sacked by their employers so they don't understand why they are asked to be working longer. The other half is working hard, because there is a intensification of working in France, partly because you have less people at work.

CNN's Bill Weir shows us how one critical spot in California went from nearly bone dry to drowning in water.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In California's Central Valley, farmers have spent much of the last 20 years praying for rain. But then came this winter of relentless rivers in the sky, enough to bring a long dead lake back to life and drown over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop.",

And now it's back. It's proof that water never forgets.

DANIEL L. SWAIN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UCLA: So the ground has literally sunk in some places by 10 or 15 feet over the past decade. That has literally changed the topography of the historical lakebed. Some places are lower even than they were the last time there was a big flood event. So there's quite a few unknowns. WEIR (voice-over): That is UCLA scientist Daniel Swain.
