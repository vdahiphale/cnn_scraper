As I sit outside the Houses of Parliament this morning, the big question on everyone's lips after a day of chaos is, with Liz Truss on her way out, who might take her place?Well, let's have a look at this. The former chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is among the likely contenders. He has predicted some of the challenges that Liz Truss would face, of course, including that unfounded tax cuts. The man who resigned in disgrace a few months ago may throw his hat in the ring. Multiple allies of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson say he could be a unity candidate. Other possibilities include House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt, Defense Minister Ben Wallace or even former Home secretary Suella Braverman and Mike Pence Kemi Badenoch. CNN's Scott McLean is live for us this morning outside 10 Downing Street in London. And Scott, it was described as something of a dumpster fire in Downing Street yesterday. It's certainly been a revolving door of chaos in recent months. So, the biggest question, who is likely to yet come next? Do we have any indication, Scott, of which candidates are likely to reach that 100-vote threshold?",

When he put his name into the ring in the leadership race over a two-month period in the summer, he was the very first candidate to reach 100 MP supporting him in the second round of voting. In fact, in the first round, no one reached the 100 MP threshold.It was not until four rounds later that he was joined at 100 by Liz Truss, and then by Penny Mordaunt. So, obviously, Rishi Sunak is heavily favored to eventually be able to win the leadership race. He was a former chancellor but he was also credited with the downfall of Boris Johnson, sort of labeled someone of a backstabber by Johnson's supporters. And so, there is still very much some bad blood there. So, he will have a challenge in winning over that wing of his party. If you ask the papers in this country, there are really only three that they think are in contention: Boris Johnson, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, as you mentioned, and Rishi Sunak. And I know your country, Christina, has an odd tradition of talking about newspapers on TV. So, in the local tradition, I will show you what the newspapers are talking about today. This one says -- this is \"The Sun.\" It says, Bojo: I'll be back. This is \"The Daily Express.\" It says, he couldn't. Could he? Will Boris bounce back to number 10? But both of these candidates also have a problem and that is that, if you ask Labour and if you ask a lot of ordinary people in this country, well, they would very much like a general election now.

It was riven already after the Brexit vote, which, obviously, the party (INAUDIBLE) base supported even more strongly.And if you think what has been riven about recently, it has been riven about the character of Boris Johnson and whether to follow him or not, which led to his own dismissal. That's just before the summer. It seems like a year (ph) ago. So, the idea that somehow, he could become the unity candidate and put himself in that position, I think, is implausible. There are three problems on the Boris Johnson's side. You have the sort of character side, and there is a privileges committee investigation that will be starting into whether he lied to Parliament. This would be starting in a week or two time. So, if he were chosen, we will be back in the theater around his character yet again. That brings us to the issue of chaos. Could he actually unite the party if he were to be the leader? Would they all row in behind him? I am not so sure. That brings us to the crisis. Would the markets trust Boris Johnson? Let's remember that Rishi Sunak broke with him partly over the character issue, the party gate, as it's been called, as you know, over here. But he broke with him also because he felt he was a spendthrift, a person who wanted to spend too much and not focus on disciplining the markets. The idea that Boris could suddenly turn himself into the person to keep the markets calm with Jeremy Hunt strikes me as implausible. I'm afraid I don't see him being a unity candidate.",

One, you mentioned there, which is if he can get himself into the last two with more than 100 votes of MPs, he could definitely then go to the runoff with the membership, and by all accounts, he is a strong person likely to win. The recent polling had him ahead of Rishi Sunak, sort of 33% to 23%. Whether those polls are reliable or not is another matter.He also has another advantage, of course, which is that he was elected as prime minister in 2019, and we have not had an election since then. So, he would be the candidate who could say, hey, we don't need another election. There's no pressure. I am just going to take up the baton again and run this government through to 2024 by which time the next election needs to be held, where as anyone else could be tarred with the brush, you've got to give the chance people a chance to vote. And then, of course, he is somebody who is such a character in a way that he could potentially unite parts of the party. In other words, he could bring together the kind of Eurosceptic wing around, Suella Braverman, as you mentioned, and his own loyalists. So, he could unite part of the party around him.

I'm Christina Macfarlane live from just outside the UK Houses of Parliament.Our top story this hour, Britain's political turmoil has only intensified after Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday. The announcement came on her 45th day in office making her the shortest- serving Prime Minister in British history. The Outgoing prime minister says she will stay in Downing Street until a successor is chosen which could be a relatively quick process. Potential candidates will need at least 100 nominations from Conservative MPs. A new leader could be chosen as soon as Monday, but by next Friday at the latest. Now former finance minister Rishi Sunak and the previous Prime Minister Boris Johnson are considered the front runners to replace Truss. The disastrous Truss economic plan led to a loss of confidence in her leader with members of her own conservative party saying they could no longer support her. And now other political leaders are demanding that people be allowed to vote for new leadership in an early general election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think even more importantly, whether this new government will be able to study the shape which looks increasingly unlikely, which will therefore cause even greater problems for the British people.

While Lula still remains the front-runner. According to all major polls, the two candidates are separated by less than five percentage points as off for Thursday night. And with a race tightening, both candidates are making last-minute appeals to attract undecided voters. On Wednesday, Lula published a letter directed at evangelical leaders to deny the claims that he would close down evangelical churches if elected into office. In his lecture, Lula also clarified his position against abortion, abortion, being one of the central issues in this year's campaign. With these targets towards evangelicals, Lula targets one of the most pro-Bolsonaro groups of the Brazilian electorate. According to the pollster, Datafolha, the president can boast the supporter of almost two-thirds of evangelicals. (on camera) Also on Thursday, Brazilian electoral authorities published the new guidelines concerning false information. According to these guidelines, publishers have up to two hours to remove false information related to the electoral race. It's a central issue because both candidates have accused each other of fake news in this particularly polarized campaign. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
