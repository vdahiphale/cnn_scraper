The objective was to erase Ukraine from the map, to eliminate its independence, its sovereignty, to assume it into Russia. That failed a long time ago.Now Ukraine is in a battle to get back more of the land that Russia seized from it. It's already taken back about 50 percent of what was initially seized. Now they're in a very hard fight to take back more. These are still relatively early days of the counter offensive. It is tough. The Russians have put in place strong defenses. But I'm convinced that with the equipment and support they receive now from more than 50 countries, with the training that their forces have gotten, and many of the forces who've gotten that training not yet been put fully into this fight, and maybe more than anything else, with the fact that unlike the Russians, the Ukrainians are fighting for their land. For their future. For their country. For their freedom. I think that is the decisive element and that's going to play out. But it will not play out over the next week or two. We're still looking I think at several months.",

Javelins, Stingers. They have that on hand, they were able to repel the attack against Kyiv. They were able to save their country from being taken entirely by Russia.Every step along the way ever since, we've worked to try to get them what they need when they need it. But it's not just the equipment itself. It's the training. It's the maintenance. It's the ability to use it in combined arms operations. All of that takes time. If a decision were made to actually move forward on the F-16s tomorrow, it would be months and months before they were actually operational.",

I think you've heard Chairman Milley, Lloyd Austin, the secretary of Defense, speak to this.

And President Zelenskyy has been extraordinary as a leader and in trying to galvanize the international community along with us to provide them what they need. But the other thing is this, there are 50 some odd countries in this coalition in support of Ukraine. Lloyd Austin has been leading this process on the military side. And different countries do different things at different times, and it all complements each other. So, for example, we have certain munitions that we provided to the Ukrainians including the HIMARs.Other countries have provided some munitions that have a longer range because as the Russians move back their command and control, as they move back some of their supply depots, out of range in some cases of what we've given them, the munitions that countries have provided, as part of an organized coalition, are allowing the Ukrainians to hit them. They've had some significant success. So our military leaders are using their best expertise possible to help determine what it is that can be most effective for the Ukrainians, how quickly can it be deployed, how effectively can they use it. That will continue and the process on the F-16s is moving.",

Or are they back?Is there a change in Russian morale? Are you noticing something about the Russian army as a consequence of the Prigozhin attempted mutiny? ZELENSKYY (through translator): I think we can understand what is happening to the strength of the Russian army or the lack of a motivation when we see what is happening to the Russian society, and something like that has been happening on the battlefield. They're demotivated. You could see that Putin lost the strength of the vertical of his power and the steps made by Prigozhin clearly attest to that. The same is happening in the army in Russia with their citizens. They don't have freedom. And because of that, they are demotivated to the most -- they don't see victories in civil life, in military activities, and even those who support this policy of war and aggression of President Putin, I think this percentage is going down. We did analyze the steps by Prigozhin. We talked about that with partners. And I would say that 40 -- maybe 45 percent of Russian Federation's regions in principle supported their steps and the rhetoric of Prigozhin. In spite of him being a representative of terrorist or even the leader of terrorist itself, you can still see that even in that, there is a split in the society. There is no unity in the Russian army and this is why we need to act. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is not just a logistical route. This is the route used to feed the war with ammunition and this has been done on a daily basis, and it militarizes the Crimean Peninsula. For us, this is understandably an enemy facility built outside the law, outside the international laws and all applicable norms so understandably this is our objective.
