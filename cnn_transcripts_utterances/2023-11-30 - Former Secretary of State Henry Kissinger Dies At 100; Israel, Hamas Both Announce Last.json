That was Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in Israel this morning, talking about the man who had his job 50 years ago, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. A controversial giant in U.S. foreign policy, Kissinger died at the age of 100 at his Connecticut home last night. We're going to have more on this in just a moment. Blinken's visit to the Middle East comes as the temporary truce in Gaza is extended for a seventh day and more hostages are set to be released.

And this comes even as negotiations are continuing in Qatar. Joining us now, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and the ambassador-in-residence to the Atlantic Council, Michael Oren. Ambassador, thank you very much for being here. I actually want to start -- I understand you worked with Henry Kissinger. I'd like to start there with the passing of this just absolute giant -- a very controversial one but a giant nonetheless. What are your -- what are your memories of him? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., AMBASSADOR-IN- RESIDENCE TO THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it's always -- first of all, it's good to be with you, and thank you for having me on. You know, it's always an extraordinary experience to meet and work with somebody who you've read extensively and you've studied. I had studied Henry Kissinger. We read his M.A. thesis on Bismarck; his PhD thesis on Metternich. We read his books. One of the greatest books of all time about the beliefs (PH) is a  book called \"Crisis,\" which is simply the transcripts of his discussions during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And literally, you cannot put this book down -- and this was Henry Kissinger. I got to meet Kissinger in a very interesting way -- firstly, as a historian. He was very concerned about his legacy and very concerned that the people of Israel -- the Jewish people would remember him fondly because he had played a sometimes controversial role in our history, particularly surrounding the Yom Kippur War of 1973. He prevented Israel from launching a preemptive strike that could have saved many Israeli lives. And then he also pressured Israel to give up territory in order, ultimately, to make peace with Egypt. And he should be remembered very fondly for that. So he would call me and discuss his role and wanted to clarify that he had worked very assiduously and honestly for the people of Israel. And then later, as ambassador, I got to work with him again and would consult with him frequently about the nature of the U.S.-Israel relationship. I'll never forget our first meeting when I said to him, \"Dr. Kissinger,\" -- and you always called him doctor, not professor -- \"are you concerned that the United States makes a nuclear arrangement with Iran would America lose its hegemony in the Middle East.\" And I'll never forget what he said to me. He says, \"What makes you think\" -- I'll do the imitation. I can do a good Kissinger imitation. \"What makes you think -- what makes you think that anybody in the White House cares about continued American hegemony in the Middle East?\" What a line that was. So I saw him frequently over the years and together, with other Israeli leaders, we would always meet with Kissinger.",

It can -- it can -- it can ignite them in some way and kill Hamas. It may be the ultimate -- the ultimate solution would be that Hamaswould give over the last of the hostages and Israel would let the hostages -- let Hamas get on boats and go somewhere. That's what we did with the PLO in 1982 in Beirut -- exactly that. But barring that situation, there has to be, at some point, an end to these negotiations. Israel's position has been to get as many hostages, particularly women and children, out as possible. But keeping in mind that the ceasefire that Hamas wants means Hamas literally gets away with mass murder and Israel loses. People forget we have 250,000 refugees of our own. People have been moved away from the borders and can't go back to their homes as long as Hamas poses this type of moral threat. And Hamas says that if -- that if it survives this it's going to propose that moral threat. It's exactly what Hamas says again and again. So we will not be able to restore our internal security or certainly, our -- even regional deterrents because Iran will internalize that you can hit Israel with impunity. And when Israel goes --",
