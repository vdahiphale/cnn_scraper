It's wonderful to have you with us. Vice President Kamala Harris' search for her own running mate, now, in its final hours. Over the weekend, she interviewed three contenders at the Naval Observatory in Washington D.C. They included Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro and the Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. The process playing out under strict secrecy with plans to officially announce the choice ahead of a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia. One of the options already facing scrutiny from the right and left, Governor Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman has been warning Harris' team not to pick Shapiro. According to a \"Politico\" report, Fetterman reportedly told Harris that Shapiro is more focused on personal ambition. Harris' Republican rivals also attacking a potential Shapiro pick.

There was Florida in 2000, and 2024, it's Pennsylvania. Shapiro could maybe move the needle on that. So, I think he's the clear frontrunner now, but like when a choice is about to be made, folks who aren't unhappy with that will start to come out and would work.
