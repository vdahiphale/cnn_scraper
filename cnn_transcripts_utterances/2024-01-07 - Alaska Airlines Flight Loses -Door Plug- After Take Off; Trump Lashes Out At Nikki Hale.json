Incredibly, the plane landed safely with only minor injuries among the 177 passengers and crew.

The Federal Aviation Administration is now issuing an emergency airworthiness directive, essentially an emergency recall, calling for a temporary grounding of these Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes pending the results of inspections.This incident happened in an explosive moment, like the most violent convertible you've ever been in, in this case on a passenger jet. Row 26 is where this happened, where there could have been a door installed. This plane did not have it. It had what's called a door plug. More on that in a second. This happened, though, with a bang, a refrigerator- sized hole punched in the side of this plane seven minutes into the flight at 16,000 feet. That led to what's called a rapid decompression, where the high- pressure, breathable air inside the plane goes rushing out and the very cold, thin air outside comes rushing in. We heard from a passenger that a boy sitting nearby had his shirt pulled off by the force of the explosion. The oxygen mass dropped and pilots very quickly had to deal with this unusual situation. I want you to listen to the calm on the air traffic control audio. Step one, fly the airplane. Step two, run the checklist, descend back to 10,000 feet, where the air is a lot more breathable. And step three, communicate to air traffic control exactly what you're doing.",

And that's what the FAA are requiring. And the United Airlines have already started that inspection process. It takes about four to eight hours in the maintenance hangar to do that. So that inspection is really sensible. One thing we know about the National Transportation Safety Board process is that as soon as they find something that is of concern, and they will feed that directly back through the regulator, the FAA, and they share that around the world. One thing we do in aviation very well is actually share that information. So I know, for example, in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority has already said for aircraft to fly into UK airspace, any 737 Max 9 with this plug configuration would need that inspected before they do that.

He will head from there to Doha, Qatar today. We know, of course, the Qataris have been closely involved in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the fate of those more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza and also over broader negotiations about whether or not a ceasefire of sorts can be obtained. And from there he will head to the United Arab Emirates and ultimately arrive here in Israel where discussions with Israeli leaders will certainly center over the next phase of this war. We saw already this week as the Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, laid out his plans, his proposed plans for the next phase of the war that will entail special operations, raids and destruction of remaining Hamas infrastructure in northern Gaza, while continuing to press forward with its offensive in the south until it achieves all of the aims of the war. And of course, amid all of this, there is also beginning to be some planning, some discussions, negotiations about the fate of Gaza after this war ends.

This could go into Monday morning, early morning. So expect the official word to come out perhaps on Monday. Now, the main opposition party, the BNP as you mentioned right at the top, has boycotted this election and in the lead up to the election, there has been a lot of violence between the two political parties. The BNP, in fact, went ahead and even demanded that Sheikh Hasina step aside as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and let a caretaker government come in place of hers to supervise the polls. It's a demand that Sheikh outrightly rejected after which the opposition leaders took to the streets of Bangladesh. That led to a massive crackdown from the Sheikh Hasina government. It led to a lot of arrests and leaders also leaving the country. Now, according to the main opposition party, thousands of their supporters and leaders have been arrested in the run up to the election. Sheikh Hasina did cast her vote this morning. She went on to say that the credibility of a government is something that she needs to prove to the people of the country and not the main opposition party. However, on the eve of this election, there was another protest taken out by opposition leaders. Here's what one of them had to say about this election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But ever since, there have been a lot of issues that she's facing, a lot of criticism when it comes to her alleged authoritarianism in the country, as well as stifling free speech.Now, the economy is also witnessing a downturn after the COVID and the Ukraine war, because of which even the IMF had to bail them out last year. But the big question is, are these voters happy in a situation such as this, where they have only one main party, in fact, to vote for. Back to you.",
