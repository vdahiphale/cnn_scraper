It is Thursday, April the 4th, 9 a.m. here in London, 10 a.m. in Gaza, where the fallout is growing over the Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers.World Central Kitchen says its operations in the enclave remain closed for now, and it's not yet reached a decision on when it will resume its vital work. The group immediately suspended its mission there after the death of its workers, and all its aid ships are now back at the Cyprus port. This video shows one boat that left Gaza following the deadly strike without offloading most of its cargo, which added up to about 332 tons of humanitarian aid. That's according to the Cypriot Foreign Ministry. The founder of World Central Kitchen is calling for an independent investigation and lashing out at Israel, accusing it of, quote, systemically -- systematically targeting his seven team members in Monday's strike.

The word outraged is not one that's used lightly, certainly when it comes to talking about an ally. So we are hearing that within the Biden administration, that there will be a very clear-cut show of frustration and anger at what has happened. There was one U.S.-Canadian citizen killed within this attack as well.But of course, it does come at the same time. The White House is very clear, saying that its policy hasn't changed, that it will continue to militarily support Israel in its fight against Israel. In fact, we do understand that the Biden administration is close to announcing the sale of up to about 50 F-15 fighters to Israel. This according to three officials familiar with the matter, that would be a deal of some $18 billion. So at the same time as we are hearing from the Biden administration that they will be very strongly criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu and his administration, they are also on the other side saying that they will continue the military support. But this is a relationship that has been degrading significantly over recent months, and certainly it will be interesting to see what comes out of this call today -- Max.",

The island rocked by the most powerful earthquake to hit Taiwan in a quarter century. In the capital, Taipei, CNN photojournalist John Meese tries to protect his wife and children as the walls of their home lurch back and forth. An earthquake has just hit, announces the anchor of this morning news show, as she struggles to stay on her feet. But the worst damage is at the epicenter, in the rugged mountains of Hualien County on the island's east coast. The 7.4 magnitude earthquake triggers massive landslides. Authorities say several people were killed by falling rocks. In the town of Hualien, apartment buildings on the verge of collapse. Emergency workers in action. Authorities say they've rescued scores of people from toppled buildings and highway tunnels. And rescue teams are still trying to reach others trapped high in the mountains. The work has continued in Hualien throughout the night. No one's left inside this building, says this firefighter. He adds, people are frightened. There are constant earthquakes here, says this woman. I've lived here 50 years and never felt one so big. It's really scary. People in Taiwan are accustomed to feeling the earth shake, but rarely with this much destructive force. Ivan Watson, CNN, Taipei. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Over 600 people are stranded or unreachable, including tourists, miners, hotel workers. At least nine people have died, more than 1,000 people injured, and rescuers, they are working hard to free the people trapped or stranded by debris. And they're also working hard just to get to them. You know, the epicenter is on the east coast of Taiwan, Hualien County, and many in this region are remote coastal areas or mountain communities that can be hard to reach. I'm going to show you this drone footage just to show you what rescue workers are up against. In this footage, you'll see 50 stranded hotel employees, and they're waiting for rescue. These individuals were on minibuses, they were on their way to work early on Wednesday morning when the quake struck, and the rescuers are waiting for roads to be cleared before they can reach and help out that group. Now, in the next video, you can see first responders on the scene of a major, major rockfall and landslide after the earthquake, and they have to scramble through all of that fallen debris, the boulders, the rocks on this blocked highway to reach survivors. They do find a man eventually, a man who was found unconscious at the scene, and he was later sent to hospital for treatment. Now, a day after this earthquake, residents across Taiwan are still very nervous. Some, in fact, slept outdoors in tents last night as aftershocks continue to just rattle the area.

Now, the Secretary General, as he typically does, didn't, again, get into detail, said, look, you've been briefed by someone but not briefed by me. But what he wanted to achieve and what NATO is trying to achieve here is this financial commitment that allows Ukraine to plan for the coming years of the war.

And for defense providers, manufacturers throughout Europe, the United States, to know that there's long-term commitment for them to produce the armaments.

Here's what one expert told CNN earlier.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAREN DONFRIED, SR. FELLOW, BELFER CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS: So when we think about Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, there are at least three impacts of it. The most existential is for Ukraine. There's also an implication for European security, and you are right that many NATO members border Ukraine. And then there's also an implication for global stability. And our belief in international law and the argument that we respect each other's sovereignty and countries have the right to defend themselves and make their own choices. So that's what's at stake in the battle that's taking place right now in Ukraine. And NATO's eastern member states are deeply concerned about the implications for them if Putin is not stopped in Ukraine. So the urgency is felt very clearly in eastern Europe, but I think it's felt throughout the alliance. And what we see right now is unity among NATO allies about thinking about what role NATO can play in this war. And one idea is to institutionalize at least the coordination of the military assistance going to Ukraine in the alliance, maybe moving the training of Ukrainian forces under a NATO framework, so to try to ensure that that support is longstanding and enduring.

She asked both sides to take into account the former president's claim that he had broad authority to take classified documents under the Presidential Records Act. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Whatever documents the president decides to take with him, he has the right to do so. It's an absolute right. REID (voice-over): The post-Watergate law covers what documents belong to the government after an administration leaves the White House. But prosecutors have repeatedly said that law is not relevant because Trump is accused of obstruction and storing highly classified material in a bathroom and other unsecure locations at his Florida estate. Prosecutors also point out that telling a jury that Trump had the authority to take records he wanted from the White House would make it nearly impossible to secure a conviction. Prosecutors insist that legal premise is wrong and a jury instruction that reflects that premise would distort the trial. But Trump's attorneys, who were also asked to weigh in here, suggested that the judge tell jurors Trump was authorized to possess a category of documents defined as personal records both during and after his term in office. The idea that classified documents belonged to Trump, Smith's team said, is pure fiction. JEREMY FOGEL, FORMER U.S. FEDERAL JUDGE: I was a trial judge for 37 years.
