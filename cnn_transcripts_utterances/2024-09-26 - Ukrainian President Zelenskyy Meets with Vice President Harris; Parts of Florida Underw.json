      "sentences": "...has gotten himself into a bit of hot water with the Speaker of the House and former President Donald Trump over a recent visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory, notably with Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey, also a Democrat, and others. I wanted to get your take on this because, listen, Zelenskyy is here specifically to advocate, as he has advocated on behalf of his own country, to get American help in this war. But what kind of challenges can American domestic politics pose to that effort?LT. GENERAL BEN HODGES, FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. ARMY FORCES IN EUROPE: Well, first of all, this is a gigantic non-story. It's a political effort by the Trump campaign and his supporters in the Congress to diminish the support for Ukraine. You know, never in my life did I imagine that the Republican Party would be using Kremlin talking points, talking about how Ukraine has already lost. Russia, after ten and a half years, controls only about 18 percent of Ukraine, and they've lost over half a million soldiers. So the idea that somehow Ukraine is losing, that is a total fairy tale. But also this visit to the ammunition plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, is important for a couple of reasons. Number one, it reminds everybody that American factories and American workers are producing this ammunition. This is good for the United States. It also counters the statement by Senator Vance a few months ago that America doesn't have the industrial capacity to compete against Russia, which is absolute nonsense. And then finally, of course, President Zelenskyy was out in Utah a couple of months ago with a Republican governor. There were no calls for investigations after that. So I think this is already a nothing story, and we should focus on helping Ukraine defeat Russia because it's in our strategic interest.",

It's been two years since she did an interview. I think that it shows that there's really no daylight between her and her husband. She was very careful in her wording and what she said. I was struck by her use of the word beautiful when she described a letter that she wrote. She said she didn't go to the RNC. Instead, she didn't speak at the RNC. Instead, she wrote this beautiful letter, which is kind of something that he would say, right? Using that word beautiful. I think they're very similar in ways that people don't necessarily understand. So that was an interesting little peek into their world.",

We need a just peace, and we must protect our people, Ukrainian families, Ukrainian children, and everyone from Putin's evil. And we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine all along. And we'll have an important meeting today, right after I talk to President Biden about the plan of victory, and I will share some details of the plan with Vice President Harris. It's crucial for us to be fully understandable and to work in full coordination with the United States. And this morning, I talked also to the congressmen, both chambers, both parties, and I'm thankful for the bipartisan support.
