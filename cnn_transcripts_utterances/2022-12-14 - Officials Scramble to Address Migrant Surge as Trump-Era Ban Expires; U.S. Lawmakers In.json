But we're starting to get a sense of what that could look like.If you see there in the distance behind me, that is the border fence, just on the other side is the Rio Grande and into Ciudad Juarez on the Mexico side. And it's just there were essentially it has been a gathering spot where hundreds, if not thousands of migrants over the last few days have gathered. In fact, we have seen that here this morning as border patrol agents have been escorting long lines of migrants who have arrived here in the early morning and overnight hours, and they are being walked over to a processing center, where some of them will be sent back across into Mexico because of Title 42. Others might receive paperwork and an immigration court date. But all of this continues to happen as this city in particular braces for the possibility lifting of Title 42 next week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA (voice over):  Sun fades away over El Paso, a large group of migrants stand on the borders' edge waiting to be processed by Border Patrol agents, while a few others tiptoe across a short path through the Rio Grande. These migrants are part of a major surge of border crossings seen in El Paso in recent days, and it's happening as the projected end of a Trump-era COVID restriction draws closer, ending the policy to swiftly expel migrants at U.S. land borders. U.S. border authorities interacted with more than 2 million migrants in the last year up from the previous year. But in recent days, an average of almost 2,500 migrants a day have been moving across this border between Mexico and the U.S. through El Paso.",

But also they're sending in a personnel to help the processing of all of these migrants, because a lot of times they just cross the river here into El Paso and they literally just stand on the other side of that border wall waiting for -- they turn themselves into Border Patrol agents and then they begin the process of awaiting just to be processed. But here the processing centers are overcapacity and backed up, so it does take a considerable amount of time. Jim and Erica? HILL:  It's something that has to be dealt with at some point.

Based on my experience of how these things work, the plan would potentially look at who has access to the data. It would put in place a really robust process so the U.S. government could understand who has access to it. Oracle would be vetting and verifying the source code, the algorithm, the governance structure.So, we have a potential solution on the table. The question is, could politics or protectionism derail what, in my view, could make TikTok more secure than most other social media platforms in the U.S. that wouldn't be subject to those robust oversights.",
