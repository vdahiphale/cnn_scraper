And the fact that this has been so politicized, and the fact that these people have been dehumanized and used as political footballs and political wedges on the right, and they have been throughout this entire election.And the fact that these people are not made to feel like people but are made to feel like political props is disgraceful. And, you know, that's why it's been politicized. It's been politicized because people forget that they're talking about human beings and only start thinking about them as props. And this is exactly what it felt like for people 20, 30 years ago who were gay. That's exactly the same movement that happened back then. It's become more acceptable now, and now it's happening to the trans community. And I think as somebody who is not trans and somebody who's a straight woman, I've seen this trajectory and I think it's disgraceful and I just want to say, for the record, I'm glad we're having this discussion. And I'm glad that, for once, that this is not being used as a political football to try to go after vulnerable people who are going through an incredibly difficult time in their lives.",

I made a list in the back while ago, and I'm wearing what I call my Steve Bannon outfit. I got on so many layers because it's so cold in New York, I look like Steve Bannon. That's just one name, Steve Bannon. What about Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Charles Kushner? If you get pardoned by him, you can become the ambassador to the France, evidently, as well.
