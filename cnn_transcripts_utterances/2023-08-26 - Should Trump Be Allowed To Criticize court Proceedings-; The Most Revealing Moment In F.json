      "sentences": "Fair trial versus First Amendment. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.With this question, can Donald Trump campaign within the parameters of the terms of his release? Consider this, Trump was booked on Thursday in Fulton County, Georgia. His fingerprints and mugshot both recorded. His subsequent release was determined by a consent bond order, which was filed with the court three days prior, the order was agreed to by the judge, Scott McAfee, the district attorney, Fani Willis, and three Trump lawyers. It enables Trump's release upon the posting of 10 percent of the $200,000 bond. By the way, kind of interesting that ending cash bail has become a rallying cry for progressives but not in this case. More important going forward are the limits placed on Trump's release, he was warned not to threaten or intimidate witnesses or his co-defendants, quote, \"The defendant shall perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case, or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice. This shall include but is not limited to the following.\" And then here's one example, \"The defendant shall make no direct or indirect threat of any nature against any co-defendant. The limitations on Trump more restrictive than those placed on any of the other 19 defendants in this case. For example, Trump's order uniquely included limitations on his use of social media, including reposts, quote, \"The above shall include but are not limited to posts on social media or reposts of posts made by another individual on social media.\" On Monday, prior to his bond being set, Trump had taken to Truth Social to attack DA Fani Willis. He called her \"crooked, incompetent and highly partisan.\" The bond agreement doesn't seem to have deterred him. On Thursday, prior to his court appearance, Trump turned to Truth Social and posted, then deleted, then reposted this, \"I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia where murder and other violent crimes have reached levels never seen before to get arrested by a radical left low life District Attorney Fani Willis.\" By the way, Trump has similarly attacked federal Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's presiding over the January 6 case. He's called her among other things, \"very biased and unfair.\" Well, then, after being booked, Trump spoke to the media adjacent to Trump Force One. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When the moderators asked who would support Donald Trump as the nominee, even if he were convicted, Vivek immediately put his hands into the air, Ron DeSantis looked around kind of sheepishly then raised his hand to his shoulder as though he were a terrorist. Vivek was the big winner, DeSantis was the loser of this debate. And you know, not because he had a poor performance, he was fine.But you know what, Michael fine is not going to cut it when you're trying to defend your position as the number two candidate. Vivek was bold. He unapologetically said that he would defund Ukraine, that he wanted to get rid of a bunch of these government agencies and that he thought the climate change agenda was a hoax. All of this stuff is just music to the ears of conservative voters, especially after decades of the GOP just promoting these geriatric career politicians who just like spout off 1980s talking points. So, Vivek was the big winner. [09:20:03] SMERCONISH: Salena, how can Mike Pence say that he'd be supportive of Donald Trump if he wins the nomination and is convicted, at the same time say that Trump wanted him to put the Constitution in a subservient role? SALENA ZITO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER/COLUMNIST, NEW YORK POST: Because voting is complicated and because there's, you know, it's a binary choice. And so, you don't have any other choices supposedly, unless there's a vibrant third party candidate. When you go into the voting booth in a general election, it's either the Republican or the Democrat most of the time. And so, you can believe that Pence did the right thing, and also be either enthusiastic or resigned to vote for Trump when you go into a general election, mostly because you are unhappy with the direction that President Biden has taken the country, and not because it is a full throated or robust support for Trump.",

A private plane reportedly carrying Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin crashed this week in a field northwest of Moscow. Video from a Russian state media outlet appears to show the plane descending rapidly against a bright blue sky and a zoom in reveals it's missing a wing.An analysis by CNN now suggests that the plane experienced at least one -- quote -- \"catastrophic inflight incident\" not visible on the video. Experts suspect an on-board explosion. U.S. and western intelligence officials have told CNN they believe it was deliberate. A passenger manifest released by Russia's civil aviation agency listed both Prigozhin and Wagner's top commander Dmitry Utkin among seven passengers and three crew members all said to be killed. The crash came two months to the day after Prigozhin launched a short-lived mutiny against Russia's military leadership challenging President Putin's authority. Now, the Kremlin has yet to officially confirm Prigozhin's death. In public comments Thursday, Putin referred to him in the past tense. And according to the state news agency of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, who provided a haven for Prigozhin after the rebellion, says he twice warned Prigozhin to -- quote -- \"watch out\" for threats to his life. As the A.P. recently summarized, \"Assassination attempts against foes of President Vladimir Putin have been common during his nearly quarter century in power.\" It catalogs a list of political opponents, former intelligence operatives and journalists who were poisoned, shot in cold blood or fell out of a window.

So, we went to the Pacific Ocean to find the remnants of an interstellar meteor, a meteor that was moving too fast to be bound to the sun based on U.S. government satellite data. And we went there. And we found indeed a concentration of molten droplets from the surface of the object when it was exposed to the fireball that surrounded it as a result of its friction with air.And then we found more spherules, more of these molten droplets along the meteor path. It was a very challenging task. We are talking about particles that are the size of a grain of sand, less than a millimeter across the region of 7 miles when the ocean depth is more than a mile. But we managed to bring home more than 700 of them. And over the past two months at Harvard University, we used the best instruments that the world has to offer to figure out their composition. And guess what? We are able to demonstrate that they are from outside the solar system.",

In that \"New York Times\" profile of you, it said this, \"Where Loeb departs from almost all of his colleagues is in thinking that aliens on other planets could have already made their way to us.\" Do you believe and does this finding support the idea that aliens have already made their way to us?",

      "sentences": "Well, the question that we address here in the first paper is whether the material is from outside the solar system. The next question is whether the composition pattern that we find in terms of elements indicates some technological origin. And, of course, the best way to figure it out is to find the big piece of the object because then you can tell the difference between a rock and a technological gadget. A gadget will have buttons on it.And actually, in my class at Harvard University, I asked the students, what should we do if we find a technological gadget with buttons on it? Should we press the button? Half of the class said that, please don't do it. It will affect all of us. The other half said, please do it because we would like to know what would happen. And I said, I would bring it to a laboratory to examine it before engaging with it. The good news is that we have the ability to collect the data and figure it out. It's not a matter of science fiction. It's not a matter of people talking about it in talk shows or politicians discussing it in the Congress. It's something that scientists can get to the bottom of.
