      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Today, we start with dramatic images from the funeral of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Plus, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump attending another court hearing. We'll bring you more information on the highly anticipated case from Florida. And polls are open in one of the most watched elections in the Middle East region. We will take you live to Iran. We want to begin this hour in Russia. That's where late opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been laid to rest in Moscow. Thousands of mourners gathered in what's become a funeral for one man and a tribute to an icon. (CROWD CHANTING) We hear mourners there chanting his name outside the church where his funeral was held. Supporters also yelled no to war and Russia without Putin. Navalny was one of the Russian President's most prominent critics before his death in a Russian penal colony last month, and crowds gathered today knowing that the Kremlin could crack down. Now, police had been present today, and a monitoring group reports that there was at least one arrest. But, with the eyes of the world on Moscow, security forces have been largely polite. Mourners have been allowed to enter the cemetery and pay their respects. But, some believe that they still do have to limit what they say, and CNN's signal has also been interrupted today. Our Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance was there for the day's events. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There have been arrests, people who have engaged actively and publicly with Russia's opposition have been arrested, have been hounded, have often been literally forced to leave the country. So, the fact that you saw all these thousands and thousands of people quietly, respectfully, sifting through by, visiting the church, visiting the cemetery to pay their last respects is, I think, very striking.There were dignitaries there as well, the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, the UK Ambassador to Russia. There was chanting at times, but chanting of his name, chants of we're not afraid because you were not afraid. And yet, it never sort of escalated or tipped over into a full-blown demonstration or protest. It seemed almost that everyone was really conscious to get the tone right, that sometimes in those quiet moments of a large presence of people that can be even more powerful sometimes, because although it's quiet, it is still extraordinarily brave. Don't forget, people had been told already by the Kremlin earlier in the day that unauthorized memorials would not be tolerated. And still, they took the risks. They obviously were cautious about going to the official memorials that were sanctioned. And we have heard reports, according to one monitoring group, of more than 40 arrests. So, it's not that this was without incident. But, it certainly didn't devolve into the kind of crackdown that we have seen on previous occasions in which many had feared it had the potential to.",

The big question, of course, is around Yulia Navalnaya. That is, of course, Alexei Navalny's widow. She was not attending the funeral today, presumably out of an abundance of caution because of security concerns if she tried to go back to Russia. But, she has publicly said that she is going to take the mantle and try to continue to do the work that Alexei was doing.But, this is a pivotal moment, Rahel. What does the future of the Russian opposition look like? How can it be relevant to people in Russia when so much of it, and particularly Yulia in this case, are living in exile? These are difficult questions to answer, and particularly against the backdrop of this absolute lack of respect for any form of descent inside Russia. So, it's a pivotal moment. And I think it's difficult at this stage to see where exactly Russia's opposition goes from this, although there are some who believe, again, through his death, that Alexei Navalny has given people the soccer (ph), the strength and the courage to keep doing the work.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we just got our first update. You may wonder why I'm holding a handwritten note. Well, inside in this court, right behind me, this is a federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, there is a proceeding of enormous national significance. But, we are not allowed to report live or transmit any information out of the courthouse, as we are at other courthouses when we cover proceedings. Instead, we're relying on a small army of our colleagues who are watching this, taking handwritten notes and then running down the stairs and across four lanes of traffic to where I am here to deliver us the news.Now, so far, Judge Aileen Cannon has not signaled that she will definitively move this case. It's currently scheduled for May 20. But, she has signaled she might move it back. And she asked the parties to come here today to discuss the scheduling. Now, prosecutors said in court, according to our colleagues, that they believe both parties are in agreement that this can be tried this summer. Technically, that's true. The Special Counsel said they'd like this to begin in early July. Trump's lawyers have insisted, though, they don't think their client should be in a federal courtroom. They don't think that he should be having to sit through a trial when he wants to be out campaigning. They insist that's a violation of his First Amendment right. But, they've said they would be willing to let this case begin in early August. But, Rahel, maybe a little bit of gamesmanship there, trying to take up some time on the calendar, so other cases don't get scheduled, and then they could always come back to try to push this one back. Now, in an ominous sign for the government, for the prosecutors, the judge called some aspects of their proposed schedule, when they'd want to do this, unrealistic. So, that's a signal that the Special Counsel may not prevail on their request to have this start in early July. But again, we have so many colleagues inside. They are watching and bringing us out with their handwritten notes, again, not the most transparent or helpful system in a taxpayer-funded courthouse in a proceeding of national significance.

So, at this point, it's unclear what's going to happen with the other federal trial related to January 6. That's on pause. This one, they're going to put on the calendar. But, Rahel, it's anybody's guess if it stays wherever the judge puts it. Now, she could also say firmly, I'm not going to move it again. Don't come back and ask. But again, right now, all eyes are on this judge, Judge Aileen Cannon. Where does she put this trial, and does she leave the door open to possibly delaying it again, if she moves it?",

Paula, thank you.And from Florida to Georgia where this afternoon in an Atlanta courtroom a judge will hear closing arguments to decide whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the election interference case against Donald Trump and his alleged co- conspirators. Now, defense attorneys claim that Willis benefited financially from her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, creating a conflict of interest in the case. Willis has rejected those claims, but the stakes are high in both of these cases. The election interference case against Trump, well, that could be completely derailed if Willis is disqualified. And then a trial delays may mean that those trials won't be complete or even take place before the November election. A lot to discuss. Let's welcome in former Federal Prosecutor Michael Zeldin. Michael, always good to have you.

And the hope here is to at least get a juror who will not accept guilt, because you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case for there to be a conviction. And if they can find one juror who hangs the jury and then has to be retried, well, then we're in November. Even if we start in July, August, September, it doesn't make a difference.

You don't need Fani Willis. You don't need Nathan Wade. You do need the Fulton County District Attorney's office to still retain jurisdiction over this case and the opportunity to proceed.On the evidence, I think that there is some conflicting testimony about when this relationship started. But, the relationship in and of itself is not grounds for disqualification. What could be grounds for disqualification is if there was a financial motive and we haven't really seen that, and/or whether the parties lied to the court about when the onset of this relationship began, and that evidence is very equivocal. So, we'll see what he says. But, most important, as I said, Rahel, is that the Office of the District Attorney be allowed to continue this case.",

We continue to track and follow these two critical hearings today that could really significantly impact Donald Trump's efforts to recapture the presidency this fall, one in Florida relating to the trial date in his classified documents case, the other in Georgia over whether the District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from Trump's election interference case. And this comes a day after Trump and President Biden made dueling visits to the U.S.- Mexico border. Those visits highlighting the deep divide over the country's migrant crisis which has quickly become a dominant issue in the 2024 presidential race.Let's dig into all of this with today's panel. Alice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator. She is a Republican Strategist, and former Communications Director for Senator Ted Cruz. Mark Longabaugh is a Democratic Strategist and former Senior Strategist for Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign. Welcome to you both. Great to have you. Alice, let me start with you. I'm wondering just in terms of these legal issues we're seeing today, the impact of this, I mean, if none of these cases -- if none of these trials go to court before November, the charges are baked in for November for voters. I mean, what impact does it have on Trump if he doesn't have to sit for trial in any of these cases? ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, it will have zero impact for the primary, but significant impact for the general election. And timing is everything here, Rahel. And what Donald Trump is doing, here is a very wealthy and powerful man. He is now trying to buy time and that's what this is all about, because we see whether we're talking about any of these cases, whether it is the election subversion, whether it's hush payments, whether it is January 6, whether it's the Georgia case, or the classified documents, Donald Trump has convinced the GOP voters and his base that all of this, every charge is the same. It is part of the weaponization of the DoJ and liberals to go after him because he is the biggest threat to Joe Biden. And we have the Republican Convention coming up on January -- July 15, four months away. These cases will not impact that because his voters in the GOP will support him. But, four months later, the general election, Donald Trump does not want to see a resolution of any of these cases before then, because he does recognize the consequence of, if there were to be some conviction in these cases that would impact a general election, those independent and undecided voters and some of those that are disaffected. So, they're trying to push this back as far as possible because they see this could impact the general election in November.",

But, if he doesn't have to sit trial for these federal cases before November, what then for the Dems?MARK LONGABAUGH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, &amp; FORMER SENIOR STRATEGIST, BERNIE SANDERS 2016 CAMPAIGN: Yeah. Well, let me make one point. I mean, he clearly, I agree, he is trying to delay because one thing is already been proven. When you get him in court and the trial proceeds, the Jean Carroll case, with the Trump Organization business case, he gets convicted, because in a court of law, you have to abide by facts. And the law, in his criminality, becomes very, very evident, and he is convicted. So, I think he very quickly hears these cases moving forward. I would also say that I don't -- number one, everyone has really discounted this New York case, but it looks like that's going to trial here at the end of March, number one. Number two, I'm not sure the Supreme Court isn't going to deal with the immunity thing pretty quickly, and Jack Smith is going to have enough time to get that January 6 trial in before the Republican Convention. So, I still think there is a very high likelihood that Trump is facing reelection in the fall with a conviction.",

Secondly, I think he is going to have a moment to really talk about the tremendous accomplishment that his administration has had, whether it's on infrastructure, whether it's been on climate and clean energy, whether it's been on American jobs and the CHIPS Act, capping prescription drug prices. He has got a great record to run on. And I think he is going to outline some of that. And then finally, I think he is going to put an agenda for the future on the table to fight for middle and working class Americans. And so, I think it's going to be a big moment for him.",

And here are some of the international headlines we're watching today.Police say at least two people are dead after a man drove a car into pedestrians near a school in northern China. At least six more people are seriously hurt. The driver was arrested at the scene and the case is under investigation. Cuba's massive fuel price hike, more than 500 percent, goes into effect today. The price increase is the largest in decades. But, officials say they have no choice but to pass the cost on to consumers as the Communist-run country grapples with shortages and a deepening economic crisis. And late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny has been laid to rest after a funeral in Moscow. Thousands lined the streets to honor the late Kremlin critic. At least one arrest has been reported. But, police have largely allowed mourners to enter the cemetery and pay their respects. Meantime, international calls are growing for an independent investigation into a devastating incident in Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry says that at least 112 civilians were killed after Israeli troops opened fire as crowds desperate for food gather around aid trucks in Gaza City. An IDF spokesman says that Israeli tanks fired what he called warning shots after seeing that people in the crowd were being trampled. Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond who is live for us in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what more can you share with us about the international reaction to this incident?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, this incident is clearly shining a spotlight on the need for a ceasefire in order to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. It is becoming increasingly clear that under the current circumstances, not enough aid is able to make it in to northern Gaza in particular, and that the ongoing war, the growing insecurity in the north is making it very difficult, if not impossible, for sufficient aid to get in. And that's where we're getting a lot of the international reaction focusing on.The French Foreign Minister calling for an independent investigation into this incident, saying that these actions yesterday are \"indefensible and unjustifiable\". The German Foreign Minister also demanding clarifications from Israel, and saying that the Israeli military should fully investigate this incident. And we know that the United States is also calling for this to be looked into. Samantha Power, the administrator for USAID, the top U.S. aid agency, saying yesterday that desperate civilians trying to feed their starving children should not be shot at. Now, again, focusing on the need for aid in in Gaza, the reason why you saw those scenes yesterday beyond the Israeli gunfire, just looking at the massing of people around these aid trucks, is because so little aid has been able to get into northern Gaza. We have seen international agencies, but in particular, countries like Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and others, are increasingly dropping aid via the air in order to try and get aid into northern Gaza. But, that just represents a small drop in the bucket when you look at the overall need. The World Food Programme has warned that if nothing is -- nothing changes here by May, Gaza -- half a million people in Gaza could be facing a full-blown famine. And today also we're getting an update now from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Rahel, I should note, which says that now the death toll from yesterday's event is up to 115 people killed, more than 760 people injured, and still many, many more questions about this incident.

And of course, the first and foremost enemy of Iran is the United States here in this region.And one of the things that we've been hearing a lot from politicians in Iran is that they say that they're concerned about a possible escalation between Iran and the United States, especially in light of the war that's going on in Gaza, Israel's operation against Hamas there, and they do fear that that could have regional repercussions and certainly hurt the stability in the region. We've already seen a taste of that, of course, with some of those attacks by pro-Iranian militias in the region that has led to a further confrontation between Iran and the United States. So, certainly, the U.S. will be watching this very closely. The Israelis will be watching this very closely.

But, WeightWatchers says that it wasn't because of a disagreement, adding that Oprah will remain a \"strong, strategic voice and collaborator\". Now, the news sent WeightWatchers stock tumbling on Thursday, although this morning it has since recovered, at least some of that loss.Let's bring in Nathaniel Meyersohn who was in New York.

It comes at a really difficult moment for the company and the weight loss industry, which has been upended by the rise of Ozempic, Wegovy, and these GLP-1 drugs. So, WeightWatchers has been really trying to pivot its business. It bought a company that has access to doctors who can prescribe these weight loss medications. So, WeightWatchers is trying to shift from diet culture and wellness culture into these drugs. And Oprah herself had said that she was taking a weight loss drug.So, this is just a really difficult moment for WeightWatchers and for the industry, and certainly Oprah leaving WeightWatchers is just going to add to the pressure on the company. And we see a Jenny Craig recently filed for bankruptcy. So, look, if you're a traditional weight loss company, you are in trouble right now. And Oprah leaving is not going to help.",

They're trying to pivot their businesses to try to attract members who are on these GLP-1s. So, Lifetime has launched kind of a weight loss clinic. Equinox is targeting a membership a plan for people who are on these GLP-1s. You see grocery stores.

But, if there is a conviction, then I wouldn't be supportive of Trump. I'm not sure I believe them, because they've stuck with Trump through thick and thin thus far. You know the line. He claims he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and still get away with it and win. And I think in the eyes of many of his voters, that's probably the case.There is also significant difference between these four different actions, as you point out, two hearings today, but two federal trials, two state trials. But, the only case that gets to trial before the election is seemingly the first one up, which is we're now in March. Maybe later this month, the Alvin Bragg prosecution for the hush money payment. I don't know that that necessarily hurts him. I really don't. I don't know that that's going to cause any of his base people who are already voting for him to abandon him. It's certainly not going to cause people to flock toward him. So, it's yet another of those intangibles. In my mind, the big issue is whether the January 6 federal case, the case pending before Judge Chutkan in the District of Columbia, is that going to get to trial before November, because I think that's the most perilous case to him.
