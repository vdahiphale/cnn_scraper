Tonight, travel is still a nightmare, with thousands of flights canceled, and passengers stranded, in airports. Unless one of those passengers gets a wild hair, and decides, with a group of other passengers, to rent a car, and drive 20 hours, to their destination, together. That's exactly what some of our guests, tonight did. In a little while, I'll introduce you, to this group of intrepid travelers, total strangers, who had quite an adventure, when they decided to drive, from Tampa to Cleveland, together, and they recorded their trip, and it went viral. Meanwhile, 10 million people, across the South, are under freeze alerts. And the death toll, from this storm is rising. At least 49 people have died, across the country. 27 of those are in the Buffalo area. And authorities fear that they'll find more bodies, in cars, as they begin to dig out, from what's being called the worst storm, in the region's history. You can see some of it there. And while Police have their hands full, with rescues, the stores are being looted. So, I'll talk to a supermarket manager, who spent Christmas Eve, watching, his store, get broken into. I want to bring in now CNN's Miguel Marquez. He's live for us, in Rochester, New York. You were supposed to be in Buffalo, Miguel, we understand. But what happened?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, there's a lot to sift through, between the report and the transcripts. But even nestled, in these transcripts, we're learning new pieces of information.So, there was one transcript that referenced this draft press release, the White House was crafting, in December of 2020 that we had never heard about before. It was right after Bill Barr had publicly done an interview, saying there was no widespread fraud. He was then the Attorney General. Well, over at the White House, they were crafting a press release that said, \"Anybody that thinks there wasn't massive fraud in 2020 election should be fired.\" Now, they never issued this press release. Eventually, Bill Barr resigned, from the Administration, anyway. But we didn't know about that until we saw this pop up, in one of the questions investigators asked. One of the other big findings, from their report, was just how extensive the pressure campaign that Trump put on state officials was. At one point, they say, \"Trump or his inner circle engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach... to overturn State election results.\" We know the former President was calling election officials. We know he was trying to get States to overturn their election results. But they really sort of try to bring to you the scope of the efforts, by Trump, and his allies, to overturn the election. And lastly, we're just learning more, in some of these transcripts, some of these former White House aides. Kayleigh McEnany, she was the former White House press secretary. She noted that she learned about the Capitol riot, and started piecing it together, when she was sitting at her desk, eating a turkey sandwich. She also told investigators that soon after, she was subpoenaed, to do her interview, with the January 6 committee, she got a call from the former President. She told investigators, \"I believe, shortly after I was subpoenaed, I received a call from President Trump, but I did not answer the call. As I noted to the committee, I have not spoken with him since being subpoenaed.\" And in the committee's report, they noted the former President called a couple of witnesses, or tried to reach out to a couple of witnesses. But they didn't name all of the names. Now, we're learning from this that Kayleigh McEnany was at least one of the people, the former President tried to reach out to, before her interview.",

I mean, some of these things, we had heard bits and pieces of. But, for instance, as Sara just said, the 200 acts of personnel reach- out to - outreach, I should say, trying to get people, to somehow tamper with the election results? And then knowing that Kayleigh McEnany, I mean that's, in your speak, witness tampering, perhaps, the fact that, President Trump was trying to call her? So, what do you think will the DOJ be most interested in? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: So look, it's a huge, huge data dump. And there'll be dozens and dozens of trails to follow. But the number one thing and, I think the number one achievement, of the January 6 committee, is anything bearing on Trump's intent. And that means any time that we learned that he found out, and he knew what was happening, and he went ahead anyway. So, there's quite a lot there to substantiate that. And then, just in general, the Conspiracy looks to be both bigger and longer than we had understood, there. Those 200 contacts, we knew about Raffensperger, but 200? That's really startling. And, of course, we now know, from the report, that even before the election, they had decided to, on this Big Lie strategy. For the Department of Justice, the number one thing is the proof of intent. They've done a pretty darn good job of substantiating it, with different witnesses. But that'll be the issue. And the notion, from Trump's guys, \"Oh, there's really nothing going here,\" it strikes me, as whistling in the graveyard. There's a wealth of information, going to his intent and knowledge.",

So, all you're seeing is people asserting some right, to asylum status, that is lawfully recognized, and then they have to go through a process. Title 42 essentially closed that down, since 2020. About 2.3 million (ph) people have been sent back over the border, without what would have normally been their lawful asylum process. So, at some stage, this has to be lifted, Title 42 has to be lifted, because it's just too hard to argue anymore, that we have a public health crisis. And you will see a surge. So, the solution, that the most Americans are, can somewhat agree on this, at least from - Frank may tell his new polling is, the DREAMers are easy, in the sense that most Americans want them to get through. The undocumented people, who are here, in this country, that some lawful process, for them, to become citizens, is a good step forward, rather than trying to find them in the interior.

And, in here, we have so much, we don't seem to appreciate it.They realize that their leaders that they need to hold them accountable, and that corruption destroys any faith they have in a better future. They realize that they need to learn ideas, and the need to work together, with people, that they otherwise might disagree with. And what's most powerful, for me, about the African Leadership University, is that you've got countries that are at war with each other, or almost at war. And yet, these students are working together, living together, thriving together. And so, lesson, for America, that we can put aside our differences, we can put aside our disagreements, for the greater good, to do something positive, not just for us, but for others, and not just now, but for the future.

It's self- directed learning. So, they have the chance to really get inside, some of these very difficult issues. And I applaud the Biden administration, for bringing the African leaders, here, to Washington, D.C. But we need to raise the bar. We need to ask more of them. We are spending billions of dollars in aid. Where's the accountability? We are investing so much time and treasure. Where are the results? These students, they're owed the same kind of future that we have. We can do it on an individual basis.
