It's 6 p.m. in Israel and in Gaza, and we begin our coverage there. We are now on day four of the truce between Israel and Hamas. And one big question remains, will that truce be extended, or will Israel resume military operations in Gaza? Both sides say they're open to extending it. But, not all of the hostages are being held by Hamas, and that could complicate things. At this hour, negotiators are still working to resolve issues surrounding today's planned release. Sources tell CNN that they're close to working something out. The main issue that's been holding things up, the number of mothers on the list of people said to be released today. Israel says that as part of the agreement, mothers and their children who are being held captive should be released together. The sources say a new list includes additional names to be freed today, and that the hostage release is on track. If all goes well today, Israeli officials say they're prepared to continue the hostages for prisoners swap. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, if that hurdle is jumped over, it does appear that it will go ahead. And of course, this is the last exchange of this four day of exchanges between the two sides. And it does appear that certainly there is a will on all the sides. We've seen statements from Hamas, heard from Israeli officials, the United States, and Egypt, all seem to think there is a very good possibility that the deal will be extended. Now, Hamas put out a statement saying they would like to see a larger number of Palestinian prisoners released so far. There have been 117 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. But, it's worth keeping in mind that in the same period, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which is an NGO that looks after the situation of prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons, they say that 112 people have been detained in the same period that the 117 were released.

Peter Bergen, let me start with you on the question of releasing mothers and their children together, because clearly that was a misstep that was made earlier in this process.

Take a look at what Kirby had to say this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, STRATEGIC COMM. COORDINATOR, U.S. NATL. SECURITY COUNCIL: These groups are operating in Gaza. We know they have some connectivity with them. I'm not suggesting there is some sort of strong chain of command here.

No? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, &amp; U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Yes. It could, Kasie. And the thing about this is, how strong are those communication lines? I think they're there. But, I think the one problem that you have is the degree of control that Hamas has may not be as extensive as Admiral Kirby mentioned. It may be quite tenuous, and it's also subject to the vagaries of their relationships. If there is some kind of dispute between those groups, then the hostages are at much more risk than then they would be if there is no such dispute.",

However, if one of the hostages is somehow injured or through the actions of Hamas, or if the elderly lady who was transferred into Israel just yesterday, if something happens to her medically, like she passes away, that could perhaps change the equation here. So, I think that cooler heads will prevail at the moment. But, there is definitely a risk that things could change. So, I think it's -- right now, things are on track for it, not happening for a military response not to continue. But, if things change or if the atmosphere gets tenser, then it could be different.",

That is costing him support among some Americans, among Democratic voters, among some in the State Department, even some on the White House staff.

And there, frankly, is risk for Trump in losing or even barely winning, because Iowa can be as much about the narrative that explodes after the polls close, as it is about whether you win place or show, that cliche of political reporting that there are three tickets out of Iowa. Kristen Holmes joins me now here in Washington, although not on set. Hi, Kristen, down the hall from us. This is going to be the first time we're actually going to get to see voters test this, what we've seen in the polls from Donald Trump, as to whether or not he is going to remain the frontrunner. I know you and some of our colleagues have some great reporting out this morning about -- basically previewing what it's going to mean. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Look, a lot of this is about momentum. So, if you talk to any of Trump's advisors, they will tell you that they believe that if Donald Trump can win Iowa that he will take it away, the nomination, that is. They also believe that there is a lot of risk involved if he doesn't take that. Now, despite the public polling, despite the fact that Trump has shown enormous lead in the state, I have still heard from some of these advisors who say that they just know that Iowa can be a wildcard. They have obviously been watching the rise of Nikki Haley. They know Ron DeSantis is competitive, despite the fact that he has been dropping in the polls. But, they do feel some confidence there. And part of that is because they actually have a strategy this time around that they just didn't have in 2016. You mentioned those four events that he has held. It's actually -- I think it's been closer to six, but four of them have been these commit to caucus events. And what that is, is essentially having people come, show up and pledge to caucus for Donald Trump. They're also using years of data that Donald Trump's team had gathered since he first visited the state back in 2015. That had largely gone untouched until this campaign cycle, trying to bring those people back out to vote. But, that's one part of this, is that what's going to happen on caucus day. We also have seen what is going on with Nikki Haley. She is pledging to spend $10 million across New Hampshire and Iowa. She needs a strong finish in Iowa to continue going on, although she has obviously pledged to continue at least through South Carolina. DeSantis, as you said, has been all in on Iowa. Where is that going to go? And again, it raises this question of momentum. What does it mean if Donald Trump wins, or what does it mean if he loses? I've heard from some Republican operatives who say if he loses, it could mean a very long primary cycle.",

At first, the Iowa Des Moines Register poll with NBC News from the end of October, Trump 43 percent, DeSantis 16 percent, Hailey 16 percent, Scott seven percent, Ramaswamy four percent. The story of this poll was really the movement of Haley up towards DeSantis. DeSantis falling a little bit back there. Now, let's go to New Hampshire. This is a CNN poll from earlier this month. It has Trump at 42 percent, Haley at 20 percent, and more clear there, you can see it there, second place for her in New Hampshire than in Iowa, Christie at 14 percent, Chris Christie, and then DeSantis has fallen all the way back to nine percent, Ramaswamy at eight percent. Susan Page, this is really -- it paints a picture of a field. Haley does, I think, have an opening here to become the clear second choice. But, there are two issues. There is Donald Trump, which Doug covered. The other issue may be Chris Christie in New Hampshire, because he was on -- he had said something similar to this. She asked him if you're going to be in the -- through the -- in the race through the New Hampshire primary. He says that he expects to be in through the convention. He was very explicit with me when I asked him, are you going to drop out before New Hampshire? He said, no. And then, this is kind of how he put it more broadly in terms of the consolidation of the field. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This race is consolidated very nicely. You really now and in live view have four major contenders for the nomination, Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, me and Nikki Haley. And the fact is that we're the major contenders for the nomination.

On the other hand, for Hamas, their principal donor in this is actually Qatar. And Qatar is putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to extend the ceasefire. Their stated goal is to have a durable ceasefire and -- as opposed to as a temporary truce, and that is something that is pretty congruent with the U.S. desire right now. So, those two countries, Qatar and the United States, working in essence together with their respective parties, that makes a big difference, I think, in this, and it could potentially lead to a longer situation where there is at least some type of cessation of hostilities.

But, as the numbers of women and children go down, you're going to be left with different categories of prisoners who are military-age males, potentially Israeli male soldiers, potentially Israeli female soldiers, also American males and males of other nationalities. So, we have seen quite a large number of Thai nationals be being released. But, there are a bunch of other dual nationals that are there from around various European countries.

While it's helpful, it's not nearly enough. The UN in Gaza said that they would need 200 trucks coming in daily for two months just to meet the need, and that the idea that only northern Gaza needs the most aid is inaccurate. The needs are overwhelming. They're all across the strip. Part of this deal included a ceiling on how many trucks can come in, 200 every day. And yet, that's not nearly enough. For some days, it didn't even hit that. Part of the problem on Saturday which led to Hamas delaying the release of the hostages, Kasie, was that not enough aid was going into northern Gaza. The UN now tells that the Palestinian Red Crescent that at least 150 trucks have gone in by Saturday -- by Sunday. Another 50 trucks were sent in today. They need a lot more of that. But, the Qataris, the Egyptians, and the people who are trying to mediate and extend truce say they want that amount of aid coming in to be dramatically increased. That's part of the problem. For instance, they are sending in medicines, and they are stuck on the Rafah Border Crossing on the Egyptian side for sometimes up to two weeks where they're no longer necessary. They're no longer -- they've expired, in some cases. And so, they want the problem -- the process to go much faster. Part of the issue here or at least the positive thing is that with a pause in finding over the last four days, people have been able to go back to their markets, will be able to buy some essentials.
