So it can be done. We have proof of that.And we know that there are differences of opinions between the leadership of Hamas inside Gaza and those based in Qatar. But if an agreement is reached, it will have been agreed upon by the leadership in Gaza as well as the leadership outside of it. And it's also worth pointing out that there are lots of differences within the Israeli government as well, and obviously these need to be ironed out if any sort of agreement is reached. And as I said, the signals from within the Israeli government itself are mixed with Prime Minister Netanyahu under pressure from the extreme right-wing members of his cabinet. And oftentimes we've seen Israel seems to be on the brink of agreeing to a deal, and then they change their mind, obviously because of internal political considerations. So there's lots of things to consider. Both sides seem to be somewhat conflicted, to say the least, Kim.",

Well Ukraine has come under a relentless barrage of Russian assaults this week. Ukraine's national police said on Thursday Russia carried out nearly 2,000 rocket artillery and airstrikes in a single day in the eastern Donetsk region. The attacks hit 10 settlements, killing four people and wounding eight. Meanwhile, the death toll in a Russian attack on Odessa on Tuesday rose to six after one of the wounded victims died in hospital. That's according to Ukraine authorities who said the attack left an educational institution engulfed in flames. Officials said Russian forces carried out another ballistic missile attack on Odessa on Wednesday, wounding at least 14 people. The U.K. is offering its unwavering support and billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron pledged more than $3 billion of annual military aid for Ukraine for, quote, as long as it takes. He met with Ukraine's president and foreign minister on Thursday during his second visit to Kyiv, and he paid his respects to fallen Ukrainian troops. Cameron defended Ukraine's right to carry out attacks inside Russia, including with British military aid. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Kenya Met Department predicting that even more rainfall is expected in the next two days, and that's already coming true. As we speak, it's raining here in Nairobi. There's already been some reports of flooding on some major highways and some residential neighborhoods, and that is why the Kenyan government now warning that people that live within 178 different filled up or nearly filled up dams or water reservoirs need to vacate within 24 hours. And if they do not do so, the government is warning that they will be forcefully evacuated for their own safety. That is the latest warning as the country grapples with the extent of the damage from the heavy rainfall that Kenya has been receiving since the beginning of March. More than 180 people have died in this flash flooding. There's been almost 200,000 people affected. In what the Kenya Met Department considers enhanced rainfall due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, and President William Ruto has called, they are victims of climate change. But in reality for so many people having to move from their homes at a moment's notice, it is a true tragedy because in some cases they have escaped with nothing but the clothes on their back, and they're the lucky ones because there's so many families having to bury loved ones over this past few weeks.
