They are baseless, personal and dangerous. Also saying: Disagreements about politics are good for our democracy. They're normal. But using conspiracy theories, falsehoods, violence, and threats of violence to affect political outcomes is not normal. They are dangerous for our democracy. This must stop.

And when the Republicans have virtually done nothing in their majority, nothing for the American people. They keep coming up with plots and investigations and hearings that mean absolutely -- and turns out to be nothing. They're nothingburgers. This is -- you know, I've been in Congress for over 26 years and this is like nothing ever before. We should be doing legislative work. There's a lot of things that we need to be doing, should be doing in a collective manner, in a bipartisan manner for the American people.

But these endless investigations in virtually every committee, Kate, just about every committee.

In fact, the ICC specifically said, well, the reason why we didn't go after Assad for war crimes and we didn't issue a warrant at -- after he killed 300,000 civilians with chemical weapons, by the way, gassing them, it's because we don't have jurisdiction.

And I think that the bill that passed was so wide, you know, in sanctioning allies that would have been sanctioned and other individuals who are friends that it was just too much.

If you take a look at a recent poll from \"The New York Times\" and Siena College, while Biden was ahead with about 63 percent of support from Black voters. Donald Trump had 23 percent. That's a historic high for Republicans, crossing that 20 percent margin. Now, if you take a look at 2020, you've seen a much wider gap in that contest. Black voters really made up a key part of Biden's constituency back in 2020. And campaign advisers acknowledged they have more work to do heading into this election, especially as we have seen, this narrowing of support. So, as you saw in the president's remarks, you saw in recent events, thinking back to his speech at Morehouse College, speech at an NAACP event, out in Detroit.
