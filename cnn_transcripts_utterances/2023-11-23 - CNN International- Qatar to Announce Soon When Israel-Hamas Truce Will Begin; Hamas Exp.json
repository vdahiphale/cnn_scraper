A diplomatic source says it's likely to start Friday, as early as midnight local time or 5The hostage release and Israel's pause in its military campaign in Gaza were delayed on Wednesday. Hamas is expected to release at least 50 women and children over the next few days. A source tells CNN the U.S. has a working list of hostages they believe are likely to be freed first. Hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails are also set to be released. The White House says the delay is due to logistical details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Well, we're not going into this with hubris or arrogance or ultra-confidence. We're grateful that we were able to get this deal secured. But as I said, it all now comes down to execution. And so, we're -- nobody's doing any touchdown dancing here. There's still work to be done and a long way to go. We're hoping, hoping that implementation will start sometime in the next 24 hours or so and then continue for the next few days, both days of a pause where there will be no fighting so humanitarian assistance can get in at an accelerated rate and of course, getting all those 50 plus hostages out. Now, they'll come out in increments. They won't all come out together and that's why this is a multi-day process. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What's your understanding about these logistical details they've been heading into? YAAKOV KATZ, SENIOR COLUMNIST AND EDITOR, THE JERUSALEM POST AND AUTHOR, \"SHADOW STRIKE\":  These are very complicated situations, right? We -- Israel is not talking directly with Hamas. It's only working through intermediaries and mediators such as the Qataris who are in Doha. The Qataris are talking to Hamas leaders that live in Doha, but they also don't necessarily have direct line to the Hamas leaders who are underground, they're hiding inside some bomb shelter or bunker in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. So, it's very technical, it's very complicated, and the steps move very slowly. With that said, it's also -- there's a lot of pressure, right? Israel still has forces on the ground inside Gaza. Those operations are continuing. And part of what Hamas's strategy, I think, here is to get Israel to stop for a few days so it can regroup, rearm, redeploy and be better prepared for continued offensive later on.",

      "sentences": "You're right, Max. You know, on the one hand, you have the situation where everybody wants to do whatever is possible to get back these hostages. The fact that so many civilians were taken, there's over 235 Israelis who are still being held inside the Gaza Strip -- or hostages in the Gaza Strip, and they're under this deal, they're only getting back about 50 of the women and children, and the elderly women, but there's still going to be a lot who will be left inside Gaza.So, Israel -- Israelis are very much aligned that everything needs to be done to get back the hostages. With that said, Israelis are also very aligned and support the government's offensive and the military operation to take down Hamas, to degrade Hamas's capabilities, to remove it from power in Gaza and prevent it from ever, ever being able to carry out the atrocities and massacre like it did on October 7th. Now, if the operation stops now, when only half of Gaza has been conquered by Israel, and still so many thousands of Hamas fighters alive and still armed to the teeth in the south of Gaza, with the Hamas leadership still intact, the operation is not yet a success. And I think the concern is that we could very see how this plays out, that ultimately, the operation just comes to an end. There will be international pressure. Hamas will trickle out hostages every single day. Under the deal, it's 10 a day. They'll offer at day five. Give us another couple of days. We'll give you a few more. The Americans, the Europeans will be pressuring Israel to agree to a long- term ceasefire. What does this mean for the continued security, though, of the State of Israel? And that is the question that hovers above everything right now.",

Because some are suggesting that perhaps European leaders, you know, they remain behind Israel's right to defend itself, but at the same time feel that the number of civilian casualties is too high, and there needs to be a reset there. So, perhaps a slight separation between the views of the U.S. and Europe on this one.",

And it's important, right, because the military operation requires the resilience of the Israeli people, it requires the military to have the capabilities, the munitions, the arms, the military platforms it needs, but it also requires Israel to have the international legitimacy and for its allies to support it.Today, we saw the visit of David Cameron, the former British prime minister, now foreign secretary, visiting one of the Israeli communities that was ravaged and rampaged through by those Hamas terrorists on October 7th. He's here in Israel. I think the support still stands, and I'll tell you why, I think that the political leadership in these countries, they all understand that what happened here in Israel on October 7th, it started here, but it could -- they could easily envision and imagine it one day happening in their own countries. When you look at the bridge of London and you see the hundreds of thousands of people who are walking there and chanting intifada and they are chanting for jihad and you see the pictures that are coming out of France and the explosion of antisemitism, this is a battle against all of the values that we should all share, all people of the West and all democratic people. And while today they attack Israel, tomorrow it could be in the U.K., it could be in France and Germany, it could be in the United States of America. And that is why these leaders should stand strong and understand that this is a battle for all civilized life today on this planet.",
