We're talking about defense-related information. Information that would be harmful to the United States if it was exposed or helpful for somebody who's a foreign adversary.

The strengths and weaknesses here? SHAN WU, DEFENSE ATTORNEYTrump himself recognizing that he cannot declassify documents once he leaves. The notion that he had some sort of standing order to declassify has been widely debunked by people who actually work with him. So, I think that's also a weakness. I mean they're a little bit between a rock and a hard place on this because he's been so all over the board as to where he actually declassified or can he do it at will by just thinking about it. And, of course, the biggest problem with that argument as a defense is that the particular charge, Espionage Act, really does not depend on whether they're classified or not, it's just documents relating to the national defense.

The discretion to figure out, when you want to pursue charges and when you do not. But it's always based on the evidence.Drawing analogies between the conduct of say Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, or even former Vice President Mike Pence, or even current President Joe Biden, as then vice president, has to do with the conduct at issue not just the existence of information. Remember, Clinton's e-mail server contained classified information, not documents that had the actual tags and the headlines that you saw in physical, tangible documents. And, according to their allegations that are asserted in this particular complaint, Donald Trump did never -- never tried to actually return them. Doubled down, tripled down, quadrupled down that he had every right to access them, to retain them as well. And the core of this entire investigation and indictment is also obstruction. What did you do to avoid the federal grand jury reviewing this case? What are you doing to avoid any sort of prosecution? Why not just return them and have that be drawn out or considered later on. That's the big question here. And that's the crux, that and a conspiracy.",

We do not use that privilege as a way to shield people from making crimes. You don't say, you know what, let's plan a crime. Don't worry, I told my attorney about it, we're good to go here. That would be absurd. And so they have to actually reconcile that.Now, the fact that it's now down, of course, in Florida, very different, could be, but we have no idea standing here right now, what was the deciding factor for the grand jury?

Christie also making it clear that he is, so far, the only Republican presidential candidate willing to harshly criticize the current frontrunner. CNN's Omar Jimenez joins us now.

But a big part of the Christie campaign is taking on Donald Trump directly. And he leaned heavily into that.For example, he didn't just talk about, for example, I should say, when he talked about the House, White House and Senate being lost from Republicans under Trump. He could have just said that. Instead, he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He hasn't won a damn thing since 2016. Three-time loser. 2018, we lost the House. 2020, we lost the White House. We lost the United States Senate a couple weeks later in 2021. And in 2022 we lost two more governorships, another Senate seat and barely took the House of Representatives, when Joe Biden had the most incompetent first two years I've ever seen in my life. Loser, loser, loser. Now we're getting going. It will be different this time. Why? Why will it be different this time? (END VIDEO CLIP) JIMENEZ: And I think it was incapsulated by the loser, loser, loser that Christie said there. Now, on Trump's indictment, Christie believes that the alleged conduct from Trump is inexcusable, especially for someone who wants to be president. But we'll see if - if this spurs any momentum because, obviously, up to this point, Christie has not been polling at the top of GOP leaderboards.",

You also heard yesterday from Republican whip John Thune, who said that these are very serious allegations. As well as John Cornyn, another member of Republican leadership, who said simply, this is not good. Meanwhile, you have some Republicans in the House of Representatives who want to take action to try and defend the president, including taking steps like defending the special counsel's office. That is an idea that Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested yesterday. I'm told that she talked about this yesterday with Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman. They discussed it in a House Freedom Caucus meeting. But it just shows you the lengths that some Republican allies of the former president are going to, to try and defend him.

Thousands of Denver Nuggets fans took to the streets after the Nuggets clinched their first NBA championship last night, but police say that things turned violent just before 1:00 a.m. Nine people were shot, ten if you count the suspect, who was taken into custody. Police say -- Denver Police say that three victims remain in critical condition at a local hospital. The other victims, including the suspect, appear to have non-life-threatening injuries. Now, the shooting took place in downtown Denver. Locals refer to this as the LoDo District. It's also near Coors Field and roughly within a mile of the Ball Arena, where Nuggets -- the Nuggets defeated the Miami Heat on Monday night. This area is famous for a lot of sports bars. They were, of course, packed last night as the basketball fans celebrated late into the night. Now, we don't know exactly what led to this violence. Police say that this is a complex and ongoing investigation that is in its very early stages. The preliminary info indicates multiple shots were fired during that altercation involving several individuals. Now, this violence is among at least 291 mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year in which four or more people were shot, excluding the shooter. This is according to the Gun Violence Archive. Denver Police are still investigating last night's incident, and they do say that updates will be provided as they are - as they become available.

In this latest atrocity, 11 people at least killed. At the beginning of the day, two dozen or so were reported to be injured when a residential block was hit in their important central industrial city. This just the latest of what is an ongoing campaign against Russia's civilians with the use of these precision missiles. You use the term advisedly there, John. Cruise missiles are, generally speaking, even the Russian version of them, supposedly deadly accurate. And they have hit clearly - almost certainly with intent, a civilian area of that city.But this coming at a time when the Russians on the battlefield are under pressure, John. There is ongoing fighting going on in the Zaporizhzhia front line. That is a relatively new development from the Ukrainian side. I think part of the early stages of their counter offensive and they are continuing to advance, they say, southeast of the eastern city of Bakhmut. All of this adding up to an increase in the tempo of the Ukrainian counter offensive. And, of course, they are taking casualties as a consequence of that.
