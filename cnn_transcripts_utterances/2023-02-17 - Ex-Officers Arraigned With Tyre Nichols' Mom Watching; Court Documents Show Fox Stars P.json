And as far as those cases being dismissed, don't be surprised if that number doesn't grows substantially, because you had other officers there who submitted reports that were probably falsified.

And they have to be zealous advocates for their clients.So, we're going to hear them spinning information however they can to suggest that their clients are innocent. But reality is we saw it with our very eyes. Our eyes don't lie. The videotapes don't lie. We saw them brutalize Tyre Nichols. We saw use a level of force that was inhumane and definitely not constitutional. So, there is no doubt in my mind that these cases go to trial, they would be found guilty at least on some of the charges and I suspect on even some of the more serious charges. Which is why I do believe that you're going to see some of them starting to point the fingers and saying, I didn't do it, he did it, I did a little something but he did more, and definitely everyone is going to be trying to cover their own behinds and trying to get the best deal that they could possibly get. And the question is, is this prosecutor going to allow there to be a plea deal particularly given the national attention, the international attention that this case has got, prosecutors may say, no deal, we are going to trial because the public has a vested interest in seeing that justice is served in all five of these cases.",

But by the time he was in office, there was this synergy and Fox clearly saw a benefit in terms of viewers and ratings in staying close to Trump.What I was very struck by, Pamela, was this claim in the suit that Trump had tried to get on Lou Dobbs after the riots had taken place but was not totally done yet. This was new information that had not been uncovered at any point in the last couple of years.

And so what you see here is that they are desperate to appease the audience. You see in text messages behind the scenes where they talk about not offending the audience, respecting the audience and in their eyes, I guess, respecting the audience is not telling them inconvenient truths.

They are supposedly kind of multipurpose but much like an American Blackhawk helicopter, but a lot more primitive.Now, these aircrafts are all built before the collapse of the Soviet Union. They are flown by pilots who, luckily for Ukraine, have spent much of the last decade or so flying in Africa for the United Nations, in war-torn parts of Africa or on peacekeeping missions. Therefore, they are quite current, which is important, because they have to fly, and I'm not joking this, below the height of a tree top, not at tree top level but below it, so they have to leap like a skimming stone on water over the bands of trees that separate the fields, to get on the pylons and power lines as they go on these air assaults against their targets around Bakhmut, firing volleys of rockets. And they fly about three missions a day, at least. I spoke to one young pilot, most of them are pretty old, or rather the captains are old. They're paired with younger pilots. But this young man had already flown more than 100 combat missions this year. And the skipper of his aircraft said he certainly couldn't remember and had given up counting long ago how many combat missions they have flown. And they're up against Russian aircraft that can hunt them from a distance. They've got very sophisticated missiles on board these aircraft that can get at these helicopters at a range of about 30 kilometers. So, they have to fly low and slow.

He literally said it like that, it has to hurry up. We need to speed it up. He kept using those words. We are David and Goliath, a little bit like Sam Kiley said, David and Goliath, and we need your aid right now.And he said he wanted the war over by the end of this year, which is why I put it that way to the chancellor. But there is an issue with production, ramping up manufacturing of the ammunition and all of the other stuff that they need to keep prosecuting this war. So, that is what the native NATO allies in Europe are having to do. The next phase is really getting there, manufacturing up and running. And he put it in the context of as if it were cars, as if we had car factories. We're never out of cars. If you want to buy a car, we buy cars. If we need spare parts, they are there.

And that is because the White House has says that President Biden followed the advice of the military out of an abundance of caution and saying that he made the best decision at the time based on the evidence, expressing no regrets, even if indeed it was simply a recreational $12 balloon being shot down with a $400,000 missile.

Those, I think, are among the more important questions.The advantage of a balloon as a surveillance technology, even though it seems quite primitive, and it is, is that it can hover, it can persevere over a location where a satellite is crossing the sky in a predictable pattern. You can hide things on the ground from a satellite, which you may not be able to hide as well from a balloon that can just hover. So, even these primitive technologies, simple technologies can have a real surveillance purpose and it just, I think, illustrates the need to get a much better grip on just what is over our airspace.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Ahmet Ayyan is grieving the loss of his wife and son, while clinging to the one person who willed him to stay alive. My daughter was telling me, papa don't cry, relax. They are coming to rescue us, he says. This is Ahmet four days after he was buried neck-deep in rubble with his wife and two children. Only he and his four-year-old daughter made it out alive. We stayed under the rubble about four days. When the building fell down, my daughter was on my leg. Thank God there was no rocks or something on her. She was rescued first. A half hour later, he was. And the two got separated. He was taken to a hospital. She was eventually taken to social services with barely a scratch on her. For days, he had no idea where his little angel was. Did you worry that you would never see her again? No. Never, he says. You knew you would see her again. And he was right. Tis is the day they were reunited. They screamed and cried, elated to hold each other once more. On the fourth day, my daughter told me, look, papa, there is light. I did not understand the light at the time, he says. Then I heard some voices. Those were the voices of rescuers, and a family member later found her in social services and made the connection. Can Gursoy is hoping by hope he, too, will also be reunited with his parent. I have one request for you. Please help me find my mother, Shukran Erdin (ph), he tells us. He and his family were trapped inside this collapsed building for 24 hours. He and his sister made it out. His mother has not been seen since. I remember the collapsing of the building. I remember passing out after a piece of the house hit me in the eye, he says. Can you describe what it was like in this type space physically for you? It was so difficult to breathe there. On the other hand, there was something crushing my leg, making me suffer, he says. Ultimately, it was his decision to pull on a bit of the curtains that were visible to the outside that alerted someone he was alive. While he continues searching for his mother, Ahmet is nursing his foot injury while thanking God he has at least one person left to love. That's my daughter, he says, and she is my little hero, my hero. Sara Sidner, CNN, Adana, Turkey. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
