This is the second hour of the show from Abu Dhabi, where the time is just before six in the evening, andyou're watching pictures from Tel Aviv, where thousands of protesters are demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. In the last hour, we've seen an outpouring of grief and tributes in Jerusalem for slain Israeli American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose parents hoped for his release until the very end. Also in the news today, Russia launches new attacks on key Ukrainian cities as the two sides trade blows. We'll be live in Kyiv. And shifting from candidate to surrogate, President Joe Biden will return to the campaign trail for the first time since dropping out in favor of Kamala Harris. Well, it's a huge day of protests, and just ended strike in Israel, the grief and the anger palpable as a funeral is held for one of the six hostages murdered by Hamas and found by Israeli troops over the weekend. We've been showing you pictures of the funeral of Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin through the first hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. His death and the killing of five others, sparking the latest protests and a general strike that impacted services across the country. A court ordered that strike to end a few hours early, and an Israeli labor union said that it would respect the court's order. Well, the protesters are directing intense anger at Israel's Prime Minister, blaming Benjamin Netanyahu for not agreeing to a U.S. ceasefire hostage release deal that has been negotiated for months. Well, back in Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are meeting at the White House, along with the U.S. team involved in hostage negotiations to try and chart a path forward.

And for what, I have to say nearly three months when we first learned the details of what was this bridging proposal back at the back end of May, what's the perspective there today? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, that's right. I mean, there has been hope. There has been aspirations that they are in the final stretch of some deal coming together for quite some time now, it was, you know, about six weeks ago that we heard from the secretary of state saying that they were on the 10-yard mark in terms of securing a deal to get these hostages released. And then, of course, this devastating news over the weekend, we just heard from President Biden heading into the White House for a meeting with his national security team, and he made some pretty interesting and noteworthy remarks that you guys played in the introduction there. Specifically when asked if Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to secure a deal, he bluntly said, no. And Becky, we have reported quite extensively on the growing frustrations within the Biden administration when it comes to Netanyahu and his team. And the Biden administration feel like they weren't necessarily doing enough to get a deal in place, but they have been reluctant to voice any of those concerns publicly. So, the fact that President Biden did that today is, of course, noteworthy, and what he's doing is echoing what has been these loud and vocal frustrations from the family members of those hostages, particularly, of course, those who were killed over the weekend. I want to play a portion of what one of the cousins of Carmel Gat, an Israeli from Tel Aviv who was murdered over the weekend said, as they lay blame on Netanyahu, listen to that.

What it demonstrates is that the Biden administration feels like there is a final deal to be put on the table here. We have seen multiple iterations, multiple deals, but one complicating factor, Becky, is that we are told, according to a senior administration official, that one of the final deals that they were putting together before what occurred over the weekend included some of those hostages that were murdered by Hamas over the weekend. So, they're going to go have to go back to the drawing board to figure out what they can put on the table, and we'll watch to see exactly when that happens.

There are 101 other hostages being held by Hamas. And so, when the Histadrut is saying we need to get Israel back on its tracks, we're saying precisely that the priorities need to be the people. The people need to have leaders that they look up to, and they can say, I trust him. The amount of people that were out on the streets last night just goes to show how much frustration there is here, the understanding that perhaps a deal could have been made two weeks ago to bring back Hersh Polin that we just watched his mother over his grave saying, now that you're free, that is just heart wrenching.

I hope to death, but not but we need to be concerned, because we see thatthere were six people alive last week, that if a deal would have been made two weeks ago, maybe they would have been back home today. So, I'm concerned, and I would say absolutely there is right to be concerned. My -- when I reflected in the interview in Haaretz about how the government has been conducting its international diplomatic efforts, was precisely because of things said that do not reflect in the policies of the idea of how the combat is actually being conducted on the ground, and I saw a huge disparity between the two, between how conduct -- how conduct and the combat of conduct is being implemented in the field, compared to the outrageous statement some of the politicians were saying uncontrollably for petty politics. So, I think your war is a serious business. And the lives of those soldiers that are being put forward, the lives of the hostages that are -- that cannot be sacrificed, they need to be brought home. And that is precisely you know why the Histadrut, I'm very proud to serve -- to wear a uniform for the military, and I'm very proud to wear the civilian attire for the community of the workers of Israel, those that care so much about this country. And indeed, that is precisely where we have to move forward. We have to put the interests of people before politics, and for too much -- too much time now, it's unclear exactly what is leading. You know, the Histadrut has been a very responsible player over the last 11 months. It is not a simple feat to conduct a general strike when you shut down the ports, when you shut down rail down or bring down the level of operations of hospitals or private and various different companies. This is a very, very serious decision. And you know, today is Labor Day in the U.S., and this is -- these are things that we do not take for granted, and we do not do just on the whim of a moment of a minute thought. This is a very serious issue, and that is why we're very glad we've got the attention of the government, but also of the international arena.",

So, that's obviously a sort of a terror tactic, if you like.The air raid started just before or around 5:30 a.m. here in the capital. And then there were the reports of all these explosions. We're told by authorities that dozens of missiles ballistic and crews were sent against this city and others, and that some of the air defenses intercepted some of them, but some of them struck. Struck a combination we understand of the usual infrastructure targets, whether energy or otherwise. And obviously there are some Russian missiles that are targeting any kind of Ukrainian arms or other such defense industry locations as well. Now, this is the third time in a week that there's been this stepped up kind of war returning to the cities, and it doesn't -- it's not an accident that it comes around the time, just a few weeks since that very, very extraordinary and surprise Ukrainian incursion into Kursk in the Russian region of Kursk. And at the same time, you know, Ukraine's Pokrovsk area, which is in the East in the Donbas region, is under fierce assault from Russia. So, what we've got right now is a multi-pronged war, if you like, what we call the war of the cities, which is mostly on the infrastructure, with Ukraine also targeting Russian energy infrastructure, as it did this weekend, hitting a refinery, hitting other targets, even close to Moscow. And again, on the battlefield in the East and in the North, you've got the Ukrainians incursion into Kursk and you've got the Russians are really accelerating and gaining ground against one of Ukraine's key logistical hubs in the occupied area of Donetsk and Donbas. So, that is what's going on right now. At the same time, Ukraine has sent officials to the United States. They are presenting to the administration what President Zelenskyy calls his four part victory plan. We're not sure what those details are, what the -- what, you know, part one to four are, but we do know that one of the things they really do want is to be allowed to actually use the weapons they're being given without any shackles or restrictions. The prime minister of the Netherlands has been in this capital today, and we know that the Dutch government has said that Ukraine is free to use any weapons it gets from them without restrictions, Becky.",

They argue President Biden and Vice President Harris that they have been the most pro-labor administration in American history, and while Republicans have made gains with rank and file union workers, really through a cultural appeal. They maintain that when it comes down to business, legislation, policies that most support union workers, that they are the team. We have seen the vice president embrace this theme of a new way forward. I'm standing in front of her campaign bus that says just that. She argues that she is principally concerned about the future while the former President Donald Trump is caught up in the past. But Becky, that is somewhat of a hard argument to make, given that she is currently in government, currently in the administration, yet she is embracing President Biden in strategic ways, especially when it comes to appealing to union workers, in which he is so popular.

So, in a -- in a central zones -- central zone, in southern zone, and northern zone. Each zone, we will vaccinate for three days, most likely another day, three plus one, and then we shift to the other zone. And then, four weeks later, we do the same. So, we started yesterday with a southern zone. And the southern zone, the target population is 156,583. Then, we moved to the south, target population 340,000 kids, and north, 150. So, yesterday, was a good day. It was actually a successful day. I was not completely surprised, because the Gaza population, there is a high acceptance for vaccination, but I think they came out in their growth. Families, fathers, mothers -- have a children.

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky. The union, UNITE HERE, has said that they are prepared to strike for more days,if necessary, in order to get a deal. Now, we're seeing strikes across 25 different cities -- and excuse me, 25 different hotels across different cities. Baltimore has just added itself to the current strike. Workers in Baltimore walked off the job this morning, and more than 10,000 workers are walking the picket line. Now, as you said, it is Labor Day here in the United States, and it is a day where we are supposed to celebrate the contributions of workers as well as the labor movement. But the union is choosing this holiday in order to send a message. They want better wages, they want better working conditions, and specifically, Becky, they want a restoration of many of the cuts that were made during the pandemic. As, you know, the hotel industry, the travel industry, was so severely impacted by the pandemic, but these workers say that many of the people who were not traveling are back to traveling again. Tourism is back, travelers are back. But they are still having to do the same jobs with not as many workers and with not as much pay. They say that their wages are not reflecting the increase in earnings that their employers are making. So far, The Marriott hotel chain, the Hyatt, as well as the Hilton are being affected by this. I want you to take a listen to a one worker talking about why she is been on the picket line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
