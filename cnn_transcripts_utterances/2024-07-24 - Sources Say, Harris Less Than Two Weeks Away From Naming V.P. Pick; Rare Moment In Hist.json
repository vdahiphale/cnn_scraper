CNN has learned that Vice President Kamala Harris is less than two weeks away from naming her running mate as Democrats push toward making her their presidential nominee. This is as we're standing by for President Biden to explain to the nation why he ended his campaign, the White House calling it a rare moment in history.Also breaking, Donald Trump is returning to the trail tonight. He's about to speak at his first campaign rally since the Democrats' dramatic shakeup. We're standing by to hear how Trump takes on his new opponent in a crucial battleground state. Plus, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, faces the U.S. Congress offering a strident defense of the war in Gaza and dismissing anti-war protesters as, quote, useful idiots of the country he sees as the gravest threat, Iran. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. It's a very busy night of breaking news in the presidential race, including new information on the timetable for Vice President Kamala Harris to reveal her vice presidential pick. Our correspondents are standing by covering the Harris and Trump campaigns and the White House. First, let's go to CNN's Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, tell us what you're learning about the search for Harris' running mate.",

      "sentences": "Wolf, we're learning tonight that Vice President Harris is less than two weeks away from picking a vice presidential candidate of her own. This is a very accelerated and truncated process. Of course, she is just on the verge of becoming the nominee herself. There's no opposition to her inside the Democratic Party, but we do know that the vetting has begun. A team of lawyers, we are told, are looking into the finances, the voting records, the public statements, and social media and the like in family histories and backgrounds of several candidates with the idea of having a candidate for the vice president to announce in less than two weeks' time.The list of contenders, we are told, include North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who has a long relationship with the vice president, they served together as attorney general, also Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Now, both of these two men have been elected statewide in their respective states, Cooper six times, Shapiro three times in Pennsylvania. Of course, both of these are battleground states. We also believe that Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona is also said to be on the short list. The Democratic lawyers are also looking at his background. Of course, he's a NASA astronaut, has a military career of his own. The list also includes Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and I'm told Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Of course, Buttigieg has already been vetted and confirmed by the Senate. He's also close to the vice president. And, of course, he ran a presidential campaign of his own. And he's a frequent spar out there on a cable television and other places. He has traveled around the country extensively. So, the vice president is looking at him as well. But, Wolf, all of this is coming as she is going to reach one of the biggest decisions she will make in her young candidacy. I'm told that pollsters are also sort of sizing up how each of these candidates would work with her in hypothetical matchups in these battleground states. I'm told that Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, is also playing a role as an unofficial adviser, as he does on every big decision. So, Wolf, taken together, what this means is that she'll be making a phone call almost four years to the day that she received that phone call from Joe Biden. She was asked to be his running mate back on August 11th, 2020. She'll be making that call, I'm told, before August 7th of 2024.",

LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, there's no question that this is about to be one of the most defining speeches of President Biden's career. We know that he is going to elaborate on his decision to drop out of the 2024 race and also set forth his agenda for the remaining months of his time in office. This is a speech, Wolf, that the president began drafting while he was still isolating in Rehoboth, and I am told that he has been working on this throughout the day here at the White House with his top advisers and speech writers. And as is expected with many of his major speeches, it is likely that he will be putting the final touches on this speech until the final moments before he begins those remarks from the Oval Office. But, Wolf, as we tonight see the president beginning the final chapter of his political career, we are also seeing on vivid display Vice President Kamala Harris starting a new chapter. She has, in just a matter of days, with really extraordinary speed, gotten the party to really coalesce behind her candidacy, and earlier today, speaking to an audience full of black women in Indianapolis. She made clear that she sees them as being critical to the outcome of the 2024 election, just as they were back in 2020. Take a listen.

For the first time in all of the rallies I have been to, they played a video on the Jumbotron behind me featuring Kamala Harris, painting her as a radical liberal, going through things that she said when she was running for president just several years ago, trying to highlight those various policies. Again, this is obviously a brand new video.And we expect to hear Donald Trump really shaping. His attacks on Kamala Harris tonight, he often uses these rallies to feed off the crowd to try different messaging, and that's what we believe we'll see later. Now, on social media, he has been ranting against her, calling her things, like dumb as rocks, but on a call with reporters yesterday, Wolf, he was much more tailored in his messaging, trying to paint her as having a very liberal record, going back to her time as a prosecutor in California, talking about the fact that she, as the second in command, was in charge, or at least part in charge of those policies that are unpopular when it comes to President Joe Biden, like immigration, like crime, like inflation. That is what his team wants him to focus on. That is what they want all Republicans to be focused on is her record and tying her to Joe Biden and Joe Biden's policies. Remember, Wolf, we are really in a race right now to define Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is part of that. They believe there is an education gap that people don't know a lot about Harris and they want to use that void in the next several days, weeks, to fill it with negative information around Kamala Harris to be the ones who define Harris instead of Harris being able to define herself.",

Obviously, it was not true of Pete Buttigieg. He has two children, which I noted in that interview. But I think what that moment also says is what they are looking for, someone who is going to go toe to toe with Senator Vance on that debate stage when that happens, and looking at that aspect of how they're doing this. That's why you're seeing all of these candidates, almost with the exception of hardly anyone, Roy Cooper maybe has been a little quieter going out on T.V. and Josh Shapiro, and kind of making their case for why they should be on the ticket with her. CHALIAN: We should note also, J.D. Vance is not resurfacing those comments right now.

He understands that he has not been controlling the state of play for the last several days. You had the historic announcement from Joe Biden on Sunday that he was stepping down, his endorsement of Harris, Harris coalescing the Democratic Party around her bid for the presidency, and that just was consuming all the oxygen. We know Donald Trump is not a big fan when other people are consuming the oxygen because it means he's not dictating the state of play.So, the goal here, and I think he just tipped his hand off the top, was to get that back and start laying out how he plans to run against Harris, certainly by looking at her record of policy proposals from back in the day, but also obviously, as he and his allies have indicated her assignment by President Biden in this administration to be involved with some of the root causes of the immigration problem is clearly going to be something they keep going at her with front and center, given how important the immigration issue is. And I just thought when you said vintage Trump, I mean, he was actually referencing his lines from 2015. That's how it was vintage Trump because he was like, remember, I used to say all the time about the cameras in the back of the room and they don't turn around and show the crowd, he was ticking through his crowd size. I mean, that is vintage Donald Trump wanting to focus on things that are not pertinent necessarily to the run, but make him feel better and try and give this sense of, don't be buying into that Harris momentum.

And as he's shifting to a new challenger, and he had had everything prepared against President Biden, he kind of had it memorized in his sleep, essentially. This is new ground for him.And this is what actually how Donald Trump typically goes through, you know, what he's going to use against someone, he did it in the 2016 primary, he did it in the 2016 election in 2020, is he'll try out lines at the crowd at his rallies and see what gets the most audience reaction and appeal and applause. And that is something that he'll adopt. And you'll start to see more of. He's been going crazy on social media against Harris ever since it was very clear that she is going to be the one challenging him this November. So, expect to see more of that. Also, he's mispronouncing her name multiple times. That is something we've seen a lot of Republicans do who do know how to pronounce the vice president's name. The other thing that stood out to me, though, Wolf, was I don't think that we have seen Donald Trump connect his attempted assassination, which he was just recounting right there, to when people and Democrats and his political opponents often say he's a threat to democracy. Now, he himself has said that about President Biden, trying to turn the tables around on him. We've seen his allies connected to that. I think this is the first time that we have seen Donald Trump try to draw a line between that rhetoric and his attempted assassination, even though, I should note, the FBI itself has not done that.",

I can't fact check claims that, you know, she's liberal or extreme or so on, but there were a few claims that were flat out wrong.So, he said, she was the border czar, but she never went to the border. First of all, she did go to the border. She went to the border in Texas in mid-2021. Republicans before that had complained that she had not gone, but Trump has just continued to say she never went, even though she did go. And second, and more substantially, she was never actually border czar. She got an assignment from President Biden to help lead the -- sorry, to lead the diplomatic efforts related to the so-called root causes of migration in three countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Now, some on the right get angry at fact checks like this because they say, look at all these media articles from back then in 2021 that said she was put in charge of the border or she was border czar. Well, those articles did not get it right, frankly, and her assignment was much more limited. Former President Trump also said that Harris let in 20 million illegal immigrants across the border, aside from the fact that, again, she was not in charge of border security itself. That number is way too high. The number of so-called border encounters under Biden is about 10 million. Not all those people actually entered. Many of them were expelled. And even if you add so called gotaways, people who evaded border authorities, maybe a couple million more, that doesn't get you close to 20 million. And then third of all, much less importantly, but Classic Donald Trump, crowd size. He said Harris may have had a crowd of 1,000, I doubt it. Then he said maybe it was 2,000. At this rally in Wisconsin yesterday, she had a capacity crowd of more than 3,000. So, he perpetually inflates his own and I guess deflates his opponent's crowds as well.",

What we know is that in all of the polls that we're seeing, there's a couple of points difference within the margin of error of at least from most of the polls than I have seen. And we've not even had our convention yet. So, we know there's going to be a significant bump in the convention once we get to Chicago and as she continues to go out and show people who she is as a nominee, as our nominee, then I know that more and more people will come out with they are support in terms of what you'll see in this polling.",

He centering, and listen, I think even Scott or the most robust MAGA voter would tell you that there's not much centering of anyone else outside of Donald Trump to Donald Trump, but in this particular case, Joe Biden is showing the difference, and Kamala Harris is showing the difference, because you don't have to resort to mispronouncing someone's name, just tweeted and actually texted Jason Miller to explain to him how to pronounce Kamala. Like you don't have to go to the depths of hell and disrespect with individuals to talk about what this country should be. And I think this speech tonight is going to be about the simple fact that Joe Biden did not believe it was in the best interest of democracy for him to lead. And so whether or not you're Democrat or Republican, whether or not you agree or disagree, you have to believe that he was putting someone else first. He was putting this country first, and that's what he believes. He's putting the future first. And that's what he believes. So tonight should be a special night for the country.",

And so, you know, my heart breaks for Trump, my heart breaks for his family, my heart breaks for just him having to go through that level of trauma and all of those individuals that were there. I'm not sure though, Wolf, with a good question you asked and we've actually learned the lesson and that's my fear.

There was a lot of thanks for both President Biden and President Trump.He spent a lot of time Netanyahu did speaking about the hostages and bringing them home. Critics of Netanyahu said that he's not doing nearly enough to bring them home. In fact, that he's delaying it. I have just learned, Wolf, from a source that there are talks about getting negotiations, backup the running early next week with the top mediators, including the CIA Director Bill Burns. Now as Netanyahu was speaking, protests were raging on the streets of Washington seeing these anti-Israel protests for months.

The civilian death toll is still more than 1 percent of the overall population of Gaza, likely higher. That is shockingly high, Wolf.As far as the aid goes, U.S. officials continue to argue that it is Israel's military operation that makes it very difficult for the aid to be distributed and has caused a breakdown in the security in the Gaza Strip -- Wolf.",
