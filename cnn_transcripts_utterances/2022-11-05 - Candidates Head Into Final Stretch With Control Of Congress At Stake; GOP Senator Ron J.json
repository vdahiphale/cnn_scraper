With those critical midterm elections just three days away, it's all about the states where the races are still considered big tossups. That includes Pennsylvania. President Biden, former President Barack Obama and former President Donald Trump are all in that state today home to a neck-and-neck Senate race.Just a short time from now Biden and Obama will hold a rally in Philadelphia for Senate candidate and current lieutenant governor John Fetterman, and then later tonight it's Trump trying to drum up support for television doctor, Mehmet Oz. Remember, Republicans only need to pick up one Senate seat -- every race is critically important at this point. In the meantime, across the country, voters understand the stakes. More than 34 -- look at this. 34 million ballots have already been cast across the country with key battleground states reporting numbers are up from four years ago. CNN has reporters in key battleground states across this nation. Let's begin with CNN's Phil Mattingly in Philadelphia. Phil, you cannot emphasize how critically important that battleground state is right now. And you just have to look at who the surrogates are. You're covering them all today. What's it look like, Phil?",

The first is just how critical the Senate race in particular is in this state.It's a pickup opportunity for Democrats as they have extraordinarily tight races for several of their incumbents. They view this is a necessity and a very real pickup opportunity. But the others, what this race has become, and this is a race about base voters and turning them out, Jim, Philadelphia in 2020 went to President Biden by 64 points. In a state that President Biden only won by 80,000 votes. This is a blue stronghold. They need turnout here in the cities, that's why President Obama was in Pittsburgh earlier today and delivering this message in support of John Fetterman. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Listen, it's easy to joke about Dr. Oz and all these quack remedies he's pushed on TV, but it matters. It says something about his character. If somebody is willing to peddle snake oil to make a buck then he is probably willing to sell snake oil to get elected. You deserve better than somebody who is just trying to make a quick buck, somebody willing to say anything to get attention. You deserve somebody who knows you. You deserve somebody who stood side by side with you, somebody who will work every day and fight for you, somebody who is actually from Pennsylvania. You deserve somebody like John Fetterman.

We're talking about at least 65,000 Georgians who have been challenged. In the county of Forsythe, one individual alone challenged the eligibility of over 30,000 people. There are voters who have turned up at the polls and they are told that they have been challenged and they're not given reason as to why they're challenged. It creates chaos, it creates voter intimidation, and voters feel disenfranchised for that because it is their fundamental right to vote. And so we have to be very, very careful when we talk about these laws that were created because Republicans did not like the results of the 2020 election and the 2021 election, and they have said that out loud. The Heritage Foundation behind closed doors said this bill was created to make it harder for Georgians to vote and then they took the footprint of the Georgia bill, and copied it and introduced it to states across the entire country because of what happened in the 2020 election.",

GEORGE PATAKI (R), FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR: Yes, Jim, absolutely. I felt it months ago and today it's even stronger. There are three overwhelming issues facing New York. One is crime. Hochul has failed on crime. The other is taxes. We are leading the nation in losing people, population, because the cost of living and the taxes are too high, and then there's inflation. And Albany has been on a spending binge that has helped inflate all these costs. You know, I want to be respectful but I just heard former President Clinton and he said we are scared and angry.

That happens sometimes, but only when you believe the other party is operating in good faith. But, Jim, the calendar is so important here. We are 59 days away from a new Congress taking over. That is all the time the committee has at most. They've got to get their work done if they are serious about this in under two months now. As you said, Trump has a time-honored practice of trying to delay. He's pretty close to the finish line here. It seems to me like he is trying to drag his feet.",

It means he has to testify in the grand jury. He cannot take the Fifth. But his testimony cannot be used against him. That's why we call it immunity. On the other hand, you have to be realistic. We just heard this guy is a longtime cheerleader for Donald Trump. He has said things out in public, including that Donald Trump declassified those Mar-a-Lago documents. So if you were to come clean now and say, no, he never declassified, it will be a disaster trial because the cross examination on this guy is going to be but you first did say he declassified. So I'm not super optimistic that Kash Patel is going to be a star witness here for DOJ.",
