Is it just carte blanche? What does that actually look like. But the other part of ABC's reporting that is so interesting is what he today Jack Smith's team about what was happening, these conversations that he claimed he was telling Trump he did not win the election, it was not rigged, that it was not stolen. I mean, to look at that and to look at what is in Mark Meadows's book, which has been its own source of fascination because of the classified documents case, I mean, in the book he writes basically the complete opposite. Of course, it's not a crime to lie in your book, but I do think that's something that investigators will have questions about, what he said then versus what he is apparently testifying.

We also want to bring in CNN political commentator and former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah, who knows Mark Meadows pretty well, Alyssa Farah Griffin, and former senior investigative counsel to the January 6th select committee, Temidayo Aganga-Williams.Temidayo, I want to start with you, because, to Kaitlan's point, trying to figure out what that means, the structure of it, what it would actually entail, when you read the story, the details that we have according to ABC News, what's your takeaway from it? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, PARTNER, SELENDY GAY ELSBERG:  I do think Kaitlan's right that we should not conflate what would be all-out cooperation, which would be proffer agreements, which means sitting down and really talking about your entire criminal conduct, everything from what you could be charged with here to a piece of candy you stole when you were a kid. That's what federal cooperation looks like. Getting immunity, which is what the report indicates, for testifying in a grand jury, that's something very specific, and that is limited in scope. So that could be basically Jack Smith wanting to get honest testimony on a particular instance about specific questions. That does not mean that Mark Meadows is going to be in court testifying against Donald Trump. I think one of the big problems here you're going to find is he has massive credibility issues. He's going to have to answer the question under cross-examination that, OK, you're going to have to admit you are a liar, and are you lying now or were you lying then? And that's a tough thing. So I think what's going to have to happen is that is there corroboration for any statements that he told Jack Smith? And that's what's going to matter. Did he turn over documents? Did he turn over, the same way he did to the January 6th committee when he provided that treasury trove of text messages.",

And I'm going to speculate a little bit here, but knowing him very well for very many years, he is a good attorney, George Terwilliger, who I think is a serious person who wants to keep Mark Meadows out of jail. I think on the one side he's given him actually sound legal advice about how far he should go in cooperating with the Department of Justice. But I think Mark Meadows publicly wants to still be seen as aligned with Trump world and as somebody who would never flip on him. So his public statements very much may contradict what he is actually doing behind the scenes.Trump world is very aware of this, though. There has been basically a year-and-a-half, two years of souring on him and not trusting that he is engaging in good faith and that he is still loyal to the team. So I think this is a mixture of a smart attorney who wants to, frankly, keep him out of jail, and then Meadows still wanting to stay in the conservative fold, still be a former freedom caucus chairman who is Donald Trump's greatest ally.",

She basically was saying that Rudy Giuliani and others misled her, people with more experience. She is an experienced attorney. She was in there. She knew what she was doing.And so I just think it's fascinating, all of this, seeing her plead guilty and the concerns that Trump world has about that. Mark Meadows, how that's affecting you -- he was involved in the back and forth with the speaker race yesterday. He is talking to all these House Republicans. And one of the parts of the House Republicans' race was whether or not you voted to certify the election. That was disqualifying for Tom Emmer to be House speaker.

So there are statement that indicate he thought that there was a chance he would be holding on. So I think there is going to be a bit of a friction in testimony they may get from him about him saying the election wasn't stolen and apparently allegedly telling the truth to Donald Trump and then when he said to other people.

You know look, you're seeing him very explicitly siding with Hamas, going even further, frankly, than Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for Putin, but very clearly in that camp of looking the other way on the atrocities that were committed by Hamas that we've seen from other leaders, including out of Russia, as well as President Xi and China.
