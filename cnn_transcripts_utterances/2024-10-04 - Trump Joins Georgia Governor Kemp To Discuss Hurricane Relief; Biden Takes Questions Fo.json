He said -- he reminded people that there is an election coming in this, in the state where it's obviously very, very close, and that he promised that if he is elected, he is very committed to this state. That was his direct quote.He also at one point said, I'm not thinking about voters. I'm thinking about lives, but obviously he was also plugging what he would do as president if he were elected. So notable as well that Brian Kemp, the governor of the state, spoke right before Donald Trump, and he did not mention any issues that he has had with the Biden administration or FEMA's response and that has been sort of a thread line through Donald Trumps criticism of the Biden administration response, the Harris-Biden administration, as he puts it, that many local officials, many state officials have said so far that the response has been adequate, that they have received what they have asked for, that the emergency declarations were made early then advance of the storm, and that they have had a open line of communication with the Biden administration. But Donald Trump appearing in a swing state that has been affected by this storm to immense proportions, making it known that he believes that the Harris and Biden team has done a terrible job at the end, terrible was the word he used -- Jake.",

But today, the president had a very surprisingly strong jobs number to talk about, as well as a temporary pause in dockworkers strike. For 90 days, as dockworkers will go back to work up, halting any supply chain snarls and advance of the election as they work out a deal that will work for both parties.

He said that if he were them, he would look at different alternatives.But also issuing that warning, Jake, that you mentioned in the introduction to President Trump about the peaceful transfer of power. You know, often when -- when members of the administration field questions about the election from that podium, they deflect and cite the hatch act and are unwilling to engage in those lines of questioning.
