They even created a campus in Brooklyn in order to take Jewish money of smart kids would otherwise get into Columbia and they educated the mayor in this kind of warehouse. And then it became the symbol of Jewish success, where when I went to Columbia about a third of the class was Jewish.And then now there was this place of kind acceptance of Jewish triumph in America. And now to come full circle, to see the ways in which Jewish students don't have a basic sense of safety on campus it feels like a parable about America.",

This morning, we are standing by for opening statements in a case that could ultimately put a former president behind bars.Donald Trump is charged with falsifying business records to hide a potentially damaging story about an affair with a porn star. This something he has long denied. This morning, brand new details about the first witness the prosecution plans to call a man who once led the National Enquirer and as the New York Times put it bought and buried stories that could be damaging to Donald Trump.

They expect it to start pretty quickly once the jurors have assembled for the day. And what they will be doing is previewing the contours of the case on both sides. So, the prosecutors are going to give the jurors and the public a glimpse into all the evidence that they have collected against Donald Trump and want to present against him over the course of the coming days. That's what their opening statement will be. And then the defense team, Todd Blanche, Donald's Trump's chief attorney, is going to be giving his opening statement. We do expect that to largely be about witness credibility, trying to cut into what the prosecutors are going be putting on the stand. The first witness, that will David Pecker, he's going call as a witness for the prosecution. He is the former chairman of the publishing company that was publishing the National Enquirer and is a person who has agreed to cooperate, got a deal with prosecutors, and he's stepping up at this time to speak about very likely what he knows of catch and kill schemes, these schemes in 2016 that Donald Trump and his campaign were interested in, and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, were interested in, to collect negative stories about Donald Trump, put money toward the people who had those stories, whose those stories were there is to tell and silence them. A very big thing, not just for Stormy Daniels, who is at the core of this falsification of business records case, but also for other witnesses who are like likely to be called to testify against the former president.",

She's joining us now. Alayna, what are you hearing about Donald Trump's thinking going into this week? Because you look at social media or how he talked outside of court on Friday, he seems angry, for sure.",

      "sentences": "He is angry, Kate. And I can say his public comments, his raging about this being unfair, his frustration with the gag order placed on him, all of that is also playing out behind the scenes. He very much does not want to be a criminal defendant in any trial.But this one in particular, I think, is very personal for Donald Trump. And, remember, a lot of salacious details are expected to come out of this. You're going to be hearing from people who have been very close to him in the past, people like Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer, as they referred to him. That's part of the reason, as well, that he's very angry about this gag order, because he's not able to attack witnesses. That's something that he is particularly very frustrated about. But a lot of this, as well, could be embarrassing for Donald Trump. And he does not want this on display, particularly in the lead-up to his next presidential election ahead of November. And if you think back to what this is really about, it's about alleged payments to a porn star that he allegedly had an affair with and then used hush money payments to try and cover that up during his first campaign ahead of 2016. And, again, when it comes down to it, you strip all the bluster away, you think about Donald Trump, this is not something he wants to be sitting through. Now, I also just want to point out that, as much as his advisers are saying that they think this trial could help him with fundraising, this could boost his support and donations, they really don't know particularly how this is going to play out because it is in a general election. What we saw happen during the primary, when he was indicted, is not necessarily going to be the same thing that happens in adrenaline. So, I keep that in mind. Now, I also just want to point your attention to, Kate, some of this interview we had with the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, yesterday, she was speaking with Dana Bash. She had a very interesting response about how it could be playing with some of his allies. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, the campus itself, it is still restricted access, so only students and staff. So, because of that, we saw a secondary demonstration form outside the gates. What we also have seen intensify are the concerns among some Jewish students who have expressed concern that they feel uncomfortable and, in some cases, even intimidated. I had an opportunity to speak to some of these Jewish students who told me that they are growing increasingly frustrated with Columbia, saying that the institution is not doing enough to make sure that they feel safe, particularly ahead of Passover. You mentioned that rabbi that even called on several hundred Jewish students to simply go home. Now, Columbia for its part, saying that it hears these concerns, that they are doing everything they can to make sure that these students feel safe. And also the organizers of this pro-Palestinian demonstration have also released a statement saying that they have maintained a peaceful environment and also distancing themselves from who they described as non-student protesters off campus, calling them, quote, inflammatory individuals who do not represent us. So, that's a key voice in this. And then, finally, another key voice in this, the Columbia president, out with the announcement that you mentioned a little while ago, turning to virtual learning. In a statement, President Minouche Shafik saying that she's deeply saddened by what's happening on campus on all sides of this debate and writing specifically that the decibel level of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. The president wrote that these tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas. She writes, we need a reset, Sara. So, that's going to be one thing to watch, certainly, what will Columbia University's plan of action be here, not just for the demonstrations that we've seen form off campus, but most importantly, the one that's taken place on campus. And this is really a reflection of what so many universities and colleges throughout the country are facing, grappling with the fact that they need to come up with plans to -- their demonstrations as well.",

Police say several teams punched him and took off with his car. When people found out about this, they started donating and raised more than $62,000. So, with the donations and some help from a local dealership, Ernie was able to pick up his brand new car. The dealership says it will service Ernie's car for life.
