The jury in the former president's unprecedented criminal hush money trial has now been debating his fate for more than 11 hours, 11 hours, and seven minutes, as you see there. Trump and his team were passing the time by rolling in a television to watch news coverage of the trial. Hi, Mr. President. This morning, he looked on as the court fulfilled seven requests that the jury made this morning and late yesterday. They got a refresher on their instructions from the judge and they got to rehear for specific parts of the trial, including testimony from both tabloid magnate David Pecker and former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, about a key 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. Let's begin with CNN's Paula Reid, who is outside the Manhattan courthouse. And, Paula, what do we know about the state of deliberations right now?",

But, Jake, we have heard nothing from the jury and we are nearing the end of the usual business day here at court.

Karen McDougal that 1998 playmate to the plate -- playmate of the year, who alleged that she had a 10 to 11 months relationship, romantic relationship with Donald Trump. Here is what prosecutor Steinglass said about that on Tuesday. Quote: Now with all of the evidence and documents in this case, it's easy to lose significance of the loose sight of the significance of this phone call, this call makes it impossible for the defense to claim that Cohen was acting on his own, that he was taking it upon himself to work with AMI, the tabloid, a company, to purchase the Karen McDougal story. This call proves that not only did the defendant know about it, but he actively participated. This is powerful evidence of the defendant's involvement wholly apart from Cohen. Stacy, what do you think?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's really important that the prosecution shows what Donald Trump's intent and motive was surrounding this alleged scheme or now it's been laid out to the jury as a conspiracy. Now, when you don't have a defendant testifying like Donald Trump, who did not take the stand, the jury can infer what a person since motive and intent was from other evidence, circumstantial evidence, conversations that get into the record about that Trump had with people along the course of this.Now, there are lots of conversations that Michael Cohen testified about that he had with Donald Trump but as we all know and we've been talking about for weeks and weeks Michael Cohen has credibility issues and the jury has to decide whether they believe parts of his testimony or none of his testimony. So the prosecution can't take the risk that the jury is only relying on Michael Cohen. So David Pecker is a great witness to show for the prosecution what Trump's motive and intent was because David Pecker did not have an ax to grind against Donald Trump. He referred to him as a friend on the stand. He doesn't have a motive to see Donald Trump convicted, unlike Michael Cohen who testified he wanted to see Trump behind bars and getting in this crucial phone call between Pecker and Trump about what Trump said is hugely important to what Trump's involvement was, as you just said, Jake, and whether or not Michael Cohen did this on his own to get credit from Donald Trump, from the Trump Organization or the campaign, that this was actually a conspiracy, alleged conspiracy right now that benefited Donald Trump and the campaign.",

Was it just for McDougal? Was it for the entirety of the election? Did Pecker and Cohen's testimony line up to the extent that they were in certain conversations together?

This shows that Donald Trump deputize Michael Cohen. He said to David Pecker, this is the guy you're going to be dealing with on these kind of things.

And you have his testimony, read back any part of it, all of it, his description of the meeting.He gave you a lot more detail about this meeting that Michael Cohen did it actually. During this Trump Tower meeting, they settle on three the key components of the meeting. So, and jury requests three and four are three is David Peckers version of the meeting. Four is Michael Cohen's version of the meeting. And Steinglass said, and I'll go to Stacy on this one, Steinglass said something along the lines.

Celebrities have been doing it for a long time. They buy and bury information. If you can afford it, you can bury it.The difference is in this case is that Trump was no longer just a celebrity at the time. He was now a candidate running for office. And he was therefore subject to specific laws. One of the laws that didn't get a lot of play until the very end during the jury instructions but there's a New York state election law that says when two or more people conspire to promote a candidate to office by unlawful means, that is a crime. That really is a crime that I think the prosecution did prove up in their case about why Michael Cohen had had his fees run through the Trump Organization business and ties directly back to the 34 count indictment for falsifying business records. So all of these things are -- this is such a complicated legal case because there are areas of law as to what the other crime is that was allegedly concealed in the business records. So all of these things are important and the prosecution, I think the jury, by asking for these extra instructions that we've been talking about.

And it was really upsetting, disheartening.And I mentioned that one of the jurors said, why don't we just call a hung jury now? But one of the things that's so brilliant about our system when it works is that this jury has to be unanimous, and so did we. And so despite the differences in the beginning, we had to come up with a system that was organized and systematic for going through each of the counts. So we appointed a single juror who was very common, even keeled, to run the proceedings, and we went through the counts one by one from start to finish. And if we got deadlocked as we did very frequently, we would address a different count and try to come to a consensus, and then we would go around the room and take a vote and write down the tally. And as the week went on, the tally shifted. So I think one of the things that's important understand is there's a lot of assumptions about what is going on behind closed doors and really none of us can know because even in jury selection, the attorneys think that they are going to know how a certain juror, based on their education level or their news sources is going to feel in the deliberation room.

That's about 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. That's when there's no activity in the court. There was no note afterwards. There have been radio silence from the jury, and they had expected been expecting that they were about to be home for the day and deliberations were going to resume tomorrow. And so, of course, no one knows what is happening inside that jury room, except for the jury itself. But now that there is word of a verdict, this comes as Trump himself has been sitting inside the courtroom for a few minutes. He's been chatting with his lead attorney here, Todd Blanche. They were kind of talking back and forth. Kara Scannell in the room said that they were sitting so close their shoulders were almost touching. But really, they just been hanging out inside of this room across the hall from the courtroom where Trump is built to have this verdict read to him from this jury. They were eating pizza earlier. They were watching TV and just kind of waiting to see what this jury was going to decide, Jake. So, obviously, this is a remarkable moment. You heard Elie there saying it's clearly not a hung jury since they do have a verdict here. The Trump team had been hoping that there would be a hung jury in this case. It seemed unlikely since the likelihood of those is not very high when you look at the percentages of how many hung juries there have been in the past. But now, they are waiting to find out what this is going to look like. Obviously, they'd been planning on the political side for the outcome of this verdict, whether it is going to be a guilty or not guilty verdict, and how that's going to influence Trump on what he just mentioned when he was going inside the courtroom there, Jake, and he was saying, I want to campaign, as Trump was walking in there. And so quite a remarkable moment as they are waiting along with the rest of us to see what this verdict is going to be. And I should note, Trump has been attending this trial every single day is required for him to be here. It's also required for him to be at the courthouse for this very reason that we are experiencing right now, which is that the verdict does have a jury. I should note, Eric Trump is sitting in the courtroom behind his father. He is the only member of the Trump family that we have seen in court with Donald Trump today. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum was also here earlier. It's not even clear if he's still here. Other members of Trump's defense team. Stacy Schneider is also joining us. And, Stacy, I mean, obviously, we're just kidding this breaking news that the jury does in fact, having verdict. We've got about 30 minutes or so while we were waiting for them to fill out this form. So what is this process look like now that the jury has reached this verdict as they're filling out these forms where I know obviously, as we heard in the jury instructions, they'll come into the room. The jury foreman -- foreperson, juror number one, what will be the one who got to verbalize is this, but the judge will go through the list and ask each juror to confirm, yes, this is your verdict, whether it's guilty or not guilty.",

There is a verdict in his case. We are standing by for the jurors to bring their decision in his hush money cover-up trial. They will reveal their verdict just minutes from now. Mr. Trump is there in the courtroom. He is the only former U.S. president to ever face criminal prosecution, and he is now waiting to learn if he has been cleared or if he has been convicted. If you're just joining us, I'm Jake Tapper in Washington with CNN special live coverage of this incredibly consequential day in the history of these United States. After more than 11 hours of deliberations, over two days, a dozen New Yorkers have decided the fate of the former president and the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee in the criminal case against him from the district attorney of Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, the judge has summoned everyone to the courtroom. And soon the judge will ask the foreman of the jury to confirm that the jury has reached a unanimous decision. Then the verdict on each of the 34 criminal charges against Mr. Trump will be read allowed in court, one at a time, again, 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records, each one pertaining to an individual check or an invoice, or a voucher. All of the charges in service of an alleged cover-up of money paid to former Trump fixer, Michael Cohen in connection with the purported Stormy Daniels hush money conspiracy. That's what's being alleged. We have reporters in the courthouse. We will be bringing you the jury's decision on each of the 34 counts as close to real real-time as possible. And let us begin with Dana Bash. Dana, huge moment. And as Elie Honig points out, it is less than 12 hours and the only thing we know right now is that it's not a hung jury. It could be a mixed verdict. It could be an acquittal. It could be a conviction on all 34 counts. But Donald Trump's defense team was hoping for a hung jury. They were hoping for one juror to at the very least as a strategy to refuse to convict. And they did not get that. Now that doesn't mean they didn't get an acquittal. We don't know.
