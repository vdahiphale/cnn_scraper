This is the medical building where the man came with his mother to get some help and medical attention. It's up there on the 11th floor where the shooting happened. And, of course, people here in the midtown area have been shocked by this, that shooting happening in the waiting room. Now, I have learned just in the last ten minutes or so that the family was upset because they believe the man was having a terrible time getting help from the V.A. He used to be a Coast Guard member. He served apparently for four years, and at some point, went to the V.A. for some help. When he went to the V.A., they gave him apparently a medication that he did not like and was coming here to get some new medication and maybe get some help from the doctors here. And at some point, he became agitated and that's when the shooting started. The Atlanta police chief gave us an update on this situation about an hour ago. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We actually talked to a man who was briefly detained because they thought he was the shooter.The reason why I bring him up is he actually shot some of the video we're about to show you. This is video from inside the hospital at the facility just after the shooting. He shot this video as an Atlanta Police officer, was telling the shots, people on the inside what was going on and why they were going to have to shelter in place. That shelter in place happened for several hours in this downtown midtown area. In fact, they just really opened the roadway back up here for traffic to flow through. All this going on and while they shut the perimeter down, there was a carjacking. That car has been located in Cobb County. And, Wolf, I can also tell you, I just learned from my sources, they found that canvas bag on the inside of the car. At some point, they're going to process that. Now, they're starting to put up a perimeter near Braves Stadium and Truist Park out in Cobb County, but they don't believe, and they're getting several 911 calls from that area, just about what's going on out there.

I think that's the patient Dr. Jansen talked about earlier, who is probably the most severely wounded. Another person shot in the arm also requiring an operation. And then another patient was shot in the face, Wolf, and this is the patient who developed significant bleeding. And some of the blood vessels around the face required a procedure that's called an interventional radiology procedure, just putting little catheters into the blood vessels to try and stop that bleeding. So, as Dr. Jansen said, all critically injured, but that basically means that they require medications to maintain their blood pressure and they're going to obviously be in the intensive care unit. I can also tell you, just as a trauma surgeon myself, it's a long road still.

I would suggest that it's probably some independent organization, as described in the previous report, could be partisans. Clearly, there is an element within Russia that does not agree with what Putin is trying to achieve and has been a part of this journey over the course of the last 18 months where it's gone sideways multiple times. So, you could see that the element of control is starting to be -- you know, those controls are starting to be released somewhat by internal organizations, and this may be exactly what we're seeing. I tend to believe that it was not the Ukrainians because they would not have been able to transit the excess of 300 miles from the border of Ukraine and hover over the Kremlin, that would speak horribly toward the Russian air defense.

That said, I'm not sure I agree that the Ukrainians don't have the ability to do this. [18They have long-range drones. There have been drones within tens of miles off of the Kremlin. I would say, though, the whole idea of the assassination, that's really poppycock. I can't imagine that that is at all in the realm of possibility. It's not like a drone carries a bunker buster.

And if they are, and this is still a theory, it could be an excuse by the Kremlin to have a purge.

Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, what information are you getting from a police and local officials where you are down in Georgia on the search for this gunman in the ongoing risks to the community? REP. LUCY MCBATH (D-GA):  Well, Wolf, what we do understand and know is that the shooter actually stole a car. He left the scene, of course. We still believe that he's armed. He may be within the Cobb County area. We don't know where he is at this point. But that is -- police are definitely searching for him within the Cobb area, and, you know, a lot of people are on pins and needles. A lot of people are very, very nervous. But I keep thinking over and over again about the families -- you know, the families that have lost a loved one, of course, the other individuals, the four other victims, that are now fighting for their lives in the hospital.",
