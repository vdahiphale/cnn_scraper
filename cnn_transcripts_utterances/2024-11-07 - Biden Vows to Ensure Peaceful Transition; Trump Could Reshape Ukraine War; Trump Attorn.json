JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": It would make them uneasy because it is interference and we know and we've seen it over the past few weeks that your Central Bank needs to be independent. It has to make tough decisions to hike rates at painful moments when prices are high in order to bring them down. Independence is key. I think it is good news that Jay Powell believes that he can't be interfered with, that he is adamant on that and was so concise about it. The irony here, of course, Richard, is that they are aligned. The former president, president-elect wants to see interest rates come down. Right now, the Federal Reserve also wants to bring interest rates down. And really, the only or the biggest issue and unknown for now is whether or not the president-elect's own policies be they mass immigration limits, mass and global tariffs will raise prices and end up forcing the Federal Reserve to slow down on those rate cuts.

There is, you know, the headwind of all those interest rates that have interest rate increases have come in the past seeing a little bit of slowing in the labor market. But I think probably given, well, we will what the outcome of the election is for whether the House and the Senate also go to the Republicans. But if they all go to the Republicans, I think there is likely to be a lot of deregulatory activity a lot of stimulus of investment through that.

It will also be the first year to exceed the 1.5 Celsius warming threshold. The alarming report comes from the Copernicus Climate Change Service ahead of next week's U.N. climate conference. Rescue and recovery operations are now underway in Cuba in the wake of Hurricane Rafael. The category three storm slammed into the island on Wednesday. It caused a total blackout. Power has since been restored in some areas. Prosecutors in -- I beg your pardon. Rudy Giuliani has until next week to turn over his valuables as part of a defamation judgment. The former Trump attorney owes around $150 million to two Georgia election workers. He must give them his sports cars, his two dozen watches and sports memorabilia. A judge has threatened Giuliani with contempt if he fails to meet this deadline. President Biden addressed the nation earlier for the first time since Trump's victory. The current president says the election was fair and vowed to ensure a peaceful transition of power.

The Ukrainians have not been able to push the Russians out of the country. The front is essentially at a standstill. In fact, the Russians are making some gains in the eastern part of Ukraine.
