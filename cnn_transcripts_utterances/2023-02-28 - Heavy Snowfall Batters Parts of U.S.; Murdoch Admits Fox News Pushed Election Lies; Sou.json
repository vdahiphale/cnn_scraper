Nearly 50 million people are under winter weather alerts across the northeast. New York's governor says parts of the state could see up to a foot of snow. Schools in Connecticut and Rhode Island have already canceled classes for today.In the west, a state of emergency was declared on Monday in San Bernardino County in California after several feet of snow over the weekend left some residents trapped. People there are also running out of gas, baby formula, and other vital supplies as they face road closures. Meanwhile, cleanup efforts will be a major undertaking in Oklahoma where several tornadoes ripped through parts of the state on Sunday. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more now from Norman, Oklahoma. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It has been a day of cleanup here in the central Oklahoma town of Norman, Oklahoma where an EF2 tornado, according to the National Weather Service, ripped through here Sunday night. The damage is extensive in the areas that were hit. The good news throughout all of this is that the storm -- the storm -- the worst of the storm and the tornadoes that did touch down caused damage in very isolated areas. Outside of these areas, we are not seeing extensive damage. And that is staggering considering the wind levels and the wind speeds that we were seeing as this line of storms blew through the state on Sunday night. In the Texas panhandle town of Memphis, Texas, the wind gusts were well over 100 miles per hour, staggering numbers, the kind of wind speeds we normally see in a hurricane, not in an area of a storm where there is no tornado involved. But this scene here is a tornado. You can see a giant piece of plywood that was ripped off of a home somewhere near here ended up lodged into that tree. We've seen that play out in several places. Several homes shifting under -- shifted on the foundation and knocked over. And we spoke with one woman who is a high school math teacher, who described being inside her home by herself, in an interior bathroom, and described what it was like when the house started shaking as the tornado blew through.",

Certainly, Pete Buttigieg had been there sooner that he was. So, the Republicans are going to dine out on this. East Palestine is on the Pennsylvania border. That's a very important voting area, Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. And I think if the Biden administration had an opportunity, again, they would've done everything they did.

Well, Prigozhin says the issue has been resolved. He took another swipe at the defense ministry. A big number of former soldiers who are now part of Wagner came here because they were looking for more creative freedom, since everyone understands the army doesn't always enable that.

We don't hear very much from the Russian side about troop losses, but there is a new analysis out from the Center for Strategic and International Studies which has looked at satellite images, open source information, social media, sources on the ground, they have been speaking to things like that to compile this analysis, and their conclusion is that Russia has suffered more combat deaths in the first year of this war than all of its war since World War II combined.They estimate that the monthly death rate is some 25 times higher than it was in Chechnya and 35 times higher than it was in Afghanistan. Now, CNN has not been able to independently verify those numbers. It is incredibly difficult to do so since they are so fraught with misinformation in this war. But it does show a sort of sense of what we've been hearing from the battlefield, that this has in a sense turned into sort of World War II-style trench warfare. Not only that, but the length of this front line, 500 to 600 miles, says the CSIS, on the both sides are sort of facing each other, burning through massive amounts of ammunition. All of this backing up what we are hearing from the ground, particularly around Bakhmut where they've been fighting for the best part of six months with no real territorial gains on either side. If anything, it is getting more intense. So, the question, of course, around morale is given that Russia is the aggressor in this war, can Putin still sell this to his people? I think it is important to note that he is and other Russian officials reframing, re-branding this war as a defensive operation where Russia is defending the people of Ukraine. Rosemary?",

Elan Ganeles, he is originally from Connecticut actually, and moved to Israel a few years ago but had been sort of back and forth, actually just recently completed his degree at Columbia University. He was driving along what's normally a rather peaceful route that actually many tourists use to reach places like the Dead Sea, to go visit Jericho.And apparently, he was essentially shot while driving. He died of his wounds. He is now the 14th Israeli that's been killed in just about a month. This has been a very violent three days, and of course, we've had more than 60 Palestinian killed since the beginning of the year. His death comes after that night, on Sunday night where we saw Israeli settlers essentially rampaging through Palestinian towns, setting fires to homes and houses, one Palestinian man killed. Those are being called both revenge attacks, but also acts of terror by the Israeli military, which is rather unusual I think for the Israeli military to essentially be in agreement with what many Palestinian officials have also called terrorist acts by Israeli settlers. Those were essentially called revenge attacks for what happened earlier on Sunday where two Israeli brothers were also killed in a shooting attack while they were driving near, and of course, the attack yesterday. These two Israeli brothers, 19 and 21 years old, killed along a route that passes through Palestinian towns in the West Bank that's often a flash point.

Tensions and violence between Israelis and Palestinians at a 20-year high. On Sunday, the occupied West Bank burned two Israeli brothers shot point blank, killed while sitting in traffic and what officials say was a terrorist attack. Then in what's been deemed revenge attacks by Israeli settlers, a Palestinian man shot and killed, houses and cars burned, just hours after Israeli and Palestinian officials met in the summit in Jordan, meant to calm tensions.
