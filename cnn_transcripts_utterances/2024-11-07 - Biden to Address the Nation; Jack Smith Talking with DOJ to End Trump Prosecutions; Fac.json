We will bring that to you live.In the meantime, the doubt is up just slightly after Trump's election victory. This comes after the stock market closed at record highs yesterday. CNN's Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, what do you make of these market reactions that we're seeing so far? I mean, yesterday, obviously, it took off like a rocket, but the market's trying to figure things out this morning. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim markets are starting today pretty quietly, maybe a bit of a hangover after that big celebration on Wall Street yesterday. We saw the Dow spike 1,500 points yesterday, about 3.5 percent, biggest one day percentage increase in two years.Now, those gains were driven by relief, right? Investors are relieved that someone has emerged as the clear-cut winner here. Weeks of recounts and fights in court would've added so much uncertainty. So, clarity is good for investors. There's also some excitement about the Trump agenda, in particular, tax cuts. Those will boost corporate profits. Deregulation. That's why we saw big bank stocks and crypto basically go to the moon yesterday. For now, investors are kind of shrugging off the potentially inflationary elements of the Trump agenda, namely tariffs. Those are taxes on U.S. imports, those would raise costs for companies. And for consumers and mass deportations, right? There's a risk that if you try to deport millions of undocumented workers, that could deprive some industries of workers and lift wages and prices. But for now, investors are pretty focused on the positives here, Jim.",

I mean, it is interesting that this is going to take place when you said inflation may be back on the rise again. I suppose the Fed may have to revisit all of this depending on how things go. But how will this impact everybody?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, not much drama about what the Fed is going to do today. It looks like a slam dunk that the Fed is going to cut interest rates for the second meeting in a row. The market's pricing in about a 98 percent chance of a quarter point cut today. That comes after that half a point cut back in September.Now, this should help borrowers because interest rates are still pretty high, right? We're still close to multi-decade highs. You can see starting to come down just a bit. So, every cut should help everyone who was trying to pay off credit card debt, trying to finance the purchase of a car. Those who have home equity lines of credit would be helped as well. But what's interesting is the Fed has less control over longer-term rates, and those rates are what influence mortgages. And we've actually seen treasury rates spike in recent weeks. Part of that has been driven by optimism about the economy, but part of it has also been driven by concern about how a Trump administration could add trillions of dollars to the deficit and to the national debt. And you can see the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has actually moved significantly higher since the Feds started cutting rates. So, Jim, the big question today for Jerome Powell is going to be how does he think about tariffs and the potentially inflationary aspects of the Trump administration?",

That's a year or two down the line.But I guess there's a good question you raise, I hadn't really thought about, what happens on January 20, 2029, when Donald Trump isn't finished with his second term, if he's sentenced to prison, then I think you get into a question of, is it actually going to be enforced on and I don't know, he'll be 82 years old at that point?

Congress may be changing hands, but the Supreme Court is at stake as well. We currently have a six to three Supreme Court, all six Republican nominees, conservatives, three of them already Trump nominees from the first term and three liberals.A couple things could happen. First of all, we've seen a trend of certain justices timing their retirement so that they can be replaced by likeminded conservatives or Republicans who were much younger. We saw Justice Breyer retire and be replaced by Justice Jackson, who's way younger. We saw Justice Kennedy retire. He was replaced by Justice Kavanaugh, who was 20, 25 years younger. So, the two oldest justices right now are Justices Thomas and Alito. They're 76 and 74 years old. We could see one or both of them retire, replaced by a Republican. 48, 52-year-old conservative. And if someone should die, we hope not, then it may remain a six-three court or it could even become a seven to two Supreme Court. So, I think Trump's second term is going to further cement the conservative majority, probably for quite a long time.",

And that -- speeding that up and getting a vaccine to people in the midst of this pandemic was one of the key huge triumphs of the previous Trump administration.Typically, this is a process that takes place over years. So, animal studies are done before a prospective vaccine could even get into human clinical trials. Those take thousands of patients and lots of years to complete. Once you get through phase three, the company submit those data to the FDA for review. And often that goes to an outside advisory group where we see these all-day public hearings where the data are all posted online, hundreds of pages, both from the manufacturers and from the FDA, which reviews the data, posts its own review. And you can see often the regulators might disagree with how the drug companies have presented some of the information or interpreted it. They make a recommendation. If the FDA then approves the vaccine, it then goes to an outside panel of advisers to the CDC. We've seen this as well. These are public hearings. Also, those slides and data are posted online. Everybody can follow along. They make a recommendation for a vaccine to be added to a schedule. Who should get it? How frequently? The CDC director then can decide whether to accept that recommendation. And even then, vaccines are continuously monitored in the real world for how safe and effective they are, both by mechanisms through the CDC and the FDA. So, Jim, what I'm hearing from people in the public health world isn't necessarily that they're worried RFK Jr. is going to come in and uncover some data that are problematic or dismantle entire agencies. Really what they're worried about is that he'll continue to sort of try to chip away at confidence in vaccines, and we are already starting to see declining rates of vaccination. For example, the MMR vaccine, that's the measles mumps rubella vaccine. Vaccination rates among kindergartners have been declining since before the pandemic. Now, they're at about 92.7 percent nationally. CDC wants to maintain an above 95 percent to obtain herd immunity. That's when folks can protect people by getting vaccinated themselves. We are starting to see more outbreaks of measles. And there's a concern, we're going to see measles come back more and things like polio. So, that's the real concern that there could be this kind of chipping away in vaccines, which over decades have been a pillar of public health.",

You know, we've seen when a fluoride has been removed from certain municipalities drinking water systems, there has been an increase in tooth decay and problems in those communities. You know, of course, at higher levels, we have been seeing data that there could be some safety concerns. So, public health experts say this is an incredibly important contribution to public health, but obviously too much is not good.",

I want to bring in my friend and colleague Pamela Brown to talk about all of this.Pam, you and I covered the first Trump administration. Obviously, we're in for quite a ride here in the coming months. When Donald Trump's comes into office and his team comes into office, they are certainly making it very clear that they're going to be bringing some very big changes to this country.",

And what I'm hearing from them is that there are some lessons learned from Trump's point of view from -- when he was in office the first time. One of them was he didn't like who he picked for attorney general. So, now a key metric in terms of that role is loyalty. That's something that they're really looking at for the attorney general role and other roles within a second Trump administration.So, of course, we're going to be tracking this closely. And it's going to look different from what we saw the first time around, Jim. I know some people might think, well, he's been in office before. We kind of know what to expect, but this will be different undoubtedly. And I know we're going to be covering it every step of the way.",
