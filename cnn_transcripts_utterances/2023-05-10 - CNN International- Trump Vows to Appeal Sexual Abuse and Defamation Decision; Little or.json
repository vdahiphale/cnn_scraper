I was in the court Tuesday morning and it took about 90 minutes for the judge to give the jury instructions on how to make this decision. And it took just a little bit longer than that for them to actually make this decision.And while I was in court throughout this trial, it was clear to me this jury was being very attentive not only to E. Jean Carroll but also other witnesses. And it's clear from this decision that they believe not only E. Jean Carroll, but they also believed her friends who heard her describe this encounter shortly after it occurred and also women who allege other similar behavior. They also, of course, heard from the former president in his own words in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape describe grabbing people and then doubling down on that in his deposition. Now we may never know exactly what the jury thought of specific pieces of evidence because they have been anonymous throughout this trial. And the judge has encouraged them to remain anonymous even though they do have a right to speak out. Now the former president's lawyers are trying to spin this as a victory for their client because the jury did not find that he raped E. Jean. But they did find that he sexually abused her, that is still under the law a form of sexual assault, a form of battery. So, if you have a day where your client has been found to sexually abuse someone and defamed them and may be on the hook for around $5 million in damages, it is hard to honestly spin that as a victory.

A Republican who's has been under scrutiny for a stunning number of lies and fabrications during his runs for office. Santos is expected to appear in federal court in New York where the charges have been filed under seal. Now we don't know yet the exact nature of the charges but the FBI and the Justice Department's public integrity prosecutors in New York and in Washington have been examining allegations of false statements in Santos' campaign finance filings, among other claims. The Congressman took office only in January and has faced calls from fellow Republicans to resign over allegations ranging from criminal behavior on the campaign trail, to petty personal dishonesty stretching back more than a decade. Large chunks of his official biography are believed to be false. Including his claims to have worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, claims that he has Jewish heritage have turned out to be not true. He allegedly stole money from a clarity set up to help a military veteran's dog. He even falsely claimed that he was a producer on a Spiderman Broadway flop. It is not a crime to lie to voters about your resume. Instead, federal prosecutors have honed in on allegations that Santos lied on federal election filings that are intended to document campaign expenditures and fundraising. We're expecting to see Santos appear before a judge in the coming hours. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Everyone that we've spoken to from Khan's legal have told us that they have had no access to their client after he was apprehended yesterday at Islamabad high court by paramilitary troops. There is a sense of unease. Protests have eased out a bit, but there are roadblocks across major cities in the country. We do know that the secretary-general of Imran Khan's party, Asad Umar, has only just been arrested at Islamabad high court. When he was accompanying the legal team that had gone into get that petition filed to dismiss the fact that this special hearing is happening inside a police compound and not at the judicial complex.

Here is what happened. Take a look at this video. There was a federal enforcement action very early this morning. Our cameras were rolling when all of this was unfolding. Federal agents in the dark were handing migrants -- who were sleeping on the streets -- flyers. Those flyers encouraging them to turn themselves into immigration authorities.Now at first there was confusion because migrants didn't know what was going on. And then the fear sank in once they realized they had to make a critical decision. A few hours later we started seeing migrants line up at a processing center that's a few minutes walk away. And we saw that line grow by the hundreds. A few hours later, a second enforcement action. This time officers, agents, federal agents with flak jackets telling people verbally that they should turn themselves into immigration authorities. Now if you take a look around me, there's a mix of people, some of them have completely left. And if you look at these blankets, these are the blankets that lot of the migrants were using to protect themselves from the sun. Well, the blankets are here. But if you look under there, the migrants are gone. A lot of them have turned themselves into immigration authorities. But out here there is a mix. I've talked to multiple migrants. Some of them say that they turned themselves into immigration authorities and they were released. And so, they're back in the camp and they're waiting for a bus or they're waiting for a plane ticket so that they go meet their families somewhere in the United States. Now all of this is happening as the end of Title 42 looms on May 11 at 11:59 p.m. Now about what's going on the northern border and the flow that we're expecting as Title 42 -- the end of Title 42 approaches. According to a source, the federal government estimates that there are more than 150,000 migrants in northern Mexican cities waiting to turn themselves into immigration authorities or waiting to cross into the United States. Now that's important because the detention facilities, the holding facilities, are already Maxed out at capacity. And so, that's what the administration is grappling with and no one really knows what will happen once Title 42 ends. Rosa Flores, CNN, El Paso. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
