President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia used 36 drones but none of them reach their target. The Ukrainian Air Forces, Russia was aiming at critical infrastructure and military targets in the western part of the country.Russia is now denying reports of a fire at the Ministry of Defense building in central Moscow that according to state media, who first reported that emergency services were at the scene after a blaze broke out on a balcony. Now, local officials say no fire has been detected but video from Moscow shows you see there, smoke surrounding the building. And a woman could be heard complaining about a horrible burning smell. Now, this is coming as U.S. intelligence now suggest Ukrainians may have launched the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Sources say U.S. officials picked up chatter among Ukrainian officials blaming each other for the attack, that contributed to the assessment that a Ukrainian group may be responsible though the U.S. has not been able to reach a definitive conclusion. But they believe it is unlikely that senior Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy actually knew about the attack. Meantime, the notorious leader of Russia's Wagner mercenaries is pitching a new nickname for himself. Yevgeny Prigozhin has been known as Putin's chef, but he says another name would be more fitting, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER GROUP (through translator): I never was a chef, and I have no idea how to cook. So, we need to get away from that. The nickname Putin's chef could mean anything. I'd be more accurate to call me Putin's butcher. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The chief of Russia's private army Wagner saying his fighters are exhausted and will withdraw. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We will be leaving Bakhmut, and the Russian Defense Ministry will be responsible for it. We're leaving for field camps to train and rest. Prigozhin claims to control all of Bakhmut, which the Ukrainians dispute. He also acknowledges losing around 20,000 fighters in the brutal months long campaign. Even as the U.S. and Ukraine say the figures are much higher, possibly up to a 100,000. Despite the alleged victory and Bakhmut, in a bold comment Prigozhin says, Vladimir Putin is war is not achieving its core objective of weakening Ukraine. How did we demilitarize it? It's now, it turns out that we on the contrary, have militarized Ukraine. I think that Ukrainians today are one of the strongest armies. Prigozhin has long been attacking Russia's elites accusing them of being corrupt, lazy and not involved in the war. Now, he fears continuing losses on the battlefield could lead to a revolution in Russia. All of this can end like in 1917 with a revolution when first the soldiers rise up, and after that their loved ones rise up. All this as the war is increasingly affecting Russia's home. Russia's Defense Ministry today releasing video of what it says was a failed attack on a Russian warship using unmanned speedboats. Ukraine has not commented on the incident. And after the brazen cross Border arrayed, by anti- Putin Russian fighters, which Ukraine says it was not involved in, but Russia blames on Kyiv vowing revenge. SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We will continue to respond to such actions by Ukrainian militants promptly and extremely harshly. PLEITGEN (voiceover): But Prigozhin says the attack shows the Russian military is incapable of protecting the country's border. Sabotage and reconnaissance forces calmly into Russia and march uploading videos driving their tanks, armored infantry vehicles. Where's the safeguard that they will not enter Moscow? (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): Now, of course, there has been an ongoing feud between Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. And once again, Prigozhin criticized Shoigu very heavily, even calling for him to be replaced. But in the case of this cross-border raid that happened in the Belgorod region. There are a lot of Russians who are asking, why the Russian military wasn't able to prevent it and why it took them so long to come to terms of the situation? Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. NEWTON: The man accused of crashing a truck into security barriers near the White House appeared in court Wednesday. Prosecutors argued to keep 19-year-old Sai Kandula in custody on charges that could carry up to 10 years in prison. CNN's Brian Todd has more now from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Prosecutors say the driver of this 26-foot U-Haul truck poses a flight risk and should remain behind bars. A federal judge agrees, ruling that Sai Varshith Kandula, age 19, who allegedly crashed this truck into a security barrier at the park across from the White House will remain in custody for now. Kandula currently faces one charge of depredation of federal government property, with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
