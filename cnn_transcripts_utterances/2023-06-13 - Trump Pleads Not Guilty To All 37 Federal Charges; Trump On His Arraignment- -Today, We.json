I'm joined now by New York Democratic congresswoman, and House Oversight Committee member, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Thanks so much for being here. First of all, I just want to -- the Little Havana stop, that cafe, Versailles cafe, one of the reasons we're told by his folks, why he was there, is because the Cuban-American people know from political persecution. And I wondered how you might interpret that and what you think of that? REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Well, I think it's -- it makes -- it's not a surprise, during Trump's remarks, he was trying to somehow pin this, as some great Marxist conspiracy. But the fact of the matter remains that this is an individual, who retained U.S. national security secrets, nuclear weapons' locations, or, nuclear site locations, sensitive materials, and put our nation at risk. And frankly, this is beyond just the Cuban community. The Latino community writ large in the United States, also has a profound sense of patriotism, and understands right from wrong, and from understanding political persecution, knowing that this is not it.",

OCASIO-CORTEZ: I mean, beyond it just being sad, what this also represents is a very significant erosion, in our systems, our institutions. What Donald Trump is outlined, as doing here, is really defiling the position, of the presidency, in taking in all of these materials, highly sensitive, imperiling the lives, of servicemembers, of people, of sensitive sites, of sources, methods, et cetera, for what really just seems like personal use, and potentially personal gain. And the motive here is something that is left to those that will be exploring this. But frankly, what this represents is a very severe compromising, of our systems, and our national security.

We just saw that they experienced much lower gains than they thought they would, last year, in the 2022 midterm elections. We are also seeing the ramifications of an extreme Supreme Court that has several members that were appointed by President Trump. And additionally, with the erosion of the legitimacy, of the court, with the conduct of Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and others, the Republican Party is very much at a crossroads, right now. And they are going to have to decide if they are going to choose a cult of personality, or this country. And that is what cuts at the core of this case. And I believe the American people are also going to have to decide if this is something that we are going to accept. And, right now, what is very dangerous is that Donald Trump is going to have this case going before a judge that was appointed, during his administration.

That is just part of the many attacks that you've seen from Trump, on Jack Smith. And I think that is part of why based on our reporting that we've been doing, Trump is having trouble adding someone, to this legal team, because they see the pitfalls, of what happens, to those, who have represented him, in the past that he doesn't listen to their legal advice. And if you watch what his speech is happening, in Mar-a-Lago -- or excuse me, in Bedminster, right now, that plays a big factor, into why he has trouble actually getting attorneys, to represent him, in the courtroom.

But he was cautioned too, and ultimately did not. He let both men continue their jobs. The U.S. Attorney, in Delaware, is still investigating Hunter Biden.

Prosecutors obviously said that he took things that were among the nation's most secretive, classified materials. That's one thing that was striking. But the other that was striking is his delivery. He made such a show, in Miami, of being seen, at the restaurant, Versailles, which is something of a landmark, in Miami, and mingling with people, and talking to people. Very low energy, tonight, very flat delivery, and spent no time, hanging out with the crowd, or sort of basking in their glow, afterwards. He turned on his heel, and walked back inside his club, at Bedminster. And so, I think these are -- this is going to be the reality going forward.

I was there for it. It was a really striking image. And it was almost as if he was giving himself a pep talk, clapping his hands together, and getting himself worked up. A bit of what we saw, similarly, in Miami, today, that is the impulse to just sort of immerse himself, in the crowd. But that's not what we saw, in this speech, tonight. Again, this was a carefully-written speech, by some of his advisers, because he's weighing out what resembled the legal argument, but which is really about the court of public opinion. But he was deflated, as he was giving it, or seemed deflated. But I do think, yes, this has real echoes.

He's writing emails about being besieged. And we know he's good at this. If you don't like Donald Trump, maybe this infuriates you. But he's very good at this.Trump is sort of the bonfire of American politics. The way he keeps his people going is by constantly throwing more wood in the fire, and keeping it blazing. He keeps them fired up, as if they're in the fight. And the theory behind that, and his own people will admit this to you, when you talk to them quietly, is that if people walk away, they might read the indictment, or they might listen to one of his rivals, who might, who again, might say, \"I have long-term questions about the FBI,\" or about two tracks of justice, or how Hillary Clinton was handled, \"But read the indictment. These are his people. These are his words caught on tape. These are his aides' texts.\" But that's how he does this. That's what's fascinating to me is that we talked about this a little bit earlier, with the conversation among his rivals, about what to do, because there's two contradictory conversations going on, among the other campaigns, right now. One is the grown-ups, saying \"We better winnow this field fast. We better winnow this field fast. We need a one-on-one or at least a two- on-one race.\" And there's 10 candidates in the race. But the other piece of it is, \"Well, if this trial is going to get delayed months and be after the early primaries, well, I need to raise just enough money, to hang around, because I'm going to have to be around, in April and May, when he finally implodes.\" I mean, how many times have Republicans had this conversation? I know. I'm not saying it's real. And I'm not saying it won't be different tomorrow. But that's the two tracks in the other campaigns, because they watch him at this. That's another attack on democracy. I mean, the last thing I'll say about this, if you thought the threat to democracy ended on January 6, that with the Biden inauguration, you are wrong.",

And she was talking about the indictment, directly, and talking about the fact that so many Republicans, according to polling, and also when you look at these prominent Republicans, who are defending the President, appear to be sticking with him. And what she said was she called it a little bit shocking that they are still sticking with him. And she said, they don't care about the indictment. Now, that is, in contrast to the President's approach here, the White House's and also notably the President's reelection campaign, which isn't (ph) starting up here, and yet they have declined to comment on this. What they've also declined to do, Kaitlan, is to fundraise off of the former President's indictment, and his arrest. Typically, you would look at this, as a potential political goldmine, for a political opponent. But instead, the President's political advisers have decided that the risks of fundraising off of this, of the potential appearance of impropriety, of fueling those Republican attacks that President Biden is carrying out some kind of politicized prosecution here, that the risks ultimately outweigh the potential benefits. And so, ultimately, they're simply relying on this split screen that we're seeing, of the former President, the chaos, that voters are being reminded of, and the current President, instead, focused, on doing his job.
