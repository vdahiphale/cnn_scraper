      "sentences": "Well, Erica, it was a very powerful and symbolic moment we saw in St. Peter's Basilica with the opening of the Holy Door. As the Pope opened the door, pilgrims started to file in past him through the door.I've been up there recently, and it's a beautiful bronze panel door. And as people walk through, they were touching the panels. Of course, what the Holy Door represents is God's forgiveness and mercy. And according to Catholic tradition, those who walk through the door and have carried out certain spiritual, charitable acts receive an indulgence which relates to the forgiveness of sins. And, of course, the Basilica is expecting millions of people to process through the door during the Jubilee year, which is going to be a year focused on forgiveness and reconciliation. The Pope wants it to be a sign of hope for a troubled world.",

But for the first time, the Pope will be opening a holy door in Rebibbia Prison, on the outskirts of Rome.Now, the Pope wants the Jubilee year to see acts of forgiveness or pardon, or amnesty by government to prisoners. And so, I think this decision by the Pope to go to the prison sends a signal, sends a message to the world that he wants to see mercy shown to prisoners. And, of course, on the 8th of December, the Pope made an appeal for the commutation or the changing of sentences for those on federal death row in the US. And, of course, yesterday, President Biden, who is a Catholic, commuted the majority of the sentences of those facing death on death row. Danny.",

It's something he does on a regular basis, but he called them to wish them the very best for Christmas and his Christmas greetings to them.The Pope has been quite outspoken about what's been going on in Gaza. He recently said that the airstrikes that had taken place were acts of cruelty and not war. He's been quite outspoken recently, also calling for allegations of genocide to be investigated. So it'll be worth watching what the Pope says tomorrow during his traditional Christmas address, which he gives midday Rome time in St. Peter's where he is likely to address some of the big questions of conflicts going on in the world today.

Not a bad day at the office, busy guy. Today marks a historic first in space travel. The Parker Solar Probe passed the closest to human made object has ever come to the sun, moving at a mind bending 430,000 miles per hour. So that means it could reach from Tokyo to Washington DC in under a minute, according to NASA. The uncrewed spacecraft is also expected to give us some really dramatic new insights. Just what are those insights? We're going to ask the guy who knows. CNN's aviation analyst and science correspondent for PBS NewsHour, Miles O'Brien, who I adore for many reasons, but one of them being today that you make things that are little complicated understandable. So the first question I have for you, Miles, is -- MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: May I interrupt you there, Erica. You put the pressure on me.",

How were they able to do this? Because the proximity is really key here. O'BRIEN: Yes. It's an amazing craft and it's done well so far. You know, it's launched in 2018. This approach, the closest one, is the 18th pass that comes within 4 million miles of the sun, which is close. The temperature on the outside has to be able to withstand upwards of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. And then on the instrument side maintain no more than about 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It's made of thick carbon material. It's actually the same material that was used on the leading edge of the space shuttles for its atmospheric reentry. And then, it has a ceramic surface on top of that. It's a marvel of engineering that it survived and is able to do what it's been doing.",

And if you're an astronaut in space, you want to know when one of these things are coming so you can take shelter. So there's a lot of good reason to be able to predict this better, but because scientists don't really understand why things heat up as they get farther away, it's difficult to make those kinds of predictions. Parker may help us get to a point where we can make a better prediction about when these things might occur.",

For one thing, Parker has discovered there are these strange switchbacks in the magnetic field of the sun. They'll go one way briefly and then switch around. Why, that is not certain. Parker is also the first spacecraft to have actually direct sensing of particles in the corona. That information is going to help piece it together, but it's going to take a while for scientists to pull it all together and really come to any sort of conclusion. Maybe they'll find a clue in there somewhere which could give them some way of predicting these solar flares or coronal mass ejections so that we could harden our systems or turn off things, or protect astronauts in the future.",

Do you have any concerns about Santa sort of being up that high in space, in the atmosphere? O'BRIEN: I just watched \"Red One\" last night. I think Santa is gonna be just fine. You gotta see that movie. It's great. Santa could do this, and it's going to be all right. I'm sure he's got all the life support he needs.
