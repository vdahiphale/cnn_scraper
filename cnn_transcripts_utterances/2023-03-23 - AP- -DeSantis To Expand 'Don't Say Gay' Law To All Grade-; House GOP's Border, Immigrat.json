They end April or May. We expect that announcement would come after that in the Florida legislature.You see this here. This is from the Associated Press. DeSantis trying to expand what is called the Don't Say Gay law in Florida. \"The rule change would ban lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity from grades 4 through 12. The initial that DeSantis championed last spring ban those lessons in kindergarten through the third grade.\" So this is about, you know, there are a lot of people who wonder, are you going so far right, that you can't sell yourself in a general election? But it is very clear he wants to use this legislative session to essentially say to Trump voters, I will give you everything you get from Donald Trump, but I actually deliver. I get things done. No drama. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes. The legislative session is essentially his platform for running for president essentially. He's run on these cultural issues. But one thing that's really interesting that you're finding now is that for the first time, Ron DeSantis is being challenged. He has been almost in a bunker in Florida. You know, he didn't get many real challenger in his reelection. And so now he is having to really fight back against a fellow Republican and someone who is so good at it, Donald Trump. And he hasn't even -- Ron DeSantis has not even entered the race yet, and he's already feeling a lot of pressure from the master tactician of Donald Trump being able to attack his opponents effectively.",

Jeff Roe, who worked for Ted Cruz back in 2016, helped Glenn Youngkin get elected governor of Virginia, is now joining this Super PAC, that's being set up to help Ron DeSantis. That's proof to me, to your point, that they understand they need seasoned professionals around to use the Super PAC to rebut some of these arguments. It's also part of a very clear DeSantis effort to say this should be a two man race. If you're not for Trump, if you're a Republican and you're not for Trump, and you're worried, the more candidates, the more it helps Trump, look at me, you know, I can raise money in Florida. We got the Super PAC operation put together. Stick with me if you don't want Trump. Don't let the field get too big.",

I've proven I can win.Whereas Donald Trump has lost repeatedly. He was responsible losing Republican House Senate. You're going to hear that a lot.

The Judiciary Committee was planning to act soon on as many as eight different bills dealing with border security and immigration issues.

You might remember that was two months ago. Our great reporters back at the table. This is hard, but they just had this policy retreat. They all went down to Orlando.

And number two, there's been a lot of push back from Hispanic lawmakers in the Republican Party, from moderates in the Republican Party who are worried about this hard line approach turning off those key voters that they're going to need to keep their majority. And so that is the debate you're seeing play out. Immigration has always been an issue that has been elusive in Washington. It's been hard. It's no easier now. And they are struggling on this issue.

But the piece of the pie that they have left available to meet those goals is shrinking and shrinking by the day. If you take off Social Security and Medicare and defense spending and border spending and a whole host of things, it's hard to meet that. And so they're in a very tough position right now.

You know, he's -- there are all these times when he has, you know, as I said, you know, kind of double signaled to his colleagues. But one case that I found intriguing when I went back to -- reconstruct what happened, remember in 2019 when the court struck down Donald Trump's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2000 census form. And Brett Kavanaugh was one of the dissenting justices who wrote a really scathing, caustic dissent about a lower court judge who had similarly rejected Donald Trump's effort. And it was very harshly critical of a district court judge up in New York. But then what I found out is that Brett Kavanaugh separately wrote a note to that judge saying, I really respect you.
