A last minute ban on beer sales puts World Cup sponsor, Budweiser, in an awkward position. After a mass employee exodus, Elon Musk calling on Twitter's remaining engineers. Live from New York, it is Friday, November 18th. I'm Rahel Solomon in for Richard Quest and I too, mean business. Good evening. The US Attorney General is appointing a Special Counsel to oversee two investigations related to former President Donald Trump. Jack Smith, a former chief prosecutor for the Special Court at The Hague will be looking into the storage of National Defense Information at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, also key aspects of the January 6 insurrection. A spokesperson for Mr. Trump has already called the move a political stunt. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that having a Special Counsel shields the investigations from politics.

Obviously, I think the investigation of the immediate prior President of the United States is a pretty extraordinary circumstance. I think that's why Merrick Garland made that appointment here. And he did so because having a Special Counsel in place means that someone who is not directly appointed by President Biden would be making that decision. So essentially, the Special Counsel is basically a prosecutor who is setting up an ad hoc office within the Justice Department that has some measure of independence, ultimately, though, is responsible to the Attorney General. The Attorney General can overturn the Special Counsel's decisions. But if he does, so, then he needs to make a report to Congress, which offers some transparency.",

So you know, in other words, let's just say a Special Counsel wasn't appointed. Merrick Garland was appointed by President Biden, whatever decision he made on his own would be considered by some, argue that he was doing that because he was beholden to President Biden or he was a Democrat or something along those lines. The people who are underneath who are reporting directly to Attorney General Garland also were appointed by President Biden. So this sort of takes us out of the realm of Biden appointees, it means that somebody who essentially is a career prosecutor who is appointed by Attorney General garland, precisely because he is viewed as nonpolitical, viewed as a career prosecutor will make that that first top line decision and unless Mr. Garland wants to overrule the Special Counsel, ultimately that that person will be making the call.",

I think that case is very straightforward. It's just -- it is difficult given that the Justice Department asked for the documents back and served a grand jury subpoena, made a visit to Mar-a- Lago asking for the documents back. I think it's hard to defend that case. I think January 6th is much more difficult to prosecute, and I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Smith ultimately decides to bring a prosecution in the Mar-a-Lago charges without bringing a prosecution to January 6th or delaying decision on that until after the Mar-a-Lago prosecution plays itself out.",

Let's be clear, though, not everybody around the world drinks alcohol or believes people should be drinking alcohol, but it is the timing and the manner of this announcement that I think has caused so many eyebrows to be raised. It's really quite embarrassing for world football's governing body, FIFA, and one of their biggest most high profile sponsors in Budweiser, who have had such a longstanding relationship with this tournament. Usually, when you get inside the stadiums at a World Cup, that is FIFA territory, they set the rules. But what we have here is a World Cup, which very much since the word go has been challenging those rules. It was of course, decided in that unprecedented double bidding process alongside 2018, there was then the fact it has been moved from a summer to a winter World Cup, the first ever World Cup in the Middle East, the first ever World Cup in a Muslim country. And Qatar's view has always been very clear. We welcome everybody from all around the world, but please respect our rules and our cultures. But the timing means, as you rightly say, so many of the teams that are already here, the international media is already here. The fans are here. And despite -- you know, this is very different as a story to all the concerns about human rights issues, the treatment of migrant workers, the pressures, the difficulties of members of the LGBTQ+ community who live here. But what this does is raises more doubts, more questions in people's minds as to what is going to happen over the next five weeks.

And really since that day, people here have felt they've been fighting a losing battle. They feel they've tried to answer questions, they feel they've tried to open their arms and invite people to come and see, yes, still they are not being given the benefit of the doubt, the rub of the green in terms of things like human rights issues. Yes, there is still a very long way to go. Progress has been made, but there is a long way to go. And I have noticed a real hardening over the last 18 months, two years of coming here, Nasser Al Khater, the CEO said to me, \"We have been treated unfairly.\" Racism is a word that has been used by organizers here as to how they have been treated and they've got to the point now, the draw has taken place. Now, the teams are on the ground. They said you know what, we are going to host this World Cup. We are going to put on a show and we are going to do it in our terms. And we had perhaps one of the big indicators of that was their moving the date of the first match of this tournament from Monday the 21st to Sunday, the 20th. So they could get their big moment, their first ever match at a World Cup finals on their own, on Sunday playing against Ecuador.

So to execute the workup, they have to bring trucks from other countries, refrigerators from other countries, staff from other countries. This is a very expensive logistical operation they have been doing for the last several months. So to come up now, two days before opening, they have to stop everything, remove all the things that they have put in place for the party they were planning to be a part of, it must be really frustrating.

But really just any sort of accounting measures that would have ensured that people were dipping into the piggy bank of customers, reserves would have been a basic due diligence question. What's very odd about this is that for the longest time, venture capitalists were actually quite wary of cryptocurrencies in particular. And so you had specialized V.C. funds prop up. FTX is notable for receiving about $1.8 billion in venture funding over the last few years. From some of the biggest names who really were reticent to get involved in the space beforehand.
