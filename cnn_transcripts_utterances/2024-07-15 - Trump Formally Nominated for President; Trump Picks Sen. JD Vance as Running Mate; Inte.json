And it was that series of events in that time that led to this moment right here, where people who thought that Donald Trump was permanently politically damaged from what had happened in that time realized that he really wasn't, that he was going to be rehabilitated. You saw Kevin McCarthy go down to Florida.And over the course of the last three years, Donald Trump has been building and building and building to this point where there is virtually no dissent anymore in the Republican Party about who is the leader of the Republican Party. And you heard actually Don Jr. saying, the greatest president, Republican president in American history. Oh, forget about Ronald Reagan.

I think that's what you'll see Vance out really work in the hustings to kind of reshape. The party has been shifting, as we know, we've talked about this away from, you know, the kind of liberal northeast Republicans have now become Democrats and the Reagan Democrats have become Republicans.And I think this pick signals a further shift in that direction for working class men and women in America. You are not only welcome in this party. You are the party. And I think JD Vance's pick signals that and he's going to go out and do that. And also Vance has a foot in Silicon Valley.

Donald Trump approached this whole process like a casting director. He was watching these guys with you and others on TV to see who could bring the case. And Vance was very, very good at that. But this point that Dave's making, there is a very narrow path for Joe Biden in this race if he has a path moving forward. That is to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, places where John has been spending a lot of time. JD Vance is a true populist. He talks about the damage of that globalization has done to these areas.

I also want to say one other thing that hasn't been mentioned. It will not be the story by the end of the day. But a challenge when you have the convention is who wins the narrative. The Republicans dominate their narrative or the Democrats take things that happen here and turn them into a story. The first words at Donald Trump's convention were spoken by Michael Watley, an election denier, a Stop the Steal guy. His nomination was seconded by Mike McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, who is under state indictment for the fake elector scheme. JD Vance also played, not to the degree they did, played with the whole idea of Mike Pence should have allowed the debate about fake electors on the floor of the United States Congress.

And this is, you know, kind of pulling together and watching Mitch McConnell be booed.He is obviously an elderly man now as JD Vance, 39, in that same body, which McConnell is now retiring from leading. It's going to stay in the Senate, but he's going to give up his title as Senate majority leader, says so much from a symbolic perspective. And while I do think, of course, David is jumping ahead to 2028, we are not we are not quite there yet. It is this way. I mean, we've talked also about how Donald Trump values loyalty. He does not necessarily want to pick someone who's going to try to compete with him. But what he is doing is making a decision here that says, I am going to choose the people who are going to be at the forefront here. It is going to be me who decides those things. And he seems to be willing to take this risk here. Because this on the one hand, and we heard Donald Trump Jr. down on the floor there say, well, my dad told me, you know, he goes, I can get kind of hot. Donald Trump Jr. says it's about himself. My dad told me, you know, we got to cool it down because obviously the rhetoric is what it is. So that's what's coming from the family. JD Vance has not necessarily conducted himself that way.",

He obviously underscores this notion that, you know, our election shouldn't be free and fair and that people's votes, you know, shouldn't count and that ultimately you should get to decide if you don't like the outcome, if you didn't like it. So, you know, I think what Democrats are going to do here is use Vance as an opportunity to get back to messaging around Trump that has been successful. I mean, if you look at the 2022 midterms, part of the success Democrats had was in painting Republicans as aligned with MAGA extremism. And what Vance does is give them an opportunity to go really hard at some of the things that people most dislike and find most off-putting about MAGA extremism.
