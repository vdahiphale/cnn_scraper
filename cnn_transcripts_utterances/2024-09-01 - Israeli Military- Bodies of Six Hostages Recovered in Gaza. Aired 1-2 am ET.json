The Israeli military says it has recovered the bodies of six hostages from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area on Saturday.The IDF has now formally identified and named all six, and their families have been notified. You can see their photographs there. They are Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Carmel Gat, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lobanov, and Ori Danino. Obviously, their families are having to deal with this terrible news. Now, the White House put out a statement. I just want to read part of it to you. Quote, \"It is as tragic as it is reprehensible. Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes, and we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.\" Now, the news had led to renewed protests in Israel, calling for the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal. The group, Missing Families Forum, a very active group in these protests, issued a statement saying, quote, \"Netanyahu abandoned the hostages.\" On Saturday, protesters said Netanyahu was putting the war with Hamas ahead of the hostages' lives.

We haven't reached that point going back to seeing all of these protests, as we just saw some video of that from Saturday night, and that's been going on -- on a daily basis, but in particular on Saturday evenings, at the end of the Jewish Sabbath that these protests have been taking place.I suppose if there is going to be a moment, if this movement, if these, you know, Hostages and Missing Families Forum, along with their supporters, who want bringing the hostages back to Israel to be the number one priority, above and beyond the priority of the government's priority of destroying Hamas, I suppose today is the day, Sunday, September the 1st, which is also the first day of school in Israel. That will -- this will be, I suppose, a key test of just how much support they can muster, and if that anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government can be harnessed, if you like, into a bigger movement that could, you know, not necessarily jeopardize his government, because so long as he has 64 seats and 120 seat Israeli Knesset, so long as he maintains that majority, he can't be toppled politically, but certainly if, you know, the pressure builds to the extent that it did, you know, it reached its Zenith, the anti-judicial overhaul talks -- sorry, protests, in the wake of Netanyahu sacking his Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, who had the temerity to call for a pause in the plans to overhaul the judiciary. That was when there was effectively a national strike. I remember I was actually flying out of Israel that day, and if you recall, I actually did a live report from the airplane as we were trying to take off, and many of the planes were grounded, the airport, everything, and that -- that's what it took to cause Netanyahu and his government to pause their plans for this judicial overhaul. So I guess today is the day, September the 1st in Israel, as it already is, to see if the amount of protests, if, you know, the number of people out on the streets can, you know, become a movement similar in size and pressure to bring the country to a halt so that the government really will sit up and take notice. But as I say, you know, and as has been noted by others such as Yaakov Katz before who's been on, you know, thus far, although the protests have been large and roads have been blocked, including the main highway going through Tel Aviv, there have been protests outside Netanyahu's personal private residence in the seaside town of Caesarea, just north of Tel Aviv. They haven't yet prompted the government to change its tacks. So if these protests are going to make a difference, then I suppose today, September the 1st, is the day for that to happen.",

The statement says they were found in the city of Rafah on Saturday and were killed a short while before Israeli troops reached them.Israel says Hamas is still holding about 100 other hostages. About one-third of them are presumed to be dead. We're now keeping an eye on what will happen in Israel in the coming hours. A group representing hostage families called on the public to mobilize as they accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of abandoning the hostages and in fact, that group, The Hostage and Missing Families Forum. They said in a statement just in the last few minutes, a deal for the return of the hostages has been on the table for over two months. Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses from those whose death we learned about this morning would likely still be alive. A lot of anger. All right, Paula Hancocks, joins me now live from Abu Dhabi. Now, all of this taking place against the backdrop of efforts to reach some sort of an agreement on a ceasefire deal.

      "sentences": "And we are seeing more distance, for example, between the Prime Minister and his Defense Minister. We have seen that there have been disagreements as to the way that this has been planned. There have for months now been calls for, obviously, the hostage ceasefire deal to be done, calls for a day-after plan for Gaza to be presented, neither of which have been done in any meaningful way.And we've heard from Israeli officials as well that the military can do only so much. You cannot continue to have a military operation or a war in Gaza, which has no end in sight and has no political solution to wrap it up. And so this has really been a criticism that we've heard for some time from the Israeli public and also from officials speaking about the Prime Minister. Now, the Prime Minister, of course, denies all this. He says that his priority is to get the hostages back. But what we have seen today will only lay more pressure at his door to agree to what has already appears to have been agreed to by Hamas, the United States standing behind this original deal, and also the two key mediators, Egypt and Qatar, have been behind this deal. Now, we know they have been putting severe pressure on Hamas to come to the table and to agree to those parameters. But as you say, it does appear as though goalposts are being moved, that the conditions are being changed, and just the latest condition that appears to be changed is this Philadelphi Corridor. Now, we have heard other conditions being changed that have been agreed over recent months, which is why the U.S. says that there has been progress made and they are moving closer to a deal. For example, at one point, the Israeli troops wanted to be stationed on a very key thoroughfare in the middle of Gaza, so preventing movement between north and south Gaza. They have now agreed not to do that, so that has moved the process forward. But we are still looking at the border between Egypt and Gaza, which is key, the Israeli military says, to preventing Hamas from being able to rearm and being able to smuggle weapons from Egypt back into Gaza to regroup itself after any kind of ceasefire.",

A ceasefire means for him the end of his government.And because of that, the public is accusing him, opposition leaders are accusing him, that he is -- that he is using his personal -- he's putting his personal interests and preferences before the state interests and before saving lives. Now, the security chiefs of all of them said, including last Thursday, we can deal from the security dimension, security perspective, with the lack of Israeli presence, IDF presence on the Philadelphi axis, on the Rafah border, for a short period of at least six weeks. But Netanyahu rejected it. And he brought the decision as a precondition to have this presence at the last moment, after midnight. So it's clear that Netanyahu is trying all in his possibilities to avoid making a decision to release the hostages, because he fears that would be the end of the coalition, the end of his government and new elections.",

Some of -- eight of them, as you rightly mentioned, were rescued by daring operations. The rest were murdered by either Hamas or died out of malnutrition and maltreatment.So the Israeli public is very, very angry, furious, and once again is blaming Netanyahu for all these delaying tactics and setting all these preconditions, because he doesn't want to have a comprehensive deal, and part of that comprehensive deal is to have, as a first stage, to have a swap, prisoner swap. He is controlled by at least two extreme radical, zealot, Masonic ministers, Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Smotrich, and they have been threatening time and again, Prime Minister Netanyahu, that the moment he accepts the deal, a ceasefire, it will be the end of the government.

They have met with President Biden. They spoke at the Democratic National Convention some 10 days ago and led the crowd in chants of \"Bring Them Home.\" They, of course, put out a statement as well saying how devastated they were in asking for privacy at this time. There was also a statement from President Biden, as you say. He was saying that he was devastated and outraged. And in the last few minutes, Michael, we have also seen a statement from Israeli President Isaac Herzog saying that the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces with the news of the murder of Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Eden Yerushalmi. And so going back to your original question, Michael, so Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23-year-old Israeli-American, Eden Yerushalmi, she was working as a bartender, 24 years old. She was on the phone with her sisters while she was trying to seek cover from the Hamas militants as they rampaged through the Nova Music Festival which was taking place just next to the Gaza Strip. Her last words that her sister heard was Shani, her sister's name, they caught me. [01:40:18] Carmel Gat, 40-year-old, occupational therapist, she was the only one of the six who wasn't taken from the Nova Music Festival. She was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri where she was visiting her parents. Both of whom were murdered by the militants on October 7th. Hostages who had been freed in the first and only ceasefire back in November described her as a guardian angel. Almog Sarusi, 27-year-old, he was with his girlfriend at the Nova Music Festival. She was mortally wounded. He stayed behind to try to help her only to find himself being kidnapped as well. Then there was Alexander Lobanov, a 32-year-old Israeli-Russian citizen. His wife gave birth to their second child who is now five months old while he was in captivity so he never got to meet his child. And then Ori Danino, a 25-year-old who reportedly took a number of festival goers to safety in his car and then turned back around to try to help more people only to become a victim himself and to be kidnapped on October 7th. His body was also found, one of the six that were discovered on Saturday by the IDF. And as heartbreaking as those deaths will be for the families and Israelis in general, it will perhaps be even harder to swallow for them to know that according to the Israeli Defense Forces Spokesman, Daniel Hagari, that they were killed -- the belief of the IDF is that they were killed just a short while before Israeli soldiers got to where they discovered the bodies and this was anyway about a kilometer away from where the Israeli Bedouin citizen was rescued just a few days ago as well. The Hostages and Families Forum putting out another statement a short while ago a stinging rebuke of Prime Minister Netanyahu who thus far, so far as we can tell, has not put out any statement, so nothing from the Israeli government so far. The Hostages Families Forum saying that a deal for the return of the hostages has been on the table for over two months were it not for the delays sabotage and excuses those whose death we learned about this morning would likely still be alive and the Hostages Forum and organizations representing families of those who still have loved ones inside the Gaza Strip calling -- saying that they will make Israel tremble today. They're calling for mass protests on what is the first day of school for Israeli children to try to take the pressure up to maximum level on the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in particular to come back to the table to do a deal with Hamas that would see the remaining living hostages returned home but of course as we saw just a couple of days ago in a quite startling account by CNN affiliate Israel Channel 12 and other Israeli media outlets about the spat between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Gallant wanting Israel to do a deal. Netanyahu insisting Israel remain in control of the border between Israel and Gaza something that is a non-starter for Hamas. Michael?",
