Authorities responded to the scene last night after someone on a separate boat called 9-1-1 to report victims in the water.

We were told that someone called 9-1-1 between 11:30 and midnight, and the caller reported these two boats saying they believed eight people were in one boat, 15 were on another. Both of these had capsized. By the time authorities got there, they did not find any survivors. They say they only found these eight bodies. They did see life jackets in that area, but they believe the people they recovered were not wearing those life jackets. And as you heard the Chief there, these were very difficult conditions. It was pitch black. Authorities were doing everything they could to search for any survivors. If they were any, they said that they were up in the air as well. But even with night vision goggles, it was really difficult to see what was going on in the water. And again, they did not have any survivors in that area, so they were just going off the information from the 9-1-1 caller, and that is still the case today as they continue to search. But again, it is still difficult today to continue that search. Authorities also pointing to awareness about all of this saying these are criminal organizations that are bringing people from Mexico, and Border Patrol saying they are working with Mexican authorities to essentially try to figure out what criminal organization is responsible for this because they did call it a tragedy, something that has been difficult, obviously for the search teams out there as they continue to do all of this. But again, we're waiting to see how long they will be searching today -- Fred.",

So one of the things that we learned in the past hour, Fred, is that emergency officials we are talking to here on the ground are expecting a better idea of how that levee will have a temporary fix from State and local engineers. Because that levee is broken on the Pajaro River, that's why we have all of this water here. So stay tuned for more information on that, and of course, as we watch the forecast, Monday night into Tuesday and Wednesday, that is Act Two, the 11th atmospheric river event -- Fred.",

CNN meteorologist Britley Ritz is tracking all of it. Britley, make it all stop. BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: I know, really. And one thing to note, Fred, is that it only takes 12 inches of moving water to lift your vehicle off the ground. He has no idea how lucky he is to actually have survived that and to have that helicopter nearby. And another thing, turn around don't drown. I know it sounds like a silly saying, but it will save your life in events like this. Round two on its way. This is not round two. This is just the rain coming in with the Westerly Wind. We wait for that next system to really ramp up over the next 24 hours. Flood Watches, 15 million plus under a watch, and this will likely get extended. More flood warnings and flash flood warnings to come over the next 24 hours. You'll see that rain really start to ramp up. This is Sunday into Monday, very scattered yet. It's not Monday into Tuesday night when this rain really starts to get heavy along the California coastline where we are expected to pick up an additional two to four inches of rain, isolated higher amounts, six to eight a possibility, especially on the Northern Coastline of California, which is part of the reason why we're under that moderate flood risk where we are highlighting it in red on Monday. But again, going down into the southern foothills of the Sierra Nevada and through the Sacramento Valley down into the Southern Coastline of California coming in to Tuesday evening, and then into Wednesday. On top of all the rain, we've had that snowpack through the Sierra that has melted a bit, but notice you can still see it on satellite. It's part of the reason why it has contributed to the flooding. But look at all of this. This is more snow through the California elevations where it has just reached up well past the roofline of many homes. So that snowpack still on average, well above average, compared to where it's been. We've let a lot of water loose through Lake Oroville's levees and the dam. That's all that water. Even at that point, we're still above average, which is great to help with the drought situation, but one of the biggest things, Fred, is that we need this rain over a long period of time, not what's going on right now when it's happening all at once.",

Today, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ruled out a Federal bailout for Silicon Valley Bank following its stunning collapse on Friday. SVB is the 16th biggest bank in the country. It's the second biggest bank failure in US history after the collapse of Washington Mutual during the financial crisis of 2008.

Beyond that, the FTC is going through the assets of SVB and liquidating it, and at some point, the depositors will gain access to those funds.The question though, is exactly how much of those funds and when they will be available. So one scenario, if there is not a bailout is that the bank could be sold. If that is the case, then it's likely the depositors will have full access to their funds.",

There is concern that people might pull their money from mid-tier banks put them in larger banks, which they would perceive as safer and that could have very quickly serious effects on their bottom line.One Stanford Professor I talked to you said that these are panic dynamics and panic dynamics are very hard to predict. The other concern is about the companies who banked at SVB. Those companies on Monday are going to see that their funds are not fully available and they are going to have to figure out exactly how they are going to pay their employees, they are going to figure out how to keep the lights on, on their businesses. Those are the two concerns that we're seeing. So as long as those funds and the bailout, as has been much discussed, doesn't come, expect to see a lot of uncertainty in the markets.",

The husband of one the sisters telling Penitas Police that the three left headed for Montemorelos, Mexico, this would have been on February 24th, crossing the border just south of Mission Texas for that about three-hour drive to Montemorelos to sell clothing at a flea market. The husband also telling investigators that he even managed to stay in contact with his wife after they crossed into Mexico. But then suddenly, calls weren't being returned, nobody was answering and that's when he turned to authorities for help, who then alerted the FBI. In the last hour, the FBI responding in a statement saying that they cannot comment on this ongoing investigation and certainly encouraging for people on both sides of the border to call in any information that they have on these three women. Just to give you a sense of the geography here, Fred. According to investigators, again they were heading to the State of Nuevo Leon. However, in order to get there, typically by land, you would have to drive through the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which you'll see it's has that small sliver that moves north. And that, according to the US State Department is on a Do Not Travel list because of a significant increase in cartel violence. It's also the same State where we saw the recent kidnapping of four Americans. So it's certainly going to be part of the concern here for authorities on the US side as they try to find out what happened to these three women. Again, two of them live in South Texas -- Fred.",

Horne, an outspoken critic of critical race theory says the so-called Empower Hotline, that's what they're calling it, will allow people to voice their concerns over materials that allegedly, I'm quoting now, \"detract from teaching standards.\" And that includes lessons that, and this is their breakdown, lessons that focus on race or ethnicity rather than individuals and merit, promote gender ideology, and social emotional learning. The State's education website also suggesting certain CRT words may be embedded in conversations. It gives examples like \"oppressors\" -- the words, \"oppressors\" or \"oppressed\" and \"White supremacy.\" The move is the latest in a nationwide trend among conservatives to reshape how lessons are taught. Virginia launched a tip line last year for parents to report so-called divisive concepts in the classroom. It was shut down months later. I'm joined now by Yana Kunichoff who is an education reporter for \"The Arizona Republic.\" Also joining us is Professor Ibram X. Kendi. He is the Director at the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research and the author of \"How to be an Antiracist.\" Good to see both of you. Yana, if I could start with you. You know, how is this -- and it is being called the Empower Hotline. How's it being received there in Arizona? YANA KUNICHOFF, EDUCATION REPORTER, \"THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC\": Yes, you know, pushing back on alleged teaching of critical race theory in Arizona schools has been -- was part of newly elected Superintendent Tom Horne's platform from the start, and so was having this hotline be part of his administration's efforts.

What are your biggest concerns here about this? IBRAM X. KENDI, DIRECTOR, BOSTON UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR ANTIRACIAL RESEARCH: Well, it prevents teachers from doing their job. If you're a History teacher, as an example, I teach history and you're teaching about the Ku Klux Klan, or you're teaching about the Confederate States of America, of your teaching about even many of the enslavers their ideology was an ideology of White supremacy. So are you not allowed to say that? Can you be called on or punished for saying the truth?
