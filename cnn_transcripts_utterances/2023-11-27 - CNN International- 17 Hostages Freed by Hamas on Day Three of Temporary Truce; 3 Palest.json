Meters away, hundreds of apartments in this residential complex. One of the mothers that we spoke to, she said, we're used to this, but we don't want to be used to this. And the fact of the matter is, Max, that Ukrainians know that there will be more attacks like this in the coming weeks and months as they move into the depths of winter. It is snowing here in Kyiv. Temperatures are freezing and Russia wants to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure. So, the Ukrainians know that there will be more attacks. These air defense, you know, obviously protecting Kyiv.

They need air defense systems. As we just heard from President Zelensky. But there is a growing consensus amongst -- certainly, the people that we are speaking to and the analysts -- that the West is providing Ukraine enough to stay in the fight, but not enough to win. And there is real confusion as to why that is the case.We then speak to these soldiers on the frontline. Yesterday we went to a hospital where there were dozens of soldiers injured in this war. They were the lucky ones to have survived. And they say that they do not have enough weapons to fight this war. General Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, he said as much in a nine-page essay printed in \"The Economist\" a few weeks ago. He said there has been a delay in the weapons provided by the West. We know the F-16s that are coming from the United States. Training is underway now for the pilots, but those won't be up in the air until, you know, spring at the earliest. So basically, the world needs to step up. The West needs to step up. You know, Ukraine is fighting Europe's war and the people here they need these weapons. They need these air defense systems now.",

Some totals for rain could be up to an inch. The snow totals really zeroing in on some of these communities right off of the lakes as that cold air really starts to pump some of that lake effect snow. What's happening is we have Arctic air coming in behind that front. That very cold air is going to swipe across the lakes. When that happens, the lakes are relatively warmer than that cold air. So, the cold air is able to pick up some moisture from the lake. It starts to hit into the land rises very quickly and it gets that snow machine to pump. And man, will it pump. We're looking at some totals well over a foot for some communities near Cleveland and Erie, some 12 to 18 inches of snow possible. Up in Oswego, this Tug Hill could be looking at some totals, maybe two or three feet. So, getting pretty treacherous as we start the work week here after the holiday. Temperatures are going to stay below average. We'll keep that Arctic air in play. But at least Tuesday and Wednesday with quite a bit of a chill in the air. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
