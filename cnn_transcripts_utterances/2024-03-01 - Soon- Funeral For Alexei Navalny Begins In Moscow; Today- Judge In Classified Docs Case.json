Plus, a critical hearing today in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Donald Trump's lawyers now saying they would accept a trial three months before the election. And Congress doing what it seems to do best these days, kicking the can down the road, yet again to head off a government shutdown.",

It's great to be with you. Happy Friday. We made it. All right. Even in death, Alexei Navalny is haunting Vladimir Putin. Just an hour from now, funeral services are scheduled to begin in Moscow for the late opposition leader. Hundreds of mourners and a heavy police presence are already in place. Navalny's allies fear the Kremlin will intervene. It's not clear whether anyone beyond Navalny's family will be allowed to attend the services. And there are mounting concerns that the Russians may block the livestream of the funeral. Making today's events a potential flashpoint for anti-Putin sentiment inside Russia. The world is watching with vigils now underway across the globe. CNN senior editor Nathan Hodge joins us now from London. Nathan, good morning to you. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, this is a two-week saga now that's been unfolding since the death of Alexei Navalny.First, we had an incredible drama that unfolded just over whether or not the authorities would be handing over Navalny's body to his family. That was mother in the days after his death had gone up to the remote prison north of the Arctic Circle, where he died in an effort to retrieve the body. And there was a giant sort of behind the scenes tussle over, handing over the body with essentially Navalny supporters shaming Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is often cast himself as a defender of traditional values for not handing over the body of Alexei Navalny, so that he could have what his family wanted, which would be an orthodox Christian burial. Now, in Moscow crowds have been assembling outside of the church in the southern Moscow suburban neighborhood, where Navalny's family had lived and they're gathering there with a very heavy police presence, as authorities are clearly concerned that the commemoration of Navalny, that this funeral could turn essentially into a political funeral. And, of course, you know, it's been a longstanding practice of the Russian authorities to crack down on any kind of unauthorized political gathering. But that tendency has already gathered speed and is an intensified since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with the authorities passing laws that essentially, you know, further restricted free speech and the authorities have dealt very harshly over the past couple of weeks with people who have been staging impromptu memorials to Navalny, laying flowers to him, and, you know, cities around Russia and many hundreds of people according to human rights observers, have been arrested for coming out and showing their support for Navalny's. So the big concern around this is that this demonstration, all that we have not seen evidence of any kinds of arrests despite this heavy police presence around the church and where the funeral is supposed to take place, but we've just heard in sort of the past hour from Navalny's spokesperson that they are still waiting for the body to actually be handed over, thus causing another delay in potentially, you know, pushing the funeral. This memorial observance further to the right, Kasie.",

At the end of the day, Trumps lawyers have tried to delay these cases as much as possible because they know that if Donald Trump is elected, that he could simply ask the Justice Department to dismiss these cases. And at the end of the day, we've seen in Bloomberg News and Morning Consult's polling, that a conviction and any of these criminal trials could be a huge liability for Donald Trump, especially in swing states and if he faces prison time.So this is certainly their strategy, may be a way to negotiate with the judge here. But as you said, Donald Trump's legal strategy has increasingly just merged with his campaign strategy. We've seen him take to truth, social, expressing his grievances with judges and with the process in genera. That has energized his base voters in many ways. I've talked to voters who believe that this was a corrupt system against him, that the Justice Department is against Donald Trump. And for his base voters, that has worked, but there is evidenced that sort of fringe Republicans are uncomfortable of this.",

The Biden team announcing he was going to go down there after the Trump trip was already on the calendar, so he clearly wanted to put himself right in that frame, so that when we were sitting here doing this the day after, we have pictures of both of them here acknowledging, hey, this is a problem, but they talk about this very, very differently. I mean, Trump was back on. I mean, I was there when he went down that golden escalator and he was talking about, you know, people coming across the border bringing drugs, bringing crime, demonizing migrants, President Biden was criticizing Republicans to saying, hey, like you killed this very conservative policy that I was willing to support, what -- what did you see as this played out yesterday?",

You heard the president of the United States say there, that there are competing versions, but also acknowledging the reality that this is going to really affect these ongoing negotiations to try to get a temporary ceasefire and a deal to release hostages. What do you know? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  Kasie, that is the concern, that with more than 100 killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry and hundreds injured, that this could derail those hostage talks, which is still ongoing. We heard what last week President Biden, while chomping on an ice cream, saying that he was hopeful that a truce, cease-fire with but Israeli hostages freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and more aid going into the Gaza Strip could be achieved as early as Monday. Well, it's already Friday, so Monday seems somewhat optimistic, especially on the unofficial deadline now is in time for Ramadan, which starts around March the 10th. But in terms of what actually happened yesterday in the early hours of the morning, between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. local time, we know that there were 30 aid trucks carrying Egyptian aid to the western part of Gaza City and the northern part of the Gaza Strip. We know that there were crowds of people that surrounded these trucks are, of course, desperate for humanitarian aid. It's been very hard to get aid into that part of the Gaza Strip, that there was a stampede. And as you say, there were people that were trampled underfoot who are run over by trucks, as they tried to escape and the chaos and some trucks rammed into other trucks, which caused further fatalities. Now, the difference differentiating versions here seem to be that the Palestinian officials and eyewitnesses say that it was Israeli fire on the people surrounding this convoy, that prompted the stampede that led to all of these deaths and injuries. The IDF, for its part, saying that it did fire warning shots to disperse the stampede, and that the only live fire at fire was at a group of Palestinians that approached one of its tanks. And it hasn't actually given us any details as to how many Palestinians were killed in that incident, but says that it wasn't that many, of course, any innocent civilians is too many. So that's the situation. Yes, you're right now. Investigation is being called for. Investigations underway, Kasie.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, right. Exactly. I think its important that we try to draw while these two big storiestogether, because one is impacting the other and I'll explain how. First and foremost, the major winter storm/blizzard that is impacting the state of California, particularly across the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the National Weather Service reserves particular wording for moments like this, using the words extremes, using the words significant, and that is all within their discussions. This is an extreme event. It is a rare event. And the reason for that is because of the amount of snow, the amount of wind that is going to batter this region. And that currently is and the reduced visibilities. This is going to make travel nearly too impossible. There have been wind gusts over 100 miles per hour, already near Lake Tahoe, in the higher elevations across Palisades, and into that particular region, this radar loops shows a constant barrage of heavy snow. The potential exists here for up to 10 feet of snow or more and some of those higher elevations. The interstates like I-80 will be virtually impassable. It will be disorienting for people if you do choose to travel, which we do not advise. The potential exists for cars to be buried in this snow as well as first story level homes being buried by snow drifts with the amount of when that's expected. Look at this, this is actually topping our charts on our forecast snow accumulation. You see those little red dots there. We haven't had time to tweak our color table here yet. But that just gives you the idea of how much snow we're talking about. It is literally off the scales. Wind is going to make it that much more difficult. Mammoth Lakes look at that as a forecast. Wind gusts 75 miles per hour. That's equivalent to a category one hurricane at the minimum. And that will reduced visibilities. And by the way, that wind heading east towards the Texas panhandle, that's where the fires are still raging out of control -- Kasie.",
