Our breaking news coverage continues in a moment.And this is CNN's continuing breaking news coverage of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. I'm Michael Holmes, appreciate your company. The FBI says the man who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump is Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20 years old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Public records show he was a registered Republican and made a small donation to a Democratic-aligned group. Investigators say he opened fire on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, before countersnipers shot and killed him. As for Trump, he says that the bullet pierced his ear and a spokesperson said shortly after the attack that he was doing fine. It all happened while the cameras were rolling. Have a look.

The Secret Service says the suspected shooter is dead. The video you see there appears to show the gunman after he was killed. And you can see on this map where the shooter was, atop that building towards the top right of your screen. Trump was on the stage marked on the map around the center of your screen. Officials also say one rally attendee was killed, two others critically injured. Here's part of the statement that Trump posted on social media, quote, I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Hours later, Trump was seen in this video getting off his plane unassisted in New Jersey. The video posted to social media by his campaign. Now, members of different law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation updated reporters early on Sunday morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

His name is Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20 years old, and he's from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Now, that's the scene right now of a massive, massive police presence. Police on the scene there have cordoned off a very large area around the home where he's believed to have spent been living recently. And so that's where the focus of this investigation is now. But, you know, it took a little while, as we reported earlier, Jim, and as the FBI said at the press conference a little while ago that, you know, he didn't have any identification on him, on his person when the Secret Service shot and killed him there on that rooftop. And so as a result, it took additional work. They had to do biometrics, they had to do DNA testing to be able to verify his identity. And so the location of where he was living, or at least the last known where place where he was living and where the FBI is now, you know, trying to get evidence is in Bethel Park, which is outside of Pittsburgh. The rally where this incident occurred, where the attempted assassination of the former president occurred is in Butler, which is about an hour away on the other side of Pittsburgh, again, all of this in Western Pennsylvania. And now, of course, the work begins to try to understand what the motivation was, how long has he been planning this, when did he get the gun, how long has he been working on this, and, really, if there was anybody else at all who was connected to this assassination attempt. And all of that, of course, is now where the FBI is focused on, in addition to obviously some of the additional questions that we all have from watching that scene, how was this government allowed to get to that location, that perch on that rooftop with a clear view of the former president and not stopped before he got those shots off.

Now, you can't just say, oh, there's somebody over there on a roof and shoot them. So, what they're going to be doing is looking, waiting until they see a weapon.The problem is that in that in that area on the roof, there could have been a slight wall covering him, hiding him. [03:10:03] And sometimes, I mean, we are taught as snipers to find rain gutters that go out of those little walls and shoot through those so that nobody can see you on the other side. So, they may have had a very obstructed view. But once they decided to take the suspect out, it was immediate. It was quick. It was accurate. It was text book.",

And so the fact that they allowed -- that somebody allowed that roof to be unmonitored, unguarded, that's going to be -- that's not on the on the counter snipers. It is on the planning or the execution. They could have planned for that roof and maybe something happened in the planning or in the execution of the plan where it was left unguarded.But what I'm thinking, though, is that how did this guy get so lucky that he had decided to take the one place that was accidentally unguarded? That's just going to be something that we're going to have to really look deeply into. What did you make -- and we're watching video now of Donald Trump being taken off the stage. What did you make of the reaction of the Secret Service agents? They obviously trained for this. Was that pretty textbook? I mean, Trump paused as they were trying to get him off the stage, which probably isn't textbook. What did you make of how that all went down?",

They are using their own bodies as bullet traps to protect their protectee. That's the highest level of devotion, I think, of duty.And I think that if you listen carefully, you can hear them going through well-practiced drills. And it's gratifying for me, who's been part of special teams, to see somebody who has trained for an emergency in the worst case scenario, not very from the training that they've had, not changing anything and not letting the situation overwhelm them. And certainly, it was impressive to me. As far as the president standing up and essentially revealing himself as a target again, they certainly didn't want that. I'm sure they didn't expect that, and I'm sure that's going to be part of training for both the Secret Service and protectees in the future.",

Trump was the victim today. It is possible that tomorrow it'll be someone that Trump identifies as a threat.

And that is, as we're saying, we're seeing on Twitter from a number of his allies, essentially. They try to indict him now, they've tried to kill him. There's going to be some of that.There's also the opportunity for Trump, especially because he is leading in polls to take a very different tack at the Republican convention and say something more like what I mentioned a few minutes ago, which is that this is an opportunity for everyone in society to look at the mirror and say, are we on a path that we want to go forward? I think you saw that from Biden. I think that's a kind of an easy argument for him. The tougher question is how do they phrase their continuing belief that Trump, in a variety of ways, has shown himself to be a threat to democracy. Anything that was true about Donald Trump and his relationship to American democracy yesterday is still true today. That doesn't mean it is wise or prudent to express those concerns in the same way.

So, no one should pretend that it is simple to unwind what we are living through.The only force we have going, I think, in the other direction is that I do not believe most Americans want to live this way. I do not believe that most Americans want to live in a society where political differences are attempted to be solved through violence or even at the level of acrimony that we now see in the way politics is conducted. And, ultimately, it does come back to voters. I mean, voters can choose to reward the loudest voices or the voices that kind of seek some kind of common ground. It does no one any good to deny our differences. I remember in the 90s people used to say it's only the political leadership that's divided, not the electorate. That's clearly not true anymore. I mean, there are deep differences between kind of blue and red America about almost everything. The one thing they have in common, I think, is that they kind of recognize that none of us are going away, and that ultimately we have to learn how to live together better if we don't want more days like today. And, as I say, for Donald Trump, as well as everyone else, this is a chance to rethink. I can't say I'm usually optimistic about the kind of rhetoric that he has used and whether it will change, but it is a moment for him, and as well as those who will compare him to Hitler to all kind of think about whether this is the kind of country you want to live in.

You go back to the early noughties to get a spate of attacks, assassinations and attempted assassinations, various political leaders. You only have to go back a couple of months though to actually get the most recent attack on a European politician. This was the prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico. Again, like Trump, like Orban, populist, divisive. Fico sympathizes perhaps more with President Putin than he does with some of his contemporary European leaders. He was shot at close range by a 71-year-old gunman. There was a sort of a lack of security, a lapse in security. And Robert Fico, the prime minister, shot in the middle of May this year only was able to go take the sort of public political arena again just about a week ago.So, these things, this violence is not utterly unfamiliar. It's just rare, but I think -- and that's why you know the background, I suppose, for the context of why a lot of European leaders look at the political discourse, the divisive political discourse in the United States and, frankly, the gun crime that exists in the United States. And this really feeds into their concerns about a very bumpy and potentially traumatic and troubling run-up, an election cycle. And the outcome, of course, is so important to all countries around the world. What happens in the United States isn't just a political view that shapes what happens in the rest of the world, it shapes people's lives. [03:30:09] The economy in the United States is such a driver. All of these things are connected and this is why people right now will be looking and hoping that the calmer voices are the ones that prevail.",

His advisers say he is fine and he will be at the Republican convention this week. One man who was attending the rally is dead, authorities say. Two others were critically injured. Now, this video shows the suspect who was shot and killed on the roof of a nearby building, the FBI identifying him as 20-year-old Matthew Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Records show he was a registered Republican. The FBI appealing for the public's help in the investigation. CNN's Alayna Treene spoke to a doctor who was sitting behind Donald Trump in the bleachers when the shots were fired. He says he helped carry the body of another rally attendee who was killed, describing the moments after the shooting as complete pandemonium. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR.

It was a little, it was very confusing, initially, because I knew it was gunfire, but I couldn't quite tell where it was coming from. It sounded like it was coming from behind the bleachers. And the man in the bleachers kind of to the (INAUDIBLE) bleachers took a gunshot wound to the head. He was killed. And another woman -- I don't know exactly where she was on the bleachers.

And then there was a state policeman there, I believe a SWAT team showed up relatively quickly. They jumped the side. There was a fence, it was next to the bleachers.

The other half of the crowd knew it wasn't and was trying to push or impress upon the rest of the crowd that this is serious.

It just seemed to me, like I said, I was sitting there, it seemed like the rounds came from behind and they got this, they hit the gentleman in the head, he got a gunshot wound to the head and the other lady was injured.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Even though it appears that it was mostly the ear and the soft tissue around the ear, when you're in the hospital after something like this, you have to sort of evaluate the possibility that they may have still caused a skull fracture or something else in a significant blow to that part of the, the head. When you watch that Anderson, a couple things. First of all, after you hear the bangs and the president -- the former president raises his hand to his ear, he then seems to go down on his own. That was one important thing. He's covered up by the agents there who are protecting him, but also probably doing a little bit of what is called a secondary evaluation, making sure, or trying to determine at least at that point, if there are any other injuries. We see what we see, but it doesn't mean that something else couldn't have happened as well in a situation like that. The president stands up. He's raising his right hand. He seems to be walking on his own, again, surrounded by the Secret Service agents, but walking on his own. Those are all very important signs. But from a medical standpoint, from a trauma standpoint, getting a full evaluation still, you don't know what you don't know in these situations. Sometimes people can have injuries that are unrecognized at that point. And, by the way, besides the former president, people at the rally as well, you can have people who are walking wounded, may not actually fully recognize that they have been injured. If there had been any other secondary injuries or unrecognized injuries from the scene, they would have likely found those by now, X- rays, perhaps a C.T. scan, really examining the president all over to make sure, again, there wasn't another injury from whether it was bullet or secondary projectiles, whatever it may have been, that probably would have all happened by now, Anderson.",

You can get a sense of the trajectory of the projectile, stitches that would be necessary, what did it do to his inner ear, would it cause problems longer term with hearing things like that, balance difficulties, we, we don't know. I think that the biggest thing at this point. Is trying to figure out, was there any other secondary more dramatic or significant injury? Hopefully not, but that's I think the main thing. But my guess is there will probably be follow up necessary, if for nothing else, just for the cosmetic injury to the ear. But, again, this can be very serious. I mean, there could be a skull fracture underneath that injury. There could be damage to the ear itself, the inner ear.So, they may have evaluated a lot of that already. You can do those sorts of evaluations pretty quickly, but it's got to be complete. You can't just go based on what you see here. You have to sort of do a full evaluation to make sure you're not missing something here. That's something the patient, in this case, the former president, may not even recognize themselves and the sort of -- with all the sort of -- all that's happening in that moment, there's things that can be missed.

I think he might have been instructed previously. They might have trained him to do that. Get down behind that barrier. Number one, whoever's still shooting can't see you because the bunting is in the way. Number two, that bunting is bulletproof. So, that's what they did. They got him down.Then once you get him down, then you have to figure out how to basically get him up and get him mobile a little bit. So, is he hurt? What is the extent of his injuries? I think Trump was asking about his shoe. He might have lost his shoe when he went down. So, you have to kind of -- there's a lot to take care of right there and get him off. You can't just kind of -- so you heard them communicating. It was very choreographed. They trained this way all the time. This is the team that surrounds Trump all the time. He knows them probably by all their first names. They all know him. They get along very well. By all accounts, he really likes his detail. That's his personal detail and they really like him. So they're there, they're on top of him. And now they've got to kind of get him up and still maintain a shield around him and get him off the stage, and that's what they did. Trump stopped a little bit to kind of wave to the crowd. And, but I don't think that was a significant delay and they got, they got him where they needed to do to get him off to medical treatment.",

And, again, just a sense of, yes, the bewilderment, like you said, everybody is still reeling from this.",

Driving into the parking lot, you could see neighbors holding lemonade stands. It is really, a fairly quiet neighborhood. That's how I would describe it.",

He warns Americans to learn from similar moments in history when the country face deep division.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  We have seen violence like this before in presidential elections. You mentioned RFK, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination was struck down. 1972, George Wallace, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, he wasn't killed but he was paralyzed for life. 1912, the last time that a former president ran for office, Theodore Roosevelt was hit by a bullet. It did not penetrate his heart. It was actually stopped by his eyeglass case and his speech. And indeed, he continued his speech. He finished it. He said it takes more than that to kill a bull moose. That gave a name to his party, became the Bull Moose Party. Violence is not new to our politics. We need to have this stop. We need, as Americans, to remember that, in the end, we are part of one country. And when we create -- when we spread hatred, when we spread poison, when we demonize, those who do not agree with us politically, we are laying the ground for the kind of violence that sadly reappears every so often in American politics. So, sadly, there's nothing new to this, but yet again, we have a chance as Americans to prevent it from happening again. We got ourselves out of this. When I say we, I mean, not just famous people who are leaders, but local leaders. teachers, family leaders of all kinds. We came to the conclusion that enough was enough. And we had conversations about limiting violence. We talked about how to spread freedom. We actually engaged in gun control. We got out of war in Vietnam. Congress investigated abuses by governments. We pulled ourselves out of this. We had a president who resigned when he realized that he had gotten caught. And we had members of his own party say that it was time for him to resign. In other words, Americans chose a country over partisanship We have done it before, and we need to do it again. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
