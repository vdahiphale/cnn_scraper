And you can see from those images that we're just putting out therefrom the Gaza Strip, the craters that were left by these Israeli airstrikes are absolutely enormous. And so it gives you an indication of how powerful the munitions were that were rained down on what would have been a very densely populated area that was meant to be a safe zone, of course, a humanitarian area targeting, according to Israeli Defense Forces, Hamas militants operating a command and control center there, but also civilians in the surrounding vicinity, paying an extremely high price. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (voice-over): As rescue workers scrambled for survivors, eyewitnesses say the Israeli strikes targeted what was meant to be a safe zone in the southern Gaza Strip, ripping through tents and makeshift shelters, leaving deep craters and dozens of killed and injured. They told us this area was safe, says this man. I swear the people here were just normal, he says, not fighters. By daylight, you can see the extent of the destruction. Israel's military says it conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists, operating a command and control center inside this humanitarian zone. An IDF statement says, prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. But this was a heavily populated area, and civilians were caught up in the powerful blast. This man says his two daughters were completely buried under the sand, only one survived. He says -- he says, he found the body parts of his neighbors strewn around. This 12-year-old girl, who's nursing a broken shoulder, suffered when her tent collapsed, she says, trapping her and her inside. I was scared because the strikes were so close, she says. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, and insists the Israeli military takes extensive measures to enable civilians in Gaza to avoid combat zones, but there's little real security in this brutal war.

And I do think it certainly hit very close to home for a lot of Russians,especially with the capital city being under sustained, it seemed, drone attack for several hours as those airports had to halt their operations for, of course, several hours. And I think there's several things that the Ukrainians have actually shown with this renewed drone attack. On the one hand, they do now have substantial long distance drone capabilities capable of flying to the Russian capital. But, of course, also flying beyond that, they've almost come all the way to St. Petersburg in the past. But now also showing that they have a substantial quantity of those long distance drones as well and that those drones can or at least try to strike sensitive targets inside Russia. If we look at some of the places that were targeted tonight, it was nine areas actually of Russia. Most of them are in the southwest, like for instance, the Bryansk area, the Kursk area and the Belgorod area, where of course the Russians do have a lot of military assets around there for their invasion of Ukraine. But then when we take a look at Moscow, we were mentioning that one person was killed on the ground. That happened in the Ramenskoye suburb of Moscow. That's also the site of a major Moscow airport, the Zhukovsky Airport. And then we did mention that for several hours, three of the airports in the Russian capitals could not have any outgoing or inbound flights. So definitely for air traffic, they're disrupted. There was one other airport, the Sheremetyevo airport, which of course the biggest one in Moscow that apparently still had flight operations. But, of course, the Ukrainians have said that the Russians use their airport also to resupply their effort against Ukraine, their war against Ukraine. So the Ukrainians definitely throwing a wrench in some of the Russian operations, they believe. But at the same time also showing that they do have those long distance capabilities. And that, of course, right now for Ukraine is extremely important as they themselves face a protracted aerial campaign by the Russians using ballistic and cruise missiles and, of course, using drones as well. One of the things that we should point out is that while this large-scale Ukrainian attack on Russian territory happened last night, at the same time, there was also a pretty large Russian attack using drones against Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians saying they detected some 46 drones in the skies. They managed to take down 38 of those drones. There were also ballistic missile attacks as well. So that's something that happens on a daily basis. But now the Ukrainians increasingly showing that they are able to punch back, even though, of course, their possibilities so a lot less than the gigantic arsenal that the Russians have, Bianna.",

The primary task for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris tonight is to win overundecided or persuadable voters, but how many voters are there like that at this point? You may be surprised to hear that about a third of voters say that a debate could have a significant impact on their vote for president, and 70 percent of American voters say they plan to watch tonight. For all the numbers to know heading into this debate, we welcome in to CNN's senior data reporter, our numbers grew, my friend, Harry Enten. Hello, Harry. I don't remember the last time you were on this show, so it's a special treat to have you clearly an important debate that we're going to be previewing if you took the time to join me. First of all, let me have you react to Gary's piece is what do you make of Door County as goes Door County, so goes the election?",

So look, I think it's a fun piece. Look, Wisconsin is, obviously, a very important state. That's going to be an important county in that state, but it wouldn't shock me, you know. One candidate wins the county by one point, and then loses statewide by a point. That could definitely happen, but still, it's good to get out on the ground and talk to regular people.

But, you know, the bottom line is there is just so much at stake going into this debate tonight, right? Normally, we think debates don't necessarily matter, because the bottom line is one candidate has a significant lead over the other candidate going into that first debate. You know, if you go back since 1976, you should see the average candidate is ahead by six points in the polls. But if you look at the polling right now, what you see between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is in the average poll, it's a two-point margin. We're significantly closer than we normally are going into first debate. So the bottom line is there's a lot at stake tonight, and there's specifically a lot at stake going on for Kamala Harris. Why is that? Because if you look at undecided voters, you know me, you know I like to drill deep down into those numbers. Look at this. How do undecided voters feel? Look at that. Forty-eight percent say they need to learn more about Kamala Harris. Voters have all pretty much made up their mind about Donald Trump. Just 18 percent say they need to learn more about Donald Trump. But look at that view favorably. Just 13 percent of voters at this point say they view Kamala Harris favorably. But there's that such a large chunk, 48 percent who say they need to learn more. So the real question is, can Kamala Harris go to those voters who've already made up their minds about Donald Trump and say, you know what? You should go with me, because if she is able to do that, she couldn't back win this election just on the basis of tonight's performance. And I will say this is a lot about the expectations game, right?",

So the big question, the big question, Bianna, is this, can Kamala Harris come out tonight, continue that momentum that she had for most of the last month that has only started to slow recently and basically turn the page? Because as I keep emphasizing, voters have already made up their minds about Donald Trump. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is, but there's still a lot of voters who are unsure about Kamala Harris. And tonight will go a long way to help determining those opinions going forward. And that is why I think so many voters say they're going to watch because there is so much at stake tonight.",

But saying these experiences have allowed me to see a different way forward, a more pragmatic way forward. I think on the immigration, got a pushback hard on the fact that she did go to the border. Maybe she had a leadership role there and she came back with recommendations of which Republicans and Democrats in the Senate both agreed upon and were ready to pass until Donald Trump made calls to McConnell and others, saying don't pass an immigration bill because I want to use it as a campaign issue.

It is about the economy and what his plans are to strengthen that economy. The fact that in his administration, you did not have wars breaking out all across the globe. And so if he sticks with his strength, then he's got a good message. Now, the other thing is he has less to gain and less to lose tonight because he is such a known quantity, that point has been made. Kamala Harris is less known so she has more to gain. And so Donald Trump really has to look for the opening where Kamala Harris stumbles, where she makes a mistake or where she leaves him an opening and that's where he's got to dive in.

We have already seen some rainfall rates of one to two inches per hour along the Texas coast. You can see the rain already coming into some places in Louisiana, like New Orleans. It's been a little bit unorganized this morning. It's battling some dry air, but it's getting its act together a little bit better because it's got some very warm ocean waters to work with here in the Gulf of Mexico. So it's got about a 24-hour window to gain strength and will become a hurricane later on today, which is why we have hurricane warnings in effect for a lot of the Louisiana coastline here. And it's been shifting a little bit east. We have tropical storm warnings in effect for New Orleans, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility of hurricane force winds there just yet, because we still have this storm that continues to shift east just a little bit and that could bring some of the worst of the winds into places a little bit farther east. So again, we'll find these winds really starting as we go into Wednesday morning. Today is your last day to prepare and get all everything down to completion. We'll find the wind gusts again getting up to 50 miles per hour, even 60 miles per hour in parts of New Orleans as we go into Wednesday and then starting to work inland on Thursday. So again, wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour from Morgan City possible. New Orleans, again, can get in on significant winds as well. Five to 10 feet of storm surge along the Louisiana coastline.
