That's the way it is and we move on and we will be ready when you are, he said. So let's look at what is going to happen. The first, we are getting a glimpse of how Donald Trump is going to run his second administration. Apparently, we are hearing that Elon Musk joined Donald Trump on his phone call this week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mr. Musk spent millions of dollars, hundreds of millions, to help Trump get re- elected and campaigned alongside him as you well know. Now, he is believed to have President-elect's ear. And \"The Financial Times\" is reporting that Robert Lighthizer has been asked to return as the US Trade Representative, extremely experienced, but did help launch the US trade war with China. He also renegotiated NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, so he is absolutely steeped in the issues, and if indeed more tariffs is on the agenda, which we know they are, he will certainly know his way around that issue. Last week, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, head of the WTO said Trump's trade policies so far seem to have backfired. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NGOZI OKONJU-IWEALA, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION: Since 2018, the tariffs came on board in 2018, we've seen trade between China and the US grow 30 percent more slowly than their trade with the rest of the world, and we've also seen that rising protectionism is leading to like- minded countries trading more with each other than with countries that are not so like-minded. So we see that protectionism and tariffs have some negative impacts on world output and on world trade. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": Two things, palpable relief that we didn't have a protracted delay, an indecisive result. The other thing I think is a consequence of the future policies, cuts in taxes, the fact that corporation taxes aren't going to rise, deregulation, the banks, the energy stocks have benefited this week. The renewables less so. Tesla has been one of the big winners. Elon Musk, you just mentioned him, more than $20 billion personally richer and more powerful this week. Look, it is early days, Richard.

So he is going to do things, like the phone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine because he thinks that Elon Musk, one, has a role to play, but perhaps there is a better understanding of the situation, whether you like it or not, he is going to be asked on to a phone call like that. I know it is alarming and I know it is strange when we hear about it, but we are going to hear about more and more of these things, and I think it is back to the future. We have to remember that a lot of strange and unusual things happened, and that is the way the president-elect works. I have spoken to businessmen who were also asked to be on calls with world leaders because they know a lot about a country or a situation. It is just the way the former president works.

And senior military leaders, of course, they could resign in protest, butofficials that we spoke to here said that that on a large scale anyway, is probably unlikely, because military leaders are pretty loath to do anything that might be perceived as kind of abandoning their people. And so, what we are seeing now is an attempt to kind of game out the responses that the department might have If Trump were to deploy active-duty troops to U.S. cities. For example, without invoking the insurrection act, kind of, you know, on a whim, and to engage in domestic law enforcement, as well as if he tried to use the U.S. military and active-duty troops to engage in this mass deportation plan that he has said that he wants to do. Now, part of the big, you know, question here is who he's going to actually install in the Pentagon? He has said that he wants to stack the department with loyalists, along with the rest of the federal government. And also, you know, there is a plan that he has to purge a really large number of apolitical civilian appointees, not only in the Pentagon, but also across the entire federal government. So that really raises the question of whether there's really going to be any backstops here when it comes to him issuing a potentially unlawful order.",

Look,if you were to look at a Web site like Polymarket, you know, you looked a few weeks ago, yes, they had, I think it was something like a two-thirds chance that Donald Trump was going to defeat Kamala Harris. But what you actually saw in the closing days was those odds started to converge almost with the polls. It became more of a tossup, so that by the end, it was about, you know, let's say a six in 10 shot that Trump would win. Now that's a slight favorite, but it's not overwhelmingly. So, and if you can't do the math at home, I'll do it for you. The polls suggested about a five in 10 chance, so I guess one-tenth of a chance higher. Why would the polling perhaps, underestimate Donald Trump and the betting markets get it right? Look, there were a few big bettors in the betting markets who suggested who put a lot of money in and that helped rise the price of Trump. But again, I don't think there was as massive a difference as you might have thought. And if you go back through the years, there are some years in which the betting markets do, in fact, do better than the polls. This year was one of them. And there are certain years in which the polls do better than the betting markets. I think 2022 is one of those and, you know, my buddy Nate Silver in 2020 I think did better than the betting markets as well. So, some years it's the betting markets, some years it's the polls.

Beautiful people, wonderful crab. But it doesn't tend to be where elections in this country decided won or lost. But here's the deal, you know, I shared, if folks at home don't know this, Richard and I occasionally text, and I shared with Richard a map which essentially projected out what the Electoral College would be based upon the final polls. And you had a normal polling miss, an average polling miss, that Donald Trump benefited from. And it turns out the final map looks exactly like that. Look. We don't have a winner yet in Nevada and Arizona. CNN has it projected, but Donald Trump leads there. So, to me, this was well within the normal average misses. And more than that, that is very unlike 2016 and specifically 2020 were Donald Trump did way better than the polls.

Look, the bottom line which 28 percent of the country heading into the election thought the country was on the right track. The incumbent party has never been reelected.
