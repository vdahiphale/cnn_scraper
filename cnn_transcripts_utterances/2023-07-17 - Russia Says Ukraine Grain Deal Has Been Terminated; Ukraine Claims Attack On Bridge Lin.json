Two people are dead after Ukraine hits a key Crimean bridge. Soaring temperatures put millions under heat warnings across the globe. And later in the show. How Carlos Alcaraz stunned Wimbledon. Welcome to the show. Now Russia says it has terminated a critical deal that allowed the export of Ukrainian grain raising fears over the fate of global food supplies and the price of grain. The agreement which had been set to expire today was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey last year. It had allowed Kyiv to safely exported screen from its black sea ports. That is despite a wartime blockage. Now, the effects of Moscow's withdrawal will be felt worldwide. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us from London. Clae, great to have you on. Look, Russia has been threatening to pull out of this deal. It basically expires in a few hours. So, take us through the latest here whether there's an anticipation of a last-minute agreement or whether it is done that Russia has officially pulled out.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Eleni. Russia has been using this deal for leverage for really most of the year that it'sbeen in force. It's been using it to its advantage in several ways. One to try to get sanctions lifted. It says that it's still having trouble getting its own food and fertilizer onto global markets because of certain sanctions impacting its banks. There are no official sanctions on Russian food and fertilizer. It should be noted, but they've been trying to get certain financial sanctions lifted. The second thing is to try to show loyalty to certain developing especially African countries with which Russia has been quietly cultivating alliances throughout this war by saying that the deal has not directed enough grain and foodstuffs to those countries that need it most. That's also part of what's going on here. As to whether this is actually a final decision. The language sounds pretty final right now. Russia says it's basically cancelled navigation guarantees, safe navigation guarantees through the Black Sea for ships carrying Ukrainian agricultural products. A U.N. official has told CNN that they believe right now Russia's words are final. But Russia has a lot to lose if it walks away here. It's got those, of course, alliances with developing countries. It's got its alliances, its partnership with Turkey which helped broker this deal. President Erdogan has said that President Putin might even travel to Istanbul next month. And it has that leverage over potential lifting of sanctions. It was just in the last week or so that the U.N. and the E.U. floated the idea of reconnecting Russia's agricultural bank to the Swift international payments network under this deal. So really, this leverage is very important to Moscow. It remains to be seen. Well, they'll come back in but Dimitri Peskov did say that if Russia feels that the concessions that it wants have been granted, it could reinstate the deal. So, it's still possible. Yes.",

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni, without question. It is a critical artery. It is the only one that connectsmainland Russia to the Crimean Peninsula. And now we have the roadway that is essentially out of service. There are still other options for the Russians to get supplies into both Crimea and into Ukraine. The railway that runs alongside the roadway that got blown up continues to function. And since the beginning of the war, the Russian occupation they did establish that land bridge from the northern part of the Crimean Peninsula all the way to Russian-occupied Donbas and then into Russia. So, they still have options but it could significantly cripple the efforts to get not just people across that bridge going for whatever reason into Crimea, military supplies, fuel and food. We are now quite remarkably, hearing a claim of responsibility by the Russian security services, the SBU, we don't often get a claim of responsibility from the Ukrainians when they carry out these more brazen attacks. Usually, they're rather coy. But today, the SBU actually posted online, the bridge is sleeping again. That's a reference to the attack on the same bridge just nine months ago at the time, they did not claim. Ukraine is saying that this was a joint operation between the SBU and the Ukrainian navy. They said they'll only offer details in a long time, essentially after the war. But the Russians are saying that this this explosion, these blasts were carried out by a surface or water drones, that it was in the pre-dawn hours around 3:00 in the morning. It could take quite some time for this roadway to get back up and running after the attack in October, it took several months for that road to reopen. This is not only a logistical headache for Russia. It is also a real symbolic attack. You know, President Putin takes very seriously the fact that Crimea, in his mind is part of Russia, which of course, Ukrainians reject. And so, it remains to be seen to what extent Russia will respond, how seriously they will take this, you know, for the logistical reasons but also because this is such a symbolic bridge. There this -- there was so much importance placed on this bridge that was years in the making, cost billions of dollars to build some 19-kilometer or 12 miles long. So, the question now is how do Vladimir Putin and the Russian military plan to respond to this extremely brazen attack by Ukraine. Eleni? Laney",

      "sentences": "All right. So, we're coming off of the warmest June ever across the globe. We had four continuous days where wehad the daily high temperature across the globe at its maximum. It never been that warm. So, we're seeing this trend, the climate crisis is now, it is our new normal breaking these records. And that is why we continuously talk about it. And this is just a bit of kind of eye candy for you. But you can really see right -- who's heating up the most lately? North America into North Africa, parts of the Mediterranean, throughout China and into the Middle East. That is where we've seen these record high temperatures. We spoke about China recording its highest temperature ever yesterday. But it wasn't just one location, it was five separate locations that saw temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius. That's roughly about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. So, just incredible heat. We're running five to 10 degrees Celsius, above average for these locations across China. It's not only China but it's also much of Europe as well. Specifically, across the Mediterranean from Rome to Athens, daytime highs are running. About 10 degrees Celsius above average. And by the way, that high in Rome today, 41, well, that's record-breaking territory. We're approaching that. We do have a bit of a cooling trend. But, you know, we're splitting hairs here. 38 degrees tomorrow, that is extremely hot. And in Athens where they closed the Acropolis because it was just simply too warm for tourists to visit that historical landmark. Across the southwestern U.S., our heat dome in essence trapping the incoming solar radiation from the sun. So, it's acting as a lid to keep those temperatures close to the surface of the Earth where we all live. And that is why we have over 80 million Americans under heat advisories. Now, this heat across the Southwest is much different than the heat across southern Florida where I was last week reporting on this very topic. The water temperatures here near record territory for Miami, Florida and the Florida Keys threatening the coral habitat across the area, but it's also helping impact the temperatures that they receive on land as well. So, a very humid, muggy heat across Miami and South Florida. But look at Phoenix, we have had 17 consecutive days where the mercury in the thermometer has climbed above 43 degrees and will likely break that again today. That is a streak. And it's the overnight lows that are concerned as well when we anticipate to actually get some reprieve from the warm weather. It doesn't happen. The overnight lows are staying well above average. So, we know with climate crisis heat waves. We have a direct connection between the amount of carbon dioxide that is polluted. So, it is imperative that with these discussions that John Kerry is having with Japan or with China at the moment, the two number one polluters across the planet have to come to some common ground here so we can move forward and solve this climate crisis.

It's not always this hot by any means. But it's not always the thought this long. But Italians and Spanish people and Greek people, they don't go outside during this time of the day. They don't drink, overdrink alcohol. They don't drink heavy meals. And that, of course are the things that tourists do. So that's the big contrast here. But we're still -- we're still hearing reports. Obviously, people are worried about the elderly, especially those who don't have access to air conditioning, which is quite a few people. It's not, you know, in every home by any means anywhere in Italy, any region in Italy. And so, you know, the health agencies are saying, you know, make sure you check on your elderly neighbors. Make sure that those people who are vulnerable with health conditions are OK. Bring them water, get their groceries, you know, don't make them go outside. So that's the kind of advice that residents are getting, the Italians are getting to take care of themselves. But again, you're not seeing Romans out here. The Spanish is up today. You know, these are tours here. These are tourists who have a couple of days in Rome, want to take advantage of it. Luckily have access to free water all over cold water all over the city. And, you know, but the weather is hot. I'll tell you firsthand and it's going to get hotter. Tomorrow is supposed to be even worse than we're looking at some relief coming. But even a relief in a Mediterranean summer, we're still talking about temperatures in the 30s. So, it's not by any means going to get cool anytime soon, Eleni.",

That led to a months-long crackdown on protesters and other forms of dissent described by Human Rights Watch as brute force. Salma Abdelaziz is connecting us this hour from London.

And that movement has faced months of suppression. That's led to hundreds of people being killed. That's according to rights groups. Some facing death by hanging just for protesting against the government. And now after months of not having the morality police on the streets as a result of those demonstrations, they are finally back on those streets.

These are images, I believe, just from Sunday of the police again, the morality police again, back on those streets. But if you take a close look at those images.

It is the only direct link between Russia itself and occupied Crimea. And if you can't use the bridge, it means you have to go all the way around back through other parts of occupied Ukraine and act -- in order to actually reach Crimea. The bridge is 12 miles long and that makes it the longest in Europe and it cost $3.7 billion to actually build it. And it's divided into two parts. One for rail traffic, the other for cars. And the Russians say that the rail part of the bridge remains intact and based on this video, that seems to be the case.
