Marjorie Taylor Greene once a McCarthy critic, now saying that she thinks it's a bad idea for someone to challenge McCarthy and that they need to unite behind McCarthy. But not everyone in the party feels the same way. Take a listen to what Congressman Matt Gaetz said on a podcast earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  Right now, there are a lot of the establishment Republicans in denial, believing that Kevin McCarthy can somehow still become speaker. What I'm here is tell you is there are definitely at least five people, actually a lot more than that, who would rather be waterboarded by Liz Cheney than vote for Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House, and I'm one of them.

What I do believe is that for our party to be successful going forward, especially given the results of Tuesday, and especially given the reasons why some people voted the way they voted, I think it's going to be really important for us to broaden our horizons and get beyond what I would call the core of the party and to start talking to a lot of those independents of which we have more every day, who are willing to hear us out.

Mitch would rather be leader than have a Republican majority. If there's a Republican who can win who is not going to support Mitch, the truth of the matter is he'd rather the Democrat win.

The majority in the Senate isn't even close if Mitch McConnell's Senate leadership fund doesn't raise and spend the amount of money to spend, including $30 million in Ohio. I think it's a little sour grape. I think it's a little sort of back seat driver, like, (inaudible) if only they had done that thing, I said that we should do, you know. To me, Mitch McConnell, you don't beat someone with nothing. Tom Cotton had a great quote this weekend. He said if you want to beat the man -- if you want to be the man, you got to beat the man. And the truth is, there's just not -- if it's a spare on the house side of people who want to run against McCarthy, my gosh, I mean, Rick Scott? Rick Scott is not going to get a majority of the Republican caucus to vote for him.

They won't get access to here. But the Justice Department, they're saying in this court filing today, there's about 3,000 documents that are not marked as classified that are in dispute that they're arguing over with Trump. And they're saying these are clearly presidential records. They're not personal records. They weren't gifts. They weren't clothing. They were things like documents created around the president for the president about the presidency, that it's just doesn't make sense, what Trump is arguing. And they point out that if Trump can't claim something as personal, then he wants to say if he loses, he wants to claim it as executive privilege. That doesn't make sense, either.

All that means is the president gets to take custody of those documents, but doesn't necessarily have to turn them over to the archives.It does not mean, however, those documents can never be seized by the FBI or can never be used against the person in a future criminal or civil proceeding. It doesn't immunize those records from being used against the person.
