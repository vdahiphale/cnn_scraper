      "sentences": "Behind all those headlines of tech layoffs, sour consumer confidence, inflation anxiety,it`s an economy showing resilience. Surprising strength in the economy in the third quarter, 2.9 percent annual growth from July through September, a sharp bounce back from a contraction in the first half of the year -- you know, it`s a pace that would have been considered very strong before the pandemic. The job market remains strong, too. Another 263,000 jobs added in November. It`s the fewest in months but it`s more than economist forecast. This year, a stunning 4.2 million jobs added. Stripping out the pandemic, it`s the most jobs added in years. And inflation, while still too hot, is showing signs of cooling. The fed`s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE price index showing signs of peaking, and gas prices are falling. They`re below where they were when Russia invaded Ukraine. Call it the yes-but economy. Yes, consumers feel like the economy is bad, but they keep spending. After all, it was a record Thanksgiving shopping season. So, why the foul mood and the sometimes conflicting headlines? Well, COVID broke the economy and putting it back together has been hard to measure. Remember tens of millions of jobs were lost overnight, schools closed, factories shuttered, more than a million lives lost. More than two years later, we`re still struggling to gauge the strength and durability of the recovery. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
