We've been relying on the heroic and courageous work of journalists inside Gaza who have been dying in record numbers in order to tell the stories of what's happening there.We were finally able to cross the Rafah border crossing from Egypt and get into southern Gaza. On Tuesday we traveled with a team of medical volunteers who are working at a field hospital that the United Arab Emirates, the UAE, has recently set up. Already this hospital is almost at capacity. They are being inundated with patients who are flooding in from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip that have simply stopped functioning. And within moments of us arriving there for this visit there was a big strike nearby, casualties were brought in. I want to play you just an excerpt of our story that will be playing throughout the day. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They brought in a man who had lost his leg and a 13-year-old boy who was moaning in agony, John, who also had lost his leg. And they said this is what we are dealing with every single day, amputees, people dying, people being crushed. And they are doing everything that they can.

In other words, they have been dumb bombs. They are far less precise than guided munitions and they also pose a greater risk of civilian harm to people on the ground there.And this is really significant because the Israelis have made a point to say that they are doing everything that they can to minimize civilian harm on the ground in Gaza and the U.S. has also come out and said that they believe that the Israelis have the intention of trying to protect the civilians as they undergo their operations in Gaza. But experts that we spoke to said that the fact that Israel is using these unprecise, these unguided munitions, roughly 40 to 45 percent of the 29,000 munitions Israel has dropped on Gaza have been these unguided dumb bombs really undercuts the Israeli argument that they are doing everything that they possibly can to try to protect civilians. It is important also to note that, look, precision guided munitions are not perfect either. But in a densely, densely populated area like Gaza, every kind of precise munition that you can use matters because missing a target by a few feet can really determine whether someone lives or dies. And so the White House is saying that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is, of course, in Israel today and tomorrow meeting with counterparts, he is going to be focused, among other things, on emphasizing to the Israelis that they need to be more surgical and precise in their operations in Gaza. Here's what the White House said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's that this isn't just about the caucuses or the primary elections. This is about the general election.

And while you can talk about the numbers and John just mentioned some of the good economic barometers, the numbers might be good but the perception of the economy is not good. And voters' perception trumps everything else. And when you have six, seven and ten Americans feel they're not better off economically than they were four years ago, that's going to have an impact. And they say, many of them, trust a Republican candidate on the economy more than they do a Joe Biden and the Democrats. And that's going to be a very important and difficult hill for Joe Biden to climb. And it's another component of that is how they tell this. It's -- you can't just tell people things are great. You have to say, I understand how you are feeling, but this is what we are going to do to try and turn things around. And that's the most important thing they can do messaging wise because with all of the other things going on, look at immigration, foreign policy, safety and security, pocketbook issues are top of mind for voters, especially as we're heading into the Iowa caucuses just over 30 days away.",

Obviously, the Sununu endorsement is the best one to get in New Hampshire. We don't know what that effect will be yet.But we know that also Donald Trump's campaign is concerned and that Donald Trump likes to punch down. I'd argue that what we saw last night, we saw Donald Trump attacking Nikki Haley more than we've seen Nikki Haley go after Donald Trump in this campaign thus far. And so many times we've seen Donald Trump get indicted and two weeks - two weeks later wonder why the polls haven't moved. The polls didn't move because Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeSantis and most other Republicans running against Donald Trump in theory instead of in practice reinforce Donald Trump's messaging. If you don't give voters a place to go, they're not going to go anywhere. And we're getting to this point where we're sort of running out of time now. We're talking about the Iowa caucus as far - being as far away in the number of days, not really the number of weeks, and certainly not in months now. We're getting to crunch time.
