What does that mean? Kate is off today. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. This is CNN News Central.Just moments ago, Trump employee Carlos De Oliveira walked out of a federal court. He was arraigned that a number of charges in the Trump classified documents probe. You're looking at this video that we're just getting in of him leaving. Officials accused him of trying to delete security camera video at Mar-a-Lago after the Justice Department's subpoena that footage last year. He says Trump wanted the server deleted.

      "sentences": "Hey there, John. Yes, this was our first look at Carlos De Oliveira as he appeared and showed up for his appearance here in court this morning in Miami. He arrived in a navy blue suit and a tie. And once he got inside the courtroom, he sat and huddled with his attorney who's Washington D.C. based John Irving. He was also surrounded by a handful of U.S. marshals who hovered over him during this court appearance.The judge asked him very early on to stand at the lectern and state his name. He said good morning. He said his name. The judge read the charges against him. He told them that he had the right to remain silent, made sure that he understood that. And he had his -- had the right to talk to a lawyer. The judge did release him. He is not on bond -- he is not being held. As you saw he did leave the courtroom. He was released on $100,000 bond. That is a personal signature bond, John. His lawyer said that he did not certainly didn't have the money to put that up. But the judge said he doesn't actually have to pay that right now. We also learned from him that he does have a passport, which has expired. The judge gave him 48 hours to turn that over. His travel is restricted to South Florida without permission. Otherwise, he can't go anywhere else without permission. And he also can't have any communication with any witnesses I.D.'d by the government. The government did give his attorney a list of those people that he cannot talk to. There is an arraignment date set for him. That is when he will officially enter a plea. That is now set for August 10th in Fort Pierce, so he will have to get a Florida based attorney to do that. That is why they had to put off the arraignment because he needs a Florida attorney who is barred in this state in order to enter a plea for him. So of course all eyes are watching this now because with his case delayed and the arraignment now pushed to August 10th that could mean that the case against Donald Trump in this same Mar-a-Lago documents case could be delayed. Of course there are a lot of questions about whether or not that trial will occur before Election Day. One other note just briefly on how we got here. There is now a fourth employee who CNN has identified as Yuscil Taveras, a lot of the reason apparently, that these new allegations came was because of him. He's an I.T. worker at Mar-a- Lago. And this is the man who, apparently allegedly according to the indictment, Carlos De Oliveira asked to meet him in the audio closet, asked him about the security camera tapes, asked him how long the footage stays on the server told him the boss wants that server deleted. Apparently CNN sources telling CNN, sources telling CNN that it was his information, it was Taveras's information that he gave to investigators and FBI agents that led to these additional allegations against the former president, his aide Walt Nauta, and now Carlos De Oliveira.

Thank you, John.Just in the CNN, a Fulton County judge has rejected efforts by Donald Trump's legal team to disqualify the district attorney leading the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. The judge also rejected a request to throw out evidence gathered in that probe. The ruling comes as DA Fani Willis is warning local officials to stay vigilant ahead of her announcement on a possible indictment. CNN's Sara Murray is joining us now from Atlanta.

We are definitely on the precipice of Fani Willis to announce who if anyone is going to face charges as part of this case. One of the things that was looming out there is this challenge by Donald Trump's attorneys to have her disqualified from the case and have all of the evidence from a special purpose Grand Jury which heard from more than 75 witnesses thrown out.So a judge here in Fulton County ruled today that he was not going to do this, essentially saying this is pre-indictment. If Donald Trump is charged, if others are charged, they will have an opportunity to challenge the special Grand Jury, the way the evidence was gathered, but that time is not now. There was another judge who was planning to weigh in on this issue on August 10th because the Trump team did not want a Fulton County Judge hearing that matter. We'll see if that hearing still takes place. The judge in ruling today said that should be moved. But again, it comes as we are already starting to see increased security precautions here around the courthouse, barricades going up behind me. And we heard from Fani Willis who are affiliate over the weekend that she says basically her investigation is wrapped up and she's ready to go with whatever her announcements are going to be.
