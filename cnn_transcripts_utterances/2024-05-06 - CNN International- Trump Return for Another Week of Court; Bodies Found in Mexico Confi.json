If you're just joining us here are our top stories today.Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting with French and EU leaders today on the first stop of his European tour. The six-day trip will also include stops in Serbia and Hungary. Ceasefire talks involving Israel and Hamas in Cairo have stalled but haven't ended. This as Israel urges people to evacuate from eastern Rafah. More than a million Palestinian refugees have fled there from the fighting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no amount of international pressure to change tactics will stop Israel from defending itself. Netanyahu spoke at a Holocaust Remembrance Day event where he compared what happened during World War II to what's happening today. Now, just hours from now Donald Trump will be back in a New York courtroom for the start of the fourth week of his historic criminal trial. The former U.S. president has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Daniels is a potential witness for the prosecution but they've been tight-lipped over who they might call to the stand next. CNN's Zachary Cohen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "A new witness will take the stand on Monday when the hush money trial of former president Donald Trump resumes. While it remains unclear who will be called to testify next, we're still waiting to hear from several key witnesses including the adult actress at the center of the trial Stormy Daniels and Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen.The trial picks back up after Friday's testimony from one of Trump's former key advisors Hope Hicks. Hicks sat feet away from Trump as she described the 2016 fallout from the Access Hollywood tape and the Trump campaign's response to stories about hush money payments. Testimony from Hicks really set the stage for witnesses who have direct knowledge of Trump's alleged role in this scheme to keep Stormy Daniels quiet ahead of the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records stemming from how he allegedly hid the way Michael Cohen was reimbursed for paying $130,000 to Daniels. Hicks testified last week that she did not believe the story that Cohen had paid the money on his own and she said that Trump was glad he did not have to deal with the stories about hush money payments coming out until after the 2016 election. Now Trump White House aides, Trump organization employees, Daniels and Michael Cohen are all still on deck for prosecutors to call. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's latest Poll of Polls shows no clear leader in the presidential race at the moment. 47 percent of voters favor Trump while 46 support Biden. The Poll of Polls includes four of the most recent national polls.Panama's electoral authority says Jose Raul Mulino is the unofficial winner of the presidential election there based on preliminary results. With most of the votes counted he's leading his closest rival by about 10 percentage points. The right-wing former public servant moved to the top of his party's ticket after his running mate was disqualified. Mulino has vowed to shut down Darien Gap, the treacherous stretch of jungle that's become a main highway for migrants heading to the U.S. Panama is struggling with many thorny issues including corruption, high inflation and a stagnating economy.

Two are Australian citizens, one is a U.S. citizen.In a previous statement, reporters also on Sunday out of Tijuana, Andrade had told the reporters that she believed that the three tourists had been killed as part of a car robbery gone wrong. MARIA ELENA ANDRADE, STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO (through translator): The aggression to these three people, a regrettable attack, had no relation to being surfers. They were killed because they were there at the wrong moment when they wanted to steal the vehicle, a pickup. We have not established that there was any knowledge that they were foreigners.",

More than 165,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Larry Madowo joins us from Nairobi.

      "sentences": "That's the forecast, Max, but I want to show you the impact of the two months of rain on one of Kenya's most exclusive neighborhoods. Where I'm standing, you see the water up to my knees, is actually part of -- this used to be a wall. This is a broken down wall from past flooding, but I want to show you across the wall over the other side because that courtyard is completely flooded and the water is higher than my entire height and I'm 5'9\", so that is no small feat.This is one of Nairobi's most exclusive neighborhoods. These are high- end properties, mansions, fancy hotels. We're just a few hundred meters from the U.N. office in Nairobi and that is what you see over there. That's the reality of the flooding that Kenya has been seeing over this past two months. So I'm just going to walk over across the road because that water is coming from that compound across the road. This road is officially closed, but that does not stop people from using it all the same because this is one of the easier ways to get to where they're going instead of getting rerouted. But this is a reality of the flooding and that is why so many roads are getting closed, so many people are getting evacuated. The government last Friday ordering people to move. Mandatory evacuations for places what they consider to be in fragile ecosystems likely to flood. They identified 178 different dams that are either full or near full that they ordered people to move. And this morning when because of six hours of rain overnight they closed this road but that's as you can see people are still using it avoiding that government intervention and risking their lives. There have been cases where people have been swept away in their cars, in their motorbikes, in their bicycles because of something like this. Disobeying that government guidance and going through it anyway not knowing how deep the water is or if there's any sudden change in the currents or anything of the sort. But this is the reality of flooding across the country. This is why so far 228 people have been killed across the country. That is danger. I didn't know how deep this is. 228 people have been killed across the country. More than 160,000 people are displaced and the forecast according to President William Ruto is that there will still going to be more rain throughout this month possibly into next month. So the damage could be even more significant. We saw for instance in western Kenya on Sunday River Nyando bursting its banks leading to flooding the town of Ahero and the neighborhoods there. People were marooned. The Kenya Wildlife Service had to use helicopters to evacuate some people. The county government of Kisumu are pleading for help because they now have a few hundred more people who are displaced. That is the reality across the country where the government has set up more than a hundred different sites to take care of people who are displaced. Schools have been postponed indefinitely. Public schools across the country will not be opening until further notice according to the government just to make sure that learners are safe. In the meantime people risking their lives all the time just trying to use the quickest ways to get where they're going -- Max.",

Some areas have already exceeded their average May rainfall in the first five days of the month. Search and rescue teams in Texas continue to scour areas flooded by days of heavy rain. Hundreds of people more than 150 pets have been rescued. Some areas received two months worth of rain in just five days. Now eight rivers are in major flood stage and more than a third of the state's counties are under disaster declarations. The high water has prompted mandatory evacuations forcing thousands of people from their homes but despite the threat some refuse to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT.

Thank you so much for joining us. It's an interesting point that isn't it, that Kristie's making. Is this a not so subtle way of China really creating or exploiting divides amongst Western allies? NICHOLAS BEQUELIN, SR. FELLOW, YALE LAW SCHOOL'S FAUL TSAI CHINA CENTER: Oh absolutely. I mean the message that Xi Jinping is sending by choosing these three countries to go to Europe, his first trip since the pandemic, since Russia's invasion, is threefold. I go to France, the most powerful country in the EU at the moment, to show other countries in Europe that they should treat me the way that France has treated me. They give me a great reception and they want to do business, they want to cooperate, they're not on the American line, that China is dangerous, so please treat me in the same way. Then he goes to Serbia to commemorate the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy during the Balkan War in '99, which the Americans say was a mistake, but the Chinese never believed this. And then he goes to Hungary, which is the biggest headache for the European Union and the actor that really prevents the European Union to reach common decisions and keep effectively the EU divided. So this is really a power move from Xi Jinping, showing that he wants to deal with the European Union, he wants things to stay in the same way, he doesn't want Europe to de-risk, but the trade and the relationship has to be on China's terms.",
