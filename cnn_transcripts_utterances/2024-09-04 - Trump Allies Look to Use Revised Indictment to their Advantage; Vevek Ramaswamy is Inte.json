Donald Trump holding an outside the margin of error lead in Arizona. And according to likely voters surveyed by CNN, the candidates are essentially tied in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada. This comes as the Trump campaign has also just put out a new memo saying that they are the team that has the momentum now 60 plus days out from the election. Let's talk about that. Joining us right now is former Republican presidential candidate, and Trump campaign surrogate, Vivek Ramaswamy. Thank you so much for coming in. It's good to see you. So, the campaign memo also makes clear that part of the strategy right now is to continue to try to define Kamala Harris as extreme and radical. If you take a look inside this new polling from CNN of likely voters in these battleground states, though, the - what - what likely voters are saying is that is not yet working, showing the way we - the way we see it - the way the numbers show it is, showing voters largely described Harris' views and policies as mainstream and Trump's as too extreme across these states. About half in each state saying Trump's views and policies or so extreme they pose a threat to the country, while around four in ten say the same about Harris' position. A lot of numbers, but the point being, is it - does it - if voters don't agree with the extreme - kind of the extreme narrative against Trump, do you think team Trump should be shifting now? Against Harris, sorry. VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I actually disagree - I - I respectfully disagree with your characterization there in one important way, which is that voters have not yet been exposed, principally by the media, to what Kamala Harris' past positions actually are. I don't blame the voters. They've been served up a new version if Kamala Harris, where she is running to the center on economic and social policies. But the reality is, if we're able to use Kamala Harris' own words against her, as I believe we should. She ran for president favoring a tax on unrealized capital gains, favoring an abolition, her words, to abolish private health insurance, a ban on fracking, bans on offshore drilling. These are the kinds of policies that absolutely are not mainstream for most Americans. And this is where I do think the debate will be useful. I do think that greater media scrutiny of Kamala Harris, hopefully with more sit- down interviews than we've had so far, will be helpful. Say what you will. You may or may not agree with Donald Trump. He and J.D. Vance have sat for tens of interviews, as have other members of the campaign and surrogate team. The reality is, we haven't seen the same from Kamala Harris. I do expect that's going to change in the next couple of months. And I believe voters are going to be very well-informed heading into November.",

She said she didn't favor a ban on fracking now. The reality is, she was one of the strongest proponents of that ban, so much so that when she was in California, she sued the Obama administration over granting fracking permits. She didn't just favor the abolition of private health insurance. She was a co-sponsor of the bill with Bernie Sanders as a U.S. senator for Medicare for all for Americans.The reality is, when you think about the green new deal, she was the chief proponent, not just as a co-sponsor of the legislation, but going further and saying she would end the filibuster in the Senate to ram that through. So, the reality is, she can say what she wants to say now. Those are actions she has taken. Is someone allowed to evolve? Of course they are. But she deserves to explain exactly why she's changed those positions, exactly what her position is. If it's not a ban on fracking, what exactly is it? What exactly is her health care plan if she no longer favors abolishing private health insurance, which just four short years ago when she ran for president she did. And that's the kind of scrutiny that's been missing. I think Donald Trump has received plenty of scrutiny, and I give credit to him for sitting for hostile interviews that Kamala Harris has not.

And I know you know that, Kate. This ballot measure would, though its vague crafting, would allow abortions far after six weeks, arguably under the interpretation of some legal scholars, all the way up to the point of birth. He's against that, and that's been a consistent position as well. So, I do think this attempt by Democrats, and its politics so you'd expected it, to conflate an opposition to a six-week ban with somehow being in favor of a ballot measure that actually would allow for far more than that is, I think, sophistry.

At least that's what the current science says.Now, I will point out again something that we talked about yesterday, that the vast majority of people, about 80 percent of people who do get West Nile may not know they ever had it. They just don't have symptoms, so they don't have very significant symptoms. In a - in a rare percentage of people, they can develop these severe symptoms, which are significant headache, they can develop fever, they can develop body aches, vomiting, things like that.

The man says he could feel his SUV floating in the water. That happened in San Antonio. And he says three other cars were also stranded. Firefighters tethered a rope and pulled him to safety.

Thank you both for being here. I'm going to start with you, General Hertling. I want to start with Ukraine. What does it tell you - we're learning today that about a half a dozen senior figures have tendered their resignations. There's a huge government shakeup in Ukraine. The - really the biggest since Russia invaded the country. What does this signal? GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I believe it signals that President Zelenskyy is looking to refresh his cabinet. You've got to consider, Sara, that these individuals, especially Mr. Kuleba, who's the minister of the interior, has been at - have been at their posts for about four years now. That's a typical time for a refreshment. And they're burnt out. I mean this is fatiguing. They've been at war for two-and-a-half years, over two-and-a-half years. They've been continually working to support the Ukrainian people and the territorial and sovereignty of Ukraine. So, I just think it's Mr. Zelenskyy saying, we need some fresh eyes, some fresh years. This is typical for a, I think, an administration, especially one that's at war.",

Yes, there's been the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk and the Russian military has responded about as quickly as it normally does. Forces are headed that way to try to push those forces out.But also, Putin has begun to take advantage rhetorically of that Kursk incursion by saying, look, we've been telling you all along that the Ukrainians, backed by NATO, are a threat to Russia. And that is something that he uses to bolster his popularity at home. And from the material point of view, Russia has supplies from North Korea and from Iran and is also backed by dual use supplies from China. So, Putin can wait this out and wait possibly for a Trump presidency where he thinks he's going to have a friendly White House.",
