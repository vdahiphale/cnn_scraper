And with travel back at near pre-pandemic levels, the nation's airports are packed this weekend with millions of holiday travelers. And TSA officials are saying that tomorrow's numbers could be record breaking. Here's CNN Pete Muntean.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): We are in a short lived air travel law but it's all about to come roaring back the Sunday after Thanksgiving when everybody begins coming home all at once. The TSA screened 1.4 million people at airports across the country on Thanksgiving Day. It's the lowest number we've seen since February. But look at the day before 2.4 6 million people screened by the TSA at airports nationwide. That number only six percent off of the same day back in 2019 before the pandemic and just shy of a pandemic era air travel record. Now the question is, Will Sunday hit a pandemic error record and couldn't hit the all time air travel record when the TSA screen 2.8 million people at airports nationwide the Sunday after Thanksgiving back in 2019. I asked TSA Administrator David Pekoske if that's a real possibility this time around.",

And despite inflation driving prices up, consumers were out in full force hunting, as they do for the best deals. The National Retail Federation expects more than 166 million Americans will shop this weekend. That's an increase of about eight million over 2021. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is at Herald Square in front of the Macy's in New York City. Gloria, what are you seeing? What are people telling you? GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Well, Alex, I don't know if you're anything like me. I wait until the very last minute to do my holiday shopping. But there are millions of Americans who are out in force this weekend. And they're getting that holiday shopping started this weekend after Thursday, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, all the way through Monday. And we have been standing here in front of Macy's all morning. Macy's opened its doors around 10:00 a.m. And people were gathered out front waiting to get in. Now on Saturday alone, the National Retail Federation is estimated more than 66 -- 60 million people I should say, 60 million people will be out there shopping. And they're also noting an increase in the amount of people that will be shopping in store. Obviously, post pandemic that is a significant difference both for big business and small business. Today is small business Saturday. 67 percent of shoppers expect to do their shopping in person. Another big increase from the previous year. And I've been speaking to people here and asking them about what you raised at the beginning, which is of course the economy very much in the back of people's minds as they're going through their shopping list, buying those gifts and looking for sales.

The search began Thursday after the man sister reported him missing off of the Carnival Cruise Ship that they had been on. CNN's Nadia Romero joins us now. Nadia, what more are you learning about the rescue and how this man is doing?NADIA ROMERO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well Alex, you would think after all of that time that he likely wouldn't survive. And so, this was something that one Coast Guard member called a Thanksgiving miracle to be able to not only find this man, but find him alive. And you can just see him kind of bobbing in and out of the water. They're hoping that someone will see him. So let's back this up. This was supposed to be a family vacation on a Carnival Cruise to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. But it was Thanksgiving Day that the 28-year-old man's sister told crews authorities I haven't seen my brother in hours and so they started looking for him. Then they reached out to the Coast Guard it became this all hands on deck search with boats and helicopters and airplanes. Finally, to find this man, I want you to hear from the Coast Guard who explains why we should never underestimate the will to live. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. SETH GROSS, SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION COORDINATOR, U.S. COAST GUARD: I'll be honest with you, you know, 17-year career, this case is unlike anything I've been a part of.

Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated.Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten were killed and nine were injured at a fire in an apartment building. Most parts of Xinjiang have been in lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos, now censored in China, showed COVID lockdown measures likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. State media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it was blocked with fences and tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. The video also shows smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failed to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely. The fire really struck a chord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food, daily necessities, and emergency care in lockdown. Three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests, which are normally rare in authoritarian China. Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory this week.

They would get that win by two goals.It was extra special for revered Polish striker, the veteran Robert Lewandowsky, who finally gets his first ever World Cup goal. The 34- year-old, who is a ruthless predator in front of goal, when it comes to putting the ball in the back of the net, in domestic club competition. And now Barcelona. And the emotion so high on the face. You could see him fighting back the tears. Look at those images. His teammates, the whole squad piling on top of him because they knew exactly how much that meant to him. Lewandowsky, Alex, with his first ever FIFA World Cup goal. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, college football fans know how fierce this rivalry is, especially with Michigan and Ohio State coming into this game undefeated.But this is a friendly wager between the two governors. It's one that is in keeping with tradition. Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer inquired about running last year's wager back this year on Twitter. She put some skin in the game with some of Detroit's delicacies, including Buddy's Pizza and a case Vernor's ginger ale. Ohio's Mike DeWine offered up pizza, root bear and cream puffs from several well-known Ohio stops. You'll notice there's no \"M\"s in the tweet. That is by design. You will not see any of those from Ohio States and their fan base before this game, especially with a chance to all but clinch a playoff spot on the line. Whoever wins, it's a virtual loss, the losers has to hope for a little bit of chaos in order to squeeze into the field. But maybe some comfort food for the governors will help, depending who comes out on top. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
