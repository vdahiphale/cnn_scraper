Israel's war cabinet has just wrapped up its fifth meeting in three days after Iran's unprecedented aerial assault over the weekend. An Israeli official has said the government was reviewing both diplomatic and military options. Meantime, a fresh snag in hostage ceasefire talks Hamas has halved the number of Israeli hostages it says it is willing to release as part of the first phase of any potential deal. A U.S. official tells CNN, Hamas is now offering to release just 20 as opposed to the 40 long expected by Israel and the U.S. Well, for its part Egypt very much entangled in the crisis in the region, both geographically of course and diplomatically. A key player in ongoing hostage ceasefire talks is now urging restraint from both Israel and Iran as Tehran threatens any country in the region that supports Israel in its response to Saturday's aerial assaults. Earlier today, I asked Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry what his message to both countries is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

As you know, Secretary of State Blinken talking about efforts that the U.S. has been working on. You've got the German foreign minister, who's in Jordan, who's coming here to Israel tomorrow.

Today, the work continues to try to seat a jury, who will weigh those 34 charges against him. Dozens of potential jurors are already out after telling the judge on Monday, when asked, that they did not feel they could be impartial in deciding the case.

I think more dangerous is the issue of violating the gag order. As you know, Erica, there'll be a hearing next week to reach an assessment as to whether or not he did that, who did what. The president, former president, in talking about Michael Cohen and other witnesses, violated the gag order, which says you can't do that. We live in an era where people could be really subject to great danger in the event that they're savaged by a person with a bully pulpit like that. So what'll be interesting to see of me, is when next week they have the hearing, whether the judge holds him accountable -- that is Mr. Trump -- and how the judge holds him accountable. Is it simply a reprimand, is it a fine? Is it imprisonment? And between now and then, what else does the president do? And so anything the president does, former president, he's got to be careful of. And remember, he could testify. And if he says something and it's fair game for prosecutors to cross-examine him on some of the things he said. And the reason I mentioned that, Erica, last point, and that's because in the event the president testifies and he lies, that goes to the issue of sentencing. Judges do not like people lying on the witness stand. Many people believing, oh, it's just a probationary case. Sure.

I mean, if he continues to do it, the judge is going to have to think about very serious measures against him.",
