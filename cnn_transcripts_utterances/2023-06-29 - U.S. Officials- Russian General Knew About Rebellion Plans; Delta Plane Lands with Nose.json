I'm Christine Romans.The U.S. officials say a former top Russian commander in Ukraine had advanced knowledge of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's plans to revolt. General Sergei Surovikin is suspected of helping plan the events of last weekend. Officials say there are also signs other Russian generals may have supported the rebellion, which raises questions about Putin's support inside of the top ranks. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is attempting to portray himself as retaining popular support. You can see him there, greeting crowds in a rare public appearance on Wednesday. He flew to the majority Muslim city of Derbent to mark the Islamic holiday of Eid, where he took a tour, kissed fans and post for selfies. Putin is also expected to deliver remarks in just about one hour. CNN's Clare Sebastian, live in London with more for us. You know, it's been a while since we have seen him out there, literally shaking hands. We are seeing quite a lot of Putin since the armed insurrection. That's on purpose.",

He made several public remarks, those events at the Kremlin commemorated the air force pilots who were killed in Prigozhin's armed rebellions, the Dagestan visit, now speaking at a tech and digital conference we understand.But Dagestan visit was unusual. This is really an un-Putin behavior based what we see in the past couple of years there, actual, physical contact, a stark contrast about long table that he would usually sit at, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. So they are perhaps, an element here of counter-programming to the support that we saw for Wagner in Rostov, cheering crowds on that street as the forces left that city, perhaps there is a concern that Prigozhin himself into a popular support among the Russian people, so the Kremlin is trying to get out in front of that. As they try to make it look like nothing happened, they are also having to deal with these reports of complicity in the top ranks of the Russian military, with what Prigozhin did. The Kremlin calling the New York Times reporting, suggesting that Sergei Surovikin, a high ranking general, former operations in Ukraine, knew what Prigozhin was doing. They called it speculation, and gossip. But there are suggestions from certain highly watched Russian military bloggers, that armed forces in Russia are now being heavily scrutinized for any signs of support for Prigozhin and things like that. Having said, that unlike Putin who has perhaps been out more than usual, we have seen no signs of General Surovikin since he made a video appeal to Prigozhin in the early hours Saturday, stopping's advance on Moscow. We've seen no signs of General Gerasimov head of the armed forces, and we still do not have actual visual evidence of the whereabouts of Yevgeny Prigozhin, supporting the claim with Lukashenko head of Belarus that he is in that country -- Christine.",

They recover these remains and they'll say that the United States medical professionals will conduct a formal analysis of those presumed human remains. And of course family and friends of those five passengers who died on the Titan. They will be comforted by this, but will also feel again profound grief. Given what the U.S. coast guard says was an implosion of the titan submersible. What is also happening now is that on Wednesday, the horizon arctic retrieved debris, in fact large pieces of debris. They said that they had finished their work out there at the site of the Titanic wreck. And what is extraordinary is that they did in fact recover large pieces of that debris. You can see that they have the dome with the view port, and a good chunk even of the passenger frame. Again, that issue here is the carbon fiber material that was used to hold those passengers, and was used in this kind of deep sea exploration. U.S. Coast Guard says that now they will begin in to examine all of it. And they have many investigations underway, including here in Canada. That investigation expected to take well over a year.

      "sentences": "Over the past several weeks, there has been an uptick in activity in the special counsel's investigation into January 6. In recent weeks, investigators sat down with Rudy Giuliani, who is representing former President Trump, and helping him file a lot of challenges to overturn the 2020 election.Now, Giuliani had previously been subpoenaed back in November by the Justice Department, looking specifically for information about any payments that he received when he was filing those challenges. But then once Jack Smith took over the probe, Giuliani did not hear anything for over six months, according to sources. It's notable that he has sat down for what is described as a voluntary interview, but usually, when it takes investigators that long to reach out to you, it suggests that you could potentially be a target in a probe, and not just a witness. At this point, it is unclear if Giuliani will be charged. Investigators on Wednesday also spoke with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Now, Raffensperger is a key witness in an alleged campaign to try to pressure the state of Georgia to overturn their election results. He had a now infamous January 2021 call with the then President Trump, who was urging him to find additional votes to try to overturn the state's election results. Now, Raffensperger certainly not expected to be a target, but absolutely a key witness as the state pressure campaign is just one of the many aspects around the January six that Jack Smith is investigating. So, it appears he is getting closer to possible charging decisions, potentially even, by the end of the summer. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROMANS:  All right, Paula. Thank you for that. Let's bring in Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney. Good morning, friend.

And then, of course, when you look at the Georgia secretary of state, in terms of his knowledge, with respect to the phone call, with regards to the pressure campaign, exacted by Trump upon him to find votes, it certainly means to me that the special counsel now is pivoting towards this investigation. I think the sense of urgency, and of course we know the timeline, as we certainly have a robust primary coming about, that I think we will see some activity.

I mean, if the Supreme Court ultimately decides whether the Biden administration had the authority, whether Congress intended for them to have the authority, it could be problematic. Before we get to the merits, Christine, there is so much about whether or not the party is suing Biden, or even having the ability to sue.
