      "sentences": "Welcome everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez in New York.We're going to begin with breaking news in Syria, where 50 years of authoritarian rule by the Assad family is quickly crumbling. Rebel forces have entered the capital of Damascus. And the rebels are celebrating after declaring Damascus free and claiming President Bashar al-Assad has fled the city. They say they're preparing to take over state media offices to broadcast their victory. Now a source tells CNN that the Syrian military there has fallen as well, as Syria's Prime Minister says the government is ready to, quote, \"cooperate with any leadership the people choose.\" Rebels have been sweeping through the country since launching an offensive last week. They claim to have captured four cities in a single day before reaching the capital. That includes the third largest city, Homs. Now Syrians were seen tearing down and setting fire to posters of Assad. Rebels say senior Assad regime officials are preparing to defect in the capital as well. We're also seeing reports of Syrian soldiers fleeing the country and going to Iraq. And the White House says it's closely monitoring these fast-moving developments and staying in touch with regional partners. There's a lot of developments this hour that we are continuing to monitor. I want to bring in Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi. Paula, what can you tell us, what is the latest that we are seeing, again, in this very fast-moving situation right now?",

      "sentences": "Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi, thank you so much for catching us up to speed.I want to expand this conversation now, bring in CNN Analyst and Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, who joins us now from Washington. Colonel, as you listen to Paula as well, obviously these updates and these developments are incredibly fast-moving right now. But can you just give us the significance of what the reverberations here are going to be with the end, potentially, of an Assad regime in a place like Syria? What happens next? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (Ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, that's a great question, Omar. One of the key things is the entire structure of the state is either going to evaporate or it's going to become part of what the rebels will use to control the population themselves. And that includes the intelligence services. So one of the key pillars of the Assad regime was their intelligence system, which was a very thorough, brutal, almost Soviet-style system. And that is something that's going to be interesting to see how the HTS and other rebel forces deal with that. The other aspect of this, of course, is on the international side of things. And each of the neighboring countries, you know, whether it's Israel or Lebanon or Iraq to the east or Turkey to the north or Jordan to the south, each of them is going to have to figure out exactly what their relationship with Syria is. And all of them have had a history with Syria, some of it good, some of it bad. And in the case of Israel, mostly bad. But that is something where, in many cases, those relationships might not change that much. But they are going to definitely be something that's going to change a bit with the advent of a new regime in Syria. So then the next factor, of course, is which group will actually control most of Syria's territory. Is it going to be HTS? That is a possible scenario, a very likely scenario. But they've got other groups. You know, right now it's a coalition of the willing, basically, that's going after the Assad regime and has been very successful in doing so. But the remnants of the Assad regime are in the western, northwestern part of the country. And then, of course, you have the Kurdish forces in the northeast. So those are things that are going to have to be worked out if Syria is to remain a unified country. So there is a possibility that Syria may come apart in some ways at this juncture. But it's going to take a while for that to materialize. There's also going to be a degree of consolidation that HTS probably will lead in the areas that it controls directly, and it will try to, I think, work with some of the other groups that they've formed a coalition with in order to have as much strength as possible, at least in the middle and northern parts of the country.",

      "sentences": "And as you've been speaking about them, HTS, Hayat Tahrir al- Sham, they have sort of been the leaders of the opposition groups that have formed really over a number of different factions. So, of course, working together to seize power from Assad is one thing. Finding ways to lead among a number of groups that have differences but united for this cause is something else entirely.But I do want to track some of the progress that we saw them make really quickly. I mean, it was just a week and a half ago we were starting to see reports of rebel forces clashing with government forces, taking certain parts of cities, taking Aleppo, for example. And then that offensive seemed to rapidly escalate and accelerate. Are you surprised at the pace with which these rebel forces were able to move from city to city to city, and then, of course, here to the capital in Damascus?",

      "sentences": "And Colonel, before you go, I want to get your take on a bit of reporting that we're just getting in. One U.S. official told CNN that what is happening is the collapse of, quote, \"Iran's artifice\" across the Middle East. Hezbollah and Hamas have been decimated. Now Assad's regime has collapsed.I wonder what your take is on that. Do you see this collapse as -- as an indictment of Iran's influence and even Russia's as well in the region?",

      "sentences": "To a certain extent, it certainly is that. And I remember when I first went to the Middle East as far back as the 1980s, and we observed a lot of activity even back then between Iran and Syria.Now, that relationship up until this point, at least, had become a quite strong relationship. But the problem that the Iranians have is that each one of their allies or proxies in the case of Hezbollah and Hamas, and of course, in the case of Syria now. Each one of those has been irreparably weakened and become useless to them from an international bridge standpoint. And as far as the Russians are concerned, it remains to be seen exactly what arrangements HTS or whichever successor regime comes into place in Syria, which what kind of arrangements they make for the bases, the two bases that the Russians have in the western part of Syria. But that presence has also been weakened and they certainly did nothing to support Assad. And that very fact makes it very difficult for them to continue to exercise leverage over the rest of the Middle East or even beyond that. So this is a serious blow to both Iran and to Russia.",

We're going to continue on with the breaking news in Syria, rebel forces there say the capital, Damascus, is now free and that President Bashar al-Assad has fled the city.Now, the Prime Minister says the government stands ready to, quote, \"cooperate with any leadership the people choose.\" And this was the scene in Damascus a short time ago. The video is set to show rebels troops firing into the air in celebration and the rebels say they're moving to capture state media offices to broadcast their victory announcement over Assad. Rebels have been sweeping through the country since launching an offensive last week. They claim to have captured four cities in a single day before reaching the capital. You can see a sense of how quickly they have moved in the amount of territory they've captured on this map here. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is also weighing in on the escalating situation in Syria, posting on social media that the United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved. But he also criticized the Obama administration for failing to enforce the 2013 red line, which stated that Syria's use of chemical weapons would mean U.S. military action. Now, the President-elect also said that the ouster of Bashar al-Assad might be good for Russia because there is no benefit for Moscow in supporting Syria. So a lot to keep up with here. I want to go now to Los Angeles, where I'm joined live by Kim Ghattas. She is a contributing writer for \"The Atlantic\" and the author of Black Wave, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the 40- year rivalry that unraveled culture, religion and collective memory in the Middle East. Kim, thank you for being here. I want to start with a bit of news that we got in a little while ago because I think it's pertinent to some of what you've written about, a U.S. official telling CNN that what's happening in right now is the collapse of Iran's artifice across the Middle East. Hezbollah and Hamas have been decimated and now Assad's regime has collapsed. I wonder how you see the context of what we're seeing right now Newswise within the region.",

I want to bring in CNN's Nic Robertson, who's in London with us right now.Nic, because one of the things, Kim, was just mentioning is about what comes next. Of course, you know, you pause to mark the significance of what this moment actually means after more than a decade of fighting, hundreds of thousands killed, millions of refugees. This rebel group is made up of a number of different factions that I guess, for lack of a better term, united in this effort to overthrow Assad's regime. Just can you explain the different factions that we're seeing here? And if there's maybe an indication of -- of who would take the country forward from here?",

The noting that Damascus is free has come from rebel leaders, as you mentioned as well. We have not heard in any form from President Bashar al-Assad.I want to bring Kim back into the conversation because, Kim, you said something really interesting right before we went to Nic, that this rebellion, this move was built in the blood, sweat and tears of the Syrian people. And I just want to dig into that a little bit more because, look, this comes after more than a decade since the Arab Spring. Of course, hundreds of thousands have been killed, millions of refugees since then. This rebel offensive is made up of a number of different factions that might have their own individual disagreements and beliefs, but united around this particular movement. Can you just characterize the significance of these various groups coming together and sort of how we got to this moment?",

And there's been no word from President Bashar al-Assad, whose whereabouts, as it stands right now, are unknown.Now, Syria's Prime Minister says the government is ready to, quote, \"cooperate with any leadership the people choose.\" And the rebels have declared Damascus free, saying Assad has fled the city, where he's held power for nearly 25 years and his family for much longer. Sources tell CNN's Nic Robertson the rebels are trying to track Assad down. And a source tells CNN that the Syrian military there has fallen, as video shows some soldiers fleeing Damascus altogether. Rebel fighters say they're taking over state media offices to broadcast their victory over Assad, adding that some senior regime officials are preparing to defect in the capital as well. I want to bring in Ibrahim Al-Assil. He's a Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute. He joins us now from Washington. Thanks for being here. I want to get your take on what we're hearing, for starters, from the Syrian Prime Minister, saying we are ready and willing to cooperate with whoever the people choose to lead next. Do you view that statement as significant in any way for what might come now? IBRAHIM AL-ASSIL, SENIOR FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Thank you for having me. So clearly Syria is now in a transitional phase, and it's definitely important that we see some cooperation between different sides for this transition to make it as smooth as possible and as fast and quick as possible. If every part of the Syrian state has fallen, that would make it much more difficult for a transition. So the best-case scenario is where the regime falls, but the state institutions hold. That's what Syrians are hoping for, and that's what we are trying to understand, if it will happen or not.",

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced an initial billion-dollar military aid package for Ukraine on Saturday. He also argued strongly for U.S. leadership around the world. The U.S. has led a coalition of countries to arm and equip Ukraine's military since Russia invaded in February 2022. Now, Austin said it would be a mistake to abandon Kyiv. The aid package includes weapons vital for Ukraine's defense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Now, that package will provide Ukraine with more drones, more rockets for its HIMARS systems and more support for crucial maintenance and sustainment. And that brings the total of U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine since February 2022 to more than $62 billion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
