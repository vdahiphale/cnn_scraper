Trump says they will be in charge of cutting bureaucracy, excessive regulations and wasteful spending.Now, Musk released a statement saying this will send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people. Trump says, quote, a smaller government with more efficiency and less bureaucracy will be the perfect gift to the -- to America on the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. I am confident they will succeed. Now, the incoming president has also announced a number of other picks for his cabinet and his administration. He, in fact, asked Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be his defense secretary. Agseth served in the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan and is known for his work as a veterans advocate. Trump also chose John Ratcliffe to be CIA director. The former Republican congressman from Texas served as director of national intelligence for a part of the first Trump administration. The president elect has picked longtime friend Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East. The real estate developer is also a chair of Trump's presidential inaugural committee. And Trump has announced Mike Huckabee as his choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel. The former Arkansas governor has a long history of supporting Israel, and that includes its claims to the West Bank.

He said, we want your team to work like tireless bloodhounds. Don't leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.And you can see how effectively inefficiency has been rooted out in the federal government here, 43 years later. You know, there's a long history of people in business thinking that they can bring kind of those approaches to the federal government. The history is, you know, that these efforts, while they may find some inefficiencies, they cannot fundamentally, you know, restructure federal operations, both because all sorts of rules, but also because the vast majority of federal money is not wasted. You know, the biggest thing the federal government does is provide retirement security to seniors through Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid for long term care. You know, it's been described as an insurance company with an army. And so, yes, you can squeeze here and there, but there is no way to radically reduce federal spending along the magnitude that Ronald Reagan promised or that Donald Trump and Elon Musk are now promising without significantly changing what it does.

This comes after a strongly worded letter was sent last month by the Biden administration saying that Israel could be in violation of U.S. law if it did not improve the humanitarian situation. The humanitarian access, the amount of aid going into the Gaza Strip and violating U.S. law could threaten the aid, including military aid, that would go to Israel. The U.S. said that it wanted to see dramatic improvement on more than a dozen different concrete measures. Ahead of the Biden administration's announcement on Tuesday, we did hear in a joint statement from eight different aid agencies, and they said together that Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in northern Gaza. So those aid agencies saying that Israel is actually making things worse, which stands in stark contrast to what we heard from a State Department spokesman who said that progress is being made, that the U.S. does continue to want to see changes made by Israel, but that Israel is not, for now, in violation of U.S. law. At the same time, we also heard from the United Nations. They said the situation in northern Gaza is nothing short of catastrophic. That's a quote.

The images that we just saw as well as postings on social media really show the extent of the grief in China, particularly in southern China where this happened.According to police, the man now in custody, the 62-year-old man, was apparently unhappy about his divorce settlement and about how some property in particular was being handled. They believe this may be what led up to this tragedy. Police want to talk to him, they want to question him, but as of last night he was unconscious. They say when he was fleeing the scene he tried to hurt himself. He may have harmed himself. A knife was found inside the vehicle and he has some injuries to his neck. Perhaps we'll get some more updates later on from police, but at this point they have not been able to question the individual. Across China there is this profound sense of sadness to the level that top government officials have weighed including Chinese President Xi Jinping, who called for all out efforts to take care of those who have been impacted. And in particular the grief, the aftermath as this tragedy really begins to sink in for many families. Not surprising, some of the social media posts that were posted early on in this investigation have been removed, censored from the government. That is not unusual, but it does give us an indication as to just how sensitive of a moment this is in China. There is some important context though to also put out there. Violent crime in China is very rare. There are more than a billion people here and if you look at the violent crime rates, they are very low. It's very difficult to get a gun. So when something like this happens, it is extremely attention getting. That is not to say we have not seen incidents like that. In fact, in recent weeks, in recent months, we have seen several cases where people have been gathered in large settings and someone tries to do harm. In fact, it was back in September, there was a group of students and parents outside and a bus then plowed into that crowd. It led to deaths, it led to injuries. But despite what these statistics may say, Paula, it certainly does not make the grief and sadness here in China in this most recent case any easier to comprehend and to deal with for that matter.",

His first administration targeted NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey. All of the agencies that monitor the health of our air and our water. And I expect him to go after clean car standards, clean power plant standards, reduce incentives for clean energy. And this is really a terrible idea, not just because of climate change in the future, but for our health today. I mean, pollution from cars and coal still kills 100,000 Americans a year unnecessarily. One in five deaths worldwide comes from fossil fuel use. We don't need that anymore. All of us want cleaner air and water for our kids. We're going to have to fight for clean air and water over the next four years.",

He, of course, is the inventor, founder and still leader of Tesla in terms of electric -- electric vehicles.But I also want you to listen to one of the world's largest emitters on their climate goal. And that's ExxonMobil. In a statement to CNN saying, \"A second U.S. exit from the Paris climate agreement will have profound implications for the United States' efforts to reduce its own emissions and for international efforts to combat climate change. We advocate for policy that accounts for security, affordability, reliability, and environmental stewardship, not drastic changes.\" It seemed that we had come so far. Do you have some optimism that, again, people that are noticing the changes within their own environment, companies that at one point were the world's largest emitters will bring us back from the brink here and do the right thing, even though there is not perhaps the government leadership?",
