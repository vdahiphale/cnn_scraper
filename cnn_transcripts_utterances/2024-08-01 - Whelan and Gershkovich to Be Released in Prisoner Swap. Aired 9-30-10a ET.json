That makes it all the more difficult.I will add just one final point. It shows you that even in the midst of what is a crisis level relationship between Moscow and Washington, largest war in Europe and Ukraine, the U.S.. on one side supporting the Ukrainians, Russia, of course, continuing their invasion, a number of other places around the globe where the U.S.. and Russia are clashing, that they are still able to have diplomatic conversations, like this one, in deeply difficult circumstances. And if there is a sliver of light, right, in that relationship, it is that you can still have these negotiations and conversations. And that's important.",

If past is precedent, this is going to be something that's out of a movie.We have seen on video the releases of Trevor Reed, of Brittney Griner, of Viktor Bout from the U.S. to the Russians. So, we're going to start to see in the coming hours photos and videos released by different governments, released by different agencies. What we expect to happen, and again this is -- we don't have the details of how this is going to unfold, but how it's happened in the past is that planes from these different countries carrying these prisoners converge on a tarmac in a third country. In the past, with Brittney Griner for example, it took place in the United Arab Emirates. There were prisoners released from Iran who were transferred in Doha, the capital of Qatar. Turkey has also been playing a role in this. So, we could see prisoners being exchanged in the capital at the airport there in Ankara. So, this is one of the details that we're trying to find out. And because this is a multi-country deal, we believe, you're going to be seeing airplanes likely coming in from different places. Now, the Russians, as they have in the past, and I believe your previous guest alluded to this, they have, in the past, released video and photos before others. So, we could see some things coming out of their -- their Russian state media. But when it comes to the prisoners who are coming home to the United States, and I should note that that could include a Kremlin critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a Russian and British national, but also has permanent residency here in the U.S. And we've heard calls from U.S. lawmakers to have him released. We could see him coming back to the United States alongside Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. We don't know where they're going to land in the U.S. Obviously that could be a variety of airports. But what is likely to happen is that they would be offered medical and psychological services in Texas. There's the Brooke Army Medical Complex -- Medical Center, rather. This is part of the biggest medical complex in the Department of Defense system. And we have seen Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed go there in the past. It's in San Antonio. And they have a program called a Post-Isolation Support Activities, often referred to as PISA, and that helps people who have been in captivity, who have suffered traumatic events, to get back on their feet, essentially, both through medical and psychological support. So, this day is going to be -- it's going be complicated. There are going to be a lot of moving parts. It's going to be full of emotion and full of history. But there's a lot that is going to happen. We believe we are just at the beginning stages of that. Guys.",

It's not easy for those of us on the outside because these negotiations and then the arrangements, shared agreements be made are extremely, you know, they're very -- they're very close held.But I think it's really important also to remember the context here. You know, this is not a court proceeding. These are not legal proceedings in Russia. This is a farce. This is hostage taking on the part of the Russians and they force us then to do what us and other countries are in the process of trying to do now, which is essentially negotiate, hopefully in good faith, to get our own national citizens back where they belong after they've been kidnapped in Russia. It's going to be a long and interesting day, and it will be interesting to see how it all breaks down. But those are my initial thoughts.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that's a really good question. There is no question that the person who decides this is Vladimir Putin. And so when he wants news to break, it will break in the -- in the Russian media, which are essentially at this point completely propaganda (INAUDIBLE). So, it will be presented in Russia as whatever Putin wants. So, you have to kind of climb into Putin's mind, which we, of course, can't do.But, number one, he is a former KGB agent. And when you talk about the main person that he wanted back, it's an FSB, the former KGB, officer who has been held in Germany. So, that's number one. Now, do Russians care that, you know, a KGB guy came back? Maybe. But I think it could also be presented as President Putin being able to muster a lot of diplomacy to get what he wants. He's a very transactional person. And so I think my question is, when, you know, I learned about this, were really why and why now? And it's extremely complex, as everybody has been pointing out. But I think I just throw into the mix here that since the invasion, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a lot of Russian intelligence agents have been rolled up, as they say, around the world. And there actually are quite a few people scattered in different countries. You know, Slovenia, here in the United States, Germany, et cetera. So, they -- you know, once we see the entire plan, I think it would be very interesting to see potentially how this came together.",

We're continuing to get details for you. We'll have more on that coming up after the break. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:51:11] JIMENEZ: Welcome back, everyone, to the major breaking news. A massive prisoner exchange is underway between the United States and Russia. The details of this, we are still trying to track down. But what we do know is Americans Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich are expected to be in included. Both of them falsely jailed on espionage charges. Gershkovich has spent the last 13 months behind bars, while Whelan has spent the better part of six years fighting for his freedom.

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, Omar, the delivery of Americans or anyone wrongfully detained back to their home country is a noble goal regardless of who is undertaking it. But given that this is likely to be happening in the year 2024, there will be a political backdrop that is inevitable to this situation.You may remember that at the end of June, Donald Trump, who, of course, is running for president for the Republican ticket, who formerly held this office, said that if he were elected, he would be the one who would be freeing Evan Gershkovich. And back in December 2022, he criticized President Biden at the time for the deal that he secured to release WNBA star Brittany Griner in exchange for the Soviet arms dealer nicknamed the merchant of death. President Trump, former President Trump, suggesting at the time that he had turned down a deal while he was in office for Paul Whelan in exchange for Viktor Bout, the so-called merchant of death, but then criticized President Biden for freeing Brittney Griner but not freeing Paul Whelan alongside her. So, certainly there is going to be a political discussion that follows this. But I think that President Biden has talked for years about his ability and his work behind the scenes to strengthen the alliances of the United States overseas. And there is no question that the U.S. and the White House in particular needed to lean on some of those alliances with multiple countries in order to secure the potential for a deal like this to happen. So, certainly, expect that to be something that we hear from the White House if and when this deal is to happen, and something that we'd expect to hear from Democrats more broadly.",

JONATHAN FRANKS, SPOKESPERSON, BRING OUR FAMILIES HOME: I'm not sure there's anything more touch and go than a hostage recovery like this. And, you know, when we see it as Americans on TV, that's because Ambassador Carstens (ph) and his team has spent the better part of weeks or a month orchestrating and choreographing these in hopes of nothing going wrong at the last possible second.
