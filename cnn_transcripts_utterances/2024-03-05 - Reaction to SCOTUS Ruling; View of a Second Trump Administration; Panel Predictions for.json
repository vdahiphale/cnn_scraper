And there is the potential for severe weather, so we'll highlight all of that. Fifteen states. We've got them highlighted here on this particular map from the west coast. Northern California getting another rainstorm for the coastal areas to mountain snow for the higher elevations.Here's a severe weather threat, eastern Texas. That extends into Arkansas. Both of those states actually going to the polls today. And some wet weather along the east coast impacting places like Virginia, all the way to Massachusetts, also reaching the polls. So, just a general overview. Lots of wet weather. That is the name of the game from Atlanta, to Little Rock, all the way to Shreveport, Louisiana. This is a current radar. Look at that little spin in that storm system entering the East Coast. That is bringing rainfall to the Delmarva Peninsula. This is the major rainmaker entering the Florida peninsula -- panhandle, I should say, right now. And those are some stronger storms over eastern Texas. So, could impact the state there and that extends into central portions of Arkansas. We do have a marginal risk. That's a level one of five from the storm prediction center. Large hail, damaging winds can't quite be ruled out. But the bigger story here will be the rain. So, ponding on the roadways will be a possibility. Here's our flash flood threat for the day today. That extends from Atlanta, to Birmingham, southward to Montgomery and Tallahassee. You saw on the radar, very, very active moving in from the Gulf of Mexico, lots of moisture. And I've got to get this in because, yes, Kasie, we officially measured over ten feet of snow in California from our five-day blizzard that seemed like it would never end, but it's officially ended now.",

KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Those are people who are voting for Nikki Haley because they want to send a message, please don't give us these two options. Please give us something different. They are not at that Nikki Haley rally because they also kind of like Donald Trump. But I think it is smart for her to take this position because, first of all, I do think that even if you are a voter who's in the center and you don't like Donald Trump, the idea of the Supreme Court taking this away from you probably wouldn't sit quite well. But also, she's got a potentially long career in politics. I don't think that she wants to put herself fully into the never Trump wing of the party because it would be hard to come back from that over the long term. So, this is her way, I think, of saying, look, I'm different. I don't think we should pick him this time. He's not the right guy for the moment.

From what I hear from people around the campaign, even the White House, it's not so much looking at sort of -- sort of the decision here. One thing I do know that Biden allies, the campaign and the White House are looking at is, as these weeks go by, and as you get deeper into the general election, some are hoping that voters become clear- eyed, that it looks like Trump is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I've talked to plenty of Democrats that say that that would benefit them. It would almost back the argument that you'll probably hear more and more in the weeks to come where the White House tries to draw a contrast directly with the former president, calling him out by name, like we saw last week at the border as well with a sort of split screen with President Biden and the former president. So, not necessary the court cases, but I do think you're hoping that the campaign hopes that voters realize that Trump is going to be the nominee likely.",

They just don't think it's possible. And that when they do realize that, you know, it will become less a referendum on Biden, more a direct (INAUDIBLE). I mean do you by that?
