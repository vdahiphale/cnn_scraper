So, you would think his core group, his base of support would be doing the same but, in fact, it's moving a little bit away from him.So, this is Trump's margin with non-college white voters. Unlike most voting blocs, this group is not moving towards but it's actually moving slightly away. So, you go back eight years ago, he won it by 33. You go back four years ago, he won it by 31. Now what we look is we see them, the latest average of polls, he's only up by 27. Now, that may not seem like a lot, but given that we're seeing these double-digit gains, say, among black voters, or among Hispanic voters in some of the polls, the fact that we're seeing this core group of supporters actually moving away from him, not just off of the 2016 baseline, but the 2020 baseline as well, I think that's a rather interesting development.",

Look at this, non-college white voters make up 40 percent of the electorate. That's more than college whites at 29 percent. All other groups, voters of color at 28 percent. So, this is something that we've seen throughout the board, right, which is that Donald Trump is making huge gains with groups that make up a smaller percentage of the electorate while he's losing a little bit. But these groups that he's losing a little bit of make up a much larger portion of the electorate. But more than that, you know, we're talking about the U.S. of A, where they make up 40 percent, why don't you go to those key Great Lake battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. They have outsized in court, in those Great Lake battleground states, non- college white voters. Look at this, they make up the slim majority of voters at 51 percent. Way more than college whites at 30 percent. Way more than all other voters at 16 percent.

That is small movement among non- college white voters. Again, you see it back in 2016, Donald Trump won them by 25. You see small movement in 2020. Donald Trump winning them by 22. And look at that, what we are today, again, Trump is ahead, but his margins are smaller. And when you have a shrinking margin for Donald Trump among his core group that makes up the majority of voters, it can make up for big shift amongst smaller groups of the electorate.And this is why Kamala Harris is still in the ballgame right now. It's because even though she's losing big league, she's losing big league among groups that make up a small portion of the electorate and she's making it up, among groups that make up a big portion of the electorate, even if the movements are small. But it's clear here. BERMAN: That is very interesting. And it's a clear downward slope in these key states among his key demographic. And if I can just for a second.",

These allegations span from the year 2000 to 2022. And all but one of these seven accusers alleges that they were drugged by Combs before they were sexually assaulted. Those are some similar patterns that we have seen in past lawsuits against Combs.But what is different this time around, as you said, Sara, for the first time ever in lawsuits against Combs, other celebrities are also directly accused of wrongdoing. Now, these celebrities are all anonymous. They are referred to as \"Celebrity A\" and \"Celebrity B.\" But I want to walk you through some of the claims. By the way, two of these lawsuits coming from \"Jane\" or \"John Does,\" who allege they were minors at the time. One of the \"Jane Does\" alleges that she was a 13- year-old girl when she was allegedly raped and drugged by Combs in 2000 at a VMA after party. Now, she says that she was brought to this party by a limo driver who alleged that he worked for Combs and allegedly said that Combs likes younger girls. Now, I want to read you part of her lawsuit. It says, quote, \"after drinking just one drink, plaintiff began to feel woozy and light headed, making her need to lie down.\" The lawsuit goes on to say that, \"soon after Combs, along with a male and female celebrity, entered the room.\" Now, the lawsuit goes on to horrifying allegations where she said that \"Celebrity A,\" who was a male celebrity, then undressed her as she felt disoriented, and raped her, while the other two, Combs and \"Celebrity B,\" which is a female celebrity, watch. Now, another lawsuit, which comes from a male personal trainer in 2022, alleges that he was drugged and assaulted by Combs at a party in the Hollywood Hills that was an after party for an award show. He says that he lost complete consciousness, doesn't remember anything but, quote, it says, \"he was drugged and repeatedly sexually assaulted,\" end quote, by Combs and an unnamed celebrity.",

And this was in 2022. It's from a male \"John Doe\" who says he was a businessman. And in this photo, which we see there, the other faces are blurred out, you see Combs at a table with Ciroc bottles. Now, another photo comes from a female, \"Jane Doe,\" who alleges that in 2014 she was drugged and raped by Combs at a Vegas after party in a hotel. And there, this photo from this accuser, alleges that this was taken by her, posted on her Instagram, and allegedly shows Combs in the room where she says she was. Now, I do want to note, I reached out to attorneys for Combs. They did not respond to these specific allegations in these seven lawsuits. But they referred me to a past statements, Sara, where they denied all allegations, saying that Mr. Combs has never, ever sexually assaulted anyone, male or woman, or any minor.",

So, evolving in the nighttime hours. And the floodwaters got so high that it swept away vehicles, it inundated businesses, buildings. And you'll see some of the damage aftermath in just one moment.But this is not a welcome sight, especially considering all the things that the country has gone through.

Look at these cars, almost like they're toy vehicles, just washed up right along this beach - this bridge and stacked as well. You could just see the brute force of the water as it swept through Roswell, New Mexico. So, why in the world did this happen? Well, we received nearly a half a year's total worth of rainfall in just one day's time. And, in fact, just a few hours' time. This is the wettest day on record for this particular location. And you can see why. This is rainfall accumulation from the storms that moved over the same areas for several hours. There's Roswell. A lot of the flooding occurring just to the south and west of the city. The good news is, John, the rain has ended, so it will continue to dry things out. But now they're left with the cleanup process as this system continues to advance eastward.
