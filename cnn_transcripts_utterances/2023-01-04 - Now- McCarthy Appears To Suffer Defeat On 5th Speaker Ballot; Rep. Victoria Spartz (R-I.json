We can't do this forever. Let's talk about the implications. We have no sworn-in House members. Say we had a national security crisis, there's no chair of the Intel Committee in the House. There's no speaker of the House right now. This is an untenable position to carry on purely because Kevin McCarthy will not step down and try someone else like a Steve Scalise. I thought it was interesting that his name was the one floated by Ken Buck. Because I worked with Ken Buck when he was in the Freedom Caucus. He's a pretty conservative guy. He's pretty aligned with some of the no votes here. But he signaled that he would be willing to go to the next guy in line, which is Scalise, who, by the way, has a highly professional team, has a leadership office, and could pretty seamlessly transition into speaker of the House if it went that way.",
