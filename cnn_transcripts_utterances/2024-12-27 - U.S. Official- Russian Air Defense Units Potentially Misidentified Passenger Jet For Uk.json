A U.S. official telling CNN that Russia may have confused the passenger jet that crashed for Ukrainian drone -- as we hear from passengers who survived the terrifying crash. Plus, a second stowaway on a second Delta flight. This time, the person was caught just minutes before takeoff. So how does this keep happening? And breaking news, President-elect Donald Trump tonight with a last minute request, asking the Supreme Court to save TikTok, at least for now. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a deadly mix up. CNN is learning tonight that Russian forces may have confused the passenger jet that crashed on Christmas day for a Ukrainian drone. That is, according to a U.S. official. Video shows the jet plunging to the ground in Kazakhstan and then bursting into flames. Thirty-eight people were killed. We know around the same time, the Azerbaijan Airlines jet was scheduled to land in southern Russia, there was, in fact, a Ukrainian drone strike in that area. And today, the White House National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, he pointed the finger directly at Russia. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

And OUTFRONT with us now, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien, retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, and Seth Jones, national security expert and senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Miles, I want to start with you with the latest of what we're just learning about this plane crash. You hear those remarkable, terrifying first hand accounts from that survivor of the crash. What stands out to you? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, first of all, what a remarkable kind of clear eyed, cool headed account from a passenger who's been through an amazing, harrowing ordeal. It's just -- it's frightening to even think about what he's been through. But for him to relate what he had done for us in such a factual way was, was helpful, I think. But you know what? Ive been thinking about a lot this afternoon, Kate, is the decision to dispatch that aircraft. The airline does have a lot of responsibility in all of this. It was not a secret that those drone attacks were occurring in the Grozny region. It was not a secret that in order to thwart a drone attack, you jam GPS, which of course is an aid to navigation for civilian airliners. It was not a secret that this was, you know, for all intents and purposes, a battle zone. And for that matter, the Russians should have closed the airspace, but they did not. So the fact that that aircraft was even in that area stands out to me right now. There are a whole sequence of events which led to what were seeing here right now on top of that. But like any accident, it's always a series of events. And if you pull one of those events out of it, oftentimes it doesn't happen.",

Spider, how easy should it be for a military to distinguish between a drone and a commercial airliner? And what does it say if the Russians couldn't tell the difference? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, essentially, Kate, there are there are two ways to do it. One is you're going to do it by radar. You're going to have some type of a return on a screen. And then secondarily, you're going to have visual identification. And what it appears at this point -- and again, realize this is all conjecture on our part until all the facts are in, is that it looks like as a result of the aborted, attempted landing at Grozny, they were close enough to the ground and ground based air defense systems, which are dumb weapon systems, you're essentially shooting bullets into the sky, managed to hit the target. At least that's the initial view that we have right now. But a drone is going to have a much different, frankly, a very erratic pattern in order to do what its trying to do relative to a commercial aircraft, which is a very predictable low slow, at this point kind of approach into an air -- airfield. So trying to as, as Miles indicated, victim blaming -- blaming is a very cheap way out of this thing and probably a very predictable narrative that were going to see. But it wouldn't be confusion on the ground. It's -- it certainly is just the combination of an incredibly capable military, the Russian military, which is immensely led by feckless leadership. That combination is incredibly dangerous. And we're seeing that right now.",

Why?SETH JONES, PRESIDENT, DEFENSE &amp; SECURITY DEPARTMENT CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, Kate, one of the things that's been interesting is I've had multiple conversations over the last two weeks with senior Ukrainian officials, including ones involved in building their drone program. And what we have seen is a notable increase in domestically produced, although parts are coming from outside drones that the Ukrainians are using for long range strike with higher payloads against Russian targets in Russia itself. So things like air bases, logistics hubs, weapons depots and some of the drones that they're using actually are small airplanes that they've pulled out the manned components and put in components to allow them to be remotely controlled, put on high volumes of explosives, and then use them for essentially suicide attacks into targets. So, you know, in a sense, there -- there's sort of this interesting psychological effect that it's having -- that it may be having on the Russians where they're a little trigger sensitive right now because they're -- they're seeing so many of these drones target various aspects of Russian territory.",

CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Well, Kate, there are so many questions tonight about what happened, including just how much time this unticketed passenger spent at this terminal before boarding this flight. There's also, of course, the question of how this person was able to get past a TSA security checkpoint without a boarding pass in the first place the night before this flight on Christmas Eve. And then there's also the fact that when the flight crew realized that there was a stowaway on board that aircraft and they decided to turn the plane back around, when that aircraft gets back to the gate, we're told that this person managed to run out of the airplane before law enforcement arrived. And so, we're told that authorities actually had to rely on surveillance video from the airport in Seattle to figure out exactly where this person was. They were able to detain the person inside of a bathroom. Here now, is another passenger that was on board that flight, describing this entire ordeal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What happened with that plane on the 25th that the guy was able to get off?There's a lot of issues around Delta specifically that have to be addressed. But to be clear, this was a lot of failures, not just deltas, because at airports there's two sort of separate security aspects. I mean, the first is what's called identity verification. That's when you and I give our -- our ID and the TSA agent determines whether we are, in fact, you know, Juliette Kayyem. The second one, though, is called the boarding status station. That's the one where you're getting onto the plane. That's ensuring that you have the right tickets. In both cases, very rare, but in both cases, in relatively recently, both systems seem to have broken down. And this, you know, give -- give the FAA and airlines some credit.

Now, one thing that is clear is that TikTok is, of course, very popular in this country. It has 170 million users and monthly users, I should say.

And he is saying he is deeply concerned about these two choices of Donald Trump, Kash Patel to lead the FBI and Tulsi Gabbard to be his choice to be the top spy, the director of national intelligence.Webster says he's concerned about the impartiality of the people in these roles. He reminds senators in a letter on Thursday that whenever he was serving under president carter and President Reagan, there were one time each for each of those presidents where they reached out to him, and he made sure to tell them that his agency, the FBI at the time, would need to be independent and impartial. What he says about Patel is specifically with this. Patel is somebody who has said he wants to investigate the investigators, has been encouraged to investigate the January 6th committee on the Hill, and Webster writes: While Mr. Patel's intelligence and patriotism are commendable, his close political alignment with President Trump raises serious concerns about impartiality and integrity. Statements such as he's my intel guy and his record of executing the president's directives suggests a loyalty to individuals rather than the rule of law, a dangerous precedent for an agency tasked with impartial enforcement of justice. His issue with Tulsi Gabbard, it's a little bit different. He seems to have an issue more with her level of experience in handling intelligence. Former Army National Guard veteran is what she is, as well as a former Democratic congresswoman. He writes: Congresswoman Gabbard's profound lack of intelligence experience and the daunting task of overseeing 18 disparate intelligence agencies further highlight the need for seasoned leadership.
