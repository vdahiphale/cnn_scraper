The district attorney is really steamed and Donald Trump is back to screaming in all caps on social media. The legal headlines are plenty today, starting in Manhattan, where the grand jury hearing the hush money case involving Stormy Daniels is meeting today. Sources saying, however, they are not discussing Donald Trump the grand jury, which means the decision on whether to charge the former president in the Stormy Daniels hush money case that decision slides into next week. Meanwhile, the man prosecuting the case, District Attorney Alvin Bragg is unleashing on house Republicans who have been taking steps to investigate the team investigating Donald Trump. Bragg sent a letter today, claiming that the GOP leaders only got involved, quote, after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day, and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene, unquote. We should note that day that Trump was supposed to be arrested, according to Trump, that day was Tuesday and that day came and went without an arrest or indictment. In a separate case, the federal investigation into the activities surrounding January 6, today, lawyers for Trump and his former Vice President Mike Pence. They are all back in court. They're trying to block a subpoena for Pence's testimony about his conversations with Trump around the time of the Capital insurrection. We're going to break down every one of these developments for you. We're going to start with CNN's Kara Scannell in Manhattan, outside the courthouse.

It's possible they could even bring back Michael Cohen, who already testified for two days last week before the grand jury.Now, this comes as Bragg is weighing this big decision of whether to bring the first charges against the former president, and it comes as the office, sources tell us, are regrouping following the weeks of testimony and the testimony on Monday when they heard from Michael Cohen's former lawyer at the request of the Trump team. Now, as you said, this comes as the D.A.'s office was also pushing back on the House Republicans who want Alvin Bragg to come and testify before their committees.

Donald Trump's team wants to limit what Mike Pence is willing to say to the grand jury by claiming executive privilege, basically trying to block him from divulging what might have happened in conversations between the two, the president and the vice president. Pence's team is also preparing to fight on the speech or debate clause side of things. The speech or debate clause is in the Constitution and what it does is, it basically allows Congress to have a lot of protections. What they're going to be arguing is that Mike Pence should have those protections because on January 6th, he was an officer of the Senate. So that is what is going to be argued in these hearings. It may have been argued today in court. All of the lawyers a whole crowd of them for Pence, Trump and the January 6th investigation.

So, Vice President Pence's team is expected to say that he's protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution because so many of his activities related to his being a president of the Senate on January 6th.

It's never been an argument that's been squarely decided by the courts, but I think there's a reasonable basis for it.On Donald Trump's end, he's got two big problems with trying to claim executive privilege. First of all, this is a criminal grand jury subpoena, which usually prevails over claims of executive privilege. And second of all, Donald Trump is a former president. It's not impossible for a former president to claim executive privilege, but it's definitely an uphill climb.",

DeSantis gave another interview in which he declared Putin a war criminal and said that Putin should be held accountable. What did you make of that? SEN.

Republicans and Democrats in my state still support Ukraine because they do believe there's a connection between fighting the Russians and protecting Ukrainian democracy and protecting our own democracy. So it could be that DeSantis realized he got way out of step with where the broad American electorate is, and he's, you know, trying to make up the difference. The problem is that it's not just Ron DeSantis. It's not just Donald Trump. There's a growing number of Republicans in the House of Representatives who are saying the same things and ultimately, at some point this year, we're going to have to authorize additional assistance, especially if this offensive shows some signs of promise, and it's going to be a little bit harder this year with the DeSantis and Trump wing of the Republican Party being in control of the House to get that bipartisan support for Ukraine aid that we had in the last year.",

We are going to have to in some circumstances engage constructively with China, like we did around the conference and biodiversity that we co-hosted with them in Montreal. There's issues around climate change that we should be working as a world together.There's other places where we're going to have to be stiff competition to China in terms of market access, in terms of investments in the global south, we need to be able to show that the West, the democracies are there to make those investments and there is competitive to China. But there are also areas in which we're going to have to directly challenge China, whether it's on human rights, whether it's on security behaviors, whether it's on cyberattacks or concerns like that, we're going to have to continue to be wide eyed and clear about the threat that China poses and wants to pose to the stability of our democracies.

They've laid out this plan to pilots, essentially reminding them to be more vigilant and step up their safety protocols after these runway incursions. We've seen six of them investigated by the NTSB so far this year, but they've also laid out this five point plan for air traffic controllers to get more help. It all centers on more supervisor oversight and air traffic control towers, also moving along the training backlog that was caused by the pandemic.The top union of air traffic controllers says that is so key here because aircraft control facilities are especially short staff, they say. They break this down like this, and the FAA is actually admitted to this, even causing some flight delays and cancelations. This staffing right now at a key facility in New York and oversees the airspace of all three major metro airports. Fifty-four percent is the staffing level there right now. It's 90 percent nationwide, so still a long way to go. And the FAA as it goes through its reauthorization period in Congress, they'll, of course be asking for more money. But the FAA has actually admitted that if we go into the summer, and airlines don't throttle back their schedules, we could see even more widespread delays and cancelations like we did last year.",
