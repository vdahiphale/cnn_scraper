Well, all those stories coming up. First though some breaking news coming into CNN Jorge Vilda, the Coach of the Spanish Women's Football Team has been sacked, he has been seen as a close ally of Luis Rubiales. Rubiales, of course you may remember is that Spanish Football Federation Chief who planted and want to kiss on a star player during World Cup celebrations.

This process of the Football Federation said they were going to wait until the legal process played out and take the 90 days. They following the lead of FIFA who said they were going to do the same before they made any sort of ruling or comments on this further. And that could take us till November till we find Rubiales fate. But the Royal Spanish Football Federation releasing this statement just moments ago saying that \"In one of the first measures of restructuring announced by President Pedro Rocha has decided to let go the services of Jorge Vilda as sporting director and women's national team coach\" a position Vilda which he took in 2015. RFEF appreciates his work at the Head of the National Team and his responsibilities as the maximum sporting figure of the women's national teams as well as the successes reaped during his term, crowned with the recent achievement of the World Cup\". Now this was a coach who was scrutinized by players Becky, remember before the World Cup heading into that there were 15 players who said they would not play for the national team until changes were made at the leadership level. While only three of those players indeed did go on to play for the national team in the World Cup, which they won as we all know, and it's been overshadowed by all of this drama, Becky, but you have to think that perhaps that was necessary for them to win in order for these changes to actually occur. Had they not won, would this have all gone by the wayside? And they're continuing to have these battles and fights if with changes of leadership that they desired? You know, now they're getting that and it's because they did persevere and they did go on and claim their glory as World Champs.",

It is using up its armaments it's using upits ammunition just in the same way as Ukraine is just in the same way that Ukraine's Western backers are struggling to give it enough artillery ammunition, and what it needs to keep in the fight. And Putin recognizes this. And in a war of attrition, often the person of a country that comes out on top is the one that's got the more weapon systems to put into the fight. The Russians have got more troops and personnel. But what North Korea has that Russia could want that Putin could want would be a weapons stock and system that is of the same type and generation as what Russia uses in the field in Ukraine. So it can get the right artillery shells, it can get the right infantry rocket systems; it can get weapons to augment and supplement what it can't produce at the moment. We know Russia has gone on a 24 hour a day weapons production at some of its weapons production facilities. But North Korea can even provide it with raw materials for making some of those -- some of the ammunition that it needs. So Putin needs to win the war in Ukraine in his mind, obviously. And to do that, obviously, he needs the weapon systems to do it. And it does appear as if North Korea can be somewhere that can provide it and better still, it's a country that's right next to Russia, that's got trade lines running from North Korea, all the way across Russia all the way to Ukraine.

And really, no matterhow the war evolves from here that is going to be true. You know, strategically, economically, militarily, politically, I mean, Russia is far diminished as a result of this. It's hard for me to imagine anyone, any other country looking at this case and saying, OK, well, you know, territorial aggression against the neighbors are good idea for my country's future. So, you know, I see it as, as this is sort of a locked in element that Russia's diminishment here, it's just a reality. As for, you know, the message is sending to other countries, I just think that we've been in, you know, the U.S. and its partners have been able to create such tremendous costs for Russia that should serve as a powerful deterrent for others. But on the question of how this war ends, and whether it's going to end with Russia occupying illegally, some portion of Ukrainian territory, you know, Russia did occupy Ukrainian territory illegally for 2014 to 2022, before, you know, full scale war began. And that was illegal, immoral, wrong. But nonetheless, you know, and it certainly was damaging to Ukraine. But Ukraine wasn't systemically affected by it and anywhere near the same extent that it's systemically affected by this war. So I'm more concerned with a war outcome that leaves Ukraine secure and prosperous. I think, you know, we've been able to manage territorial disputes and illegal occupations even over the long term, in such a way as to allow countries to prosper, and you could point to Korea or West Germany and so on. But obviously be better if Ukraine can restore virtual integrity. The question is, is that a plausible outcome.",

Ifyou are a regular viewer of this show, you'll know that there's been a surge in violence between Israelis and Palestinians this year, in fact has been the deadliest year for both sides in more than a decade. But inside Israel's Arab communities, there's been a wave of murders being perpetrated by their own. So far more than 160 Arab Israelis have been killed this year in violence, mostly attributed to organized crime. And while the deaths have been unrelated to the Israeli Palestinian conflict, many Arab citizens of Israel blame the government for not doing enough to protect them. CNN's Hadas Gold has more on what is going on, and what we understand to be behind this rising wave of deadly violence. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A mother's anguish, grief, still fresh. Enough, she cries. We want to live in peace and quiet. We want to find who is behind all of these. Why? Why? Why kill these kids? -- was murdered just last week, a year out from a stint in prison. An Arab citizen of Israel, he's one of the latest victims in an alarming crime wave that's rocking the Arab community across the country. At a recent protest in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, thousands turned out to call for equal justice. Arabs make up around 20 percent of Israeli citizens. Many speak fluent Hebrew and also identify as Palestinian. But they say Israeli authorities are not treating their cases the same as Jewish ones. Tashida -- says she blames the police, government and the law, her son was said to be married soon. When I asked her whether the police have made any progress on the case, she says not yet and stops, overcome by emotion.",
