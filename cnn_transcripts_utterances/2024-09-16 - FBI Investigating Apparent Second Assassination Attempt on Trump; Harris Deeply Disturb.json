This morning, a picture is beginning, just beginning to come into focus about the man's past, including what he recently said about Trump himself.The FBI is working to piece this all together and figure out how and why he got a few hundred yards from Donald Trump with an assault-style rifle. The Secret Service spotting him, opening fire as Trump was golfing. The would-be shooter then fled taken into custody a short time later on a highway. Charges and a first court appearance could come as soon as this morning. There is a lot to get to surrounding all of this.

Several streets around the golf property are still closed at this hour as authorities and investigators try to piece together what happened here yesterday. As you noted, we are getting a better picture of the 58-year-old man who has been detained in connection with this incident. He has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. He is a self-employed home builder in Hawaii.Now, according to some of the social media posts, he has been a bit critical of the former president and he traveled to Ukraine back in 2022. In fact, Ukraine's Foreign Legion tells CNN that he reached out to them about volunteering in the war effort in Ukraine. He was also arrested back in 2002 for barricading himself inside of a house with a weapon in North Carolina. Now, yesterday, CNN spoke to Ryan's son, Oran, who told us a little bit about his father and in a conversation that he's had with us off camera, Oran said, quote, that his father was loving and a caring father and an honest, hardworking man. He doesn't sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violence. He said that his father is a good father and a great man. Here now is some sound with Ryan back in 2022 at a rally for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I am very proud to be an American.Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign leaders for the second time in as many months being forced to talk to their staff about these security risks of working for the former president and this dangerous attempt on his life and their boss in a memo that was released from Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, his co-campaign managers. They wrote, this is not a matter that we take lightly. Your safety is always our top priority. They went on to say that the staff should, quote, remain vigilant and be observant and maintain a constant level of situational awareness.

He has no events scheduled for during the day today, but he was scheduled to hold a cryptocurrency event, where he was going to unveil this sort of new venture coming from his family tonight from Mar-a-Lago at 8And so far, as far as we know, those events will continue as scheduled.

This weekend, and she was briefed in the immediate aftermath of this incident while she was here by her team.Now, she did release a statement overnight saying that she was deeply disturbed by the incident, but also saying the following, quote, as we gather the facts, I will be clear, I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence. Now, Governor Tim Walz, who is your vice presidential nominee, also responding on X saying, Gwen and I are glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe. Violence has no place in our country. It's not who we are as a nation. Now, John, of course, this is not the first time that the vice president, though she was not the Democratic nominee at the time, has had to weigh in on an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. And it has been a challenge for the campaign on decrying political violence against any candidate, including former President Donald Trump, while also making the argument that he's unfit to be president. And at her rallies, the vice president has talked about the divisions in the country, but simultaneously called for unity. Now, this is a message that's going to carry on into the week, and we'll see how, if at all, she acknowledges this latest attempt in her remarks, but today the vice president is going to meet with the Teamsters, a critical meeting to try to garner that union support that buoyed President Biden in 2020. The Teamsters, of course, has not endorsed either candidate yet. They typically wait until after the party's conventions, but they have more than a million members. So, it is key for any candidate to try to notch their endorsement in hopes of persuading other union supporters across the country. Now, the vice president, after that on Tuesday, is going to be interviewed by the National Association of Black Journalists. Recall that they previously interviewed former President Donald Trump. They will now be doing that with her tomorrow. And later, she heads to Michigan and Wisconsin. So, yet another crucial week for the vice president to continue to garner that support heading into November. John?",

We previously reported that U.S. officials revealed they had intelligence on an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump even before the attempt on his life at that Pennsylvania rally, but they said that attempt was not linked to Iran.CNN's Zach Cohen is joining us now. You're reporting that there doesn't seem to be any apparent indication at this point that the Iranian threat relates in any way to what happened yesterday. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sarah, this certainly adds to our broader understanding of the elevated threat level that Trump faces at this particular moment, and it raises more questions about the security concerns around Donald Trump, and particularly concerns about how now on two separate instances in two months, somebody was able to get that close to the former president with the apparent intention of assassinating him.And, look, like you mentioned, there is no indication at this point that the intelligence briefing related to an escalation in Iran's intentions to threaten the former president is related to what took place yesterday, but, again, it does come after we previously reported that Trump and his campaign were briefed previously on a similar Iranian threat. And an arrest was made in a plot to target Donald Trump in an assassination attempt effort. So, look, this taken together, this does add to our bigger picture understanding of the kind of threats, both foreign and domestic, that Donald Trump is facing. And for the Secret Service, it's really going to, again, make them go back to the drawing board and take stock of how they can protect Donald Trump from these various threats. I think, frankly, too, it's also adding to the picture of Iran and what Iran wants to see in this 50-day window leading up to the 2024 election. We previously reported that U.S. officials have said that Iran was behind a hack and leak operation also targeting the former president's campaign. Their intention is to undermine his efforts to get into the White House. So, Iran really has Donald Trump in their sights and they really want to do everything they can to prevent him from retaking the White House as we lead up to 2024. I want to go back to this briefing that happened within the last roughly a week or so ago. And the briefing was both about physical threats against Donald Trump as well as cyber threats. So, a range of possible concerns, both related to Trump's personal security and this election interference effort targeting Donald Trump at this moment in time, which is a critical moment in time as he's on the campaign trail trying to win the White House once again.",

Both Republicans and Democrats, frankly, Americans are very concerned that this is happening. I'm very proud of President Trump. He -- the sad part is, Kate, we're not going to be talking about the assassination tempt. We're going to be talking about which one. I mean, that should not happen.
