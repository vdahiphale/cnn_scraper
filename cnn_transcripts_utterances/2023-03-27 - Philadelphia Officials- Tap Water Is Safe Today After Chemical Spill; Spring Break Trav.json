They now say tap water is safe to drink until at least midnight.But before that, city officials sent out a push alert to residents recommending they use bottled water -- bottled water instead. That advisory led to bottled water flying off store shelves as you'd imagine. And residents are now wondering who to believe. CNN's Danny Freeman is in Philadelphia. Danny, yes, what's going on there?",

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, I got to say there's been a lot of whiplash in Philadelphia over this issue over the past 24 hours. As you said, the city is saying unequivocally the water in taps in the city of Philadelphia is safe to drink at this moment.There has been no contamination in that water. But as you mentioned, a lot of the residents of Philadelphia are not quite convinced and not taking the government's word for it just yet. So, let me see if I can break down how this confusion started. The chemical spill actually happened back on Friday night in Bucks County. It's about 20 miles north of where we are. It happens just off the Delaware River. But the Delaware River is, of course, one of the places where Philadelphia gets most of its water from. So, the Coast Guard, the State Department of Environmental Protection, they were all out trying to clean it up. But on Sunday morning, the city of Philadelphia decided to alert the press and alert the city. Hey, there is this contamination that happened in the river. We're just out of an abundance of caution letting you know. And then Sunday afternoon around one o'clock, they sent out that push alert to all the residents in the city saying we recommend to use bottled water, again out of an abundance of caution. Well, people waited and then they went to the stores like this Acme behind me. They rushed to get bottles water -- pickup bottles of water, there was a rush -- a lot of empty store shelves but then later that night, the city came back with another push alert and said now we are telling you for sure the tap water is safe to drink and it will be safe to drink until Monday night. So, tonight basically until midnight. But again, we've been out here at this supermarket in South Philly today and people are still buying water. Take a listen to what one resident told us just a little while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But they are taking more water in from the Delaware River today. And they're testing that now to see basically what happens at midnight tonight. And then alert Philadelphians whether or not they can start drinking the tap water when Tuesday comes around. So, again, we're monitoring updates from the city. We'll bring that to you as soon as we have it, Amara.",

      "sentences": "That's the big question, Amara, and the big concern of travel groups. They say it's not really the spring break travel crowds that are keeping people away from traveling but really the challenges that airlines and aviation have been going through lately.The TSA says right now though, we are in the spring break travel peak. Just yesterday, it screened 2.5 million people at airports across the country. That number is interesting because it's only about 4000 people off from the same day back in 2019 before the pandemic. In fact, Thursday and Friday, the numbers were above the same day back in 2019. But the U.S. Travel Association says these numbers could be bigger because travelers are seeing headline after headline, meltdown after meltdown at the airlines not only industry-wide last summer but also at Southwest Airlines over the holidays, the single-day meltdown at the FAA back in January. The U.S. Travel Association hopes that this spring break travel period will be smooth, but it highlights these problems as we go into the busy summer rush. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEOFF FREEMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, U.S. TRAVEL: The air travel system is under great stress. We're seeing it. We're seeing it with delays. We're seeing it with cancellations. Perhaps we're seeing it with some of the safety concerns that are happening around the country. And that is leading some travelers to say you know what, I would travel more if we could fix that air travel experience. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You might be able to snag a deal, Hopper says by saving maybe $150 of your book on a day that's a little quieter like Tuesday or Wednesday. Also, try and book the first flight out if you can. That's the best way, Amara, to try and minimize on those delays and cancellations.",

He is a senior member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Armed Services Committee. Congressman, thank you so much for your time. So, you just heard there, you know, Pete laying out all the issues of air travel that we've seen recently, do you think the aviation industry is ready for this spring rush and the coming summer days? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI, (D-CA): Well, we're certainly going to find out. The proof is going to be known in the next several days as people get into the airplanes and travel. We do know that this industry has had plenty of trouble. This shutdown during the pandemic event trying to get back up and operating across this nation has been a very, very difficult thing for the airlines, but also for the traveling public and certainly for the airports and the FAA. I think over time, there's going to be a much better experience. New airplanes are coming online, and that'll be helpful. Also, the FAA, we're going to go through the reauthorization of it this year in the committee, and we absolutely must make sure that they have the personnel that they have the direction, and they have the money to carry out their tasks of airline safety at the airports. The infrastructure bill that passed a year and a half ago. It has a lot of money for improving the airport facilities across the nation. And also, a piece of that is a bill that I introduced that provides low-cost loans to the airports so that they can upgrade their facilities. Is there going to get better in the future? I certainly hope so because I'm a constant flyer.",

I mean, we still don't have a permanent FAA administrator.In fact, President Biden's pick to run the FAA has now withdrawn his nomination. We heard Republicans some of those who had posed his nomination, criticizing him for lacking experience in the industry. What's your take on this?",

I do want to ask you, Congressman, about the current debate in Washington over TikTok.Speaker Kevin McCarthy is now saying the House bill will push ahead with the bill to ban the app. TikTok CEO, as you know, testified before Congress last week, but of course, McCarthy and others just don't seem convinced. He tweeted, it's very concerning that the CEO of TikTok can't be honest and admit what we already know to be true, China has access to TikTok user data. Where do you fall on this?",

President Biden has been pushing this issue for some time and he said, either sell it or get out of the United States. We're not the only country in the world that has the same concerns. Many others do. And it is a legitimate concern. So, good. McCarthy's on board with President Biden. We'll get this thing done. And TikTok should not be there.But I want also, for all of us to be very, very, very much aware that our privacy is not only a TikTok issue. All of the social media platforms collect our information. And our privacy is basically for sale to the highest bidder out there that wants to engage in some sort of an advertising program. And then you can add the algorithms that feed us information that may be correct, but it certainly leads us down the rabbit hole of keeping us ill-informed about the broader world. Those algorithms really narrow our personal focus on what's going on in the world. And that's not good for democracy. It's not good for our individual lives.",

There's Prince Harry and Elton John, who are friends, of course. They were taking Associated Newspapers to a court or trying to take them to trial along with Sadie Frost, the actress, and Liz Hurley. They accused the newspaper of breaching their privacy effectively. The newspaper says all of these allegations are preposterous smears. But essentially, what those people are suggesting, these high-profile individuals is that they become aware of compelling and highly distressing evidence that they've been victims of abhorrent criminal activity and gross breaches of privacy by Associated Newspapers which owns the Daily Mail. Things like putting listening devices into people's cars and homes, phone hacking, obtaining medical and banking information. Prince Harry's inside. We don't know whether or not he's meeting other members of his family. I know that Prince William isn't able to meet him or King Charles because they're not in London or in Windsor at the moment.
