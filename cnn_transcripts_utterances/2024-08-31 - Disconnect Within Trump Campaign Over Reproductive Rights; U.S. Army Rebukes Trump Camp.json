When I heard about it, I disagreed with it. At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation, that way you can do an abortion in the ninth month.

Now, this comes at a time that is pretty inconvenient for any Republican presidential nominee to be sort of vacillating on abortion and abortion rights.It's only a few weeks or a few days -- it's only less than 100 days until the election.

Meanwhile, some of the extremists who supported him all along are pushing even further and helping to make the case that the Harris-Walz ticket has been making.

And on a more micro level, in terms of our communities, you know, many parents feel like they're playing tug of war between parenting and working, and it is important to help each other out in community.The opposite of isolation is connection. And so, no matter where you are on the parenting spectrum, you know, whether you have young kids or teenagers, being able to check in with one another, normalize the struggle. We're all just trying to keep our head above water and really offer a helping hand. So, maybe it's going over to a neighbor's house and allowing them to shower while you hold their infant, or it's offering to pick a child up from a practice after school. We need to help each other and lighten our loads, as well as recognizing that it's OK to say no and not compare our life to somebody else based on what we see on social media or just from our neighbors.",
