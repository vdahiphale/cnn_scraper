People have been lobbying for them for the past few years, either directly to Trump on TV through fundraising. A lot of people around him are his friends, through think like America First Action. So yes, there's a whole crew of people around Trump. And while there are a ton of loyalists, and I think Trump is placing a bigger premium on loyalists this time around, then maybe central casting or other factors, I do think at the end of the day we might see a few dark horses and they just might be bigger name brands, especially when it comes to the economy. Like if someone like Jamie Diamond or Steve Schwarzman raised their hand, one of these titans of industry on Wall Street, I could see Trump skipping over some people that he has already had around him, like Bob Lighthizer for someone like that just because it would give him a sense of power over the biggest names in the industry.

Senator Marco Rubio is a client of Susie Wiles, or was a client of Susie Wiles. He's from south Florida where Susie is from. He is seen as a neocon, though, and that sort of cancels him out in terms of running for V.P. His name was up there with Doug Burgum, with J.D. Vance, and Susie pushed really hard for him, but I do think there might be some problems with the America first agenda and Marco Rubio and where he stands in a lot of issues. So he might have to not just come up against Susie Wiles but Don Jr.And I think this idea that Susie is going to completely block the clown show, she wasn't able to do that on the campaign and I don't think she's going to be able to do that in the White House either. Trump likes to have a kitchen cabinet. He has a ton of people around him. All she can try to try to be savvy and maneuver within the environment that she is in. That's how she survived for so you. She is one of the longest standing top staffers around Trump, and it's mainly because she hasn't pushed back that much. She won't be the traditional gatekeeper, like a chief of staff.",

Vance. And for as much criticism as Trump got in the end, he brought them over the line with that group of voters that he was supposed to target, right, those young, first-time, low propensity bro voters.And so I think this win, J.D., has actually just given Don Jr. some more clout. And we know where Don Jr., and he stands ideologically to the right. Steve Bannon, I don't think he's going to have a lot of clout. I'm going to be honest with you right now. I know he speaks with Trump from time to time, but I think that voice that said the party is here, the party is here, you need to run with the party, has been replaced by people more like J.D. and Don Jr. who are not as far right as Steve Bannon, but they are not that far away.

And for the sake of the country, I hope so. But let's keep in mind, and enough people aren't talking about this. One of Donald Trump's chief of staff, General Kelly, came in for this exact reason, guardrails. He was exhausted by this, and ultimately, Donald Trump, who may have been said, look, I want guardrails around me, ultimately pushed him away because there were these people, the show that's walking by his office every day, and he always draws it in and gets distracted by the shiny red ball.So for the sake of the country, yes, I hope she can come in and enact discipline because that is really important for a president.

So half of the country is obviously dissatisfied and disappointed.There is an advantage, frankly, to the Republicans having won everything, which is they actually get an opportunity to show America what their agenda is. They are confident that their agenda is going to be beneficial for America. We'll see. And if it's not, America will see that. So yes, in the short-term, I do think Donald Trump probably has more power than he came in with in 2016 because he had lost the popular vote in 16. It was seen as kind of an aberration that he won. But he did, by the way, we had a majority in the House and Senate, so we still could do our things. This time, yes, he came in with a stronger mandate, but he is not up for reelection. And usually a president that is not up for reelection in many cases is a little weaker. Now, what is working in Donald Trump's favor? He has a Congress that will not oppose him. But again, it's kind of like the dog that caught the car. OK, fine, you have a compliant House and Senate now. What is your agenda? And I've asked people, obviously there's deportations and everything else. What is a proactive, positive agenda by Trump, and I don't know what that is. I'm not sure he articulated it.",
