I'm Isa Soeres coming to you from London.And there are growing signs this very hour that Israeli troops are nearing a potential ground invasion into Gaza. We are following breaking news for you on the Israel Hamas war this hour. The IDF telling CNN that its troops are \"increasing operational readiness\" for the next stages of war. Troops and tanks have been massing near Gaza for days, as you can see there on your screen. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the front lines, offering words of support, telling them to be ready. All this as Israel continues to pound Gaza with airstrikes in response to those devastating terror attacks by Hamas last weekend, of course. Israel has called for 1.1 million civilians, that's half the population to leave their homes and move southwards. And tens of thousands of Palestinians are already fleeing. Hamas, however, is telling Gazans to stay put. Hospitals say they can't and won't leave because doing so would be a death sentence for their patients, while the U.N. says ordering more than a million people to leave defies the rules of war and basic humanity. Let's get the very latest. Our Becky Anderson joins me now from Tel Aviv. And Becky, just bring me up to date. I mean, we saw the response from the IDF in the last hour. It says its forces are increasing operational readiness for the next stages of war. What is your sense on the ground, Becky, of how imminent this may be?",

And many things that are happening in real-time.In addition to that, we have told the population, go south. We will ensure the open corridors and the ability of you to go south, and we urge you to go south. OK. That's where we stand. It's less about hours and about timing, and it's more about the outcome. We want to see more Palestinians heed our warnings and go south so that we can continue and to enhance the operations with a minimal effect on civilians. Of course, there is an effect on civilians, and we are very much aware of the situation in Gaza. I don't think that any war can ever happen without the effect on civilians We are trying to minimize it. And in order to be able to minimize it, they need to listen to our warnings and disregard the efforts and the statements made by Hamas to force them to stay in a very dangerous area that is going to become more dangerous.",

If they choose to do that, then they would, by their own actions, perhaps bring back a much better situation that they themselves caused.Hamas bears full responsibility for everything that has happened so far, the butchering of Israeli civilians and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. They are the ones who have mismanaged the very general international aid to Gaza and used it for military purposes. They are the ones who are using the civilian infrastructure to build and to conduct military operations, which is a war crime, indirect violation of international law. They are the ones who are holding people hostage, our people, and their own people, telling them, don't evacuate. How cynical and how brutal is -- we are trying to do everything -- possible while we are at war to minimize the damage to civilians. They are not our enemies. We are not actively targeting them.

We do watch before, and if there is a special situation of many civilians, and definitely children, or anything else that we see, and there are times that we avoid striking, even when there's a military necessity, even when it really serves our military purposes, if we see noncombatants, then we have averted strikes, many of them, in this war and in previous rounds, and that is our practice.Unfortunately, children are affected. That's not the aim. And we try to conduct our operations again to minimize that. And again, calling on civilians to evacuate is the humane thing to do. We're trying -- we're telling them, get away, including children, get away. Obviously, the parents are responsible. But get away from this active combat zone and care for your own safety. And it is never our intention to kill civilians. We are going to punish Hamas. We are going to strike their military capabilities. And at the end of this, I think once we are done with Hamas, the humanitarian situation in Gaza will be much, much better because there won't be a terrorist organization that controls their lives, mismanages the international aid that has been flowing into Gaza for so many years and governed in a proper way. Once Hamas is gone militarily, the situation in Gaza will be better and it is Hamas, they have the option and the agency to directly alleviate the situation.",

Indeed, there were shortcomings, but I want to assure you all of our active intel collection capabilities are zeroed in and focused on Gaza. We, of course, are looking and listening at what's happening in Lebanon with Hezbollah. And we always have our ears towards Iran, which is the source of the evil here.But for the purposes of targeting, there is an, unfortunately, well experienced mechanism of collecting intelligence, analyzing it, classifying it and then approving a target, which by the way, has a component of a legal adviser. Is this a legitimate military target? Is the strike proportionate, and does it serve the military aim? And each and every target that is struck, even in real-time, when it happens fast and we see an important target come up, for instance, a Hamas commander, finally, there's to expose himself and isn't hiding underground, like the cowards that they are, even then there's a process of input of legal advisers. So, it is clear. And yes, I stand behind the intelligence 100 percent. We know how to do this, despite the fact that there were shortcomings in other parts of our intelligence. Now, to the second part. We did incursions into Gaza in order to help us solve the 1,300-piece puzzle that we unfortunately find ourselves against. Meaning, 1,300 dead Israelis having to understand to identify all of the bodies and to understand who is dead, who is missing, and who is presumed alive or dead and hostage. And the raids into Gaza helped us with additional information. I cannot say it's a breakthrough, but definitely additional valuable information that serves to help and understand where they're being held. And most importantly, how we can get them out.",

Our Salma Abdelaziz has more. We want to warn you now that some of the images in her report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This is what running for your life looks like in Gaza. An ambulance with a young girl and wounded woman inside rocked by explosions as they attempt to flee. It is unclear what happened to the pair, but they're among the tens of thousands of people on the move after Israel's military called on nearly half of Gaza's population, some 1.1 million people to get south in a matter of hours. But along the safe passages specified by the IDF, utter horror. You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Salahuddin Street, one of the designated evacuation routes. In the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings. CNN has geolocated this video and four other clips from the horrifying scene. The U.N. calls Israel's evacuation advisory impossible and a violation of the rules of war. And Palestinian officials accuse the IDF of bombing civilians even as they fled. Dozens of evacuees were killed or wounded by Israeli airstrikes according to Hamas. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals. And again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. What did the children do to deserve this? This woman says. Did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead. The only survivor is a two-year-old girl. The health care system is on the brink. A complete siege, making it impossible to get aid into the enclave. And already, there's a shortage of everything, even space in the morgue. We're keeping the dead in ice cream trucks so the bodies don't rot, this doctor says. Gaza is in crisis. Gaza needs help. For those still able to move south, this is one of the neighborhoods families are expected to flee towards, Hanus (ph), where Israeli airstrikes have wreaked havoc. This is a genocide, not a war. It's genocide, this man says. And it's an attempt to force all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Finding refuge is proving dangerous and deadly. And for the many families desperate for shelter, the fear is there may be no safe places left. Salma Abdulaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That area is claimed by both Lebanon as well as Israel.

We're at high alert, and we're taking all the necessary precautions to be prepared for a front on Lebanon. We -- and I would take advantage to tell Hezbollah, look very closely at what's happening to Hamas in Gaza.

The Israelis say that 30 mortar rounds were fired from Lebanese territory into Israel. Hezbollah put out a statement that they had struck five Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms area, which is a disputed area between Lebanon and Israel, and that they were able to struck -- strike, for instance, a surveillance position of the Israelis. Now, the Israelis say that in the course of that exchange of fire, they saw what they called a terrorist cell, about to launch a guided missile in the direction of an Israeli position that they hit that cell in an airstrikes.

And that includes, according to you, have combined and coordinated strikes from the air, from sea and from land. How do you envisage this taking place and how soon do you think this may take place?",

And the reason I say that is because a military force that is ready to invade is kind of like a coiled spring, it's ready to go, it's cocked into action. And once you're there, you almost have to go forward unless you are pulled back, and that is -- pulling back is sometimes a harder exercise than going forward for a variety of logistical and political sometimes reasons. So, that becomes, I think, the main issue. That's why I think this is going to happen fairly quickly.The one thing that could stop that would be perhaps a deference to Secretary Blinken, who is still in the area of the Middle East, and that could potentially delay things. But from a military standpoint, I think we're very close to something happening.",

They know the land, the layout of the land better than the IDF. How will they be preparing here? How concerned should IDF soldiers be about the fight inside of Gaza using anti-tank and anti- armor missiles?",

      "sentences": "Yes, especially using those anti-tank and anti-armor weapons you can expect that the Hamas folks have really prepared themselves quite well. They've had, in essence, all of the 17 or so years that they've been in charge, they have used that time to prepare.We have seen the training videos that Hamas has put out there. We have seen their ability to mount surprise operations. So, the surprise operations that they conducted against Israel last weekend, they will have similar surprises in store for any IDF soldier that comes their way. And IDF soldiers can expect to be confronted by a very crafty, very wily opponent, and that is, I think, something that is easy to underestimate when it comes to the intelligence assessments of something like this. But hopefully, the Israelis will have learned certain lessons when it comes to this so that they can be prepared for this.",

Many of them had served in the Israeli Defense Forces and want to get back and be a part of that.It was emotional. Some of the family members were there. There were some 150 people in the middle of the night at Los Angeles International Airport to be on this flight, something that has been pulled together within just days by a nonprofit, a humanitarian organization called Israel Friends. And they did this within just a few numbers of days. They had no expertise on how to get a plane, how to charter a flight, but they were able to do that. But just to give you an idea of what these people were talking about and what they're leaving, I want you to listen to one man, David Frankel, who -- when the war first broke out, he made sure to get his family out, his two young sons and his wife here to where they have family in Southern California. But he is going back to fight. Take a listen to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
