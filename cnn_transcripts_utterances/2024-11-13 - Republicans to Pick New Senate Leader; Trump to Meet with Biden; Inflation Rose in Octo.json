You know, this decision today from Melania Trump to not join her husband at this White House visit could be emblematic of some bigger dynamics that could be coming as the first lady returns to the White House a second time. Our colleagues have reported that she could be spending a good amount of time actually in New York City and Palm Beach, and that actually she may not even be moving to Washington, D.C., full-time. This, of course, could end up effecting where Donald Trump spends his time on the weekends, for example. This was something that we saw during the first term and not so different from how the Biden's have spent a lot of time on the weekends in Rehoboth or Wilmington. So, again, I think this is just one more reminder of a way in which we fully expect the Trump presidency to, in many ways, not be traditional, Kate.",

Now, despite the fact that Vance is in the room today, this ballot is going to be a secret. That means that no one is going to know how senators voted. I will say that we have seen a large number of lawmakers going in. And I was just tabulating in my head, some of them, many of them have not said publicly who they are backing. That is intentional, because the reality is, whoever wins this race today, they're going to have to work with. And the last thing you want to do is irritate or frustrate the man who is going to eventually lead your Republican conference. Now, it may take some time, John, to be able to tabulate these votes. And they may have to do multiple ballots of voting if no one gets the majority. And today that special number is 27 right off of the top. So, this could take a considerable amount of time. We expect nominating speeches for each of the men running. And just a couple of notable speeches that will be happening behind closed doors today. Steve Daines, who led the Republicans to win the majority just last week, he is going to be giving a nominating speech for John Thune, the current Republican whip who's vying for this job. We also expect that Marco Rubio, a fellow Floridian, is going to be giving a nominating speech for Senator Rick Scott. So, a lot happening just in a couple of seconds at this point, John.",

The chaotic scene that we later saw described by journalists of people literally flowing in and out of the Oval Office without anybody there to sort of stop them, so that people are almost - almost casually dropping in and sort of helping him make policy on the spot.I think now that people know what can go wrong and what can happen, I think people are going to adjust their strategies, and people are going to be very focused and very determined to get specific policies accomplished and to let a lot of the rest of the chaos go.

Also, Media Matters has publicly expressed interest in bidding for this. Again, we don't know exactly what is bidding because they have signed these - these NDAs.
