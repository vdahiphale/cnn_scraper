So, we expect more of those documents to sort of be exchanged in court today.However, we learned in court paperwork filed yesterday that prosecutors are asking for another status conference hearing in about 30 days. And they say that's because the two sides are in talks to strike some sort of plea deal, saying, \"the goal of resolving this matter without the need for a trial.\" Now, listen, George Santos actually sat down with our local affiliate, WCBS, and discussed and hinted at the fact that he might strike a deal.

Nobody likes to see higher prices. But only up 0.1 percent. The year over year number cooling a little bit to 3.1 percent.But what we saw in this report is that energy prices fell significantly. And that's because gas prices have fallen in recent months. So, you have gas prices falling month-over-month by 6 percent year over year, falling by almost 9 percent. But the reason why we didn't see a more significant decline in this report is because shelter is still really expensive. Rents, housing, what people are paying, that was up 0.4 percent month-over-month and up 6.5 percent year over year. Some slightly good news at the grocery store. Prices are still up, but cooling. So, month-over-month, up 0.2 percent. Year over year, 2.9 percent. That is cooling from the month prior and the year over year number that we saw in October. But if you take this big report and look at it -- sort of step back and look at it, it's important because the Federal Reserve is meeting today and they're going to be talking about all the data that they've seen over the last couple months. This report will signal to them that they could, tomorrow, the announcement will come, but they could pause interest rate hikes. And that is such good news for the U.S. consumer as they look to next year because ultimately it paves the way for potentially cutting of interest rates. And for everyone who wants to buy a new home, mortgage rates, who's paying a lot on their credit cards, student loans, auto loans, it's really important to see this trending in the right direction with interest rates so people feel like they don't have to spend a lot on interest to pay for everything else. So, a really nice report that we're seeing today. And I think consumers, hopefully, will start to feel this, because consumer sentiment for the last couple month has been on declining. But in the beginning of this month we saw consumers actually starting to feel a little bit better about the economy. Even our CNN polling showed that many Americans just feel like despite these good economic reports, the economy is not in great shape. Maybe this will help people feel like prices are cooling still a little bit and they'll feel a little bit better about the economy.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): The White House recently sent a letter -- after these committees issued subpoenas to the White House, the White House sent a letter back and says you haven't held an impeachment inquiry vote yet and we're not going to give you any records until you pass an impeachment inquiry.

And the rationale was the same in terms of their facing obstruction, they needed more tools, legal tools to get documents. I understand what you're saying about the difference between what the Trump counsel's office was doing versus what the Biden counsel's office is doing in practice on the documents, but I think my question right now is, didn't you guys kind of lay the groundwork for everything the Republicans are doing right now?",

But, of course, that is not the case. The White House and the administration has been unbelievably cooperative with a fishing expedition of an investigation. They have given essentially the Republicans every single thing they've asked for.And you don't have to take my word for it. James Comer said it several months ago when he said he had 100 percent cooperation from the administration. This is an investigation in search of facts. There are allegations that are completely unfounded. And every single time a Republican is asked to point to specific, direct evidence linking Joe Biden to any misconduct, they are unable to because it does not exist.

And there was recent polling which had almost a two to one margin that more Republicans would be unlikely to vote for their incumbent sitting congressperson than they would be more likely to vote if they went forward with impeachment. So, let's talk to the American people, the ones who are going to decide who is in the House majority, and their overwhelmingly against this impeachment investigation because they know that it is completely baseless, that it is completely partisan, for political purposes, and that it is moving forward at the direction of their dear leader, Donald Trump, who wants retribution for his own impeachments.",

Campuses all around the country are unsafe right now for Jewish students. And this is not the First Amendment. This is a code of conduct by -- within the universities that requires the university to protect their students, all students, under Title 6 of the civil rights law, and under their own code of conduct. And if they are unable to do that, and Harvard has had multiple incidents of outright harassment and threats and borderline violence. And if they're unable to do that, then that is a violation of their code of conduct.
