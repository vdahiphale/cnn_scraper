At least 34 people have died from storm-related events in Erie County alone.One of the victims was 22-year-old Andel Taylor, who was found dead after being trapped in her car. She was just six minutes away from her home. CNN's Athena Jones brings us the latest from Buffalo. That is heartbreaking to hear, how close she was. Athena, there's still a driving ban in Buffalo, correct?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Sara. That's exactly right. Authorities want people to stay off the roads. They say, though, they'll readdress, they'll take a look again at this idea of a driving ban overnight depending on how much snow they're able to clear.I want you to look at this mountain of snow behind me. That has been building up since this morning. In fact, earlier this morning, trucks stopped dumping snow here, thinking maybe it was too much. They started a new pile. You can probably make out the truck driving away. He just came to dump a new load. Part of that load is frozen in the back of his truck. We also have some drone footage that was shot by our CNN photojournalist, Jeff Mills, which gives a closer look of the mountain of snow, which, by the way, is at least two or three stories high. It's higher than the two-story houses around here. He also shot footage of neighborhoods around here showing what it takes to get more than four feet of snow out of the way. That is continuing. As you mentioned, the National Guard this morning doing door-to-door checks both in the city and suburbs where people lost power to make sure they have what they need, if they don't have food and help that they get help there. We also know police and others are going door-to-door to check on folks that they weren't able to respond to during the blizzard. There were some 1,100 unchecked emergency service calls. They were unchecked because the roads were impassible. This is why people got stuck and died. And so they're now down, as of a couple hours ago, they were down to about 200 to 300. That's a lot of door-to-door checking. Of course, the continued effort to clear the snow from the streets. The goal, according to the Erie County executive, Mark Poloncarz, to make sure one lane of traffic is open in every single street of Buffalo so that the city can operate well, so emergency services can operate well. Here's what he had to say about the importance of checking on people, though, in these neighborhoods. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The goal is to have at least one lane cleared everywhere across the city of Buffalo by tomorrow morning. The county executive said the county roads, the area that the countyis in charge of, they believe they'll have those roads cleared mostly by 7:00 p.m. tonight. So, the idea is to work as much as possible. We've seen loads and loads and loads of trucks picking up snow all around the city. Snow that's been piled up in one neighborhood. And bring it to the larger piles here. So that is going to continue. We've also seen a lot of snow melting already. It's just above freezing.

Just in the recent past, you had five feet or six feet of snow, just last month.

Lots of different kinds of machines to move it out of the way.But I do have to ask you some back and forth that has happened because politics does come into play in the days after something like this happens. The Erie County Commissioner Mark Poloncarz and the Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, the commissioner is criticizing the mayor in the cleanup, saying the mayor hasn't been in daily contact with other municipalities that seem to be doing better. What are your thoughts on this? And has there been communication from your vantage point?",

And the county executive has been in contact with me throughout the storm and says that he has not had contact with the mayor's administration.And I just -- at this time, don't want to put politics -- because we're still digging ourselves out of this storm. But we are going to have to do an autopsy after this blizzard and figure out how municipalities can work together to better address disasters like this. As you said, the city of Buffalo, we're prone to snow and we're prone to extreme weather like this. So we really need to get on the best foot forward for our residents.",

This is after becoming a viral weight loss hit on apps including TikTok and Facebook.Senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is joining me now. There are some huge articles on this that I have been seeing. It's become a favorite in a lot of places, including Hollywood. How big is the problem? And what's it doing for those people who actually want to use this for the thing it was meant for, which is diabetes? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: So, Sara, this is becoming a problem for some people with diabetes. They rely on this medicine to control their blood sugar levels. And they're not able to get it because people are using it for weight loss. Now, to be clear, weight loss is also a legitimate use for this drug if you're over a certain weight. The problem is that people are using it where it's not necessarily clear that they really medically need it. And that can be taking it away from people who do medically need it for diabetes. So, let's take a look at what the maker of this drug says. The makers of Ozempic say, \"There are intermittent supply disruptions of some dosages of Ozempic, due to the combination of incredible demand, coupled with overall global supply constraints.\" So, they do have some parts of their Web site where they sort of help guide people through. And they explain all of this. But really, that's a fancy way of saying there are shortages, for some people, in some parts of the country. And doctors are having to really try hard to figure out how to help their patients -- Sara?",
