He can't even avoid this vote because a member can force a vote to expel a member of Congress by the way they draft it and the way the New York Republican freshman -- the vulnerable Republican freshman did is they are essentially forcing this vote, trying to go after one of their own because of the charges that George Santos has faced. Charges Santos has pleaded not guilty despite facing this federal indictment.Nevertheless, the vote is expected later tonight. And in order for this to succeed, it would require a support of two-thirds of the full House. We do expect all house Democrats to vote to expel George Santos. The question is going to be how many Republicans would vote for it. We expect that to be, if they need to succeed, about 77 House Republicans to side with their New York Republican freshman to kick George Santos out of the House. At the moment, the expectation is that they will fall short of that because the House Ethics Committee announced just yesterday that they are still investigating the matter, that they will not make a final decision about what their recommendation is until November 17th or perhaps earlier. So a lot of Republicans will say, let's wait for the House Ethics Committee to make its decision, then we will decide about whether to kick out George Santos. But, Dana, make no mistake about it, this is a very serious moment for Santos, for the Republican majority, for a seat that could flip to the Democratic side of the aisle because if the House Ethics recommends expulsion, almost certainly more and more Republicans will seek to kick him out. And that could happen in a matter of just a couple of weeks here. So, this vote here will be telling to see how close they get to that two-thirds majority. Dana?",

He doesn't have, I mean, you know Dana from covering politics for a long time, you start to develop a feel for where the pitfalls are, the land mines are, the things you have to avoid, the things you have to work on.

Someone who aligns himself with them on a host of issues and on this, right now, the base, the Republican base, those Republican congressmen are saying that they don't want to support Ukraine anymore. That they don't -- and that apparently also in this bill, it doesn't have any humanitarian aid for Gaza as well, which was in the president's initial request. So yes, he's at odds with Senate Republicans, although there is some waffling among some Senate Republicans also in their support for Ukraine. But you're going to see him have to come face to face with Mitch McConnell as well as Senate Democrats who consider this a totally unserious proposal, because of the fact that it's not something that any Democrats would support and you have to have Democratic votes for it to get to the president's desk.",
