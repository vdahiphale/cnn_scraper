Also, the President is operating within a media environment where he's had -- what his team has had to say that he's not anti-British today.He's offending some people on different sides of this. Do you think that that was a conciliatory speech and one that might encourage the restoration of Stormont?",

What, if any, tangible impact do you think you can leave behind from a trip that has been really hyped up for many months?",

      "sentences": "The tangible thing that you'll leave behind is envoy to Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III whose remit is all about business. And, of course, that was the other part of President Biden speeches is what we're expecting.The idea that encouraged the economy here, the President spoke about how the economy in Northern Ireland has doubled, almost doubled over the past 25 years. And he believed that it could triple again. He said, there are many, many U.S. businesses that would like to invest in here. So that tangible thing that President Biden will leave behind will be that special envoy, Joe Kennedy, to try to infuse American investors and businesses in Northern Ireland. And there are plenty of them here already in Northern Ireland, as we saw when we were out talking to business leaders here, and CEOs of various companies. They feel the business here is doing well, and there is plenty of opportunity. So I think that's the tangible -- that speech was aspirational. I think we're going to have to wait to see how that can be delivered on. And let's not forget, Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist Party leader was in the White House, will have had conversations around St. Patrick's Day with the President. But, you know, don't expect immediate results but there may be a trickledown effect.",

There's been a bit of chatter in media over here about Biden emphasizing or prioritizing these personal events rather than the political discussions, which seem to have been a bit confused in their choreography?O'SULLIVAN: Yes. I mean, obviously, in -- particularly in the British press, there has been a lot of talk about how it can be viewed as a snub, that he is coming to Ireland for multiple days to see cousins, and he's not going to the carnation next month. You know, I think the White House has pointed out that the First Lady will be attending. But this is, you know, something we have seen from Biden down through the years. As you showed in those clips there, you know, occasionally making jokes that would be more inclined towards nationalists and Republicans in Ireland, which of course, I think he was very careful, I'm sure, to stay away from that, as -- in his time in Northern Ireland this week.",
