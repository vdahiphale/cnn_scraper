At least 100 flights out of Hartsfield International Airport have been cancelled. A majority of those flights are going to upstate New York, Illinois, as well as parts Texas. There are two flights that are going out to California that have also been cancelled. The numbers nationwide, they're not a whole lot better. We're talking about well over 1,500 flights that have been cancelled across the U.S., another -- about 1,200 or so flights have been delayed. Here at the airport, things, again, busy, manageable. Folks are just trying to make sure that they get here with enough time. There's an entire assist agent side to the Delta Terminal where folks there are trying to trouble shoot their itineraries considering that chances are they're probably going to be delayed if they're trying to get to certain parts of the U.S. And then just on the other side of where we are, of course, is the TSA pre-check line. Folks there are making a line just trying to get their travel plans through. We caught up with two passengers who told us their flights were around 10:00 this morning.

It really is already baked in.But what it does do is it just provides a lot more connective tissue and all of that could matter in the criminal investigations. And that is the DOJ's investigation of what happens next on the criminal front could absolutely have an impact on the 2024 field. But I also think, politically, we're going to see Republicans in the New House majority in Congress in January immediately start to investigate the investigation. So, I think that's the way the political narrative is going to go. But what Republicans are thinking about in terms of 2024 is not the primary so much as how this could impact the general election. And what you're seeing is Donald Trump's overall national approval numbers going down to lows not seen since before he became the nominee the first time around, back in the 2016 race. So, republicans are thinking about how they could win in 2024. And they don't like the Donald Trump bet for the general election.",

McConnell seems to have moved further away. But if Republicans are discussing with Trump but saying they will back him anyway if he's a nominee, I'm not sure what it adds up to.

But immigration is such a powerful political hammer for Republicans right now. And, look, they're talking about impeaching, you know, Mayorkas. So, it's just hard to imagine an impeachment, political theater on Mayorkas and then an immigration deal somehow happening at the same time.

I think the immigration deals are, right now, really going to be in the realm of helping avoid government shutdowns by procedural votes.

New data from the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation says, prices have increased five and a half percent last month from a year earlier. That's a little bit lower than October when prices rose just more than six percent compared to the same time last year. That news comes as the White House says, it is cautiously optimistic that the economy will bounce back next year.So, let's get some perspective now. Joining us is CNN's Economics and Political Commentator Catherine Rampell. She is also an opinion columnist at \"The Washington Post.\" Catherine, good morning to you.

Obviously, people can't cut back on how much gas they need to fill up their tank if they have to drive to work, they have to take their kids to school, et cetera. So, this is definitely a good thing on its phase.The question is why are gas prices falling? And they're falling because of a mix of both good reasons and bad reasons. The good reasons would be some of those supply chain problems have unwound themselves. There was less of a disruption in global oil supply related to the sanctions placed on Russia earlier this month by the G7, as well as the E.U. specifically. That -- there was a fear that suddenly there was going to be much less access to oil globally, and that would cause prices to shoot up for both oil and gasoline. So, there are a number of reasons to think that there are good factors influencing the trends that we're seeing in gas prices -- oil prices and gas prices. However, part of the reason why gas prices have been declining is that there are still high risks of recession next year, including recession, actually, that's already ongoing probably in much of the world right now, including the E.U. and the U.K. And when there is a recession, there is much less demand for fuel, right? You have factories needing less energy. You have consumers going out and driving a little bit less, or otherwise feeling a little less flushed, so they cut back on how much energy they consume. So, some of the reason why gas prices are falling has to do with the fact that there are these expectations, that there could be a big drop in demand. And in fact, we already see demand declining to some extent, including the U.S. So, it's a -- obviously, we would rather have gas prices falling for good reason, that supply chains are normalizing rather than the bad reasons that there's a recession, that there are continued lockdowns in China, et cetera. But it's a little bit hard to parse how much you attribute to the good versus the bad at this point.",

Again, there are other countries in the world that are already experiencing recession. But we're talking about the U.S. I think there is still a high chance of recession. It's not inevitable.It does look like, as we've discussed, inflation has been coming down. Those prices are moderating -- price growth is moderating, even if it's not back where it was. And so far, the job market seems quite strong. Unemployment is close to record lows for example. So, in theory, it is still possible you that could get inflation coming back to something around normal without huge numbers of workers losing their jobs.

Yes, there were hundreds of individuals who were stuck in cars in the overnight hours. Two-thirds of the first responders that we sent out to try to get to individuals in life-threatening situations themselves got stuck. We're talking about fire, police, EMS. It was a horrible situation.The blizzard conditions are such that you cannot see beyond pretty much your windshield or the front of your vehicle. We had to pull our Department of Public Works plows off the roads. Everyone did. The state, the county because it was just so unsafe. Thankfully, conditions have cleared up a little bit in parts of the worst affected areas. Now, we've got plows on the roads again. But we're still going out there to do these lifesaving missions that's because unfortunately, people have been stuck in the cold, bitter cold. Windchills of minus 20 in the overnight hours. And the best thing we can do at this situation is just try to get to them one by one because this has just been a horrible, horrible storm. And we know snow in Buffalo.
