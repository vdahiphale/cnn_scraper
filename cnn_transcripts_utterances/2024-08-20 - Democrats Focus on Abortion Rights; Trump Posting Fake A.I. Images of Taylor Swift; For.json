Shawn, good to see you this morning. You don't have the jacket on, so I guess you can't take it off for us as you did last night on the convention floor. But you went after Donald Trump, called him a scab.For the voters out there who are wondering, well, what does all that mean? Can you explain that one for us? SHAWN FAIN, PRESIDENT, UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION:  Hey, thanks, Jim. And it's still hot out here, even from that last night. So, no, I mean, it's literally, you know, scabs, a term we use in organized labor for people that cross picket lines, people that don't respect workers' rights. And that's what Donald Trump is. You know, Donald Trump openly admitted with his, you know, billionaire puppeteer Elon Musk, you know, that he's taken $45 million a month from, that, you know, they laugh about the fact that they would fire striking workers. He laughed about the fact -- he's basically said that, you know, Elon Musk was, you know, a champion and, you know, celebrating the fact that he fired striking workers. And that's the big contrast between these two candidates, you know, between Trump and Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris stood on the picket line with striking workers. Joe Biden stood on the picket line with striking workers. Tim Walz stood on the picket line with striking workers, and Donald Trump wants to fire him. You know, it's a federally protected right to strike for better conditions on the job. And like all wealthy people, Donald Trump thumbs his nose at the law when it comes to working class people. And that's just wrong and we're going to call him out for what he is.",

Every time I speak to our members and speak publicly, like I tell them, this isn't my opinion, this isn't party politics.You look at these two candidates in their own words and their own actions, you put that side by side, and it's a very clear picture of who stands with labor, and who stands with working class people, and who doesn't give a damn about working class people. Donald Trump doesn't care about working class people. He serves one master, and that's the millionaire and the billionaire class. He doesn't care about workers. And you know, it's been shown through his actions for decades. I mean, he blamed striking -- he blamed the auto workers for the recession in 2008, 2009. It's a lie. You know, he talked about doing a rotation of our jobs in 2015 when he was running for president. Rotating the good paying jobs out of the Midwest to places where they pay less.

Working-class people in this country are hurting, but they're hurting because corporations took advantage of a pandemic and jack prices up. There was no means to do it. No need to do it. They did it because they got greedy and they wanted more, and they did it on the backs of the consumers.That's what caused this and that's what we got to rein in. And Kamala Harris understands that. You heard her talk about corporate greed. And you know, you don't hear Donald Trump say those words because that's who Donald Trump serves. So, again, we got to talk facts. We got to make people see the reality of why their weight -- why their conditions, why cost of living went up. It wasn't because of policy, it was because of people taking advantage of a pandemic, by the way, that Donald Trump denied even existed while millions of people died.
