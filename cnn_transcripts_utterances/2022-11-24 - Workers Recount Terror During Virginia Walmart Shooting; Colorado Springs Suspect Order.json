A lot to get to this morning on this special edition of NEWSROOM.Millions of Americans will gather today with families and loved ones for the holiday. Part of that tradition includes the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade which is kicking off right now in New York City. We're going to have live updates in just minutes. But first, this Thanksgiving will be a difficult one for so many families who've lost loved ones yet again to senseless gun violence just over the course of this past week. In a span of days a tragic spate of mass shootings from Colorado to Virginia has taken the lives of at least 11 people. This morning we're learning new details about the terrifying moments inside that Chesapeake, Virginia, Walmart. Overnight the community held a vigil to remember those killed there. And in Colorado, the suspect accused of opening fire inside an LGBTQ nightclub now being held without bond. A neighbor is revealing more about Anderson Lee Aldrich's troubled past, saying the suspect expressed hateful attitudes towards the gay community. Let's begin this hour with new details surrounding the deadly Walmart shooting. I know it's hard to keep track. CNN national correspondent Dianne Gallagher has the latest.

Some of them, at least one of them, directed at the gay community.The suspect used slurs to describe gay people but also had outbursts against other races, also. And, you know, Xavier Kraus is a 23-year- old young man with a job. And he said what really struck him was the kind of differences between his life and the suspect's life. Kraus lived in an apartment with his girlfriend. He has a job across the hallway. The suspect, 22 years old, similar age, lived there with his mom -- their mom and didn't appear to have any direction in life. Apparently the suspect, very smart, but very alone. Few other contacts. And you know, we saw during the appearance yesterday by video link from the jail cell behind me, the suspect was slumped, slurring, bruised head. And, you know, we've now also seen the mug shots which show just how beaten this suspect was. So that's just take us back to that night. Remember Rich Fierro, the army veteran hero, took the suspect down and then the suspect was kicked repeatedly in the head by a young naval officer, Thomas James, and a transwoman whose name we don't know.

What's so interesting about that is that number only about 6 percent off from where we were back in 2019 before the pandemic. We're pretty close to a pandemic-era air travel record, although not quite.The good news here is that things have been relatively smooth for passengers and airlines after they had really big cancellation problems over the summertime. 50,000 flights canceled in total. But just check FlightAware, just today so far, there have been only 28 flights canceled, 60 flights canceled yesterday. The superlative on Tuesday, United Airlines canceled zero flights network wide. That includes mainline and regional flights. At American Airlines, they operated 99.9 percent of all of their flights. That was the biggest schedule of any airline that had planned for the Thanksgiving rush. So things have been pretty, pretty good.

And back out to the west, on the colder side of this, there's actually snow coming down. So that could be a little problematic when it comes to driving.Back to what Pete said, I don't think I've ever heard of an airline never having one cancellation in a day. That was pretty amazing. So good travel today up and down the East Coast. 54 in New York City, 60s all the way up and down the coast. But then the rain comes through tonight and moves away for tomorrow. So there will be some rain that here will eventually get here. But another batch of showers begins to develop across parts of Texas. Again, a separate system and this is for Saturday night. Most people are going to be driving home on Sunday. And then guess where that goes? Right back up into the northeast again. So wet travel all the way -- all along I-95, I-85, 75, and then across here, the I-10 and the I-40 very, very wet for the next couple of days and even white in a few spots. So here's your airport delays for Saturday, looking pretty good. A couple of showers down here but minor delays.

Remember Pence has said there were profound separation of powers problems that were presented initially because the legislative branch was seeking testimony from the executive branch.But the DOJ is part of the executive branch. So that argument doesn't exist anymore. And because he's openly accused Trump of having recklessly endangered not only him but his wife and daughter who were present on Capitol Hill that day, I think he's waived the executive privilege argument as well. So I don't know how he could protect himself against a legitimately issued subpoena to testify in the criminal case. SCIUTTO: OK. So you don't believe he can protect himself.
