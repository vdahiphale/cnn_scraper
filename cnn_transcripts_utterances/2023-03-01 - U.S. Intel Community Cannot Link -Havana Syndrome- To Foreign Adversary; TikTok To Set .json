      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. This is after two years of intensive work by the intelligence community looking at the question of who or what caused these mysterious incidents now known as Havana Syndrome.And what the Intelligence Community assessment finds is that they weren't able to link any of these cases to a foreign adversary. That is why they are coming to the conclusion that it's unlikely that a foreign adversary was involved in these Havana Syndrome incidents that we have seen affect U.S. diplomats and U.S. spies around the globe, dating back to 2016 when there was that cluster of incidents in Havana, Cuba. It's important to note that they're also saying there's no credible evidence that a foreign adversary has a weapon or a collection device that would be capable of carrying out these widespread incidents. That's really important here because there has been kind of the belief that there's been some foreign adversary who has this weapon that is targeting U.S. officials. And the finding now is that that isn't the case. Now, what we are hearing very definitively from the director of the National Intelligence Community, from the director of the CIA is this finding doesn't undermine the experiences that these diplomats and these spies had. They really did have real experiences, but it's just a plethora of factors that led to these experiences. Such as environmental factors or health factors or social factors, such as us reporting on these incidents, that led to these cases being reported and these cases being experienced. I think it's important to note, though, that some of the folks who were victims of this are a bit frustrated today. Because they're saying, if it's not a foreign adversary, but I was told by a professional, a medical professional that I have a diagnosed traumatic brain injury, then what did cause this? It was interesting to hear from U.S. officials who talked about the breadth of their investigation here. They talked about looking at incidents and looking at what was happening around those incidents, what was happening in the walls, the cars that were passing. And finding things they didn't expect to find, such as HVAC systems that weren't working, or such as mice that were connected to computers that were creating some discrepancies in the area. So they did not find, again, that a foreign adversary was linked to this. And they're saying essentially there's not one reason for these incidents. And of course, there are questions about the future of this investigation with Admiral Haines saying that \"this work will and must endure.\" But we're still waiting for specifics on what that looks like going forward.",

      "sentences": "Victor and Bianna, I would describe this as more of a soft limit than a hard limit.Here is how it works. The platform is saying that after 60 minutes of screen time, teenagers using TikTok will be presented with a notification telling them, hey, you've been on for an hour. This notification can be dismissed by entering in a pass code. It can even be disabled entirely within the settings of the app. So teenagers using the app can opt out of this feature. Those that do, if they use the app for more than 100 minutes, the app will tell them, hey, you may want to consider setting a daily screen time limit for yourself as a custom feature. Now, all of this is aimed at trying to establish some friction in the platform, trying to get people to use TikTok by thinking twice sometimes if they're using it for a long time. The thought is, by making this the default setting, many users will simply go along with it, and maybe that will result in some reductions in screen time and potentially better mental health. The question is whether or not all of that is actually going to work or do anything. I think the jury is still very much out on that -- Guys?",

And it's almost certain to an impact on Jalen Carter's draft status and beyond.This crash at Athens that Clark County police are still investigating killed his former teammate, Devin Willock, as well as team staffer, Chandler LeCroy. And what their investigation found is both Carter and LeCroy was effectively racing one another. Police say they were driving in a manner consistent with racing when they left the downtown Athens about 2:30 in the morning on the night of the crash. Their investigation found that alcohol, reckless driving and racing were all significant contributing factors to that fatal crash. And this is what they said in part of their statement they released earlier this morning. \"The evidence demonstrated that both vehicles switched between lanes, drove in the center turn lane, drove in opposite lines of travel, overtook other motorists and drove at high rates of speed in an apparent attempt to outdistance each other.\" In fact, the police investigation found that LeCroy, that teen staffer who was driving a team vehicle, her car reached speeds of 104 miles per hour prior to the crash. We did reach out to Jalen Carter, representatives for him, including his agent and mother. They each declined to comment, but did say that he is at the NFL combine where it will not participate. But just a short time ago, Jalen Carter did release a statement on his social media that said, in part: \"It is my intention to return to Athens to answer the misdemeanor charges against me and to make certain that the complete and accurate truth is presented. There's no question in my mind that when all of the facts are known, that I will be fully exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing.\" At last check, Carter is still not yet in police custody -- Victor, Bianna?",
