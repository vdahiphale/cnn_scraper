We will ask our senior political analyst. Plus, the battle for Bakhmut and what it could mean for the war in Ukraine if the city falls to the Russians.",

A total of 20 out of the 212 train cars actually left the tracks as this train was headed for Northern Ohio down to Birmingham, Alabama. Authorities really shifted a lot of their focus on four tanker train cars. Two of them were hauling what is being described as diesel exhaust fluid while the other two were hauling water soluble solution that is often used to treat wastewater, common industrial solution, as they describe them. However, authorities say that those train cars did not experienced any sort of spillage.So, the head of the EPA in the state of Ohio is saying that there was no chemical released into the air, into the water, and into the soil. So, now, a lot of the focus will certainly be on a massive cleanup process that is underway there in Springfield, Ohio and also on the investigation as they try to find out exactly what led to this derailment just a little over a month after the toxic tragedy that took place in East Palestine, Ohio. It is the same rail company and the same state. However, at this point, the investigation has certainly nothing to lead investigators to believe that they could potentially be linked, but certainly a reminder that these kinds of derailments are happening. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, roughly 1,000 derailments is happening in the U.S. per year. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, compared to 2016, though, his ceiling does look lower and his reach does look more narrow. In 2016, he pretty much appealed across the ideological spectrum. There wasn't much difference in his support between the most conservative voters and more moderate and centrist voters. But as you saw at CPAC, the kind of message that he is giving right now is pretty much confining him to the most militant conservative voters in the party predominantly. There is room. There is room among white collar, somewhat more moderate, economically-focused audience or simply more pragmatic Republican audience that worries about Trump's ability to win.

I think Biden's vision of how he wins is that that fear turns out the core democratic base of young people, voters of color, and college- educated white voters, all of them, primarily situated in our largest metro areas. Biden himself who is focused on kitchen table economics, the blue collar blueprint to rebuild the America, defending social security and Medicare, cutting down the prices of drugs like insulin, that through all of those efforts, he can pick up a few points on the other side of the ledger, among culturally-conservative blue collar, older non-urban voters who would be attracted to a Trumpian cultural message but might find -- might believe Biden's argument that he's looking up for them economically. It is almost like a division of responsibility for mobilizing the democratic base, which may not be his forte, but trying to cut into that economically-strain, culturally-conservative constituency that has moved so sharply towards the GOP in the Trump era.

Remember, they are banned from school, from university, from the workforce. The women I speak to say that they feel invisible.

The report said, quote, \"the denial of women and girls' fundamental human rights may mount to gender persecution, a crime against humanity.\" Rosemary, the Taliban has yet to respond to this report.

You know, CNN has reached out to Will Smith's camp for comment.In the special it says that he is not going to sit down with Oprah or anything like that anytime soon. So for now, this is Chris Rock addressing the spa and I can only imagine it will still be fodder for jokes of Chris Rock to come.
