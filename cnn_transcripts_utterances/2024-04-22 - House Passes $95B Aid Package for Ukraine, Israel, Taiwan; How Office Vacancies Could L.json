The President atthe time said in an address to the nation that it was in the interest of U.S. national security, saying that it should -- no ground should be ceded to Russia. But of course, the stalled aid in Congress only added to the urgency. And over the course of recent months, U.S. officials made the correlation between battlefield losses in Ukraine, arguing that that was because they weren`t getting the funding that they needed and putting the responsibility squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Now, over the course of time, White House officials have been in touch with members of Congress and congressional staff working furiously behind the scenes to see this through. And the President Saturday applauding that it has now happened and hoping that it crosses the finish line soon so that aid can get to Ukraine swiftly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It`s actually referring to the effects ofincreasing office space vacancies on cities. Post-pandemic, a lot of businesses don`t require their employees to come into work, letting them work from home instead. Great for some workers, but not so great for the people who own the office buildings that rely on companies to pay their leases to rent space. The numbers show that a lot of businesses are now getting rid of their office space. At the end of last year, one out of every five office spaces in America`s biggest cities were empty. And that`s leading to something called a doom loop, which could hurt these big cities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that`s where a lot of cities are currently going. They`re trying to subsidize through taxes, for example, reduction in property taxes for these conversions. RICHARD COLES, FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, VANBARTON GROUP: The sort of underbelly, if you will, of the doom loop is the demise of the urban center.

I stayed in like a lot of camping sites as well that had facilities to like, you know, freshen up and all of that. We made it to the Sahara Desert. We made it to Sierra Leone. Borders, out of all my trials and tribulations, was the sore in my side. Like it was so difficult crossing. Liberia border, I had to sleep there for two days. So yeah, it`s been lots of lessons. You know, patience, endurance, you know, being knocked down and standing up again. I had a car accident in Ivory Coast. So that was something you don`t plan for. It was bad. I guess if it was in the U.K., the car probably be considered a write-off. Everybody when they saw the videos and photos, they`re like, that`s it. The trip is over, you can`t go.
