Now, I can't say precisely who is in there, but on a Friday morning, you would expect to see civilians stocking up pre- weekend. I've often been in supermarkets like this too. You can find military in there to purchasing supplies. But, this is clearly a civilian target. And we've seen this happen when Russia is experiencing battlefield setbacks elsewhere that they choose to hit, clearly, civilian targets like this. And you can see, just from those images, the extent of the damage and the death toll has risen from one to 11 in a matter of hours. I think it's fair to say it may continue to get larger.And as I say, we've seen attacks like this repeatedly from Russia. Earlier in the week, Vladimir Putin called the incursion into Kursk in Russia by Ukrainian forces, a major provocation, claiming that Ukrainian forces were firing indiscriminately at residential areas. Well, here we have evidence of what Russia has been doing for the past two years, which is repeatedly hitting civilian targets. This, I have to say, looks like it seems targeted, given how the destruction is visited mostly upon the building, Rahel.",

They say that a framework agreement is now on the table with only the details left to conclude. The mediators plan to present what they call a final bridging proposal in either Cairo or Doha. And with tensions also rising along the Israel-Lebanon border, Israeli officials say that they are now looking to build a tent city in the south that could accommodate tens of thousands of people, as they prepare for a wider escalation.

      "sentences": "Well, there is certainly that possibility, and that also does appear to be at least partly the intention of the United States, Egypt and Qatar in calling for this summit next week, which Israel has already agreed that it will attend. We are still waiting to get Hamas' response as to whether they will send a delegation. But, it seems likely at this point that those negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage deal will indeed resume next Thursday in either Doha, Qatar or in Cairo, Egypt.And with that week between now and then, there is an opportunity for Iran to wait and see how it's going to respond. It has been vowing retaliation for the assassination of Hamas' political leader in the Iranian capital last week. But now, the question is, will they perhaps give more space for that diplomacy to happen? We have heard indication so far that Iran is potentially considering a ceasefire deal as something that could be a substitute for, or could at least lessen, perhaps, the retaliation that they were intending to deliver in the form of a strike on Israel. But, there is still a big question mark, and that is to say that even if a ceasefire is good enough for Iran to avoid this regional escalation, will it be enough for Hezbollah? There have been indications in the last 48 hours or so that Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, to Israel's north, far closer, of course, than the Iranian regime, that Hezbollah could act independently, and they have something else to retaliate for. Beyond the killing of Hamas' political leader, they also have vowed to retaliate for the killing of their senior most military commander, Fuad Shukr, in a strike in Beirut just hours before Haniyeh's assassination. And so, there is this real possibility, as officials have indicated to us who have reviewed key intelligence that Hezbollah is making preparations for a strike, could strike before Iran, and could also strike independently of what Iran decides. But, there is no question that if a ceasefire can be achieved before any of those strikes take place, it would considerably reduce tensions in this region, which really feels like it's very much on the verge of boiling over.

Yeah, he has talked -- he does talk about those issues, but he doesn't do it effectively. He doesn't know how to prosecute the case.Frankly, Vance is better at prosecuting the case on the issues than is Trump. But, Trump is just too scattered. He is so obsessed with crowd size, his grievances, the governor of Georgia, Harris, he said, turned black just last week. I mean, this is crazy stuff.

Let's look at Europe and see how markets closed there, green across the board, FTSE 100 closing up about a third of a percent, CAC 40, about the same. And taking a look at Asian markets, which closed more of a mixed picture here, the Nikkei closed up, I'd like to see that as of late, closing up about half a percent there, Hang Seng, a little bit more than 1.1 percent, and the Shanghai Composite off about let's call it a quarter of one percent.All right. Back here at home, the U.S. labor market may be showing signs of cooling, but apparently, that is not stopping consumers from flocking to the Paris Olympics. Bank of America reports that aggregated credit card and debit card spending per household fell in July by 0.4 percent year-over-year, but it also pointed out that international travel remains a highlight for consumers, as they prefer to buy services rather than goods. Bank of America also reporting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive. So, we wanted to understand more fully how healthy is the U.S. consumer. I want to bring in now Senior Economist for Bank of America, David Tinsley, who joins us now from London. David, good to have you.

And we did see a small tick up in unemployment payments going into those accounts, which would be consistent, I think, with a modest deterioration in the labor market. But it's modest.And I think really important, when you look at what people are getting, their wages and salaries after tax into their accounts and our data, you're still seeing pretty solid growth for the lower income households, around three percent year-on-year. That's the key. Also, people do have money in (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) pandemic. So, there are a few other supporting factors as well, I think.",

And of course, we can't really see what they're pulling out money, what to do with it, but that has risen credit card utilization. So, the amount of credit card balances have relative to their limits, that's risen a bit relative to where it hit in the lows after the pandemic. So, I think around the edges, and I think the New York Fed this week published some data on delinquencies for credit cards, and across the financial system, those are rising.

This is what's left. It is post-tropical Debby, meaning it's just losing the skeleton of a hurricane, but it's still pumped with so much tropical moisture, gusty winds and that tornado, dry wind gusts up to 45 miles per hour still, as it moves much faster up at the northeast.We do have a tornado watch in effect until two o'clock, including places like Philadelphia, some of the suburbs of New York, as we're getting some of these kind of outer bands. What's left of the outer bands? It could still have some cells that rotate, and we saw that this morning with some tornado warnings for D.C., right now, not finding any warnings, but these little cells, again, do have the capability of rotating, and we're watching that closely. Heavy rain has been a problem. Washington, D.C. had warnings this morning for one to one and a half inches of rain that fell in just 20 minutes. When water falls that fast, it's really hard for it to drain and go anywhere. That's why we have so many flood warnings in effect. Charleston still dealing with some of these flood warnings as well, after they got the brunt of the rain from Debby, at least in the Carolinas here, 10 to 20 inches around Charleston, up around Wilmington as well. That footprint of rain going all the way up to the Canadian border. We're talking about flood watches in effect, again, through D.C., Philly, up towards New York, upstate New York, even parts of New England, New Hampshire and Vermont. So, we'll continue to find maybe three to six inches of rain, maybe even more than that, and that could come down very quickly. So, you can see the rest of Debby continues to swirl up through New England as we go through the day today after dinner. Time again, it continues to exit. By tonight, we should see the last of the showers finally getting out of here, maybe a few left by tomorrow morning, but really starting to wrap up. Here is a look at some of these rain totals. Again, pretty easily, some two to four inches, really, across a lot of upstate New York, could find some totals approaching six inches or more. If it comes down fast, that's where you get the threat for flash flooding. As we go into next week, we're watching another area of development out in the Atlantic. That could likely become our next named storm. So, again, we're not done yet. We're only getting started here, as we go into hurricane season. Rahel.",
