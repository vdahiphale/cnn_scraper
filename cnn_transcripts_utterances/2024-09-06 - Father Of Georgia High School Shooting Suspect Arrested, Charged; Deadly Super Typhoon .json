Colt Gray and his father were questioned by law enforcement last year regarding several anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting. The FBI Atlanta and the Jackson County Sheriff's Office said in a joint statement that they received tips about online threats in May of 2023 and tracked then 13-year-old Gray as a possible subject and interviewed him. The subject denied making the threats online. The father stated he had hunting guns in the house, but the subject did not have unsupervised access to them, and there was no probable cause for arrest or further action at the time, according to that statement. CNN obtained the incident report from Jackson County detailing that interview. Colt expressed concern that someone is accusing him of threatening to shoot up a school, stating he would never say such a thing, even in a joking manner. The county alerted local schools for continued monitoring. But Gray later moved to neighboring Barrow County where the shooting occurred. That's where law enforcement sources tell CNN, authorities found writings in Gray's bedroom. They believe he wrote referencing the 2018 Parkland Florida High School shooting massacre. Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the gun used in the school shooting was an AR platform weapon. Due to Gray being a minor, he's being held at Gainesville Regional Youth Detention Center, but will be tried as an adult. The school shooting has been heartbreaking for many, especially those who knew the victim, 14-year-old students, Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo.

He couldn't corroborate it, but at least they put the father, the dad, on notice, and that notice is what is backfiring on the father now. Now, we know that Colin is talking. He is talking to law enforcement.

Is there more here than just Putin being that smug teenager throwing spitballs from the back of the classroom as Barack Obama once described him? SANGERHe clearly has a preference. Don't listen to what Putin says. Watch what his intelligence services, what RT, the news channel and others do. They are very much in former President Trump's camp. And there's no particular surprise about why that is. I mean obviously, at various moments, Donald Trump has said -- he said to me during 2016 why wouldn't I want to have a good relationship with Russia. Putin has been very complimentary of me. And we saw during his presidency how he dealt with it. Oddly enough, many of his aides were Russian hawks and they did place a lot of sanctions on Russia at various moments but Trump himself obviously, talked about his admiration for Putin on many occasions. And it seems pretty clear to me that while Putin may say he would favor Harris, I somehow doubt that if he had a vote he would pull the lever that way.",

The second is more in the realm of cyber operations than disinformation. You'll remember that before we knew in 2016 about the disinformation campaign, we knew that there had been emails stolen from the Clinton campaign. We knew that the Russians had gone in and seized some records, copied them from the voter registration rolls in Illinois, Arizona, later we discovered in several other states. That's actually what worries me more, a ransomware-style attack against some of these registration systems that would then make it difficult for people to register or would indicate when you went to vote John, you know, oh we believed you've move to a different state, something like that. And that would give a pretense for secretaries of state, some of the more recent appointees who were election deniers and others to say, there's something suspicious about this election and hold up the certification of the vote.",
