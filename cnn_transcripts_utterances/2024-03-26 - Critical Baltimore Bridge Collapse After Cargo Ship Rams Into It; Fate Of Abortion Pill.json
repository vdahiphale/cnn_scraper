And what makes this bridge unique is that this is the bridge, the main bridge in this area that can handle traffic that carries hazardous material, HAZMATs, because HAZMATs are not allowed in the Baltimore tunnels that go underneath Baltimore harbor. Of course, those tunnels are the venues where the major -- the regular auto traffic moves through usually, but the trucks and other vehicles carrying HAZMATs, well, they have to go through this bridge, they have to go over this bridge as they're going up and down the east coast. Obviously, that has all come to a stop right now, and that's going to be halted indefinitely, at least as far as this bridge is concerned.So, that's going to be another major logistical headache for officials here trying to figure out how to get HAZMATs shipped to and from various points in the east coast going up and down these highways here. And again, we can just give you a broader look at how -- we have a second camera here, by the way, that can kind of train in on the vessel itself of the DALI, which impacted that bridge a little before 01:30 this morning. Just take a look at just this huge swath of the bridge that has just now vanished, it's missing, it's in the water. You can see some of the stanchions in the water and some of the other things there that are -- some of the rescue vessels that are around that area.

The justices seemed very skeptical that these doctors even had the legal right or the standing to even bring this lawsuit in the first place. And that's because of some of the arguments from the FDA lawyers, the government lawyers, and also the drug manufacturer's lawyers. They really said, look, the doctors are bringing this case because they believe that they might at some point maybe have to treat women who appear in the emergency room because of potential complications from Mifepristone. The justices seemed to indicate that maybe that sort of injury was just far too hypothetical to bring a suit.And then we saw interesting comments from the chief justice and also Neil Gorsuch talking about the fact that, you know, why did a handful of doctors have the power really to get a lower court opinion that would have banned this pill nationwide, or at least taken back some of the restrictions on it?

So the FDA's stance was, look, we followed the proper procedures. There's really no great harm in this. And that's why this drug has been out there since 2000.You know, but the Supreme Court here might not even get to that broader issue. They might end up tossing this case on the standing issue.",

One of them was a woman by the name of Erin Hawley, who happens to be a very active anti-abortion advocate who's married to Josh Hawley. So he was there in the courtroom, as were other state officials, including the attorney general of New York, Letitia James, just shows the stakes of this for the states, for people on both sides. Because, Wolf, as you know, this is the first big abortion case since the justices in 2022 reverse Roe v. Wade. And in that time, just to point up the stakes, more women have relied on medication abortion to end their pregnancies.And the other issue here is the FDA's authority to use its own scientific review and expertise to decide what drugs should be approved. And when you cut right through what the justices questions were, I think with key justices who had voted to overturn Roe asking very skeptical questions of the challenges here, I think they will find that these anti-abortion lawyers who say that they have been harmed by the FDA approval of Mifepristone and easy access to the drug, that they cannot prove they've been harmed and therefore do not have legal standing. And I'll just refer to two justices in particular, Wolf, who voted to overturn Roe two years ago, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. And both of them suggested by their remarks that they do not think there was sufficient harm to bring this case. At one point, Brett Kavanaugh even said, just to confirm on the standing issue, under federal law, no doctors can be forced against their consciences to perform or assist in abortion. Correct?

You know, we are living through it so we don't realize it, but in the last 30 or 40 years, we have gone through a massive expansion of globalization, where something like two and a half billion to 3 billion people have joined the world trading system. That's all of China, all of India, most of Latin America, large parts of Africa have suddenly all become part. They're all playing the same game now. You look at the technology world. We've created a brand new digital world. I mean, think about what the world looked like before that. We are now living in a world where the biggest companies in the world are all these new companies that didn't exist 20, 25 years ago. Think about the reality of the identity revolution that has taken place. Take one piece of it, women.Women have been emancipated to, you know, from being second class citizens, which they were for thousands and thousands of years. And all this has happened in the last 30 or 40 years. So we're going through the acceleration, the disruption that all that causes. But we're also going through, and this is what I talk a lot of in my book about the backlash, the feeling that, you know, this is all going too far, too fast. And there are a lot of people who say, don't worry, I'll stop the world. You can get off. I'll take you back to when you were more comfortable. You know, the most important word in Donald Trump's slogan is, make America great again. I'm going to take you back when it was safe and you don't have -- you didn't feel so disoriented.",

Ronald Reagan stood for limited government, balanced budgets, free markets, free trade, spreading democracy abroad, great pride in that and very open and receptive to immigration. Think about what Donald Trump's Republican Party stands for.Literally every one of those things I said, Trump is basically the opposite on almost all of those. He's a protectionist. He doesn't like free trade. He doesn't like immigrants. He's for big government. He spent more money than anybody in his four years. So that's the transformation we're going through.

We're going to tell you who she is and how his choice could shake up the race potentially for the White House. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:48:16] BLITZER: Today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Nicole Shanahan as his running mate for his independent presidential bid. Shanahan is a very wealthy attorney and entrepreneur who has a long history of making large donations to Democratic candidates, including the man they're running against, namely President Biden. CNN's Eva McKend is joining us now live from Oakland, California. So, Eva, what did Kennedy, first of all, say about his pick?",

To see how this potentially impacts the 2024 race, let's bring in CNN political commentators Bakari Sellers and Scott Jennings.

And she talked about helping him get on the ballot today. So while I don't think the vice presidential pick usually makes a big electoral difference, for the Kennedy ticket, she brings a lot of money to the table and also she shares a lot of his liberal views. So they mesh well there. But really this is about cash getting some into this campaign. And when they get it, I think they can make a difference with it.",

She is a very wealthy woman from Palo Alto or Oakland or that Silicon Valley area. I'm not sure why anybody of good common sense actually takes on the role of being vice president for Robert F. Kennedy Junior. We know that there are a lot of people who were asked and she finally said yes, which makes you question why she's doing this.Ego comes to mind, but also it sets you up for future failure to be associated with somebody who's disassociated from their own family, somebody who has these anti-vax views, somebody who's out of the mainstream of most thought processes. And then I would, you know, me and Scott and you, Wolf, will be sitting here one day and reviewing a debate that has Ms. Shanahan, Kamala Harris, and maybe somebody like Tim Scott on the same stage together. And if there's one person who sticks out that is not prepared for that limelight, who is not prepared to swim in those deep waters, it would be her.

And I think when the campaign unfolds and people really focus in on who Kennedy is, I mean, he has been a tried and true liberal and a really fringe liberal. I mean, he has espoused some kooky views over the years. But look, there are people who are attracted to that and he's picked a very liberal running mate. So I think as the campaign unfolds, if you're a Trump supporter and you want to get Donald Trump one more chance to beat Joe Biden, I doubt you're going to be flirting with Kennedy.But I do think, and you can see the way Democrats are reacting today, that there's real concern on the left that dissatisfaction with Biden on his progressive flank may drive some people out of a third door just as a protest vote.",
