Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin still in critical condition in a Cincinnati hospital. The 24-year-old NFL player collapsed on the field after a violent collision during his team's Monday night football game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Players on the field understandably shell shocked as medical staff performed CPR on Hamlin for a full nine minutes before they finally restored his heartbeat. He was then driven out of the stadium in an ambulance. The NFL later suspended that football game. The Bills updated in the early morning hours that Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest after that tackle. We're going to be live in Cincinnati with the latest on his condition. We're also going to be talking to a lot of former NFL players about this.",

That vote is set for later today. At this hour, though, Kevin McCarthy still hasn't locked up the support he needs for that gavel. So, will we see a chaotic floor fight between GOP moderates and the far-right wing of the party? We do know Republican lawmakers are set to meet behind closed doors this hour. We do want to begin, though, in Cincinnati where, as Jim mentioned, Damar Hamlin is in critical condition. He's at UC Medical Center after collapsing on the field last night.",

He's a preventive cardiologist at PREvent Clinic in Georgia. Good to have you with us this morning. So, let's start with what we know this morning, Dr. Montgomery, the fact that - and this is good news, as Adrienne just pointed out, that his heartbeat was restored on the field. CPR, though, was administered for a long time. He's in critical condition. What do you make of all that? What does it tell us about what he could be facing? DR. DAVE MONTGOMERY, PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGIST, PREVENT CLINIC: Yes, good morning to you, Erica and Jim. So, you know, I think that there are two distinct possibilities, and I will just say, as we're hypothesizing and conjecturing, keeping what Adrienne said in mind, that this is a human being. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his teammates. Two distinct possibilities. One is what we're been hearing about, and that is that impact to Hamlin's chest hit right at the time when - at the heart rhythm caused a chaotic sort of spiral. We call it Commotio cordis, Erica. That just means a chaotic heart rhythm and the heart stops. You see here on your screen, right at the time where the EKG, which makes the heartbeat, that red line shows you the most inopportune time to get a blow to the chest, in football or any other sport that can cause a chaos. And then there's another distinct possibility. And I think that that possibility, after I went frame by frame, Erica, yesterday, there is the possibility that the blow went to his jaw and into his brain. In other words, a traumatic brain injury of sorts. Now, here's a connection. In very small cases, or very rare cases of severe enough traumatic brain injury, you can have traumatic cardiac arrest. It happens in the seconds to minutes after, but it still ends in cardiac arrest.",

He could have it and not have a diagnosis.With that being said, any time there's something like this we think about, can we make things safer.

And when they started to -- when the training staff ran out on the field, the players were calling and motioning for them to run out to the field.

For some of them it's personal. They don't like Kevin McCarthy. For others it's all about these concessions. And, Alayna, it's interesting, there has been so much that has been essentially given up by McCarthy at this point. But if you're giving in to every little demand, what's he actually left with if he manages to pull this off, Alayna? ALAYNA TREENE, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Well, it's a great point, Erica. And he has. He's given away the store really in trying to cave to what members of the right flank want. The issue is, he did that without really having any guarantee for what they would be offering in return, which is what he needs, is their votes. And as of now, they are remaining united in their opposition, even though he's caved on giving them a - a lower threshold for the motion to vacate the chair. A number of other big concessions that these conservative members have wanted. But, still, he hasn't flipped any votes with that. And so I really do think it's coming down to the wire and a lot of people -- Scott Perry, the chairman now of the House Freedom Caucus noted this in his statement this morning say that he -- McCarthy waited until the last minute to give into these demands, to release that rules package that so many of these conservatives were waiting for.

You were tweeting about this yesterday, noting about these concessions that had been made by McCarthy in terms of - of the rules package for the incoming congress. And changes you noted, the very significant impact this could have on ethics - on congressional ethics investigations, for example. Walk us through that.",

One that I noticed was this change to the Office of Congressional Ethics. This independent watchdog that oversees all ethics issues in Congress. And what Republicans have proposed was basically - you know, on paper it looks fairly benign. But what this would do is institute term limits for the members of its board, some of whom are Republican and some are Democrats. And the term limits would basically boot out most of the existing Democratic board members. It would also make it much harder for the office to hire staff.And all of this could have a huge effect on ethics investigations at the beginning of this new congress.",

Is there another candidate quietly waiting in the wings here to swoop in and, if necessary, take this from McCarthy? I mean I know Steve Scalise because he is certainly not publicly campaigning for this and he's remaining loyal to McCarthy, but his name has come up as a plan b. Where does that stand?",

People like Dan Bishop, Don Bacon are starting to say that they want to put other members forward for this. Andy Biggs, one of the people who is very staunch in his opposition to Kevin McCarthy, is also running for speaker. But a lot of these other potential names that are being floated -- Jim Jordan another one that conservatives would love to see become speaker, it's not very possible. Jim Jordan, as another example, like I said, doesn't want this. Other people whose names are being thrown around and the buzz that's coming around them don't really want this. And so it will be difficult. I do think that if there really is a point of no return for McCarthy and he realizes he will not be able to win the 218 votes that are necessary, then - then potentially Steve Scalise will step forward. He's been privately preparing for this I'm told yesterday as this became a much more realistic reality. But it's still very unclear. And also, again, even if conservatives all rallied behind one candidate, the majority of the conference really wants McCarthy. And so it's a very difficult position that they're in today.",
