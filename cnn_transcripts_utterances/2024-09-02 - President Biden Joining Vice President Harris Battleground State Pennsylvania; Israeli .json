Just a few moments ago, she and President Joe Biden were mingling with many union members here in Pittsburgh, a variety of unions, leaders from different unions, as well as state lawmakers, including Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Bob Casey, as they tried to shore up support in this critical state where Joe Biden has seen his popularity remain strong among this critical constituency, even as his approval rating overall has remained fairly low throughout his presidency.Since exiting the race in Pennsylvania and across those blue wall states, his approval rating has ticked up by a few points, but it's still hovering in the low 40s, which is one of the challenges for Vice President Harris as she tries to figure out how to leverage Biden. But because he is so popular with working class and older voters, that is the reason why this is the first time that you will see the two of them together and the first time that you will see President Biden officially campaigning in front of a Harris-Walz banner. Now, for her part, Vice President Harris is also expected to leverage some of the Biden administration's legacy policy positions. One in particular is going to be relevant today and that is the position that she is expected to take on a takeover of U.S. Steel, a Pittsburgh based company that is currently the subject of a $15 billion takeover by a Japanese rival. A campaign official says that she is expected to announce her opposition to the deal and support that company remaining under American ownership. The fate of that deal currently rests with the federal government. Now it's a singular issue, but it's emblematic of the overall feeling that American manufacturing should be immune from the control of other foreign countries, even allies and even deep- pocketed companies. And it's something that we expect Vice President Harris to embrace as she tries to shore up the rank and file support from these union members who are here today. Alex?",

The only person I ever heard say that was Joe Biden to be honest with you and I'd served 28 years of elected office in Pennsylvania. Hey, but if you're out in Pittsburgh and you want to talk about helping American manufacturing and American workers you really shouldn't oppose this deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel. The Japanese are going to invest huge amounts of money in technology to make steel better in America, and what we're witnessing is just people talking nostalgically about steel. I'm from a steel family, 30 years, Bethlehem Steel, my dad. And I got to tell you, you want to do harm to America steel, kill this deal. And I really would discourage Vice President Harris and other elected officials from, you know, trying to undermine this thing at a time when we need to make steel better in America, so. You're really not helping your message too much as far as I'm concerned. I get it. They're playing to the USW. They're reflexively against deals like this. But Pennsylvania has been the beneficiary of direct foreign investment for years in basic industry manufacturing, biotech, and it's provided a lot of work for American workers in very good settings.

And he is somebody that can absolutely speak to the struggles, speak to the worries, speak to the anxieties that workers have across the board.He can also speak to not just what he has done in the Biden administration to help all of these workers, but what the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz administration would continue to do for them. And I think he speaks from a place of credibility that Donald Trump or J.D. Vance would never have. And I think he can be somebody who will compare and contrast what they have done for workers versus what Donald Trump and his administration both has done when he was in the White House for four years and what he will continue to do if he gets another four years in office, which is he was the most anti-worker president that we've ever had. He sides with the billionaire CEOs and corporations, talked lovingly to Elon Musk about how great it was that he could fire workers on a whim. Talk to his billionaire CEOs about how if they give him money, if he gives them millions of dollars, he gives them millions of dollars that he will take away all those pesky regulations so that they can do whatever they want. And so I think that is something that not just Joe Biden can underscore, but with Kamala Harris at his side, they can make a real point in how union-friendly, worker-friendly authentically a Harris- Walz administration will be compared to the horrific worker record that Donald Trump has.",

The more that there are visuals and the imagery and the audio of the two of them standing together talking about how Kamala is with Joe Biden, it shows more of the continuity. Everything that the Trump team has been arguing, which is that Kamala Harris is more of the same.A reason why you're seeing a surge in polling right now for Kamala, she is picking up steam certainly over where Joe Biden's numbers were, was because people right now in polling are believing she is a change candidate. That's an emotional vote. Politics is so fiercely based in emotion. It's how you can drive a voter. When you look at her as a change candidate, the more events they do with Joe Biden, the harder it is for the American people to believe that she is an actual change. And this is actually also perilous for her, especially with that hardcore pro-Palestinian group that sits within the Democratic voting base that we saw Joe Biden have issues with in the primary. If they start to believe that Kamala Harris is in fact the same foreign policy person that Joe Biden is, that can depress Democrat-based turnout. And so while she might be picking up in other pockets, this strategy of campaigning with Biden really could put her at a larger deficit than it could to be helpful in the long run, even if there are small pockets because right now it's September, there's still plenty of road ahead. I would have picked this strategy for more of a get out the vote game and not right now.",

Union support in three key states mainly Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada, all swing states could really determine the election and the Democrats know that, Vice President Harris knows that. And so they have been courting, trying to court union workers and union leadership to the best of their ability. They did get the support from United Auto Worker president Shawn Fain, but Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters president has been flirting with a GOP endorsement, though he hasn't gone ahead and done that yet.He has met with President Trump and as you said, he spoke at the RNC. So we are already seeing cracks in the sort of once impenetrable support for Democrats from union leadership. And that is making a lot of Democrats very worried because, you know, the rank and file has already -- we've already seen those cracks. You know, just to give you a quick example, in 2016, Hillary Clinton won union support in the exit polls by about 8 percent over Donald Trump. That was an 18-point drop in the margin from the 2012 election to show you that Democrats have been losing labor union workers over the recent years and so they're going into this election very worried. Inflation has been high in recent years, and that has been being felt by the average household, but especially these union workers who are making, you know, union salaries. And that's been a major source of frustration. And so it'll be interesting to see whether Vice President Harris and President Biden addresses that issue tonight.",

You have sewage running in the streets, you have piles of garbage, and you have a severe lack of hygiene because we aid organizations, due to Israel's restrictions, have not been able to get in sufficient levels of hygiene kits to distribute to the population. In fact, we're at a stage where we're barely even able to get in a bar of soap.",

How dire are the conditions? DAMONAnd what this has done is not just resulted in this huge spread of cases of that skin disease impetigo you were talking about, which actually, Alex, has the potential to be deadly, because in the most severe instances, children need to be hospitalized, and if they're not, they can risk kidney failure, which means they can risk death. You also have the spreading of illnesses like meningitis, which can also prove to be fatal, and then hepatitis A. And just in Nasser hospital alone, the head of the pediatrics department, was telling me that two children per week are dying because of hepatitis A. And you really get the sense being there that even if the bombs were to stop dropping tomorrow, if Israel does not allow more aid into Gaza, and if Israel does not facilitate and secure the roots that it designates that aid organizations must use to pick up the aid, Gazans are going to continue to die at a horrific rate because of the widespread illnesses that we're seeing, because of these types of diseases that we're seeing.",

So there's one father his wife was killed as she was cradling her daughter, the daughter and son survived, but the father was so traumatized by everything that he has forgotten his name, and he has forgotten that he has children.I have met numerous children who have simply lost the ability to speak. I have met children who have lost certain levels of motor functionality, and doctors can't find anything physically wrong with them, and so they say it's the psychological impact of all of this. You see, you know, signs of aggression in children. You see bedwetting. You see all the different ways that trauma can manifest itself. And the reality is that while the triggers are ongoing, while the trauma is ongoing, the kind of work that needs to be done to help these children begin to process everything that they have been through, quite simply, cannot materialize because there's too much instability that is just continuously happening all around them.
