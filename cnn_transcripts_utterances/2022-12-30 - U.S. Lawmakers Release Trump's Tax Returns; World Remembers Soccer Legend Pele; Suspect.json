      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, six years of Donald Trump's tax returnsare now public, what we've learned about the former president's finances. Then mourning and celebration. The world is remembering Brazilian soccer legend, Pele. Then, an apparent breakthrough in a U.S. murder investigation. A suspect is under arrest in connection with the stabbing death of four students. But first, he built an entire brand and a political career around the image of being a wealthy business mogul. Yet, newly-released tax returns show Donald Trump claimed millions of dollars in losses for years. A U.S. house committee released the documents today after the former president lost a long legal battle to keep them private. They span six years including 2020, when Trump paid nothing in taxes at all, as you can see on your screen there. He claimed massive business operating deficits that allowed him to slash his tax liability. In 2016 and 2017, he paid just -- as you can see on your screen $750. The returns also showed Trump held foreign bank accounts while in office. And in fact, he paid more in foreign taxes than U.S. taxes in the first year of his presidency. The documents were made public just days before Republicans regain control of the house, and Trump is claiming a political motivation. In a statement, this is what he said. \"The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it's going to lead to horrible things for so many people.\" Let's break all of this down with CNN economics and political commentator, Catherine Rampell, she's a \"Washington Post\" opinion columnist. Catherine, great to see you. A lot for us to get out, do you think. Look, I know CNN is still sifting through the tax returns. You're probably still sifting through it too. What's does it show you? What stood out from what you have seen so far? I know you're still going -- you're combing through them. CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes, these are hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents. And I don't pretend that I've gotten through even a substantial fraction of them. I mean, there are some interesting nuggets here, including things that he said there were obviously false, like he said that he donated his presidential salary to charity in at least 2020. He didn't donate any money to charity at all. As you pointed out, there's also some interesting information about foreign bank accounts he had including a Chinese bank account, which was the case in the earlier years of his tax returns, none in the later years. You can see that he paid foreign taxes to a lot of countries abroad, including Azerbaijan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, lots of other places. The thing that we still don't know, that I wish we did, is where he's actually getting his money from --",

You can see that he's deducting interest, potentially on loans that he owes, but you can't see whom he is paying that interest to. And that is not -- I mean, the fact that that's not in the tax returns is not surprising. Most people when they file their tax returns would not include that information necessarily upfront. But in the course of an audit, the IRS should have been asking for some documentation, so that they can substantiate, oh, did you actually pay these -- you know, these interest expenses that you deducted? Can you show us the loan document? Or can you show us the canceled check or whatever? And that has not been released by house Democrats, and I'm not sure why? There's a question about whether IRS even asked for this documentation in a report last week, that was released by house staffers, it did look like IRS agents were unusually deferential to Trump's tax attorneys and tax counsel in general.

Our tax code is incredibly complicated, particularly the real estate portion of the tax code. And there are plenty of ways to legally minimize your tax obligations that make it look like you're not making much money when in fact you are. So, the fact that he didn't pay very much in taxes doesn't necessarily mean he was a bad businessman. However, there are a lot of other clues that indicates he may have been or that he may have engaged in some dodgy tax maneuvering that crossed the line from tax avoidance to tax evasion. And some of that was summarized last week, you know, some charitable deductions that he took that seems suspicious, some loans to his kids that may have actually been gifts, which should have been taxable.

So, therefore, you know, modeling revenue as she had an expense, so therefore it nets out to zero, no taxes owed. That seems suspicious to me, but we don't know, we don't know what happened here. And again, if the IRS were doing its job, they should have required some   documentation to say hey, Melania, this looks a little weird. These numbers are exactly equal, you know, to the cents.

The police only releasing essentially the timeline, saying that Kayla and Maddie had been out on November 12th, they went out on November 12th, and they were out at a local bar, they then went to a food truck, got home, Xana and Ethan, they had been at a party, all of them getting home at around 2:00 in the morning on November 13th. They were believed to have been killed in the early morning hours of the 13th. And authorities saying that it was a brutal murder, they were stabbed multiple times in their sleep. The big question though remains. Motive. Why were these four students killed? And that's what we're hoping to hear from authorities in Moscow, Idaho, because they have said that this was a targeted attack. But they had not explained why they believe this was a targeted attack. So, I think this is going to be one of the biggest questions for Moscow police. One of the only keys or clues in this case had been a white Hyundai Elantra. Police had been asking the public for information on this car. They said in total, for this entire case, they received about 20,000 tips from the community interviewed, about 300 people on this case, but again, they had given us very limited information.

BRIAN WINTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AMERICAS QUARTERLY: I think that the fact that he was one of the world's most famous people for 60 years and managed to still be something resembling a normal person is nothing short of a miracle. I spent a couple of months working with him back in 2014, helping him write a book for the World Cup that Brazil was hosting that year. And I found him pretty simple at the end of the day. This was a person who, as hokey as it might sound, thought that he was put here on this earth to make people happy. And that being on the soccer field was part of that.

He also -- even though he was very well-paid by the standards of the era, for example, when he signed with the New York Cosmos at the twilight years of his career in 1975 for what was considered an insane amount of money at the time made him the highest paid athlete in the United States, it was $1 million a year, which, you know, that's great. But today, when you consider that, even if you adjust for inflation, that was nothing compared to the salaries that even some above-average athletes are making today. So, yes, he did cash in. He was, in some respects, the first person ever to do so. I mean, some of the tradition when we think about celebrity athletes cashing in and having their own brand of coffee and shoes and kind of other stuff, Pele was the first to do that.
