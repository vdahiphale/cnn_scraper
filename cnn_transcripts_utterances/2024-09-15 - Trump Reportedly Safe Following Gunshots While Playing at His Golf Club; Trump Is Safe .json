      "sentences": "Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Jessica Dean, and we begin with breaking news.Former president Donald Trump is safe after a shooting incident near the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Martin County Sheriff's Office saying they have stopped a vehicle and taken a suspect into custody. We know a gun, an AK-47 style weapon, has been recovered near that scene as well. Now we are standing by for a press conference from police and the Secret Service, which we are expecting in the next half-hour. Let's begin, though, with CNN's Kristen Holmes. Kristen, tell us the latest what you're hearing right now.",

      "sentences": "Right, Jessica. So what were told us this afternoon when Donald Trump was on the golf course at West Palm Beach, that is Trump International Golf Course, he was in-between holes when shots were fired. We are told by sources that Secret Service fired shots. And as you noted, a person has now been detained. There was a long rifle, so an AK style rifle, that was recovered with that person in the car after they were detained.It is still unclear what exactly a motive was, but officials have told me as well as our colleague John Miller that they believe that Donald Trump was the intended target. Again, this would have been a suspect who was armed, essentially waiting for Donald Trump at a golf course in West Palm Beach. He was on lockdown. The entire course went into lockdown. It is unclear where Trump is at the moment, if that locked had been lifted, if he has moved back to his Mar-a-Lago resort or if he is still waiting currently at the golf course right now. We are not intending to hear from the former president, but all of this is still very fluid. Obviously, as you said, we are waiting for several law enforcement press briefings on this issue as they try to sort out the details here of what exactly happened. And Jessica, just to be very clear, this is somebody who obviously survived an assassination attempt earlier this year or just a few months ago. In addition to that has ramped up security and that includes both local law enforcement who are on him all the time or near him, securing perimeters when he is traveling, including in West Palm Beach as well as Secret Service. So it's unclear exactly how many more Secret Service officers would have been or agents would have been on the ground with them at this golf course. I can tell you from my knowledge that generally they travel in different packs on different golf courses. You have people who are traveling behind him. There are people who are traveling in front of him all in order to secure him. And that has obviously been ramped up since that assassination attempt. And we're still again learning the details here of what exactly happened, where exactly Donald Trump was when these shots were fired. But as you said, the campaign is saying that he is safe. And the Secret Service is saying that they have been investigating this as a protective incident. Obviously, that in itself goes to show you the serious nature of how they are taking this. They would not be investigating something that they believe was random and unaffiliated to the former president. Now, what the outcome of that investigation is I'm sure we'll learn more details from the Secret Service briefing, but right now clearly, as officials have told John Miller and I, they do believe that Donald Trump was the intended target of this suspect who was armed and essentially on or near the golf course.",

[16Secret Service returns fire. An individual was chased. Local police do a car stop on the highway. That individual in custody now, he has been identified by police. They know who he is, and they are continuing to investigate him. As Kristen said, reports that that gun was recovered in the car. They'll have to determine if he or that gun and that car was connected to this incident. The questions that are emerging are, were the shots fired at President Trump on the golf course or did part of the Secret Service perimeter team that was searching the area for just such a threat confront the man with a rifle outside the perimeter and exchange shots with him? All of this still coming together. Hopefully, a story that will have crystallized into a second or third version that we'll get at this press briefing. In the meantime, the investigation of this individual in custody is -- got a lot of fast-moving wheels right now.",

We have these beginning facts that we do know.Jonathan Wackrow, I want to ask you as former Secret Service, Kristen mentioned, and we all remember the assassination attempt on former president Trump's life, not too long ago, that security has been increased around him. What role would they have played today? How does that factor into all of this?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, you know, what we do know is that the Secret Service has said that they've, you know, put more protective assets towards the former president, and those protective assets, you know, most likely include more tactical agents, both from the counter assault team, sort of the tactical team that will be travelling at all locations with the former president.More counter-sniper teams so when we think about the open air space of a golf course, the long-range threat is, you know, critically important to cover. So you'd have more counter sniper teams, but beyond that, if you think about the protective model of concentric rings radiating out from the protectee, the outer perimeter, more counter surveillance agents who are undercover agents that are working that outer perimeter. Very specifically designed to identify those types of threats that could be lying in wait along tree lines, along motorcade routes, around any other areas. So again, to Commissioner Miller's point, we don't know if the engagement by Secret Service was from one of the tactical teams or was it from one of these, you know, counter surveillance team members whose job it is actually is to go out and interrupt the chain of attack. You know, so, again, we want to see if that crystallizes, you know, take a term from John Miller, during this upcoming press briefing. But, Jessica, I just want to say that, you know, the operations around, protective operations around a golf course are very complex for the Secret Service because you have to think about, unlike a static stage location, you have to move your protective operation across 18 holes of a golf course. It's a lot of real estate to cover, but the Secret Service has put a model in place years ago, understanding that our protectees like to enjoy golf. so the rolling bubble, if you will, you know, was put in to place. And as you go along, again, this threat may have been uncovered who is lying in wait, you know, by one of those advanced agents walking along the tree line. We don't know if there's any aerial surveillance as well. That is now typical with your protective operations. Again, looking ahead to see, you know, or identify any threats before they materialize. So lot of questions yet to be answered. But I think we'll start, you know, garnering some of those, some of that information with a forthcoming press conference.",

I will never surrender. I will always love you for supporting me. Unity, peace, make America great again. May god bless you, Donald Trump.And then as I noted, there is a link there to a fundraising page. Just one thing to quickly note as you were saying about this West Palm Beach golf club and going over to Mar-a-Lago, he has been under a lockdown at the West Palm Beach International Golf Club since this incident took place. So this means that that has now lifted, that they believe, Secret Service believes, and law enforcement believe that the position that he is in is now safe enough for him to travel in that motorcade, as you noted, back to Mar-a-Lago. His team has been waiting to see when he would be allowed to go back to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Obviously, right now, the situation is incredibly fluid as we have been reporting -- Kaitlan.",

Hold on one second, the sheriff of Palm Beach County is speaking right now. I want to listen in. SHERIFF WILLIAM D. SNYDER, MARTIN COUNTY, FLORIDA: It's very urgent follow-up, asking all law enforcement for a specific vehicle with a tag number and an occupant description. We immediately swept I-95 out on the northbound lane, at every exit between Palm Beach and the Palm Beach line and the St. Louis County line. One of my local patrol units saw a vehicle, match the tag. And then we set up on the vehicle by using what we do here. We pinched in the car. It safely stopped and got the driver in custody. Right now as we speak, the FBI, Secret Service, Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is at the scene. They've responded there. They'll take over the investigation off (INAUDIBLE).

He doesn't have the typical pool that you would see with Vice President Harris or with President Biden. And so that is why we don't -- we're still piecing together more details about what we're learning. Typically those reporters wouldn't be on the golf course anyway, Wolf, but they would obviously be traveling with him.So there were not reporters with him when you saw that that motorcade coming back, but something else that stood out to me from what Sheriff Will Snyder just said there, Wolf, in addition to Trump confirming that they found an AK-47 and that was what was recovered, the sheriff said that they know the suspect's -- that they know the person's name that was detained in that car. That image so you could just see, he declined to say it publicly, but he said that that car was also cleared using a bomb detection dog, and that that vehicle that you saw that is apparently related to this is now in the hands of the FBI. He says that they will help with transporting it for the FBI back to Palm Beach County. It's unclear, obviously, what else is going to happen, but he did say a male driver is in the custody and in the hands of the FBI at this time, Wolf. So that's an incredibly notable confirmation there from the sheriff about where they are in this investigation. Obviously, there's still a lot of questions about, you know, the license plate on that car. Who was that car registered to? What are the details of that? And also where it was in relation to the golf course. When you look at this and where Trump was, I will say, Wolf, the golf course is obviously an incredibly difficult area for the Secret Service to be able to secure it. It's an open area, it's shrouded with trees. It's not often easy to get a glimpse of Donald Trump when he's on that golf course, which he, you know, typically, it's pretty predictable that he's there. He spent a lot of his time there and it wouldn't be, you know, unknown to someone that he would be there. You can see his motorcade going in and out when he's on the property. And so I think there are still a lot of questions and hopefully we are still going to get that briefing from officials in addition to the questions that we just got there of what exactly they do know about what happened here. You can see, Wolf, that the area is closed off, and that area he was telling people not to get on I-95 as we're waiting to get a more fulsome update hopefully, Wolf, from officials.",

Unlike Butler where the shooter really was in plain sight for an awful long time, the shooter in this incident you had cover and concealment, or at least some level of cover and concealment along that -- along the wood line. You know, and because of that, you know, you can really start to believe that the attacker actually had some level of a line of sight to where the former president was.Now, were they in the actual range to launch an attack or were they discovered by some of these counter surveillance or other agents that, you know, really constitute the enhanced security measures around the former president. But the key factor here is the accessibility that this attacker had to the secure site. Really the ease of ingress and egress in really the thought that there was some level of an escape route. All of this to me starts to signal a more elevated attack than something that was just a spontaneous, right? You'd start thinking about the weapon that was utilized, the backpack, the GoPro, the ease of ingressive and egress with a specific escape route. So all of these elements, you know, starting to get pieced together, start painting a really bad picture around this attacker and the intent that they had, you know, to attack the former president.",

What else are you learning, John?MILLER (via Webex): Well, as we said in the beginning of this reporting, you know, this information is preliminary. It was expected to shift and change. What we've developed is a little bit of a richer picture. Law enforcement originally said shots were fired, they believed, at President Trump. That Secret Service returned fire. As they are interviewing the agents involved and getting this richer picture, it appears now that, as President Trump was golfing at whichever holes he was golfing at, the Secret Service team that was with him is advancing forward of that location, so they can clear those areas and double check them. And, at some point, see this individual with a rifle pointing out from behind a tree line or a wooded area, that they go confront this individual. And that the shooter, with the A.K.-47 or this semi-automatic rifle, does not fire shots, but is confronted by Secret Service who fires shots at him. He drops the weapon and fleas. Witnesses see him get into that car. And the sheriff, Snyder, told us, and that's the Martin County Sheriff not the Palm Beach County Sheriff, that be on the lookout for that vehicle. Went out. They flooded the highway. If you could go -- if you can still bring it up to the picture of that car stopped at that site. You know, what you see there is a classic vehicle containment technique or a VCT. Where one car gets in front of them. Backs into him. The other car gets behind him. And the third car blocks him in. And they come out with those long rifles pointed at him and start to give him commands. Which he complied with and, of course, then the search of that car. The FBI will be taking over the investigation into the shooter and into this individual's background and into what he was doing, allegedly, in that area with that rifle as the former president was playing golf just a short distance away. And that is probably some of the details that we hope to get more on at this upcoming briefing from local and federal authorities.",

He frequently holds meetings at. He plays golf at. He even has a campaign meetings with his staff there, as well as various lawmakers who come down to Palm Beach to meet with him as well as donors. So, what they did, in terms of local P.D., Secret Service, to block off this area is very unclear. And, as you can see here, it's a heavily-wooded area. So, you can see in the picture there, they'd have to do a lot to block off that area. There's quite a bit of foliage there, which is what we are understanding. Something came, as John Miller said, from a tree line or that area looking down at the golf course. But just overall, he has had ramped-up security at almost every event and at his homes in Bedminster as well as Mar-A-Lago, including those road closures. Just for one example. I was at an event recently, where I talked to a number of Secret Service agents who had come from headquarters in Washington, who had volunteered to be there as part of this kind of entourage of Secret Service agents. As they've really tried to beef up the security around Donald Trump. I am unclear, and this is one of the things that I've been asking about, when that advance team of Secret Service began traveling with him. Because it hasn't always been that there were multiple teams traveling all around him on the golf course. But, clearly at this time, I'm not sure if it was related to the assassination attempt or if that's something that has just come into practice in recent years. But he, here, clearly had a team, both behind him that whisked him away and nearby by enough to him, as well as this team that was scouting out ahead of the holes. And that is the team that we know engaged with the suspect. COLLINS: Yes. Yes, and that's the question about the perimeter. Because, you know, if you're going into Mar-A-Lago or going into the Trump golf course, obviously there is a security perimeter or a security measure at the entrance. You go through magnetometers. They wand people down. They check to make sure they're on the list. But the perimeter is a whole different animal, as we're waiting to learn more. Kristen Holmes, I know you'll continue talking to your sources. As you hear more, come back to us. And Wolf, obviously, you know, as we've been looking at this, it's just this effort where we're waiting to hear from officials about this. But I've just been talking to several people in Trumps orbit that are stunned. That this is a conversation that we're even having again right now. After just living what they went through in Butler, Pennsylvania, with that attempted assassination that we all witnessed on camera, where he was on stage. And now, you know, a lot of people who are getting calls or were speaking with Donald Trump today, Wolf, just say that they're shocked that this is, again, what they're witnessing.

It was completely shut down. There's law enforcement presence throughout. And then, we -- I got -- I was about two minutes from this live-shot location. We all got pushed into a parking lot. That included myself, other cars, people on bicycles, pedestrians, quickly put away into this other -- put to the side, this other parking lot, because that was when the motorcade was just about to move. They were finally -- had finally deemed it safe to move the former president from here at Trump International. So, we did get some video of that -- of the motorcade moving. But, Wolf, this has been on lockdown. As you know, the golf course went into lockdown immediately when those shots were fired.

When it's so difficult just to get inside Trump International. So, once again, we -- it does appear that the former president has left here. He is safe. We saw about 10 cars going by. And just getting back -- just one note, Wolf. Just because I do live here in Florida, Martin County, where they did put out the bolo to apprehend this individual, that is about an hour from the front gate of this golf course.

His senior staff and advisers have offices that are in West Palm Beach but also at Mar-A-Lago as well. Not offices but they're often meeting with the former president there. We know that, over the last several weeks, that there's staff, particularly junior aides to former President Donald Trump, who are working seven days a week. There are 50-some days left until the election. And it is a constant sprint for this campaign.So, its unsurprising that they were people inside of that office that is in downtown-ish West Palm Beach. So, probably a roughly 12-minute drive from Mar-A-Lago. And that there are a number -- as I said, a number of senior aides and advisers, as well as junior staffers, who have all moved down to the West Palm Beach area. And just a reminder that, in the days after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, there was a memo sent out by campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris Lacivita, essentially telling staffers not to go into the office. Not just in West Palm Beach, but around the country, just to keep them safe. There was a heightened amount of insecurity and anxiety among people who are close to former President Donald Trump. While they did not believe that any of these offices were intended targets, law enforcement did secure all of these offices around the country, particularly one outside of Washington, D.C. and in West Palm Beach, Florida, to make sure that those staffers were safe. They were told to work from home at that time. I will tell you that there's been a lot more ease after Butler in the recent weeks. People felt like -- that security had really ramped up. That they felt safer, particularly with that increased Secret Service presence. And just a reminder, it's not just the Secret Service presence. We've also seen an increased local law enforcement presence. In front of Mar-A-Lago, many of the streets are blocked off. They are highway exits that are, at times, blocked off to Palm Beach, if he is traveling in and out of the area. It's not particularly happy for some of the people who live there who have complained to me about it. But we do know that those are some of the increased security measures that they have taken. So, it's not surprising that that office was shut down or at least searched and put on lockdown, the same way that the Trump International Golf Course was, just out of an abundance of security. Because that had been a very big concern of the campaigns, as they were facing the aftermath of that Butler, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt.",
