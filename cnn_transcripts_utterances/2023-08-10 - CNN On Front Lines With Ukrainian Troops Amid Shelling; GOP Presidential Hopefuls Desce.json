And weeks ago, this was where the remaining locals would be hiding out and getting shelter from air strikes. But it has taken a direct hit and quite a few people lost their lives when this explosion happened. You can still smell the explosive in the air.

You'll have to stick around and figure out exactly what this is in just a minute, Alex.What we are hearing from people who are here in the state of Iowa, it's something we've heard throughout the entire primary, is that they were either in the camp of fully backing Donald Trump or looking for an alternative. That's really the theme we have seen throughout this entire primary season. And that will continue today. Today is the kickoff of the Iowa State Fair. It's notable to anybody watching politics or grew up in the Midwest. About a million people expected here in the next 10 days. This is where we will see the entire GOP field, including Donald Trump. Trump is not expected here until Saturday. But today, we have already seen some of the people who are perhaps in the single digits. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who has generally been a lesser- known candidate, but really flooding the air waves here, trying to get the people here, the Republicans to get to know him. In a few hours, we're expecting former Vice President Mike Pence. They have both been taken part in the soapbox. This is a tradition here in Iowa. They have 20 minutes to deliver their essential message and try to get people on board the Republican caucus members. They're also going to be taking part in what's known as fair-side chats with Iowa's governor. So back to this. This is a deep-fried strawberry cheesecake. I'm going to read this.

He said they are prioritizing aid to people who have lost homes. There are hundreds of families in that position now. He said the Army, Navy, and Coast Guard is there to help with the Hawaiian National Guard. He said they are focused on evacuating residents and tourists from the disaster zone. We did just speak with a state senator there from the Lahaina area. He said they do not have cell service. There are only very small places where they're able to call on the phone, where they're able to text. They need food. They need fuel. Certainly, the needs are very extreme there right now. He said the FEMA administrator is going to be on the ground tomorrow there in Hawaii. So we'll be watching all of this. That is President Biden commenting on the damage from these deadly wildfires in Hawaii. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
