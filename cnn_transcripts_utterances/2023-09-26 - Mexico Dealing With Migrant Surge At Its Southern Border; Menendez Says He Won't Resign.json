HARLOWHouse about a shutdown and potential damage to the United States as the White House puts the blame squarely on House Republicans. According to a new statement from the White House, quote, \"A government shutdown would have damaging impacts across the country, including undermining our national security and forcing servicemembers across the country and around the world to work without pay.\" So at the center of these negotiations is new military assistance, funding for Ukraine, according to the Times. Also, in the Senate, a bipartisan idea gaining traction to take the threat of a government shutdown off the table not just now but for good. Senators and House members circulating a letter pushing legislation that would automatically fund the government past spending deadlines. That is addressed to top party leaders and here is part of it. Quote, \"It is a simple bill that offers an\" enmity reasonable -- an eminently, I should say, \"reasonable solution to one form of recurring congressional gridlock.\" Well, our next guest co-sponsored that bipartisan bill and has been pushing it for five years -- Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. Boy, is it relevant now, Senator. Thank you very much for joining us. The question is would leaders give up the leverage that they get from spending deadlines and shutdowns to forever end the possibility of a shutdown? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  We do need to take the shutdown issue off the table entirely. At the end of the day, this is not good for the United States of America as a world leader. It doesn't typically solve the problem at any point. In fact, I don't know of a shutdown that solved the issue on it. We do need to have hard, grown-up conversations about debt and deficit, but during a shutdown is the wrong time to do it. And quite frankly, the way the bill is shaped, the leaders still have leverage. The way that we shaped the bill -- this is Sen. Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire -- she and I wrote this together five years ago that members of Congress and our staff -- we stay in session seven days a week. We can only work on appropriate bills. It forces Congress to be able to do its job. But it holds federal workers and their families, and the American people harmless in the process while we're trying to -- while we work through the issues that we've got to get done.",

But then also to have no pay during that time period is really difficult. And to lose access to all those contractors.

That is the southern polar jet stream and that is basically just running across the southern tier of our U.S. and making its way into the Eastern Seaboard as well. So to conjure up my favorite HBO Max show, yes, winter is coming. So expect that. That's the trend. In fact, according to the Climate Prediction Center, they're actually calling for above-normal precipitation favoring much of the Eastern Seaboard during the core of the winter season. And that means that the weather patterns generally are going to favor that area for more snow. So what about temperatures? Well, climatologists look towards other winter seasons with strong El Ninos, like we're entering into and they compare Decembers, Januarys, and Februarys of previous years and this is what they predict. The above-average temperatures will be located across the northern tier of our country with the cooler weather kind of defined to the southern portions of the U.S. So if you're looking for snowy and cold weather anticipate that along the Eastern Seaboard.
