Similar comments have come out in the past about the UN.But when you pair that, for example, with what we were -- what we were hearing with Nikki Haley, you know, he has a pattern of this. He's gone after John McCain, for example. He's gone after generals when he -- when he ran in 2016. So, this sense that Donald Trump is somehow going to be a different person than he was a few years ago is just completely erroneous. He is an individual who is not moved -- is not one for hyperbole, even though there were a lot of his supporters that want us to think that words are dangerous.

Because obviously this was such a chaotic scene, and there's still confusion over who this child was. Was this her child? Was it someone else's? And how did this all happen and why? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, trying to piece all this together at one of the most prominent megachurches here in the country like the church behind me. Investigators say that the woman entered here on the west side of the church. And we've also learned in the last few hours that the FBI and ATF has been assisting in a search of a home in the city of Conroe, which is about a 45 to an hour's drive north of the Houston area that searches. That home has gone on throughout the evening hours. We don't know many details as to exactly what was uncovered there. And that sort of thing. But we are expecting to hear from Houston police here in a couple of hours around 2:30 Eastern Time, 1:30 Central Time for the latest updates on this investigation. And as you mentioned, Sara, the woman who showed up here was wearing a long trench coat, was carrying this assault-style rifle underneath there when she began opening fire. And you can hear from that video clip from inside the church just how chaotic and confusing it must have been for many of the parishioners who were inside. Investigators and church officials, Joel Osteen, who is the lead pastor here says that it could have been a lot worse had it happened at a different time that they were in between services. In fact, the Spanish language service was supposed to start here at Lakewood Church in about a half hour after this shooting started. So, this was a point in time where there were people kind of moving back and forth throughout the area and in the -- in a transitional period as they were getting ready for the next service here at this church on Sunday afternoon, Sara.",
