I'm Kim Brunhuber, we're following two major stories on \"CNN Newsroom.\"Israel is ramping up raids in Gaza as it prepares for the next stages in its war against Hamas. But we begin with an urgent manhunt for the suspect in two mass shootings in Maine. Law enforcement surrounded the suspect's last known address for hours on Thursday. Authorities were heard shouting, you're under arrest and come out with your hands up, though it appears the suspect wasn't there at the time. Investigators will be scouring other locations in the hours ahead. Now police are looking for this man, four-year-old Robert Card. He's considered armed and dangerous. He's charged with multiple counts of murder. Officials are telling residents in the areas around Lewiston, Maine to stay vigilant, remain inside and lock their doors as they search for Card. The suspect was seen carrying a high-powered assault- style rifle during the massacre. U.S. Senate Republican Susan Collins, who represents Maine, says she supports a ban on very high-capacity magazines but says that guns aren't necessarily the problem. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): We do have a second amendment in our country.

He could have gotten into a second vehicle and he could be as far away as Florida at this time. He could have gotten into a boat and or he could have got on foot into the woods. I think the boat option going out into the Atlantic, I know the Coast Guard is patrolling. I think that is the least likely of the options because his smaller craft needs fuel. And he would have known this that he would have attracted attention of anybody getting for him obtaining fuel. So I think the most likely option based on what we're learning about the subject is that he is very adept to the rural area, the woods. He's very knowledgeable about these wood areas. So I think either him going out on foot at the -- at the boat dock area or taking the boat down river. to other locations where he had supplies set up. Eric Rudolph in 1998 was a five-year manhunt after he was put on the 10 most wanted, the Atlantic City bombing, excuse me, the Atlanta Olympic bombing, and then other medical facilities. And he was on the run for five years because of the same situation. He was familiar with the woods, he had setups, and he was able to stay hidden from law enforcement for over five years.

But the key takeaway here is it's increasingly likely Chinese leader Xi Jinping is now going to the U.S. next month to attend the APEC summit and also meeting with President Biden there because the main part of, the main mission of Wang Yi's trip is widely seen as to pave the way for its leader to go to San Francisco next month as he hashes out all the final details with his U.S. counterparts.Now, the reason this is happening right now is not coincidental. Obviously, as we mentioned, global conflicts are growing and expanding. So there is some global expectation that the two superpowers need to put a floor on their free-falling relationship because a lot of these issues simply cannot be resolved or even addressed without them somehow seeing eye to eye on some of the issues. That, of course, includes the Gaza conflict. But also remember, there are domestic reasons here as well. Xi Jinping is still facing very strong economic headwinds, so he needs to show the domestic audience here he is capable of managing and recalibrating international relations, especially when it comes to this relationship with the U.S. That's why these meetings in D.C. are happening. Despite tensions, very much still remain high. The two militaries just released videos to accuse each other of conducting dangerous maneuvers in and above the South China Sea, putting other sides' warships and warplanes on a collision course. And then, of course, you have these hardened, targeted very much export control measures targeting China. So, at the end of the day, a lot of these moves are seen as tactical by analysts. Fundamentally, they say the Chinese leader -- his view on the U.S. remains quite dim, as he has put himself. The U.S. is out to get China, to contain China's rise and surprise Chinese interests. But at least right now, the two sides seem to agree there's this narrow window of opportunity between now and early next year when the U.S. presidential election season kicks off in earnest.

President Zelenskyy says Denmark's offering is over $500 million worth of tanks, drones and ammunition. U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby has blasted Russia for its continued invasion of Ukraine, saying Russia, quote, \"continues to show no regard for the lives of soldiers.\" Here he is. JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: Since the 11th of October, Russia has suffered significant losses in this offensive attempt of theirs, including at least 125 armored vehicles around Avdiivka and more than a battalion's worth of equipment. We expect more Russian attacks to come. This is a dynamic conflict and we need to remember that Russia still maintains some offensive capability and may be able to achieve some tactical gains in the coming months. To pursue that outcome in Avdiivka and elsewhere on the battlefield, Russia continues to show no regard for the lives of its soldiers. We believe they have suffered thousands of casualties in their effort to conduct this offensive. Some of them on the orders of their own leaders. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You see all the debris, its plants, its palm trees, its metal, its brick. This is the front of those fancy hotels where people spend hundreds ofdollars to come and enjoy some time off. It's completely ruined. Not only the front. Look up. Look at what happened to this building. You cannot even see any proof that anybody could have been living there. We have reports that people were actually in these buildings when the hurricane came, but you can see the danger they were in because of the damage that buildings like this have suffered after. And this is something that we see not only on these nice, expensive areas, the resort areas. They -- more poor parts of the city are also suffering. The people are telling us they are not getting help, they're not getting water, they're not getting food. We saw looting in some streets, in some stores people were coming out. In most cases they were just taking food, water, something to drink. There were some that took advantage of the situation and they walked away with big screen TVs, but mostly people were telling us they just needed something to get by. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
