And while many have questioned the strategic value of what is left to this city, both sides have doubled down on their commitment to control it. This video posted on social media appears to show Ukrainian combat vehicle coming under fire from fighters with the Russian Wagner mercenary group. Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces have been able to hold their defensive lines. This video appears to show Russian soldiers in retreat from the city's outskirts. Russia claims to have captured settlements around Bakhmut and the Russian defense minister says the victory here will open the wake of further advances in eastern Ukraine. There is no doubt this battle has become a symbolic one but one of a strategic value. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with CNN about the decision to continue defending this city. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is tactical for us. We understand that after Bakhmut, they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk to Sloviansk. It will be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine in the Donetsk direction in the east of Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But after today's meeting ended, we had a few minutes to approach some delegates, which are a curated group of local representatives. This delegate is part of its Zhuang ethnic minority from the southwestern Guangxi province. She says this is her first time attending the Congress, and she feels happy to see her motherland becoming stronger. The rest of the delegates quickly rush out before we have a chance to approach them. The question is how much of these COVID controls will remain in post pandemic China. It limits access, even more, to China's already extremely opaque political machine. This much is clear. The communist leadership only wants the world to see one narrative from China. That is the image of unity, strength, and victory. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Five women claim that the laws are putting their fertility and their lives at risk if there's a medical emergency. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Amanda and Josh Zurawski were thrilled last year to tell family and friends that, after years of trying, Amanda was finally pregnant. Then, four months into her pregnancy, her water broke. AMANDA ZURAWSKI, TREATMENT DENIED DUE TO TEXAS LAW: You're 100 percent, for sure, going to lose your baby. We just kept asking isn't there anything we can do? Isn't there anything we can do? And the answer was no. SERFATY (voice-over): But doctors in Texas said they couldn't do an abortion. Amanda became septic, needed a blood transfusion. Her family flew in, because they feared she would die. Amanda lost her baby, but survived and is now the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit filed Monday in a Texas court against the state and a Texas medical board.",

Walgreens says they won't distribute abortion medication in those states, saying in this letter to the Kansas attorney general that \"Walgreens does not intend to ship mifepristone into your state.\" Newsom countered with a tweet: \"California won't be doing business with Walgreens or any companies that cowers to the extremists and puts women's lives at risk.\" He didn't specify what business his state has with the drugstore chain.

In Morocco, dozens formed a circle, held hands at a World Women's Forum for Peace, supported by the United Nations. This year's theme is \"DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality,\" and to highlight the growing digital gender gap. Meantime, in Spain, the government has approved a draft bill of a gender equality law, aimed to boost the presence of women in politics, business, as well as other areas. It will impose a 40 percent minimum female representation on boards at large companies and professional associations. And in Cuba, this International Women's Day is special for female boxers. They were recently allowed to compete in tournaments after decades of restrictions. Now many are making history by getting in the ring. Our man in Havana is Patrick Oppmann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For years, this is how women in Cuba have boxed. Sparring in rudimentary gyms, with whatever equipment they could scrounge. While men's boxing is a sport the island has long dominated, women's boxing did not bear the government's stamp of approval, meaning women boxers had to train on their own and were unable to compete in tournaments at home or abroad. It was a missed opportunity to show how formidable Cuban women can be in the ring, says trainer Namibia (ph). \"From the time we were in our mother's wombs, we are fighters,\" she says. \"We are always fighting for something: to raise our kids, to help our families, to be independent.\" Whether was sexism or simply the slow pace of progress they were up against, at long last, Cuba's female boxers are getting their title shot. In December, Cuban boxing officials said a new league for women would be created and that they hoped female boxers could represent the island in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. \"We took this step when we were sure, really convinced,\" he says, \"that it was the moment, and we didn't have any concerns because our women would be protected.\" Weeks later, 12 women made history as they competed for a spot on the team.",

These athletes know they will still need to change some minds about whether they belong in the ring, but say at long last, attitudes are shifting. \"In my case, all the comments I have received have been positive,\" she says, \"that if I make an effort, I can achieve it, that Cuban women have the potential for this.\" It took years for this moment to arrive, and while Cuba's woman boxers are only just beginning to fight, simply being in the ring means they've already won the first round.
