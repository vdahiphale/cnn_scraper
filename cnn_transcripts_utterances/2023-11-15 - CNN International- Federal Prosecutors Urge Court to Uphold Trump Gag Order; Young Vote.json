They point to the fact that in this case they say just days after he was indicted, he issued this threat. He said, quote: If you go after me, I'm coming after you. He then proceeded to attack the court, the special counsel and trial witnesses who could potentially give negative testimony. Then there were repercussions, for example, prosecutors note how the judge overseeing this case had someone call and threaten her to kill her and her family if Trump was not elected in 2024. Now, even as recently as this past weekend, Trump was calling out special counsel Jack Smith -- him and his family. Now the gag order is currently on hold, so that is not technically a violation. Prosecutors say that is exactly why they need a gag order. Trump's lawyers have insisted that this gag order violates his First Amendment, inhibits his ability to campaign for the presidency. But prosecutors rebut that by saying, look, there's never been a defendant who's been able to just go out there and malign the courts and prosecutors and witnesses. And the judge in this case has previously said that his First Amendment must yield to the orderly administration of justice. Now the question as to whether he will have to be bound by this gag order, that goes before a three-judge panel in the Court of Appeals on Monday. Paula Reed, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
