The situation is getting tense as thousands of Israelis, many far-right nationalists, march through the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. They're celebrating Flag Day, an annual event marking Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 war. In the past hour, journalists in the press area near Damascus Gate were pelted reportedly with rocks and other objects. And some teenage marchers shout as racist taunts at journalists wearing hijabs. Well, we have our reporters on the ground there. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in the Old City in Jerusalem. But let's begin with our Hadas Gold, who's near the Damascus Gate. Clearly, Hadas, this has been a tense situation developing in the last couple of hours. Tell us what you've been seeing, what the atmosphere is there right now.",

We were in the cordoned off press area forjournalists to film and witness this annual march and things were already getting a little bit more active, especially with young teenage boy groups. This is the route for men to take. The women take a different route that takes them through the Jewish quarter of the Old City. The marchers go through this gate, Damascus Gate, which is the main entrance to the Muslim quarter, and they are all going to meet up and end at the Western Wall Plaza. And already, things were getting tense. We were hearing teenagers chanting things about getting revenge on Palestine and erasing their name. But then things started to escalate. They were coming up to the press there. I was standing right next to several other reporters, including several female reporters who were wearing hijabs right next to us, and they started taunting those reporters directly, saying things like may your village burn. And that's when we started getting some violence. Things started to be thrown at us -- rocks, bottles, cans. I myself saw journalists being injured in their -- on the head by things being thrown. We actually, at one point, had to pull back a little bit for our own safety. It took some time for police to take control of the situation. There are thousands of police out to try and keep this route safe but in recent years, this march, which is meant to celebrate for Israelis when Israel took control of East Jerusalem, when Israelis were able to go to the holy sites of the Old City. In recent years, it's become essentially a right-wing nationalist rally and especially when now in -- this is the most far-right government in Israeli history. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir actually was just here just behind me in the crowd where people were chanting things like, oh look, the prime minister is here. These people adore these types of ministers and they feel emboldened now that they are in government. Now, this March was the pretext for that 2021 war. It was during this march just in the 6 p.m. hour when militants in Gaza fired rockets towards Jerusalem and it caused the march to actually be canceled. Well, that set off that 11-day war with Hamas militants in Gaza. Now, there is less of an expectation of rockets being fired tonight, but the feeling on the ground is still very tense. It's very violent and it boasts towards Arabs and towards journalists, as well. And so, there is fear actually that the violence will actually be on the ground and not necessarily coming from the sky. Christina.",

And what we've been seeing is thousands of people coming down from the hill up there towards Damascus Gate. These are mostly young men, some of them teenagers, some of them younger. Many of them from the occupied West Bank, religious Zionists. This is really sort of many of them, some of the most extreme elements in Israeli society. We spoke to some of them, and they basically see this conflict in biblical terms, that they say that God gave the Jews this land and everybody else who lives there, in their opinion, is just going to have to put up with it. And what we've seen is, inside the Old City that the Palestinians are being forced to put up with it because there have been barriers erected within the Old City along all the alleyways to stop any sort of interaction between Palestinian residents of the Old City and these thousands of marchers. Now, officially, there was no order for merchants to close their shops in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. But we did see, at certain point, police basically forcing them to close. We saw scuffles between Palestinian youth and some of the young Israeli marchers. We experienced scuffles with the police as well, who didn't seem to think we should be doing our job covering this event but it's been tense by and large, not major violence, not major clashes, but still some hours to go before people come home so, we shall see what happens.

The children, aged thirteen, nine, four, and a baby who's not even yet one year old, were traveling in a small aircraft that came down in the south of the country. But the news has still not yet been confirmed. Let's speak to journalist Stefano Pozzebon, who's in Bogota.

And now, we are understanding that it's not been absolutely confirmed yet. We know from the airline company that was providing the flight that crashed on the 1st of May that there a small single engine Cessna 206. So, it was flying with these four children, four minors and three adults and crashed pretty much halfway in their flight from the Caqueta River towards the north in San Jose del Guaviare. Christina, this is one of the most remote and sparsely populated regions in Colombia and in Latin America. It's a region that is deep rainforest where communications is really tough and where you either move around with a plane or with a boat in the river. And right now we are at the height of the rainy season down there, so any sort of communications, transportation, movement is very, very difficult. We have been given, however, some images, Christina, of the search and rescue operations that the Colombian Air Force and the Colombian military forces have set up to try to get locate and hopefully rescue these children. I want to point out that the Colombian soldiers are here, you probably see them on the screen. They're playing a message from the grandmother of these children who speaks to them and essentially trying to calm them down and also make contact with them. We can only imagine what's their mental situation, what are their feelings now after having survived if they truly have and if the story has a positive outcome after staying in the jungle for 17 days, let's not forget the plane crashed on May 1st and now 17 days after we may be on the brink of a solution, hopefully a positive one, Christina.",
