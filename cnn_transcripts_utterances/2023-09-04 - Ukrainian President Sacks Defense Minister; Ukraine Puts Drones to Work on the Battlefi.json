Reznikov has served in that role since before Russia's invasion, appointed in November of 2021. In recent months, President Zelenskyy has overhauled the country's defense sector, cracking down on corruption. Reznikov hasn't been directly implicated in any of that, but Mr. Zelenskyy says it is time to make a change. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Oleksii Reznikov has been through more than 550 days of full-scale war. I believe that the ministry needs new approaches and other formats of interaction, with both the military and society as a whole. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So whilst I think there's been no indication whatsoever that Reznikov himself was corrupt, I think he's failed to stop corruption occurring within the Ministry of Defense.

Very few defense ministers have to actually manage defense policy during wartime, and he's done that exceptionally well in the sense that he's been front and center in engaging with Western countries to ensure that Ukraine gets weapons that they need and gets them in reasonable quantities.I think one area where maybe there has been a challenge is getting the critical types of weapons such as armored fighting vehicles, battle tanks, in particular the F-16s and also long-range missiles quickly enough. But this is not really Reznikov's failure, per se. It's more a failure of the West in the sense of being overcautious in supplying Ukraine with those critical capabilities. So I think he has been effective in so many ways. HOLMES: Yes. What do we know about his replacement -- replacement, Rustem Umerov?

Their counteroffensive was delayed because of a slow response by the West to supply the types of capabilities that they would need, such as the tanks and the armored fighting vehicles.So they're now battling against the clock. They're advancing South towards Mariupol from Tokmak. Tokmak is the next big target for the offensive if the Ukrainians can break through the Russian lines there. And they've indicated they've broken through that first line of a defense, breaking near Tokmak, at least the Russian forces around Tokmak have made it Tokmak unusable as a resupply area. And that makes it virtually impossible for the Russians to hang onto Crimea. It sets them up for an advance deeper into Crimea by Mariupol in the spring of 2024.

They're apparently pushed through the Russian first line of defense, and they're now advancing potentially further than that. But we still have yet to see how tough those defenses are behind that first line of defense, and whether the Ukrainians can widen that breach sufficiently to pour through heavier forces like armored fighting vehicles and main battle tanks. If they can, then they certainly can make record advances before the winter, essentially denying the supply lines for the Russian forces in Crimea and then establishing a good position from which they can poise to advance into Crimea in the Northern spring of 2024. Obviously, the Russians will try and defend that as much as they can, but there is some question about just what is the quality of Russian troops behind that first line of defense. And I think it will be critical to see just how effective that Russian defense is.",

First of all, of course, it's the least contributor to climate change. Five percent of global historic emissions and, actually, about 2 percent when you remove the emissions from South Africa, were oftentimes not in the headlines as an emitter. But also, science is now very clear, the latest reports from the IPC saying that Africa is actually the continent growing fastest on Earth, faster than any other continent. We have a number of countries on the continent already reporting more than one degree Celsius on average of temperature increase, and that's has led to multiple impacts. But, you know, not being an economic powerhouse on the continent -- on the planet obviously means that that is oftentimes not seen. And then thirdly, I would say the big challenge for us in Africa is therefore not as the emitter but as the most vulnerable, means that our challenges are really our adaptation and responding to the loss and damage happening across the continent.",

Also human-wild (ph) conflict, which is really important, as well. What does this mean for people? Agriculture and food is the mainstay of the economy in Africa.

This coming almost weeks after General Brice Oligui Nguema and members of Gabon's presidential guard seized power from President Ali Bongo.The coup ended the political dynasty of the Bongo family, which had been in power for more than 50 years. It also marked the eighth military takeover in Western Central Africa in three years. In Chile, a joyous ending to 42 years of sorrow. A mother who was told her child died at -- died in childbirth got a stunning phone call telling her he was actually alive. But as Rafael Romo tells us, many babies were stolen there in the 1970s and '80s, and this reunion is heartbreakingly one of just a few.

Chilean authorities say many priests, nuns, doctors, nurses and others conspired to carry out illegal adoptions. Authorities told us the number of stolen babies could be in the thousands. But the investigation into the adoptions has languished over the years, and some of the hospitals where the children were born have shut down, as we have found out over the years. [00:35:05] ROMO: For many women in this country, what this hospital in ruins means is a place where their children were stolen, a place that became a nightmare for them. They were looking for a place where they would deliver a healthy baby. Instead, they left empty-handed.",
