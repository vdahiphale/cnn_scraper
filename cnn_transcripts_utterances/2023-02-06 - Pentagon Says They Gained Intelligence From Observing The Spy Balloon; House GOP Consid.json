What they have said over the last few days is that they were able to collect intelligence about the way that the balloon was transmitting information, for example, and other ways about how it maneuvered.But ultimately, what we're told is that the administration does not believe that it was ultimately able to gather that much intelligence at all because the specifications of the balloon were not all that sophisticated, right. No more sophisticated say than the satellites that the Chinese have hovering in orbit as we speak. But the issue, of course, with the satellites is that they do not stay in one place for as long as a balloon can. A balloon can loiter for a much longer period of time as it did over Montana, for example. So, the U.S. officials that we spoke to did say that there were steps taken to cover up certain areas to make sure that no unencrypted communications were happening in the vicinity of the balloon and generally just minimize the ability of the balloon to collect intel. But you know, one really interesting detail that we learned today, Jake, is that the U.S. military actually does not have the capability on a day-to-day basis to collect intelligence on things inside the United States. And so, they were given special authorization to collect intelligence on this balloon while it was in -- over the United States, Jake.",

As Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader said yesterday, said it defies belief to suggest there was nowhere between the Aleutian Islands of Alaska and the coast of Carolina where the balloon could have been shot down to avoid endangering American lives.Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader says that those kinds of criticisms are premature and they are political. Now, there is a hope among the Democratic leaders and the Republican leaders that there will be more information coming as soon as tomorrow. There's an expectation that the so-called Gang of Eight, the leaders of Congress and the leaders of the Intelligence Committee will get highly classified information about exactly what happened here. Then there will be another briefing for the larger set of members. The Senate Intelligence Committee members as well as the full Senate, as well as the full House potentially could get briefed as soon as next week. Other members from the key committees want to get briefed as well. Now, Jake, there is still uncertainty whether the House Republicans will take some symbolic gesture to condemn the president's actions. Remember, the House majority on the Republican side, very narrow. They can't lose more than four Republican votes to approve anything the moment they don't have an agreement yet on what any resolution could look like. So, I am told at this moment they're still debating about whether to proceed on any sort of vote to sort of push back against the Biden administration here. But Kevin McCarthy right now meeting with his top leaders in his office as they chart out the four strategy and decide how to proceed on this issue.",
