No incumbent president has ever been defeated in his party's primary since the 19th century, but 69-year-old RFK Jr. has a surprising amount of support.A recent CNN poll shows that among Democratic and likely Democratic voters, he's polling at 20 percent over President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. Joe Biden is at 60 percent. Twenty percent is about as high as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is polling in the Republican primary, despite a fraction of the media coverage and advertising for Kennedy. How? Well, his alarmist conspiracy theory messaging has given him a platform on anti-establishment podcasts and conservative media, including today's talk with Elon Musk on Twitter. For years, Kennedy has pushed back on medical experts and scientific consensus who widely agree that the broad application of childhood vaccines helps prevent the spread of disease and has no ties to autism, but he has spread, Kennedy, these lies, tying childhood vaccines to autism. In May of 2019, two of Kennedy's siblings and his niece wrote an op-ed in Politico titled, \"R.F.K. Jr. is our brother and uncle. He's tragically wrong about vaccines.\" This is before COVID, of course. The next month, Kennedy met with a prominent anti-vaccine activist in Samoa, where vaccine fears run rampant. And later that year, a deadly measles outbreak shut down that island and claimed dozens of lives, many of them children. During the pandemic, of course, of COVID pandemic, Kennedy likened Dr. Anthony Fauci to Hitler. He said it was easier for Anne Frank to hide from Nazis than for Americans to escape vaccine mandates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY JR.: Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You can hide in an attic like Anne Frank did. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He had an article in salon.com and \"Rolling Stone\" about childhood vaccines that both publications had to retract and take down because it was so false. But why would Instagram reinstate his account? SARA FISCHER, SR. MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS: Especially because he did explicitly violate its policies around COVID misinformation. Instagram spokesperson told me today that the reason they did it is because he's a contender for 2024. And so basically Instagram is saying, look, we believe that politician's speech should be treated differently than everyday people because people have the right to hear what their politicians are going to say. Whether you agree with that or not, that's their policy. And it's worth noting, Jake, they're not the only ones. YouTube said last week that it was going to roll back some of its policies around election denialism, meaning it would allow that kind of speech on the platform because, you know, the Republican Party has a lot of candidates right now who are putting that forward as their platform. And they also don't want to be having to be the ones that are pulling people away from hearing our politicians.

The Pentagon says the U.S. ship had to slow down to avoid a  collision. This happened in the Taiwan Strait between the island of Taiwan and mainland China, which the U.S. insists is international waters, even though China claims it is its own territory. CNN's Will Ripley joins us now from Taiwan's capital city, Taipei. Will, tell us more about what happened and what both sides are saying about the incident. WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this happened on the Taiwan Strait over the weekend, as you said, Jake, and this is just the latest in a series of incidents between the United States and China that have some in this region and, frankly, around the world worried that this region is spiraling closer to conflict. On Saturday, at the same time that the U.S. defense secretary was in Singapore at a defense summit with the Chinese defense minister, this U.S. destroyer and a Canadian warship made a freedom of navigation transit through the Taiwan Strait. The United States does this very often. They say this is international waters. They don't recognize Taiwan as China's territory. China's communist rulers have never actually controlled this island. And yet a Chinese warship essentially cut off the U.S. destroyer coming dangerously close. We're talking about less than 500 feet between these two ships. Had the U.S. destroyer stayed on course at its actual speed, the two ships would have very likely had a collision, the United States says. But the U.S. ship slowed down basically to a crawl and avoided a collision with that Chinese warship. Now, the U.S. Defense Secretary, speaking at that security summit in Singapore, Lloyd Austin, he talked about how dangerous this situation is. And then, of course, the Chinese Defense minister had his own response to why the U.S. was there. Again, the U.S. claims this was just a peaceful passage. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I think accidents can happen that could cause things to spiral out of control. LI SHANGFU, CHINESE DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): They're not here for innocent passage. They're here for provocation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
