The tree was praised as a victory of light over darkness. Kyiv says Russian drones and missiles pummeled cities across the country on Friday, killing at least 31 people and wounding more than 150 others. Now we're hearing from Russia that it shot down more than 30 drones that came from Ukraine overnight. The UAVs reportedly went down in four separate Russian regions, including Moscow. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attacks terrorist strikes. He is vowing that they won't go unanswered, and Ukraine will bring the war to Russia. Nic Robertson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): From Ukraine's center, Dnipro, to all points: Kyiv in the north, Odessa in the south, Kharkiv in the Northeast and to Lviv in the far west. Russia launched its biggest air attack since their ground invasion 22 months ago, 44 of 158 Russian missiles evading Ukraine's Western supported air defenses, killing and wounding civilians. This man narrowly surviving, pulled from the rubble in Kharkiv. Schools, shopping malls, private homes and high-rises, even a maternity hospital hit. In the capital, this resident awoken by missiles at 7:30 am \"It was a horrible sound. It was so frightening. The missile was flying and everything was buzzing, whirring,\" she says. \"I didn't know what to do.\" President Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of throwing nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal against Ukraine. Ukraine's air force describe a complex attack of interlocking waves of drones, bombers, fighters jets, cruise, hypersonic and other missiles, intended to distract and stretch air defenses.",

If you remember, when it liberated part of the Kharkiv region, et cetera. And so now we are being told that this is looking much more sinister than we thought. Putin has been able to mobilize significant resources. Economically he was able to move his economy to a war footing. And so we are now having it play catch up to the Russians. We have to relieve these exhausted troops. We have to train new soldiers. This will take time. This is being done quite late in the game. So this is a very, very nervous moment for all of us, especially now that we are seeing our partners in Brussels are being slow with their delivery of financial aid and the U.S. Congress has still not decided what to do with the announced package for Ukraine.

I mean, this should actually lead to the invocation of Article 5, the collective security by NATO. But we're talking about a nuclear power such as Russia.
