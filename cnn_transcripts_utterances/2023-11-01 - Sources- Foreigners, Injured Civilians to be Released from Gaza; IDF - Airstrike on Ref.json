Sources telling CNN that a deal has been reached among Israel, Hamas, and Egypt, in coordination with the U.S., to release all foreign nationals who have been stuck in Gaza, along with critically injured civilians. The sources say the deal is separate from any hostage negotiations. CNN's Rafael Romo is live for us in Tel Aviv. Rafael, we just learned about this in the last hour or so.

First of all, we have to say that this agreement is as you mentioned before this is crucial, very important, because there are many families waiting not only for the civilians but also from the hostages. And it is separate indeed from any hostage negotiations and yes, it is a deal that was brokered by Israel, Hamas, and Egypt with coordination with the United States. With the purpose of releasing all foreign nationals.And according to sources familiar with the negotiations, Kasie, critically injured civilians will also be allowed to get out of Gaza. Now, I have to tell you, this is still very preliminary and there is no timeline or details on the number of people to be released. What we had previously of been reporting was that 81 injured Palestinians were expected to arrive at the Rafah crossing at some point today, after the massive attack yesterday by Israel in Jabalia refugee camp. But in any case this agreement marks a major breakthrough when it comes to getting civilians out of Gaza. Many of those civilians, Kasie, are American citizens with U.S. passports that have been stuck there since the beginning of the war. So, very good news for them and their families -- Kasie.",

He joins us live from Brisbane, Australia. General, thanks for being with us. Let's talk about the distinction that is being made here because there are, of course, civilians who have been terribly impacted by the strikes that Israel is making. Obviously, there are accusations of war crimes from the Palestinian side, Israel says this is aimed at legitimate targets and that the reality is, the people that they are targeting, Hamas, are building these tunnels and putting military infrastructure underneath human beings and that's what makes it so hard. How do you view each side's argument here? MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN, AUSTRALIAN ARMY (RET.):  Well, it certainly is a very difficult balancing act for the Israelis to achieve here. Yes, there are legitimate targets that are going after in Gaza, but military necessity and proportionality that are also very important principles that thrive here. And beyond the laws of war, they need to engage in ethical conduct. At the end of the day, to kill a couple of enemy combatants strike, then accidentally killed a bunch of civilians, we need to question the proportionality of that.",

Record breaking cold temperatures are in store today from the Southern Plains to the Northeast. Let's get straight to meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, good morning to you. I will say I personally felt this on the East Coast last night when we were out for Halloween. I fell like it was getting steadily colder from about 3:00 p.m. on.

      "sentences": "Yeah, can I give a bit of props out there for the parents who are awake at this time of the morning, especially if you've got children that you looked around in the snow? I mean, this is a real story. Out of the Great Lakes on Halloween, there was a few inches of snow from Chicago into my home state of Michigan. It got so windy, so snowy, that the electricity went out in parts of west Michigan near the Lakeshore, and they cancel trick-or-treating for some of the kids. Drastic.But this is the scene that unfolded. This is lake effect snow band. And in fact, the latest radar shows some of those snow bands moving off the greater Chicago region, but right back into southwestern Michigan, and right off of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as well. You can see some of the snow bands, wow. That is a spooky Halloween forecast. We warn you yesterday that there would be a drastic cooldown, and it is not just across the great lakes in the Midwest. It is all the way to the mid-Atlantic in the East Coast. Check out D.C., our nation's capital. On the 30th of October, it was 82. I think today will only reach 51 degrees for the afternoon. So you are waking up to a cold start to November, and we have roughly about 60 potential record lows from today and through tomorrow morning. That's why the National Weather Service has this hard freeze warning for places like Atlanta, Charlotte, all the way to D.C. And you can see that below freezing temperatures for much of the nation's midsection, still the lower 40s along the east coast, but it is really nasty when you factor in the wind. Wind chill value is well below freezing for many locations over the eastern two thirds. The only silver lining in this forecast, Kasie, is that we will get a bit of sunshine, because the cold front that brought the chill, the autumn weather, is well off the East Coast, so that will help rebound at least the feeling on our skin, because of the yellow sun. I'm telling you -- if I've got red eyes this morning, it's because my kids brought me around until at least 9:00 p.m., and my alarm goes off at 3:00 in the morning. Whoo. I am tired.",
