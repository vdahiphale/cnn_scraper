      "sentences": "Again, right now, what we know is that this vehicle was coming in and was directed to a secondary screening point there at the border. And there was -- it appears to be an acceleration that happened.It's not clear why that was, whether it was intentional or the person tried to speed through the secondary screening or whether there was an accident or, as we were just talking about just now, whether there was some kind of a medical incident that could have caused this. Again, there are a lot of questions the FBI is still trying to get to the bottom of, Homeland Security, the ATF, everybody is there. They'll be examining the vehicle to see what caused that explosion. Was it something that happened after the car crashed into the object -- into the infrastructure there at the border post or whether there was something on board the car that would have been triggered and caused an explosion? Again, those are all the questions that the investigators are still trying to work out. But at this point, we do know -- at least the initial part of the investigation indicates that there were two people, two occupants in the vehicle and that they're both deceased. This investigation gets a lot more complicated and a lot more difficult because there's nobody there to question or ask about exactly what was the motive or what was the reason why this crash happened and why this explosion happened. Obviously, they're taking all the -- the abundance of caution is, you can see it everywhere, right, they've closed all the border crossings and the Joint Terrorism Task Force is being activated, they're there. We can't draw any conclusions from that. But obviously, they would be there when you have an incident like this to figure out why it happened -- Boris?",

Josh, Evan brings up a very good point that you had alluded to just moments ago about investigators potentially interviewing those involved in the incident. Now that we've learn the two men in the car are deceased, how does that complicate investigator's efforts?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's so important because that rules out the ability for authorities to hear directly about what their state of mind was, what was happening in the call.Again, was it some type of medical incident? Was it an accident, some type of mechanical issue? That means this other type of evidence will be so much more important, including CCTV. We're talking about a border check point blanketed with security cameras. They'll be going back to look at all of that footage. And I would suggest, even within Canada -- this is why those international relationships are so important. On that side of the border, authorities want to track back, where were the individuals coming from to establish some type of pattern, direct evidence about where they were, again, to try to understand what was taking place in the moments leading up to this. I will say also, Boris, for all of those -- all of us watching right now, this is something we want an answer to, as far as whether this was terrorism. I can tell you, based on experience covering these stories with the suspects -- I keep saying suspect -- the individuals now deceased, I think that means it's going to take much longer for authorities to come out and say, we have ruled out terrorism. Again, at this point, they have to do their due diligence in order to try to gather information at the scene, understand the full picture of who these people were. But the fact that they don't have that direct ability to interview them, I think patience is going to be key because authorities have a lot of work to do behind the scenes. I don't think we'll see them come out anytime quickly now with these individuals to say we've ruled this out. But obviously, those are questions we'll continue to ask.",

If you're just joining us, there's been an explosion at the Rainbow Bridge crossing that connects the United States and Canada near Niagara Falls. It's been shut down now. You're looking at live images from a camera focused on that crossing. We've learned that two men in that vehicle were killed when the car exploded as it was trying to get through the crossing. We have CNN's Brynn Gingras who has been following the latest details on all this. Brynn, walk us through what you're learning. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris, and as we're hearing from the panel that you've been talking to, there's still so much information that needs to be gathered on the scene. The federal authorities there from the ATF, the FBI, the Joint Terrorism Task Force on the ground there trying to answer those questions. But what we know at this point, there are four land crosses that are shut down in response to this explosion that happened at the Rainbow Bridge at Niagara Falls, the cross entry between the U.S. and Canada. Authorities on both sides working this, trying to get those answers. And from our understanding, what John Miller has been learning, is that a car went at an accelerated rate of speed, at some point during the check point process and then, as it's been described, exploded. We know from Evan Perez that two people inside that car are deceased. So as Evan pointed out earlier, it might be hindering a little bit this investigation. Certainly, not able to get questions answered from those people who were the occupants of the car. But unclear what the motive was. Was someone doing this as a sinister act? Was this a medical incident that happened? All of those are questions that are still needing to be answered on the ground. But as we've been saying, authorities are notifying Justin Trudeau. We just saw him talking on the floor there. He's getting updates. We know that the governor of New York is getting updates. We know that the vice -- rather, the president is getting updates about this ongoing situation while he's vacationing with family in Nantucket. Of course, we also know that, currently, right now, the threat environment at this time in this country is at a high level. We've been talking about this, not only just because of what's happening in the Middle East, but also of course the holiday. We know that authorities have sort of raised the risk assessment and we know there's, in that area at least, a systemwide security uptick. That means for the airports in that area, for cars traveling through that area. Certainly, there are going to be more check points. There are going to be more screenings of cars. There's going to be more screenings of individuals getting on and off planes. So certainly, there's an uptick in security in that area. So again, much of this information still getting relayed to us from sources up there on the ground and we'll continue to update you.",

      "sentences": "There's a lot of things you can see at the airport, like the dogs put in place here and they've been sweeping the airport all day, but also many things you cannot say.The TSA has entered this heightened state of security after this incident. We heard from the Buffalo airport and the Niagara Falls frontier transportation authority, which oversees the airport. They say all cars coming into the airport will be screened. They will be doing that because they entered a heightened state of awareness there. They're trying to make sure things are getting out to the public because so many people are traveling today. And 2.7 million people is estimated by TSA to pass through airports nationwide. The airport of Buffalo relatively busy. It's a pretty significant impact. I want to read you the statement from the TSA. It says, \"The TSA and the Department of Homeland Security are in close and ongoing touch with all partners and continue to monitor the situation and may adjust security postures as or when necessary.\" So, we are only seeing this now develop just in this moment. The TSA is essentially telling us we may see more things develop at airports nationwide. Right now, at Reagan National Airport, things seem roughly normal. We've been through ebbs and flows all day of huge traffic volume. Now we're about to be on the precipice of the afternoon rush. Around 3:00 p.m. is when things start getting going again. And we'll see the impact here as it unfolds as so many people are trying to get where they're going on this big day before Thanksgiving, the biggest day for holiday travel.",

      "sentences": "Sure.Let's get more details from John Miller. John, you've been on the phone with sources in law enforcement that have been looking closely, reviewing some of the footage. What are you learning? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: This is Buffalo joint Terrorism Task Force from the FBI field office there. This is the Customs and Border Protection people who operate the security cameras on the bridge. This is the Buffalo agencies, including the sheriff, which has the bomb squad. They've been going backwards looking at this from different angles. The most telling piece of video they have shows the car on a local road, on the U.S. side in Niagara Falls, suddenly, begins to accelerate. And then moving towards the check point at a high rate of speed and then striking a curb and then flying over a barrier, crossing over to the other side of the road and then landed in a secondary inspection area and then disintegrating and bursting into flames on impact. What we have here now is a very active investigation, but we're past the first version that a car exploded at the secondary check point after being referred there. It actually flew there after impacting the curb and the barrier and then exploded upon impact after landing. That could mean an accidental acceleration. It could mean a motorist who suffered a medical issue with his foot on the accelerator. It could mean a ramming attack, which is intentional, where he got up to a high rate of speed and struck the barrier. But what we again have here is we are far away from being able to call this a terrorist attack or even an attack. And we need a lot more information from the forensics at the scene, the identity of the person in the car, and what that tells us about that person and whoever was with them in terms of background.",

It starts to look more like trying to potentially, you know -- two people trying to essentially push their way across the border because they're afraid of getting stopped if they tried it in the lawful way. So that's a possibility.But we can't rule out the fact, Boris, that this could have been two people trying to make some sort of a statement that ended up, unfortunately, in a life-taking way for themselves. So there are -- there are all sorts of -- it's a very gray area of what was their intent and were they simply trying to get to the other side and slip through in an area where they normally would have been caught and detained? Were they trying to make a statement almost like an act of suicide or protest? We just don't know at this point. But I think that the less likely answer to these questions is that it was some sort of an intentional terrorist attack, with a vehicle bomb, especially.",

This information, I just viewed some video of the explosion, and I'm not an expert on this, but it could have been a saddle tank on a vehicle or something that caused that level of explosion. It wasn't a -- it didn't appear to be a huge truck laden with explosives. This could very well be some type of medical situation or accident.
