The sports world is reeling over the sudden death of a prominent U.S. sports journalist at the World Cup. Grant Wahl died in Qatar Friday after collapsing in the press area.Now, white flowers fill his empty seat. He was only 49 years old. The circumstances around his death still unclear. But in a podcast and newsletter, published days before his death, he had complained of feeling unwell including tightness in his chest. You may remember Wahl was the same journalist who made headlines in November, after he was detained and briefly refused entry to a World Cup match for wearing a rainbow t-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights. The U.S. State Department says it's in communication with Wahl's family and World Cup organizers. And CNN's Don Riddell joins me now from Doha. Don, just awful news, just made everybody gasp late last night here in the U.S. What more are we learning about the circumstances surrounding Wahl's death?",

I mean, it was just so sudden and so bizarre, frankly, that it has taken most of the day to really begin to try to process it. And certainly, for the immediate hours after I learned about it, I mean, it just didn't make any sense at all.There were people in the stadium, fellow journalist who saw what happened. I was covering the game from a different part of the stadium so I was unaware about any of this until 5:00 this morning here local time. But witnesses have told CNN, that at the end of the 90th minute in this game, when the Dutch stood at an extraordinary equalizer against Argentina, that he collapsed. And as extra time and penalties subsequently took place, in throwing the 80,000 fans in the stadium, most people were unaware of the drama that was happening up in the broadcast section, where medical professionals spent 20 to 25 minutes trying to revive Grant Wahl. We do understand that he was taken to hospital, but obviously, we now know that he did not survive. And it really has just knocked, you know, the stuffing out of the football, broadcast and reporting community, which is pretty intimate. A lot of people, you know, we're all rivals working for different publications and different broadcasters, but a lot of us are mates. And a lot of us knew Grant Wahl really, really well. I spoke with him just two weeks ago, he joined me on the set here in Doha. And we were talking about the upcoming game between the United States and England, which was such a key game for the development of the sport in the United States. And this is what he had to tell me.

My sympathies to you and for those who may not be familiar with Grant Wahl's career. Tell us more about the impact he had on the sports world. CHRIS WITTYNGHAM, SOCCER PODCASTER &amp; COMMENTATOR: Yes, I think if you go back to his time at Sports Illustrated, he was someone who came up through the pipeline of traditional journalism at the time. And at the time, there was no room at a magazine like Sports Illustrated for just a soccer writer. So he also covered college basketball, did other stories, was renowned for having done the first big story on LeBron James while he was still in high school at St. Vincent St. Mary's, and sort of announced LeBron James to the world back in a time when magazine covers carried that sort of significance. And, as your previous guest said, brought the American version of football, the world's football to the world. And as much as it was referenced as cheerleading, it was also not foregoing your journalistic principles for the sake of trying to grow a sport. It was also, you know, holding stakeholders, to account powerbrokers to account. He once ran for the FIFA presidency, because it was so corrupt at the time, particularly after the World Cup hosting rights were awarded to Russia and Qatar. So this is a journalistic Titan.

You stay in the same bed every night, which is not the case when you're traveling the whole of Russia, or the whole of Brazil, or the whole of South Africa, as in previous World Cups.

I think this is a move and I agree she's not going to beat the United States senator come January 2005.I was looking at some poll numbers from civics, which is a kind of Blue-Ribbon outfit, they really are. A favor built among Democrats is five favorable, 82 unfavorable, among Republicans 25, favorable, 45, unfavorable, among Independents 25-56. You don't need 42 years of political experience to say these are not winning numbers. The other thing is, it's just a false characterization to say that this changes a whole lot. The only change that is discernible is that if a Democratic senator in a state with a Republican governor dies, then that would be to the Democrats disadvantage. And I furthermore give Senator Sinema some credit, she did this after the Georgia election. So I think this is totally no answers, she's not going to be reelected. She probably knows that. She doesn't want to watch, you know, corny polls showing her, you know, 72 points behind in a Democratic primary. And it doesn't really change a lot and it's probably a move in her interest.
