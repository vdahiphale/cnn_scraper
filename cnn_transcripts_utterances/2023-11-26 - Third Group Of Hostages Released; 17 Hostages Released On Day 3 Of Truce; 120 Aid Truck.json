We're staying on top of breaking news. Following an agonizing 50 days held by Hamas, today jubilation in the streets of Israel as another 17 hostages are now returned and safe. It's the third exchange of hostages as part of a four-day truce in hostilities between Hamas and Israel. And right now the 13 Israelis released as part of today's deal are being treated at hospitals. Among them, a 4-year-old American, Abigail Edan, the first American released since the start of the truce. She was also the youngest American captured by Hamas on October 7th. An additional four foreign nationals including separate from the deal arrived in Egypt a short time ago. That group includes three Thai nationals and a Russian-Israeli dual citizen. Let's send it over to Wolf, Wolf.",

We know there are nine children amongst the Israelis that have released in this latest, the third group of people to be released from Gaza under this hostage deal.The majority of them, if not all of them, and it's not exactly clear, are expected to come here -- I'm talking about the children now -- here to the Schneider medical facility which is on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, in a suburb called Petah Tikva. And you can see right behind me is that hospital. And there's also a helicopter landing pad which is just a few meters from where I'm standing now, the green lights on the ground there. Behind it, you might be able to make the ambulances. They're sort of preparing to receive those former hostages when they come here. We don't know exactly when they're going to arrive, but amongst them we're told by the Hostage Family Forum, which is the support agency that's been set up to help these hostages' families. Saying that Abigail Edan, the joint U.S.-Israeli citizen, 4 years old, she had a birthday on Friday inside Gaza as a hostage, is one of the people expected to be brought here by helicopter in the next few minutes also, perhaps 20 or 30 minutes away. We don't exactly know. The world that she comes back to though, Wolf, is going to be dramatically transformed from the one that she was snatched from back on October 7th.",

But instead entering central Israel via -- near Kibbutz Be'eri which is, of course, one of the sites of the terrible massacres on October 7th which is right behind me effectively.And the main reason why is because one of those hostages, 84-year-old Alma Abraham, we're told, was in serious medical condition and required immediate evacuation. We're now told actually, Wolf, that she was medically evacuated by helicopter directly from the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military and onward to a hospital in Israel. The rest of those 12 Israeli hostages then entered directly via the route near Kibbutz Be'eri and boarded a convoy of vehicles there which we saw coming right down this road, Wolf, on their way to the Hatzerim Air Force Base nearby. From there they're being taken by helicopter to hospitals like the one where Matthew was just reporting from. But what we also know, Wolf, is that these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal. And that is why they have -- there's a whole range of preparations that have been made for them. Medical, psychological, social services all made being available for them at these various hospitals. But of course, as Matthew was just saying, many of them are also returning to a different reality where most of their family members -- most of them have either had a family member killed or still captive in the Gaza Strip. And that's also an important point to remember. As some of these Israeli hostages are freed, many of their family members are so elated to see them home, and yet they still -- some of them in some cases still have families hostage in Gaza.",

The majority of them, once again, were held under administrative detention, no charges laid against them, no ongoing legal process. And of course, as we have seen over the last three days, this has been for many Palestinians, particularly in the Occupied West Bank but also of course, in Jerusalem a huge moment of hope for those detainees and prisoners, but also for their family members and loved ones. Now of course, we have seen over the last few days a bit of uncertainty as well around the release of these detainees and prisoners, that list of who is set to be released on each day is -- it is uncertain on what time the list is released.",

And this is where they've set up a big screen to watch the unfoldings on Israeli TV. Watch the pictures as their loved ones, their friends, their families came out of Gaza for the first time in some seven weeks.We had a chance to speak with one of the women here whose husband was murdered in the terror attack on October 7th. And she said the last seven weeks have been seven weeks of hell. To finally see some of those she knows coming out of Gaza, that is the first bit of light she said she's seen in her life over the course of the past seven weeks. So an incredibly emotional moment here as each new picture came up, each new little clip of video of the newly-freed hostages making their way out of Gaza and into Israel. There was more applause, there was more cheering, more hugs and for the first time in so long for many of these families, there was more happiness. In the Israeli military presser tonight, the spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari pointed out that for all of the hostages released tonight, they have a family member either killed or still hostage in Gaza. And that gives you a sense of the pain that this community here has been through and how important this day was and whey they all came together to watching what was unfolding here. They all know this is just part of the process, they say there are still members of the Kfar Aza community who are held hostage in Gaza.

Now, the president said she had endured terrible trauma and what she had gone through was, quote, \"unthinkable\". The president though did not yet have details on her condition. But of course, White House officials have been working furiously behind the scenes and around the clock to try to secure the release of hostages and especially American hostages. The president expressed some confidence that there would be additional releases including Americans, in particular two American women who they're trying to seek the release of. The president also hopeful that this pause in fighting could be extended. U.S. Officials have said that Israel has agreed that, if Hamas were to release ten hostages, that they would add a day in the pause in fighting.

And that's because both Hamas and the government of Israel are under great pressure. Hamas clearly wants to buy time, and trade hostages for the possibility of constraining or even delaying the ground campaign, and the Netanyahu campaign understandably is under tremendous pressure from hostages families to redeem those people from the battlefield. In this case, from being cruelly abducted by Hamas, on October 7th. So, this is a process that seems pregnant with real possibility.

As an open democracy, we put everything and discuss everything, and Israelis are known for being very frank and honest on all the issues that have affected their lives, so it's true, there many people told us, we lost faith in our country, we lost faith in our military, but I think we're also seeing, following the immediate trauma and the horrors of October 7th, is also a nation rising up as a lion, a nation which was attack in the worst terrorist attack since World War II. Rising up as a line, just like what United States did following 9/11, people fall clinging together to each other, supporting our military forces, who are risking their lives in order to take this evil out of our face, and enabling a better future.And you see how the nation and the internal fabric of society is seeing an incredible lights. I'm very proud of my nation, I'm very proud of my Israeli sisters and brothers, all showing amends resilience and strengthen love, and affection, and dreaming about a better future for us, all including our neighbors.",

I've spoke at the joint session of Congress, on the 13th of July. It was an amazing, amazing, amazing personal experience, and a national experience.You could see both sides of the aisle getting up, time and again, and applauding Israel on its 75th anniversary, and the vision, the great vision. And I spoke about peace with our neighbors, and I said that what undermines the ability to move to peace is terror. Terror cannot be accepted, cannot by any norms. You can argue with Israel, you can criticize, we are democracy we have our own debates, believe me, but you cannot in any way directly or indirectly agree that there is any legitimacy to terror. There is none. That's the issue. That it's a moral issue, it requires moral clarity, which, of course, President Biden has shown, in his statements, in his visit to Israel, and of course, wielding a grand coalition to fight -- to fight evil now.

Why would any Israeli immediately rushed to a solution when he or she thinks that that state, one day they can be taken over by Hamas?We have to be lucid. We have to show each other, especially we must, we Israelis, we demand to know how our safety and well-being will be preserved. It's a legitimate demand that we've always presented. We thought that when we moved to a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza, for years, time and again, rotating, another eruption, but in the last 2- 1/2 years, there was quiet, relative quiet. We had some explosions, but relative quiet. We enabled tens of thousands of Palestinians to go in and work from Gaza, in Israel. And what many of them did? They gathered information, supplied it to Hamas, which help them all break into our border, torture, chop, rape, endlessly, rape, attack, chop, and burn our citizens. And then abduct some of them as well, to Gaza. This is the issue. And one has to understand this issue. You can't just say two-state solution without supplying the entire basis for peace, and security for Israelis, and Palestinians.",
