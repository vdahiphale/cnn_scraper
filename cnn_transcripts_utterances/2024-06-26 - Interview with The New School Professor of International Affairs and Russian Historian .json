I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. After 15 months in a Russian prison on trumped up charges of espionage, the American journalist Evan Gershkovich is finally facing trial. His family, his paper, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and the U.S. government all express outrage, calling the charges false and cynical. The 32-year-old reporter faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted. Gershkovich has appeared in a court in a remote part of Russia where proceedings got underway behind closed doors. Apart from a brief photo op today, Gershkovich is unlikely to be seen again until the process ends. Matthew Chance has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is the first glimpse of Evan Gershkovich for months. Cameras briefly allowed into the courthouse about a thousand miles from Moscow, where his trial for espionage is finally underway. His head shaved, the 32-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter looked calm, but he faces a sentence of up to 20 years if or likely when he's found guilty. In a statement, the editor-in-chief of \"The Journal\" wrote, this bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man.",

No questions.CHANCE (voice-over):  For nearly 15 months, Gershkovich has been held under tight security in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison. He, his employer, and the U.S. government all vigorously deny the spying allegations against him. But Russia appears determined to press ahead despite official U.S. objections. A new statement from the U.S. embassy in Moscow says Evan did not commit any illegal acts and should not have been arrested at all. This trial isn't about the presentation of evidence, due process, or the rule of law, we're talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals, the statement adds. With the conflict raging in Ukraine, Russia began a crackdown at home on free speech, silencing dissidents or forcing them into exile. It's against this backdrop that Gershkovich was arrested on a reporting assignment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. This is video from the website of the tank factory there, where Russian prosecutors allege Gershkovich acted \"on the instructions of the CIA to collect secret information.\" Although, no evidence has been made public. The trial will take place in the city, which is about a thousand miles from Moscow amid an outcry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I don't want to predict, but I would imagine that Evan Gershkovich may get 20 or even more, just because he needs to be very valuable person to potentially get exchanged. And so, he would be as much prosecuted as possible. But I think, at this point, we cannot really talk about uniqueness anymore. I think they are, as Matthew Chance pointed out, I think correctly, the Russian State is taking prisoners of all kinds and Americans, particularly just because the Russians or Putin feels that if America is all out hybrid war with Russia, helping Ukraine, arming Ukraine, maligning Russia all over the world, damaging Putin's reputation at all times, talk to him and as he always says, inappropriate terms. So, all bets are off. So, the Russians can do whatever they can do. But let's remember that Putin also, a descendant of the KGB former operatives, he himself as a former KGB operative. So, he does act in this kind of tough nosed national security way, national security agenda when they collect as many prisoners and they don't really -- they're not apologetic for that in any way possible.",

I do not rule out that the person you refer to, Mr. Gershkovich, may return to his motherland. By the end of the day, it does not make any sense to keep him in prison in Russia.

So, he was one of those Islamic fundamentalists that, of course, were supposed to -- were bringing harm to the Russian land. So, Putin was quite explicit about that Krasikov is a hero. And if America wants Gershkovich back, they really need to discuss it with Germany and they know -- we know they did. In fact, when Alexei Navalny, whom you and I spoke a lot about his death and his life, when there was information that Alexei Navalny perhaps could be exchanged, Krasikov was also mentioned. And when Navalny died in February, then apparently, the conversation sort of stopped. But I think Krasikov will come out. And one last thing, Sergei Ryabkov, one of the ministry of foreign affairs officials, in fact, yesterday or today said very pointedly that the conversation about exchange is going on.

Journalist's prize objectivity, right? We look for facts, we look for maps, we look for data, look for history. We want to know what happened. But that takes us only so far. We need empathy. We need to be able to hear the other person. And in particular, when it comes to covering religion. I can give a very quick example. The -- if you walk into a Catholic church and people are taking communion and you say, they're having bread and wine, objectively, you've told the truth. That's what they're having. However, if you are empathetic and you try to see it from their point of view, they're taking the body and blood of Christ. So, the idea that objectivity takes us only so far is my core principle in teaching this course. We all come to teach and we all come to -- into life with our own perspectives. I've been teaching this course. I'm an American Jew. I have strong ties to Israel. I have many family members in Israel. I love Israel. I support Israel. And I've been teaching this course from pretty much from my perspective. And then, six years ago, I had a guest in the class, Greg Khalil, who my -- a friend had told me it was a good -- would be a good guest to talk about Christianity in the Holy Land.

But I think, you know,the reason why I'm doing this course, we do have a strong friendship that lasts six years, is because I think what's missing in the public square is an ability to talk about really difficult issues, in particular Israel- Palestine. As somebody who's Palestinian, and I was born and raised here, but I lived there, I have a huge family there. Some of them are experiencing absolutely atrocious realities right now. Palestinian perspective is never heard. It's rarely heard. I think, you know, on your last segment about the hostage rescue, of course you have to be happy for hostages who are rescued, but 270 Palestinian civilians killed. There's a different value of life here. Because imagine if those hostages were held in Tel Aviv or in New York, there's this reality that for Palestinians, it's like, well, you're human shields. That means you're legitimate human targets, and that's not fair. That's not right. So, my objective is not simply to platform Palestinian perspectives, rather, it's something larger than that. I don't think my story is the only story. Ari's story isn't the only story. If we want to deal with complex issues in the world, we have to be able to understand the multiplicity of deep truths that exist at the same time and be held accountable to the actual facts.

So, Ari and I have actually grown quite a bit together over the years and being in places that have made us and our students quite uncomfortable. So, after October 7th, we already had -- he knows where I stand on a variety of issues. We're radically transparent with each other. We're not mean when we disagree, but it's important for us to speak proactively what we think about particular issues.

Even someone saying, from the river to the sea, Palestine should be free, may sound innocuous to some people, but to other people, it is offensive and antisemitic. So, you may not think it is, but try to understand the other perspective. And that's really what we've tried to do. And it started as a reporting tool. In other words, this is a great way to report, but we soon realized that it was a human relations tool.

There is no good future for any Israeli or Palestinian without a good reality for every Palestinian and Israeli, and we are moving over the brink on the ground there. And as long as this continues to escalate out of control, this could go -- this could have large regional implications. Things won't be calm on our campus right now. So, I think the story with the protesters and the students, I think the administration will look very bad in hindsight.

And interestingly, in Ireland, so much of this conflict, like in the United States, has been local culture and politics. So, we didn't leave Israel and Palestine far behind. I do just want to push back a little bit, Christiane, if I might, on sort of what Ari said. You know, there was an environment on the campus that was really quite toxic for some time, and I don't -- I think the administration did a poor job at fighting antisemitism, but also, they weaponized it. And there was a lot of anti-Palestinian speech and bigotry. But there were some important stories that were missed out there. I remember one day, the third night of Passover, I was at Pulitzer Hall where we teach. The encampment was right next door. I heard the faint call of Muslim -- a call to prayer from the encampment. I walked over. I saw about 20 students standing in a large rectangle holding up bedsheets, protecting fellow Muslim students from the prying eyes of cameras. Just an hour and a half later, it was the start of Passover, the third night, and there was an interfaith meal hosted by a number of Jewish students, a sizable minority there. And so, something important is happening with the young people. And I can empathize with your discomfort with the charged terms of apartheid and genocide. Those are very powerful terms, but the reality on the ground in which one people is ruling over another, what I said is the opinion of human rights organizations around the world.

And as U.S. voters gear up for the election in an increasingly divided country, the merging of faith and political identity often contributes to further polarization.

New York Times columnist David French was recently dismissed from an engagement for the Presbyterian Church in America after facing backlash for his criticism of Donald Trump. He joins Michel Martin now to discuss his latest article, \"The Day My Old Church Cancelled Me Was a Very Sad Day.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I came of age really politically in the Reagan era, and I came of age sortof as that Reagan, Republican, Cold War conservative. More libertarian leaning in my outlook. Very much interested in America's global role. Very immigrant friendly, for example. You know, the, Reagan was famous, and a lot of people forget this about his legacy, that he was famous for welcoming immigrants and showing that the attraction and appeal that America had to people abroad was a symbol of, for example, our superiority to the Soviet system. So, I really came up as a Reagan Republican. That would be my story. And I'm also evangelical. I was raised in the evangelical church. So, I was an evangelical Reagan Republican, and fit very well culturally, both within the Republican Party and within the evangelical church. Basically, my whole adult life, until June of 2015, when Donald Trump came down the escalator, who signaled a break from all kinds of Republican traditions that I had appreciated and respected, not merely a break with Republican -- with Reagan ideology, but also a break with Reagan's character in any -- really, any emphasis on personal character at all.",

      "sentences": "You know, I will just speak personally, I'll say I underestimated two things, when I was thinking through the state of Republican politics in2015 and evangelical politics specifically in 2015 and 2016. Number one, I underestimated the antipathy that existed toward Democrats. I underestimated how much there was this raw hatred and/or fear of Democrats on the part of so many Christian Republicans. I -- even though I was a Republican active -- I was a Republican delegate to the 2012 convention, a Mitt Romney delegate. I was a long-time religious liberty lawyer and prolife lawyer, but I always had close friends who were Democrats. I never saw politics as that deal breaker on matters of faith and friendship, but I underestimated how much many of my co-religionists had real raw antipathy for Democrats, and I also underestimated how fundamentalist so many of them had become. And by fundamentalist, I mean, where there's this zone of absolute religious certainty, they had extended into politics so that if you were not going to support the Republican standard bearer, that was not seen as a political mistake, that was not seen even as an honest mistake, it was seen as a sign of apostasy, as departing from the Christian faith itself. And that blindsided me. That took me totally by surprise. So, it was the combination of antipathy and rising fundamentalism that ties the politics of conservative Christianity to the faith itself so closely that I didn't see that coming. And that's what blindsided me. And both of those trends have only gotten worse in the ensuing, you know, eight, nine years since Trump came down the escalator.",

And then, they turned around, the administrate -- the denomination turns around and says, well, for peace and for unity, we have to yield to those people and exclude me. And so, the price of peace, what peace was, was actually capitulation to the loudest and angriest voices. Not to the majority of the denomination, certainly not to the majority of the denomination, but to the people who are the angriest faction. And that's not peace, that's capitulation, that's exclusion. And this is one of the reasons why so very many people right now don't even feel welcome in many of the churches that they grew up in.",

Most people, politics is very downstream from the daily rhythm of their lives. But for the small minority for whom politics really is an extension of their faith, they have really adopted Trump with an extraordinary zeal. And what they've been very, very effective at is telling -- is using personal insults to warn the majority away from dissenters. So, rather than dealing with my arguments, they'll call me a heretic. They'll say that I'm a wolf. They'll say that I'm demonic. And so, then when somebody says something, I read this from David French, they'll say, well, he's a heretic. And the immediate recoil is, oh, I don't want to read something from a heretic. Or he's a wolf in sheep's clothing or he's demonic. And so, the passivity of the majority is really enabling that minority, because they don't do any additional work to determine whether or not the accusation is true. And that's one of the things most dispiriting, again, about this cancellation from the PCA. There was a hurricane of misleading and cruel commentary about me into the public square. And the good people -- and the \"good people\" did nothing to determine the veracity of it all, or wouldn't even really evaluate the morality of the way in which people attacked us. They just wanted the pain to stop. They wanted the controversy to stop. And so, that meant capitulation.

So, they -- you know, there is a moment in my church that's very indicative when a woman -- an older woman in the church came up to me and -- with sincerity and kindness said, David, I don't understand why you oppose our president. Can you tell me? And this is during Trump's term. And, you know, I didn't have time to give the whole brief against Trump. And I just tried to very nicely say, I just wish he lied less. And that was just my first answer. And she looks at me and with 100 percent sincerity says, you mean Donald Trump lies? It's very difficult to sort of understand if you're outside of MAGA country, how much the vision of Donald Trump as a human being that has been created within that MAGA bubble is so contrary to fact.

I don't think people who are of evangelicalism understandthat if Trump wins in 2024, the zeal of evangelical support for him will be even greater than anything that we've seen, because it would have been seen as a -- as divine intervention, as a miracle that this man subject to all of these indictments and now a conviction and a sexual abuse finding and all of fraud findings and all of this, that it will be interpreted as the world came against him, but God protected him and made him prevail. That will be a narrative that will lock into a big chunk of the church in a way that will lead to zeal that I think is on a scale that's even greater than we've seen, and will also create, I think, a model going forward. This is how you win elections, is with Trump like figures. If Trump loses, I'm not so sure that we would have a fever break moment, so much as a fever fade moment. You know, people forget that a lot of Republicans still really liked Richard Nixon when he was forced out in 1974. They did. And then, what ended up happening was there was sort of this fade, not so much a fever break, but often a fade. And so, I think you would see more of a fade. But that MAGA populist reactionary element isn't going anywhere. It's perpetuated not just by Donald Trump, but by people with giant social media platforms. And their 5 million, 6 million followers are not just going to disappear into the ether if Trump loses. This is a movement that I think is going to be relevant and dangerous in many ways in American politics for a long time to come. But nothing compared to the danger of if Trump wins again 2024.",
