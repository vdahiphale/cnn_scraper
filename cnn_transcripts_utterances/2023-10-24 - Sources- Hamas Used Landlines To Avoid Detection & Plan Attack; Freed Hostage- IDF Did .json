It is almost midnight here and it has been 17 days since the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas caught this country and frankly much of the world by surprise, setting up a cascade of responses and consequences that now includes a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Part of that humanitarian crisis, the lack of basic necessities, food, water, fuel. Moments ago a spokesman for Israel's military says no fuel will be allowed to enter the Gaza Strip because of concerns it will be stolen by Hamas which controls the Gaza Strip, and that lack of fuel is already having serious consequences. The World Health Organization says six hospitals have shut down due to a lack of power.The Israeli military spokesman was responding to a question about whether Israel would consider allowing fuel deliveries in exchange for hostages. Out of approximately 222 people kidnapped by Hamas that day, only four had been released. And tonight one of those four is accusing the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli intelligence service of failing, failing at their jobs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, RELEASED HOSTAGE (through translator): The lack of awareness by IDF in Shin Bet did great damage to us. We were the scapegoat. They warned us three weeks beforehand, hordes of people came into the road and burned our fields. They sent fire balloons and the IDF did not treat it seriously. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She says her captors, the terrorists of Hamas, threw her onto a motorbike, they beat her with sticks, they stole her jewelry. And this is just one person's story, at least 218 others including Lifshitz's husband are still being held hostage right now. Intensive talks are underway to secure the release of a large number of them. The desire to get them out, a major reason the U.S. continues to press Israel to further delay any ground operation into Gaza. This as CNN is learning exactly how Hamas was able to pull off its deadly surprise attack without tipping its hand. Let's start with CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance. A warning to our viewers, his report will contain some graphic images.Matthew, sources tell CNN intense talks are underway right now to free a large number of hostages. What is Hamas asking in return?",

But our understanding is from U.S. and Israeli sources as well, is that the main demand of Hamas is they want fuel. They want fuel in exchange for lives. Fuel to, in the words of Israeli officials, to potentially fuel rockets that could be fired at Israel, fuel also to power the underground network of tunnels that Hamas has for lighting, of course, but also for oxygen supplies there as well. Officially, the Palestinian health ministry says it wants it to kind of fuel the hospitals, as well as lots of people in dire need of medical care, of course, in the Gaza Strip. Although the IDF, the Israeli military, is especially said that's not real, they already have supplies of fuel to do that.Anyway, if that barrier cannot be broken, it's unlikely at this stage, it seems, there's going to be more of the hostage releases that we have seen. And already, as you said, we've seen over the past few days several hostages be released by Hamas into Israel. One of them earlier today, very old lady 85 years old, gave her stunning account of how she was captured and what she went through. And just a quick warning, you know, is Hamas video at the start of this piece. And so it's not clear what propaganda purpose they may have been thinking of when they allowed this to be filmed.

      "sentences": "All right, Matthew Chance, thank you so much. Appreciate it.One big question since October 7 is how, how did Hamas carry out such a successful, sophisticated if you can call it that, terrorist attack while keeping it all so secret? And today we're learning that old school technology may have played a major role. CNN's Chief Investigative Correspondent Pamela Brown joins us now from the U.S. Pamela, what does the intelligence show? PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANCHOR: Well, Jake, sources are telling me and my colleague Zach Cohen that a small group of Hamas operatives used hardwired phones in the tunnels beneath Gaza to communicate over a period of two years. That's according to intelligence shared with U.S. officials. Now those old fashioned landlines allowed Hamas leaders to communicate underground with one another and secret. They avoided using computers or cell phones in order to keep from being trapped by Israeli or U.S. intelligence, according to these sources, and frankly, it worked, Jake. Instead, they held meetings in person among a small group and they stayed off all digital communications. So this partially explains why Israel and the U.S. were caught so off guard by the attack. And how 1000 Hamas binders were able to pour across the border without being stopped showed here in this propaganda video released by Hamas. All of this communication happened in the miles of underground, a tunnel system beneath Gaza that the IDF nicknamed the Gaza Metro. You heard the hostage there in the story you just play, Jake, talking about the spider web of tunnels. That's where apparently these phone lines were hardwired underground. Another way Hamas was able to keep this under the radar is that they kept the planning of the October 7 attack a secret even from other members. Only a very small group knew about this mission until just before it was carried out. Hamas ground unit commanders and fighters were in training for many months, and they were kept in a state of general preparedness, I'm told, but only found out about the specific plans just a few days before the terrorist attack. And one of the sources said some of the training above ground was observed by Israeli officials, but did not ring major alarm bells. The thinking was, I'm told, was, oh, Hamas always trains people like this, it didn't look different. But of course we know now, Jake, it was.",

Israeli military found a similar kind of communication system when they raided a city in the northern West Bank over the summer, according to an Israeli official. They call this a joint operational command center and it had hardwired communication lines and closed circuit surveillance cameras to give advance warning of Israeli troop movements. So clearly, this is something that has been in their playbook, Hamas has had in their playbook and they used it to execute this operation, as you pointed out successfully, Jake.",

But when this is over, there will have to be an investigation, thorough investigation, lessons learned. Why was their intelligence failure? Why was it so easy for them to cross over the fence which was supposed to protect us with all the high tech and so forth? And why did it take the IDF so long to force them back to the other side and kill the people who'd come over to our side? There are all sorts of issues that need to be investigated. In the past when we've had security mishaps like this, and this is more than a mishap, this is a major problem, we've had investigations, we've had committees of inquiry, we've had parliamentary inquiries.

      "sentences": "Jake, it is significant. We've known that and we've reported that Meadows did go before the grand jury, we knew that he had spoken to the grand jury, as matter of fact, this has been a big source of conjecture within Donald Trump's circle, legal circles, certainly was the question of, of what level of cooperation was Mark Meadows having with the special counsel? Now we know from ABC's reporting that this was done under an immunity deal, and that he had spoken to the special counsel, including before the grand jury multiple times. And the key here is that according to this story from ABC, the former chief of staff to the former president told investigators that the former president was being dishonest when he claimed that that he had won the election immediately after the November election, November 2020 Election.They also -- he also goes on to say that he had repeatedly warned the former president that there was no evidence to sustain his claims that there was this widespread fraud that could have made a difference in those election results in 2020. That's a big, big piece of information for someone so close to Donald Trump to provide to those investigators, to provide to Jack Smith. Now, what this means, Jake, is that this is somebody who is going to be certainly one of the top witnesses for Jack Smith and the prosecution when this case goes to trial early next year, and that's what we're looking at. We're looking at a trial that could start in March of next year. And obviously the fact that Mark Meadows was not only one of the closest aides to the former president, he was also deeply involved in trying to find any evidence there was of fraud. He kept pressuring the Justice Department. He went down to Georgia to try to pressure state officials there to find evidence of this fraud. All of course -- all of which of course, Jake, we know was not there. [17:30:09] So the idea that, Jake, that Mark Meadows is now in the camp of the prosecution, the only thing we've heard from his lawyers in the last, certainly the last few months that we've reached out on this issue is that Mark Meadows is going to tell the truth whenever he is asked to do that. So that the idea that he is now firmly helping the prosecution is going to be a big, big deal for this case going forward. Jake?",

He was on the phone call to Georgia. He is aware of everything that's going on. And let's not forget, on January 6th, he sat there in the White House, according to Cassidy Hutchinson scrolling through his phone, while Donald Trump would not come out for, you know, 187 minutes and tell the writers to stop and go home.He is the inner circle of everything that was happening, and he has been given immunity. And when you get immunity, you can't take the fifth, you have to testify to what you know. I think there's something else that's worth mentioning here. Mark Meadows during that whole period of time that he now says he was telling Trump that there -- this was baseless. He was saying something else publicly all of this time. He wrote in his book that the election was still stolen and rigged. So what's been going on behind closed doors with prosecutors is completely different from what the public posture was. One question I'll have is, in addition to his testifying, honestly, about what happened, what does he get immunity from? What was his exposure in all of this, Jake?",

He was in the meetings. Just to be clear, Jake, we should go back and remind our viewers that we actually did report back in June, that Mark Meadows had gone in to testify to the grand jury.But this ABC reporting is taking it further, because of two things. We now know that Mark Meadows spoke to prosecutors, in addition to that time with the grand jury at least two other times. And the big news here is he's been granted immunity. So the question is, you know, what kind of deal was made? What was his exposure? And then we just have to go back and remember that he may now be saying that he told Trump this was baseless. But what did Mark Meadows do? Or more aptly, what didn't Mark Meadows do? He did not ever publicly come out and say that the election was in fact, you know, fair and free. He stuck with Trump's lie on it. He sat there in January -- on January 6th, as Cassidy Hutchinson described, sitting on his couch, scrolling through his phone, never going in to, as far as we know, to tell Trump, you have to go out there and stop this. And in the book he published after he left office, he continued to say the election was stolen and raked. We don't know yet exactly what the details are of everything that he's told the prosecutors, but this is the closest you could get to Donald Trump, what he knew, when he knew it, and the fact that he was perpetuating a lie that first led to the violence on January 6th. And as Liz Cheney, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney has said, she feels it remains a clear and present danger for more violence, Mark Meadows has stood by publicly silently.",
