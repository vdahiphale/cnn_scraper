But we're going against a really tough set of information parameters. Internet control, protesters arrested, a lot of fear and people are falling out of windows. So this is a tough challenge. But the war crimes tribunal and going after the information space inside Russia, that's the best way we can win right now while we give Ukraine more military means to advance its offensive in the coming weeks.",

Putin would like to have military support.But Xi's in a difficult position. He doesn't want to bring about sanctions on his own country. And he doesn't want a triumphant Putin, because he could then threaten China. In the long term, Putin knows China is the biggest threat to Russia. And Xi knows that in the long term interests of all sides, Russia took Asian territory from China and eventually China will want that back. So there are strains in this relationship and limitations. Certainly neither China nor India, who are potentially friends of Russia, want to see this conflict escalate. They want it over and this is what Putin is struggling with.",

Now you can see some of the migrants were able to get access to tents. So that helped some of them. As you can see, a lot of them are still sleeping out on the streets, covered only with blankets. Now the City of El Paso has been doing cleanups every single day, two to three times a day, to try to help with the sanitation issue. But of course, outside on the street, there is no running water. The city did bring port-o-potties on the other side of the street. That has helped. They've added washing stations as well. They can have water to wash their hands, brush their teeth. Here's the other thing, Jessica. The city says they're also worried about RSV, COVID, the flu. And on top of all of that, there are ticks in this area so they're very concerned about that as well.",

And that test can be a PCR, an antigen test.

There are no restrictions for outdoor events here in New York City anymore. So this is going to be a full-blown, full-scale party once again like in many years prior. Thousands of people will be standing right here where I am now, shoulder to shoulder. Even now -- Times Square is already a crowded place. You can see that people are walking around trying to get a sense. Tomorrow around this time, people will likely be lining up, filling up this area here. All through the back, the blocks behind us and in front of us, the ball will come down at midnight, ringing the new year. As I said, one of the biggest parties of the year will be right here. Security, you mentioned, will be tight. It is always a big operation for the New York Police Department as well as other law enforcement agencies here in the city. We will be hearing from Mayor Eric Adams later this evening. But if you are going to come out, don't bring a large backpack. Don't bring an umbrella. Don't bring chairs. You want to come with the bare minimum. Dress warmly. You will have to stand out here for hours. And it will be a safe and a fun event. And it is all about that energy and that crowd -- Jess.",
