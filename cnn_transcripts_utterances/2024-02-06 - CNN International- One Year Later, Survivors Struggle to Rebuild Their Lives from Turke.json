If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with some of today's top stories.Britain's King Charles III is postponing his public duties as he undergoes treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. The palace says he will continue with state business and official paperwork, though. The Nevada Republican primary is happening today, just two days before the state caucuses. Nikki Haley will be on the primary ballot, but Donald Trump will not. But Trump is running in the caucus on Thursday and is widely expected to win the state's 26 delegates. And the Philadelphia Eagles will play the NFL's first game in Brazil. The Eagles will kick off their regular season on September 6th in Sao Paulo. Their opponent hasn't been announced. Tuesday marks one year since a series of devastating earthquakes leveled entire cities and villages in both Turkey and Syria, killing more than 55,000 people. Hundreds marked the grim anniversary in Hatay, Turkey on Monday. A choir of singers bringing people to tears. Many who lost homes and loved ones in this tragedy are still struggling to pick up the pieces. As CNN's Scott McLean reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On February 6th last year, people around the world said prayers for Turkey. Five and a half days later, they witnessed this miracle. Sezai Karabas and his then six-year-old daughter, Sengul, somehow pulled out of the rubble without a scratch. My house was here, he shows us. Even we didn't know how we survived. It was cold, we had no food or water, but God gave us strength. But Karabas is not as lucky as he seems. His wife and four-year-old son were killed. On one hand, he says, you feel happiness. On the other, you feel sadness. I didn't know if they made it out, but deep down, I knew they probably hadn't. One year on, signs of destruction are impossible to miss. Some streets still look like the earthquake happened yesterday. In most others, the destruction has been replaced by blocks of lifeless, empty lots. The rubble has mostly been cleared away, but mass reconstruction still seems a long way off. Only a small fraction of the 650,000 homes the government promised to build have been finished.",

Sometimes at night, I dream he shows up at my door. Khaled Kassar is one of the more than 3 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey. His house collapsed in the earthquake. It's now this empty lot. He had to move to a new city to find this tiny apartment. But there, his kids can't attend school because of a law that requires refugees to remain in the province they are officially registered in. Countless other kids are in the same boat.",

The last school year was wasted, this year was wasted, and I don't know what will happen with them. I don't know. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (on camera): So, Bianca, this is the historic, really ancient city center of Antakya. And you can see that many of the buildings here are just hanging on by a thread here. They are in desperate need of repair or replacement. And this was an area where we are now that before had cafes, bars, restaurants, and it was also teeming with tourists. Even outside of the historic city center, though, many newer buildings, though, also collapsed on February 6th of last year. And that's why more than 250 builders have been convicted for violations of building codes. You have also seen plenty of outrage toward the local government for failing to enforce those building codes, which have now been on the books for well over 20 years. So, the reality here, Bianca, is that the shaking last year may have only lasted for seconds, but the impact of this is going to last well beyond today. It will probably be felt for generations.",

Scott McLean in Antakya, Turkey, thank you very much.In Germany, thousands protested against right-wing extremism in Frankfurt on Monday. The rally comes after weeks of nationwide demonstrations against the far-right Alternative for Germany party. The protests were prompted by a report that two senior party members had attended a meeting to discuss plans for the mass deportation of migrants and citizens of foreign origin. The AFD has denied that the proposal represents party policy. In New Zealand, hundreds of protesters marched to the place where the country's founding document was signed back in 1840, and that is the town of Waitangi. Annual celebrations coincided with the rally against a proposed government policy that could dial back indigenous rights, as well as calls to review the Treaty of Waitangi. Demonstrators say it should remain as it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I suppose we've seen this play out a number of times in this war since October the 7th in the sense that Israel issues these evacuation orders.Now, the message doesn't always get through because of communications issues. Could be internet blackouts or whatnot. And even when it does get through, there may be the sense that, look, since nowhere in Gaza is safe anyway, why displace ourselves once more and go on the move somewhere else? And right now, you've got the added issue of the weather. It's quite cold and wet right now. And some of those people who have been, who live in areas that have received their evacuation orders may take the view that it's better to remain where they are, where they've at least got some measure of shelter, rather than go to another place where they don't.",

He says they've almost completed their operations in Khan Younis and then they will be targeting the last, in his words, remaining stronghold of Hamas in Rafah, whose population has ballooned about sixfold since October the 7th.And satellite images show like a tent city with about a million people living there. So, there are concerns that if and when Israel does reach Rafah in terms of its ground operations, that we could see additional noncombatant casualties. We already know the death toll is over 25,000. The Hamas-run health ministry gives out those figures, doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but does say that the majority of those are women and children and concern that those noncombatant casualties could go higher. As for Yahya Sinwar, the defense minister is saying that he's on the run up until now. We've been led to believe that he's hiding underground somewhere in the sprawling tunnel network of Hamas under Khan Younis. The suggestion now seems to be that maybe he's in Rafah, but certainly according to the defense minister, he says that Sinwar is now on the run, moving from hideout to hideout and doesn't have any more contact with his fighters. Israel, also saying that it's killed or injured about half of all Hamas fighters. Now, Hamas has denied both of those claims by the Israelis. All we do know right now is that the fighting is, if anything, intensifying in Khan Younis and Israel very much has its sights set on Rafah as it seeks to try to make it job done in the Gaza Strip.",
