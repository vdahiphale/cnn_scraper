At the start of July, Democrats were describing their meetings about President Biden's re- election chances as a funeral, all the while the Trump campaign was effectively measuring the curtains to move back in. But in just four weeks, with VP Kamala Harris now at the top of that ticket, that has all changed.Tomorrow, Harris enters the Democratic convention in Chicago with the wind at her back. Those funeral vibes, they're out. And apparently, concert vibes are in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. J.B. PRITZKER, (D) ILLINOIS: Frankly, it'll be like a rock concert. I think people are going to be cheering and pretty excited. And I can say I've not felt this kind of energy and electricity at any convention other than the one for Barack Obama. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the swing states, the very important swing states that will decide this election, they're also tight. You know who knows it? Vice President Kamala Harris.

And she was there along with Walz, and they were hitting several events all throughout the day. Now, this whole week in Chicago and its roster of speakers will be about defining Harris and of course, keeping the momentum and all of the enthusiasm going. Now, teeing it up are two political bookends, shall we say. You've got President Biden and Hillary Clinton tomorrow night alone. One candidate who defeated Trump and another who narrowly lost to him. I want to bring in former Spokesperson for Governor Doug Burgum's 2024 campaign, Lance Trover, former Obama Campaign Advisor, Ameshia Cross, CNN Political Commentator and Republican Pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and CNN Contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro. So glad to have all of you here. Look, there's a different vibe happening from a month ago about this convention. And, you know, with all the momentum that's happening, I wonder from you, Amisha, I mean, there's still people that she's got to convince. She's got to get the job done for voters who want to look to her but might not be convinced. What does she have to do to define herself?",

      "sentences": "No, absolutely. And I think that's why she keeps relaying to herself as the underdog, even though we've seen some of these polls shift. One of the things that she's doing that is extremely important is defining her narrative.A lot of America still doesn't know the backstory of Kamala Harris. So talking about how she worked a low-wage job, worked at McDonald's when she was in college, talking about her mom having to save for over a decade to be able to afford a home and what that meant for her family when she was a teenager in high school when they were actually able to finally get to that point. But I think it's also leaning in and talking about the issues that matter to the American public the most. It is no mistake that she came out with a very strong economic agenda going into the DNC. She did not wait until after the DNC to do it. And part of that, I think, is because what we've heard from Americans over and over and over again, exhaustively, housing crisis. Housing prices are too high. Grocery bills are too high. Having concerns about that, the child care expenses. You talked earlier about, you know, back to school. There are a lot of families who have children going back to school and are trying to decide whether or not they can afford school supplies and to keep the electricity on. And it's been a really hot summer. So I think these are things that matter. COATES: Well, first of all, thank God school has got back in session. I don't care. I'm that mom. Thank you. Have them back for a little bit for the daytime. I hear you on that point. But let me ask all of you, what is more important to the voters right now? The idea of defining herself and her backstory, as Ameshia eloquently described, or about what she stands for specifically? I mean, I wonder where is the rub and the rubber meeting the road for the voters? Is it the policy or is it do I like you?",

But when voters are saying, please don't give me a Trump-Biden rematch, the sense that somebody is different, is not a Trump-Biden rematch, that this is new, actually her ability to distance herself from Biden right now is giving her that advantage.So as she defines herself right now, there is the opportunity to either lock in these voters who have at least in the short run said, oh, thank goodness, I have somebody different I can vote for. Sure. But the Trump campaign has to be more disciplined about trying to define her in what they believe is the negative light tying her to Biden's policy, saying she'll be worse than Biden.

She's going to have the sitting president on the first night. And she's going to have to show him a lot of deference, a lot of love, but define herself and take the mantle and say, this is what I stand for and this is who I am. She's already done a lot, I think, already in the way that she's messaged. She's given a lot of sort of enthusiasm, the way she seems tough, the way she just even walks down a plane. You know, I used to watch Biden walking down the plane and it was always kind of like halting and just the visuals were so different. And she is kind of very commanding in the way that she sort of embraced all this.

They're trying to define her. What do you think the Trump campaign should be doing during this week to try to figure out how they put themselves in the limelight? LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, I think the Trump campaign is doing what they can do. I mean, but you're up against a convention. It's the same way the Democrats really couldn't do much during the Republican convention. I got the emails. They're going to be out and about all week long. Somebody's holding a press conference in Chicago tomorrow or the next day or so. Trump's going to Arizona later in the week. But I think the rubber meets the road, though, is yet I think she's going to have a really good week. I think the Democrats are, I don't know how these protests are going to shake out. That could be kind of a distraction. But I think overall she's going to have a really good week. I wouldn't be surprised if she's not even further ahead coming out of this convention. But post Labor Day, I think, is where the rubber is going to meet the road with her. And we talk about the policies. I think then voters are really going to traditionally start keying into this election. And I think that's where they're going to start looking, saying, OK, what does she stand for? What is her vision for the country? They know it up to the bait. But I think then post Labor Day, that's when folks are really going to say, what does she stand for. CROSS: I think he's right about post Labor Day, especially. And that's one of the reasons why the fundraising hauls that Kamala Harris has been able to do have been so enormous and very strong, because she's already committed the campaign has to millions of dollars in post- Labor Day ads. The overwhelming majority of those being digital ads, because that's where the people are.",

We've seen some of the conversations he's had with press, if you can call it that. I don't even know what those things were. I think that he's going to continue to do that and she's going to hit him hard. But in addition to that, he has also attacked some of the most protected, I think, citizens of our country when it comes to veterans. And many of those veterans and veterans organizations are also pushing back because she has some walls on her campaign ticket. There are ways in which she can speak to that population that will really touch them. And I think that he is a secret weapon in many ways. And he will be utilized in those ads as well. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think that's what's been so interesting, seeing all this energy from the Republicans targeting Tim Walz. And I think the reason you're seeing that is precisely because they do see him as a threat. He does represent a lot of the constituencies that the Republicans think are their constituencies, veterans, you know, people from rural backgrounds. He speaks to that.

Now, in the case of going after J.D. Vance, as you said, Lance, Trump's already very well defined. And I've been in some ways surprised to see the lack of the kind of like apocalyptic rhetoric. Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. That type of message is not actually what Harris and her team have been delivering so far. It's been more of this like he's weird type message. Instead, they've really been focusing more of the harsh stuff on J.D. Vance. But for the flip side of that, Harris is still undefined. Every minute you spend talking about Tim Walz is a minute you're not spending trying to define Kamala Harris.

I think people take very seriously that there's a lot of folks out there who are really upset, have something to say, and that depending on how it's handled, it could really have an impact on what America thinks of our ticket.That said, I think the parallels to 1968 don't really hold. Extremely different reality in terms of the issues we were facing, but also the footage you even showed there, the Chicago police at that point were out of control. Thank God today we have a police force there that's playing by the kind of rules you need to play by in a democracy. So I think we'll see a smart, restrained approach from the police. I think they have to be mindful, give the protesters some space, some opportunity to get out what they're there to say. Sometimes it's really important to like have a little bit of a safety valve, give some space, but also know when it's important to draw the line. And then finally, I think it's really clear Vice President Harris took a different tone than President Biden right out of the gate and talked about Palestinian suffering. And I'm someone who believes in the state of Israel, absolutely believes Hamas is a horrible terrorist organization, but Palestinians are suffering and Americans care about it. And it's important to talk about it and find a way to bring peace to Gaza. I think she's done a good job talking about it. She's going to have to keep talking about it.",

No one can perfectly control all that. After it was all over, I felt we had made some mistakes, and I talked about it publicly. So my concern here is she doesn't get to control everything that happens, but it will stick to her. What she controls is her message. And I think it started well, but I don't think that is going to necessarily be enough. One of the things I was really struck by was a few months back when Senator Schumer really clearly said that Benjamin Netanyahu had to go as prime minister, that he was so much of the problem in the region. I think that's something the vice president needs to think about saying as well. I think she has to talk about Palestinian suffering. She has to talk about what's wrong with the current Israeli strategy, while being very clear we will always defend Israel from its surrounding enemies, of course. But at the same time, the current policies of Benjamin Netanyahu are causing a humanitarian crisis. She will have to say more about that.

And if history is any guide, on Election Day, there's one thing we know. Donald Trump always out-polls the polls. And if I'm a Democrat, that's something that's always in the back of my mind.",

Bringing up Jeffrey Epstein in any correlation to Donald Trump at this point is just something that should be off the Richter for them just because of the many flights that were taken, the fact that this guy has already been adjudicated for sexual misconduct up to and including rape. That's something that should not be on the table.But I do think that they cannot stop, because for whatever reason, they're not wanting to have a conversation about Project 2025 because it's been historically unpopular, but in addition to that, they are more willing to try to pursue these lines of attack against personhood for Kamala Harris, whether it's race, whether it's gender, whether it's attacking women in general, who are the largest voting bloc in this country. They do not want to talk about policy. And I think that, to a point that was made earlier, they're walking into this. Immigration was probably going to be the strongest hit they possibly could have done, considering that a lot of Americans, quite frankly, are upset at the current immigration framework and the economy. But unfortunately for them, the economy tends to tick up. We just saw the inflation number go down. Yes, there are people who are frustrated about, you know, cost of the grocery stores. Those are things that I think Harris' economic agenda are very strong pointing towards relief from. But if they stayed in those lanes, they would have a better chance. But the Republicans are not interested in expanding their base. They are, you know, driving very strategically into one lane. Even though Democrats are grabbing white males, we saw evangelicals for Harris. We're seeing these groups expand on the left, whereas the right is absolutely fine with that same small pot.",

The question is, now with Harris at the top of the ticket, how much does it kind of reset back to the coalitions that were going head-to-head back in, say, 2016, when it was not a Trump-Biden race? To what extent does Donald Trump still supercharge with the kind of white working-class voters that the Harris campaign is obviously going for by trying to say, look, we're the true ones that have union support, look, we have Tim Walz. These are groups that Donald Trump really infused into the Republican Party, as well as sort of working-class voters of color that I think the Harris campaign says, no, no, no, Biden may not have been doing as well, but we can get these folks.",

It's a clip of her saying her position.And it was positions that were pretty far to the left, pretty far outside the mainstream, many of which she has since repudiated. But I think it would be smart for the Trump campaign to have the pressure put on her constantly. Do you still believe we should abolish ICE? Do you still believe we should defund the police? Do you still believe that we should stop fracking? If you don't, explain why.

She's the author of several books about the White House, including \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\" Kate, thank you for being here this evening. An exciting moment to think about what she might be saying, given her last very memorable speech there. Her favorability rating it's at 55%. That is one of the highest among politicians, and she's not even one. How is she able to resonate with voters so highly? KATE ANDERSEN BROWER, AUTHOR, \"EXPLORING THE WHITE HOUSE\": Well, I mean, when she left the White House, it was 70%. It's astounding how much people trust and like her. And there was a poll actually that \"USA Today\" did that showed that people value her opinion more than Taylor Swift, more than Beyonce. You know, they really respect her because I think partially because she doesn't want to run for president, right? She hates politics. She hates the fighting and the divisiveness. And so she doesn't really have that kind of political goal in mind. She's a mom. She's a professional. She's intelligent. She's funny. People love her.
