At this point, it's unclear who opened fire. Also today, as part of intensifying efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis, the first aid ship carrying desperately needed food has reached the enclave. Let's go now, live to Jerusalem with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy, a lot to cover here. But what can you tell us about this plan that Netanyahu's approved to not only go into Rafah, but also to begin evacuating people from that area?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, we still don't have many details. But what we do know is that the Israeli prime minister and his security cabinet have now reviewed operational plans for a military offensive, as well as the evacuation of civilians from Rafah.And the Israeli prime minister has now approved those plans, effectively putting in place a plan that he could order the military to carry out. That doesn't mean that an offensive in Rafah is imminent at this point. We know that it would take as a significant amount of time to actually carry out that evacuation and that preparations needs to be made for the area where those displaced Palestinians from Rafah would be moved to ahead of an anticipated Israeli military offensive. The Israeli military has said that displaced civilians from Rafah, where there are about one-and-a-half million in Palestinians currently living, would be moved to what they've described as humanitarian enclaves in central Gaza, where there would be food, there will be shelter, field hospitals. And all of that would be coordinated with international partners. But beyond that, they haven't provided many details about what that would look like or the feasibility of moving so many people to an area that has been decimated, in many respects, by the Israeli military's bombing campaign in Gaza. And U.S. officials who have been pressing the Israeli government to come up with a feasible plan to carry out that evacuation ahead of a potential military offensive say they have yet to actually see those plans. The secretary of state, Tony Blinken today emphasizing that it would need to be a feasible plan, that the United States would have to see it before the Israeli military moves forward with such an offensive.",

His son, who is serving a life sentence without parole, killed four people with a gun that his father had bought for him. Thursday's conviction comes a month after Crumbley's wife, Jennifer, became the first parent ever to be held directly responsible for a mass shooting committed by their child. The couple now faces up to 15 years in prison with sentencing set for next month. CNN's Jean Casarez covered these trials for us. Jean, how big of a game changer are these verdicts?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is significant because, just as you said, this is the first time in this country that parents have been charged with homicide. And this was a homicide charge, involuntary manslaughter, resulting in prison time, substantial prison time potentially.Because they exercised gross negligence in regard to the handling of a firearm in their home, knowing that their child had issues, mental instabilities. And a conviction for both the mother and the father really creates such a precedent, and prosecutors around on the contrary, can now look at this. And I think the aspect is that when you have this gross negligence -- in Michigan, they have legal duty, meaning a parent has a legal duty to make sure that your child doesn't harm another child. Not all states have that. Michigan does. But it is definitely something to take notice of all around the country. Right here in Michigan, in Oakland County, they're focusing on the sentencing because it's next month. It's April 9th, 9:00 sharp. The courthouse right behind me. it's going to be James and Jennifer Crumbley. Sentencing is at the same time. We can conceivably, I believe, see them in the courtroom together. But I think it is understandable why it's being done together. Because there's going to be victim impact statements. They are going to be so emotional. These families have gone through so much, hearing after hearing, defendant after defendant. And they are still standing strong. And they will tell the court -- and Michigan encourages it -- of what they've gone through, how their life has changed, how it will never be the same, how it impacts them. And doing it once on April 9th, I'm sure is enough. And they are cognizant of that and respectful for the families, so they wouldn't have to do it two times on two different dates for those two parents.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna and Boris, yes, there's a lawsuit which involves athletes from several sports. Yes, really stems back to that 2022 NCAA swimming championships.That's when Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer from the University of Pennsylvania, won the national title in the women's 500-yard freestyle event. Now one of the swimmers she competed against at that meet is one of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, Riley Gains. And Gains has been very outspoken about her views on opposing the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports. Now, Thomas competed on the men's team at UPenn before transitioning and switching to the women's team. And the lawsuit details the shock that Gains and the other swimmers felt when they learned that they had to share a locker room with Thomas at the championships in Atlanta. Gains and the other plaintiffs say the NCAA's transgender eligibility rules violate Title IX, which is meant to guarantee equal rights for women in collegiate sports. They argued it also violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Now they're seeking a ruling to keep the NCAA from implementing its transgender eligibility rules moving forward. The plaintiffs also want transgender athletes to no longer be allowed to compete on teams that don't match their biological sex. And for the awards these athletes have received to be given to other competitors. Now the NCAA responded to the suit, issuing a statement Thursday saying: \"College sports are the premier stage for women's sports in America. And while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women's sports, and ensure fair competition in all in NCAA championships\" -- guys?",
