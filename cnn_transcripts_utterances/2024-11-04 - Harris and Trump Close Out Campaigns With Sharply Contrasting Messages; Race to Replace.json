She said, let's enjoy it these last 24 hours of campaigning.The Vice President there sharing some optimism for the future of the country, talking about going into rooms where there are very different folks that don't share much in common but who are coming together to do as she said, good work.

You know, at this point, the former President's comments, his record have now been well litigated, and it is time to excite people about the election and her affirmative vision for the country. But they also think that they can message directly to the Puerto Ricans in this state, more than 30,000 of them right here in Allentown. They are trying to build off of that event at Madison Square Garden about a week ago when that derogatory comment was made about the island. They think that they can seize on that and use it as an opportunity to talk about the Vice President's long support for Puerto Rico.Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was there Saturday, Sunday, and Monday spending time in a state that they really didn't expect to be so competitive at this point. Back when Joe Biden was the Democratic nominee, they were starting to shift resources out of North Carolina into the blue wall states. But with Harris there, it has become incredibly competitive. And you can tell by the time and energy that they have put there of late that they are really, really focused on holding that state. Those closest victory in 2020 was in North Carolina.Later today, he'll be, like you said, in Reading, Pennsylvania, right behind me. And then he has another stop in Pittsburgh as well, crisscrossing this other battleground that he has put a lot of effort into. Reading is in one of those battleground counties that we are seeing both campaigns fight for Bucks County. Donald Trump lost it by just four points four years ago and a result that was really reflective and mirrored closely the statewide results in this race. And he has put a lot of effort and energy into trying to increase his margins here. I will say the turnout today so far for this event is quite thin. There is a lot of empty seats left in this arena. And Donald Trump is now supposed to speak in the next hour here. So I'm not saying that's a sign about what we can expect in Pennsylvania by any stretch or in this county, but Donald Trump has built his brand around his ability to turn out large crowds. And so far in the stops today in North Carolina and here in Reading, it is noticeably thin here.",

This is called get out the vote. And you got to know exactly who you're going to get out of each one of these counties. The President and other campaigns have captains there. They have precinct maps. And we know this morning, for example, in Pennsylvania, I polled all the Puerto Ricans who have yet to vote. And there's 87,000 of them who haven't voted. The good news is there's over 120,000 of them who have already voted.So there's a strategy to go turn out those Puerto Ricans who were offended by what happened at Madison Square Garden. It's just one of those. Think about over hundreds of offices, over union halls in Pittsburgh, over what's going to happen with the rallies. The rally is to energize folks who not maybe are going to be torn between Donald Trump or her. It's between who's going to go vote and who's going to sit at home.",

Because if you look at where turnout is right now, early voting, absentee voting today in Pennsylvania, the gap between Republicans and Democrats is more than half. You had actually a Democratic lead of over 1.1 million votes going into the election in 2020.Today it stands about 400,000. And that's the type of number that the Harris campaign recognizes. This is why you see the Vice President there doing, was it, four stops today because they have a turnout problem right now. You talk to any Democratic strategist, Republican strategist, turnout is down in Philadelphia. Right now, if you were the Harris campaign, you were sweating going into tomorrow because you have to try to get a lot of people show up to vote who don't normally show up on Election Day. And that's the thing that I think we're looking at the difference voting patterns between Republicans and Democrats. Traditionally, Republicans show up on Election Day, always win the Election Day vote, Democrats don't. And they're now going to be much more dependent on Election Day turnout. I think also another reason you're seeing them focus so much on North Carolina and Pennsylvania is that both campaigns, if you ask them, think that there's some numbers in Wisconsin that show that Trump is maybe already walking into a win in Wisconsin tomorrow. And that's why you're seeing so much focus in these other two states.",

MOWERSBut clearly, there's a Pied Piper method going here because you're seeing the increase in turnout right now.

So the campaigns are kind of on their own, so to speak. It is at the whim of the national media, so to speak, and how voters are going to be able to actually get their information there. So that's one piece.The other piece I'd say is that if you talk to most operatives on the ground, you remember Iowa is one of the largest homes of the Obama to Trump voters, right? More counties, I believe, than just about any other state who voted for Obama twice and have voted for Trump twice. You have a lot of these voters who do not always participate in the polls. You hear about the silent Trump voter. Iowa is the epicenter of some of that. So there's a little piece of that as well. You've got the fact that there's a unique circumstance in Iowa. You also do have a six-week abortion ban which has driven some, you know, response from particularly women in Iowa as well. Do I think Donald Trump's at risk of losing Iowa? I don't.

      "sentences": "Well, I think Republicans are very confident that they're going to win the Senate. They are being cautious about by how many seats, right? Are we talking a narrow Republican majority or are they talking about a real sweep? And this makes a difference because you have some Republicans who sometimes cross party lines and vote with Democrats. I'm thinking of someone like Lisa Murkowski, someone like Senator Lisa Murkowski. And if Republicans have just a 51 seat majority, it really does empower those Republican senators to cross the aisle and vote with Democrats. And this could matter if you're talking about a potential Trump presidency where those Republicans could block certain nominees that he wants in his Cabinet. You also could have a scenario where Harris wins and these senators cross the aisle and work with Democrats to approve her nominees. So it's a huge, huge question. And it matters a lot if you have 51 seats or 54.",
