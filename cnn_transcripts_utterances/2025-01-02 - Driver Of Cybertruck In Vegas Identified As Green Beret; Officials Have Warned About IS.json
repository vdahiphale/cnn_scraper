Law enforcement officials have now said there is no direct link that they know of, but we now have the name of the individual involved.It was, according to our colleagues John Miller and Haley Britzky, the man believed to have rented the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded, his name was Matthew Alan Livelsberger. He was, according to the U.S. Army -- CNN reported earlier that the man who rented the Cybertruck was a Special Forces soldier assigned to the 10th Special Forces Group. The new information there as we continue to follow this story and the new elements of that. I now want to bring in former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Beth Sanner and Retired FBI Special Agent Bobby Chacon. Beth, I want to start with you because I want to dive in on the New Orleans suspect and the kind of ISIS elements of that in a moment. But to start here, because there's a distinct difference in the profile, at least as much as we know so far, in the Las Vegas Tesla explosion, in the sense of it doesn't fit necessarily the profile we usually see from a lone wolf operator, somebody who has been radicalized by ISIS, as we've seen in the New Orleans case. What's your kind of read on the limited information we have on this individual?",

      "sentences": "You know, well, it's all speculation at this point, and we don't know whether this person was, you know, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, maybe some kind of Islamic connection, although I don't think that, or maybe mental illness, maybe PTSD and suicide is involved.You know, curious for me for someone who is so experienced picking a Cybertruck, which has bulletproof windows, you know, it's kind of odd to me and stayed in the vehicle. So I don't really know. But I do know this that, you know, if you are classified as a mass casualty perpetrator in the United States, you're more likely to be a person with a military background than the other indicators. And that doesn't mean that military people are radicalized more, but it means when they do radicalize, they're more likely to radicalize into using mass casualty and force. MATTINGLY: It's a great point. And to the extent there's any connective tissue between what happened in Las Vegas, what happened in New Orleans, Bobby, is that the New Orleans suspect, our perpetrator, also had a military background, had been, I believe, in the National Guard, had been honorably discharged. Two very different career kind of trajectories in terms of a Special Forces soldier and the individual down in New Orleans. When you look at the kind of profile that we've seen from the New Orleans suspect, it does track with a lot of what law enforcement has warned about related to ISIS or ISIS radicalization over the course of the last several years. What stood out to you?",

      "sentences": "Well, you're exactly right. I mean, look, this is what ISIS does. They're pro at it. You know, we've seen them do three camera shoots and slick editing in their videos. They put this material out, they put books out and videos out, and they basically put it out for the world.And they wait for people that are in desperate situations or looking to turn to some material like that. It's like putting out baited food that's baited with poison for an animal that's injured, that can't hunt on its own, and it will come and consume that food and that poison. So these people -- and we are now learning the New Orleans killer, you know, had financial problems, had marital problems. You know, he was somebody that was in his life, had some issues, and he apparently turned to this. So ISIS has put this material out there for the world to consume, and the more people that are consuming it, the people that are kind of in certain mindsets and certain psychological areas in their lives that are having difficulty may consume that and then may turn into, you know, a killer like this. And that's what ISIS knows. They're very good at it. These videos and this material is made with that intention. And he has all the hallmarks of, you know, what they tell them to do. As McCabe said earlier, you know, they tell them to make a video and release it just before you go and do your attack. Number one, for your family. And number two, to pledge allegiance to ISIS. And so that's -- it tracks perfectly. Now, the Vegas bombing is the exact opposite. So in New Orleans, body count was high. He wanted to kill as many people as possible. He drove the truck until he couldn't kill anymore. He got out and then started shooting people. And so that was a high body count. That's what ISIS wants. Now, in Vegas, this guy, if you watch the video, it's a terrible explosion, but you don't see any other humans around. If he wanted to kill people and have a high body count, he would have driven to a much -- a different area of Vegas. There's plenty of crowds in Vegas. He got to hop the sidewalk in front of the Bellagio and mow down people if he wanted to. So those attacks are so different that that's where the disconnect to me occurs. Because if he wanted a high body count with that kind of explosion, he could have easily done that in Vegas and he chose not to.",

So we've had, you know, IS was at its height, you know, and President Trump really was able to take credit for destroying ISIS, the caliphate in the, you know, late 2020s or 2019-2020 in Syria. But since then, the group is much more dispersed.And you have these places around the world in Afghanistan. This is ISIS-Khorasan. Those are the people who did the attack in Russia against the Crocus Hall. And also, most likely behind the Taylor Swift attacks that were planned in Vienna, and that CIA and other intel helped shut down before there was a mass casualty event there. And so we are seeing this spike in Islamic State. And, you know, in this past year, we've had 14 arrests in the United States related to IS, you know, Islamic State. Five of those had active plots. And the reason -- and that's up from nine last in 2023, and none of those were active plots. And part of the reason for this is because of what's happening in the Middle East, the real feeling around Gaza and the Palestinians. And now we're seeing a big push after the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, where ISIS has been making a comeback in the last year. And so really for the entire community, the IS threat is certainly very serious, but it's being manifested in these kind of inspirational plots involving generally single people. Maybe small groups, but generally single people.",

And they're willing, possibly, to split with Trump to stay true to their principles. They're -- you know, they don't like the continuing resolutions. They don't like that he's added spending, mainly to try to compromise with Democrats on these spending bills to avoid government shutdown. So there are plenty of very conservative House Republicans who don't necessarily want to pick a fight with Donald Trump. But they do believe their principles called them to kind of stick to what they feel like they came to Washington to do. And that kind of puts them at odds, sometimes, with Speaker Johnson. We see that with Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example. She's a big ally of President Trump, but she's one of Mike Johnson's biggest critics. So usually, she falls in line, but there are others who seem less willing to do so. So that's why Friday's going to be such a toss-up.",

And that is what it looks like under a Trump administration, which is what he is going to experience, which is by one tweet by Elon Musk, everything sort of tanked that they had worked on.So the next 24 hours, I think, are going to be pretty critical to see how Republicans either get behind Trump's endorsement or not. If Trump changes his mind, I mean, we're living hour by hour here. So whether they're already preparing for it to go into multiple rounds and what you said about Massie could be just Massie, but it also gives permission to others to vote no if they don't get along with them.",

We saw it at the end of the year on spending, but that's a fiscal question that many Republicans like to vote against the spending bills anyway. I'll be very surprised if that happens, but we shall see. If it does, if there are House Republicans who defy the president-elect now, that is a much more interesting sign of issues to come going forward. But boy, Speaker Johnson, Trump made him sweat it for a little bit, a few days, without giving that endorsement. But he got it sort of going into the holidays. I would be surprised if there's a repeat. And Monday is a key deadline because that is when the Electoral College certification happens.

That became something that Kevin McCarthy really folded on after those 15 rounds. And it ultimately led him to losing his speakership months later. So I don't think Johnson is willing to fold as much as McCarthy, but could there be members who try to pull some tweaks out of that and again, let him sweat a little bit?
