And there's this question of the access to the gun, which she's very much been pushing off onto her husband who will face trial next month, and ignoring the mental health needs of her son, Ethan Crumbley. The meeting at the school just a couple hours before the shooting is really key to that and that is what she has been on the stand talking about.So let's discuss this with our reporters and analysts who can join us on this. We have Jean Casarez, Areva Martin and Joey Jackson with us. Jean, just to you first, this meeting is really a linchpin of this case. What stood out to you?",

His phone was taken away from him. They said, you're not going to be able to go to the shooting range at all until those grades go up.Now, we had heard on the prosecution's case that he was locked out. Locked out of what? We don't really know. But it was a bad argument. So the next morning, she gets this text from the counselor, and she sees the drawing. And she testified that she was very angry when she saw the drawing, and she took it personally. So did she interpret that drawing that from his anger the night before that he was drawing a picture of just his rebellion against the parents' discipline that night before? That's what it appeared as, though. Now, she made it sort of - I mean, she said she was concerned at the meeting. But she made the meeting, and she had texted this to Brian also, that it was just sort of a calm meeting. And so that demeanor is different from what we had heard before, that it was a little more concerning. But the counselor admitted that he was concerned about suicide. That's what he was concerned about. Nobody ever mentioned a mass shooting.",

She's blaming everyone. She made that reference to her husband drinking and perhaps being depressed. She's made references to the school of perhaps not doing their job. She made a reference to Brian or some reference about him maybe having a poor memory.So the strategy here is clearly blame everyone and accept no responsibility. Deny any knowledge about any mental health or emotional issues that her son may have been having. She denies seeing text messages and other written documents that clearly indicated that this young man was having some issues, even so much as giving us this explanation that, well, he saw things in the house and we had this little game that we played around ghosts. So nothing seemed to be an issue for this mother. And I'm just not sure that everything we've learned about this kid that jurors are buying that this mother was even - was either so oblivious or she has this way of just making everything seem so normal when it really wasn't.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. So from a defense perspective, what you want to do is to put matters in context. Context matters, right? And so if you look at the evidence, this case will be really decided on three pillars. The first pillar is that of foreseeability. Should she have foreseen that that is Jennifer Crumbley, that her son could engage in this type of behavior, even with having access to a gun that was potentially hidden.Number two, and moving on from the issue of foreseeability, to what extent did she have notice of her son's mental health maladies and other issues. And number three, did she act reasonably. It's really unusual in a case to have the defense say in opening statements that my client's going to testify, they committed to it, and here she is. [15:05:05] But to the core of your question, Brianna, I think a few other things stand out. You talk about these school communications that - where the school's communicating with each other, what are they saying? A, he's having a rough time. B, he's sleeping in class, right, they're talking about that. C, his family is a mistake. Well, all of that is highly relevant, but did they ever inform the mother of that? And if they didn't inform the mother, how would she be expected or anticipated to address that in any way, form or fashion? So that's big in terms of context. Number two, if we just are sitting here talking about haunted houses and things flying off the shelves without knowing that the house was built in 1920, that internally they would joke about it, that the circuit breaker was cut off while they played with the Ouija board. Well, if you just talk about things flying off shelves, oh my goodness, he has a health problem. But she put it in context. What the context is that? Look, this is generally what we do. And so I think all of these things on balance, leaving off, right, to what we heard about the meeting, hey, it was a meeting. The school said that he wasn't a risk. You know what? We'll address the issue. And so at the end of the day, I'll stop where I began. Should she have foreseen this will be the defense, right? And was she on notice of this and did she act reasonably under these circumstances? They're arguing that she should have and at the end of the day, you know what, she's maybe not the best mother, a mother of the year, but she shouldn't be criminalized for it and that's the defense's perspective. And that's what the jury is going to have to buy if she's to be acquitted.",

She specifically said that it was up to her husband to handle it, that weapons made her uncomfortable at home. Walk us through that testimony, because that could be critical.",

And so she is saying that she had only been to the shooting range once before, that guns really weren't her thing. Horses were her thing, that's what we know about that. And so, James mainly handle the gun. I think to a lot of jurors, that may make sense.You know what's very interesting, another point, this is a suburb of Detroit, all right? But apparently, we heard in this trial through testimony from the school, dean, actually, that a very big sport with peoples in the community is hunting. And that a lot of the students at the high school go hunting with their families or their fathers before school starts. And so they put out a notice every year saying, if you go to hunt before class, be sure not to come to school in your camo and be sure not to bring your weapon, your hunting rifle with you to class. So that's another thing. This jury is made up of people from this community, Oxford, of Pontiac, Michigan. And so that is something to also take into consideration here. And so a lot of jurors may say, my husband handles the guns. I do understand that. So they may say that's the way it's done in our house too.",

But it's just curious to me that she says guns aren't her thing. She knows that her son has a gun. She doesn't know where the gun is. She testified that the gun may be in the bedroom where the lock to the case may be in a beer stein in the kitchen. She wasn't really clear about that.And it just strikes me and I think jurors sitting there are going to wonder, how come this mother didn't mention to the school in this meeting, we did get that gun for Ethan for Christmas. And we just want to make sure that given these drawings and given what you've told us that the gun is still safe. So maybe, honey, you stay here. I'm going to go check for the gun or anything like that. I just can't imagine that some juror is not going to want this mother with this history to have taken that really simple step and to have at least alerted the school about the possibility that the gun might have been removed, because she really doesn't know because she's not in the chain of custody of the gun because, as Jean said, guns aren't her thing.",

In Iraq and Syria, frankly, it doesn't have full control over the Houthis as well. And the actions we have seen, that is, a drone strike that killed three U.S. service members, has concerned Iranian leaders because of the potential for escalation. It shows the idea that though Iran equips, trains, funds, supplies, all of these different groups, it doesn't fully control their actions and that's why you see officials saying that Iran doesn't want an escalation in the region.Now, with that drone strike that killed three U.S. service members on Sunday, an escalation very much a possibility, with the U.S. promising to respond and officials telling us that response will be more powerful than what we've seen in previous U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria. Iran very much aware of that, and this is a situation they were trying to avoid, just as the U.S. has been keen to avoid an open regional war, Iranian leaders, according to U.S. officials, are also keen to avoid that war. It's interesting, Oren, I wonder if this lays some groundwork for maybe what we may be anticipating when it comes to the response of the U.S. If you have officials saying they believe Iran was surprised, it seems they might be less inclined to do something more direct with Iran rather than hitting the proxies.",

      "sentences": "Well, officials have made clear they hold Iran ultimately responsible. The White House did say yesterday that they're blaming the direct attribution for the attack on an umbrella group of Iran- backed proxies. But there is quite a bit of a spectrum there short of directly attacking Iran itself, going right after Iranian territory or striking the capital of Iran. And that's because Iran has assets, Iran has the proxies and the U.S. can go after those in Iraq, Syria, frankly, Yemen. Unlikely they'd go after Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that's an option, too, and that's because of Iran's reach in the region.So there are plenty of ways, frankly, to go after Iran and their abilities, their capabilities, capabilities throughout the region without striking Iran itself. And I think that's what we're likely to see as the U.S. makes clear that this will be a multi-phased approach, perhaps a wave of strikes carried out against targets that might not be directly Iran, but are clearly linked to Iran.",

      "sentences": "Yes, a number of things have. I mean, first, when you look at, we'll take it backwards, they were talking about the school and the meeting at the school. Now, obviously, that meeting is significant. What meeting am I referencing? I'm referencing the meeting when James Crumbley, the husband, and Jennifer were called back, the mother who's on trial now, to talk about the drawing of their son that had the blood on it, that had the gun. And it was significant, why are they there?She, Jennifer, is saying that she left the meeting calmly, it was not abrupt, and she felt that there wasn't a security threat. But what's very significant at that point, and we heard it in other testimony, is that the school had the ability, not only her, to raise in the - an issue about the gun in that meeting, but if there's a drawing of the gun for the school to ask, hey, does he have access to a gun? Are you aware of a gun? And it doesn't stop there. The school got the backpack. You heard testimony previously from today that the dean got his backpack, that is, Ethan Crumbley, and handed it to him. Was it searched? Why wasn't it searched? Should there have been a search of that? Should there have been inquiries of the school based upon that? (Inaudible) very important (inaudible) stood out the issue pertaining to, obviously, when in context to these discussions about his hallucinations, was he having hallucinations predicated upon being mentally ill, was he having hallucinations or anything else, was he playing tricks with them as he always did. That stood out. Again, context as to what was important. And so all these things go to notice and with the school having information that their son's having a problem, it would have been nice if he's having a rough time, if he wasn't sleeping and other things, to inform the parents that never happened. And so it goes to the issue of blame, last point. And that is that she, Jennifer Crumbley, indicated that, look, she's not much into guns. It is the husband who purchased the weapon and the husband who hid the weapon from them. And so I think the defense is making the case that this was not foreseeable, she would not have known and she acted reasonably and non-criminally under these circumstances. SANCHEZ: Areva, to Joey's last point, part of the reason that this case is so important is because it could set a future precedent. And I'm not talking the distant future, I'm talking in just about six or seven weeks when her husband is set to be tried for four counts of involuntary manslaughter. How could this case potentially impact that one and the testimony that we hear today, what impact could that have down the road?",

It was from his, texting with his friend or his journal, and he says, I got to find where my father hid that key. And it's not coming in because it - because he's got a Fifth Amendment privilege, and if you let that in, it opens the door, the prosecution argued, to the entire journal. It's as if Ethan was testifying and he has exerted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, so the jury is not going to hear that from his text. I got to find the key that my father hid. But I want to talk about one thing Joey said, because I want to look at the facts here. Everybody has to hear this. At the school, all right, on that Monday, he was researching bullets. It was in his English class. The English teacher told the counselor and the dean, everybody, that it just made her remember that his writings that September, that fall, had been of a violent nature. And then at some point right around that time in school, he was watching a video of somebody killing somebody. And then you've got the math worksheet on Tuesday. The school never told Jennifer any of that.And when they went to the school about that math worksheet, she wasn't told about the video he was watching of somebody killing somebody. He wasn't told about the English teacher saying, geez, this semester he's really been writing his violent tendencies in his English papers. She didn't hear any of that. And there has been a very big issue with the families in Oxford about the inaction of the school. And that day, the dean is the one that carried the backpack from math class, gave it back to Ethan. Question was, why didn't you open it up? No reasonable suspicion, he said.",
