This was the first U.S. response to that Hamas response to the proposal that was on the table. The secretary of state saying that numerous changes were put forth by Hamas.Some of them are workable and some of them are not. Clearly trying to strike a tone of hopefulness, but also frustrated with the fact that Hamas has come back questioning their legitimacy, how seriously they are engaging in these talks, because some of the things that they have put forth in this counterproposal here, the changes that they are proposing, are positions that they have previously taken, and effectively the United States believed that they had moved on from that point. But the secretary of state made it clear that they are determined to try and bridge the gaps here. The secretary said, in his view, they are bridgeable, but he's just not sure if they'll be able to get there, but made the case that a deal here is in the benefit of both the Palestinians and the Israelis. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Steve Scalise, the majority leader, said it's really important that Republicans get this passed, get this out of their chamber today. He said that that is the hope. That is the expectation. Meanwhile, Tom Emmer would not say whether or not the votes werethere. He, of course, is the Republican vote counter. That is his gig. And he made clear that they plan to vote today, but he would not say whether or not the votes would be there. You can expect that behind closed doors, as we speak, Republicans are wrestling with what to do. There had been some concern that there might be some moderates who were on the fence and leaning against voting for this proposal. But again, it just all matters because of such a narrow majority in the House. The speaker can only afford to lose two Republican votes. That means they have to count very carefully when they have these close votes coming to the floor. So, we'll see whether or not they ultimately put that on the floor today. The rule vote happening at 10:30 a.m. John.",

A cooling off. And on a monthly basis, prices were flat, slower, which means better pace than April.This read on the U.S. economy also is coming just hours before the Federal Reserve makes its latest interest rate announcement. Meaning, this is a big day on the U.S. economy front. Joining me now is one of President Biden's top economic aides, Lael Brainard. She's the director of the National Economic Council. Lael, thank you for being here. With the full understanding you all take a lot of care to not weigh in on the Fed and respect the Fed's independence, would you expect the data out just this morning to have a demonstrable impact on what we learn this afternoon?",

The president respects the independence of the Federal Reserve.I will say that today's report on inflation, which showed zero inflation in the month, an inflation down by two-thirds, is welcome news, particularly for families that are feeling squeezed by the cost of living. Grocery prices down or flat for four months in a row and gas prices below $3.50 at the pump. Those are prices that are very important to American families. BOLDUAN: And, Lael, you talk about how families are feeling squeezed. And in general, when it comes to the U.S. economy, how people feel about the economy is a huge issue. It - how they feel about the overall economy. How they feel about their personal economy. The president's approval rating and how people feel about the economy remains under water. We have showed - we're going to show everyone a graphic kind of tracking his approval on the economy over the course of the year, really from - since March of last year. And now it's kind of remaining in the low 30s. If the data is showing improvement, and that is what you see with this report today, why aren't people feeling it?",

And he knows that the cost of living is just too high for a lot of families. And he is fighting really hard to lower those costs.On health care, of course, he secured important legislation, bringing the cost of prescription drugs down, like on insulin to $35 a month. Those are real savings. Grocery prices, he's been calling on grocery chains to bring prices down. They've kept their profit margins pretty high. And now you see grocery stores answering the call. Price reductions on thousands of items. Grocery prices flat or down for the past few months. Same on gas prices, where we are seeing record production and gas prices coming down going into the summer driving season. But look, we know that in coming months that's the kind of choice that's going to be in front of us, you know, whether to keep fighting to lower costs for middle class Americans, which is at the center of the president's agenda, or to be fighting for tax cuts for the ultra- wealthy and corporations.

Sam Altman, who's the founder of OpenAI, he said last month, Lael, \"one of the things that annoys me most about people who work on AI is when they stand up with a straight face and say, this will never cause any job elimination. This is just an additive thing. This is just about to be great,\" Altman says. Altman goes on to say, \"this is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs. This is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function, and this is going to create entirely new jobs. That always happens with technology.\"What are you planning for on this front?

So, this is an area where the president was really out front early on, lead in the G-7 on recognizing the promises of AI, but also that there are some downsides to AI, and to put a framework in place where we really grapple with those comprehensively put safeguards in place, and in particular on workers. Thought it was very important to work with labor leaders, business leaders, to come out with some principles about how to make sure that AI enables workers. Workers are trained to take advantage of AI tools to enhance their work, enhance their productivity.But that there are safeguards against, for instance, surveillance that would impinge on privacy and that workers are given an opportunity to use AI tools as opposed to seeing the kind of displacement impacts. So, I don't have updated estimates, but I will say, we put out a set of principles and we are going to want to work with labor, with business leaders to integrate AI in ways that American workers have the capability to use AI to enhance their jobs and their productivity.",
