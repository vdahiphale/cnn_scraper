Lake-effect snow is blanketing the Great Lakes region as biting cold sweeps across most of the country. Nearly four feet of snow is already covering western New York from the past few days. And now more than two million people in the region are under lake-effect snow warnings. Officials across Pennsylvania spoke earlier today, driving home the message for people to stay safe by staying off the roads. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEC. MIKE CARROLL, PENNDOT: My message to the public is simple. Don't travel unless you absolutely have to. Give us today and tomorrow to restore order to the -- to the transportation network that we have made great progress over the last 36 hours. And I have every expectation with the work of state officials, county officials and local officials will meet the needs of folks here in Erie County. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson International Airport still remains the busiest in the world.

Officials here at the airport were expecting 440,000 passengers over the entire Thanksgiving holiday. 200,000 of those just this weekend. At the national level, the Transportation Security Administration, the TSA processed 2.4 million passengers Wednesday and 2.7 million Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. They were expecting more than 3 million passengers today. We spoke with some of those passengers earlier. Some told us so far, so good, while others said catching early or very late flights is the key to not getting stranded. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROSE WILLIS, RETURNING FROM WASHINGTON D.C. TO ATLANTA: It was pretty easy. It's not as crowded as it normally is I think because the flight was coming in later on in the evening, like about 12. So the crowd is not as bad. but it does take some time.

Some of those cold temperatures, the coldest air of the season so far, after a lot of us just wrapped up a record warm fall.The lake-effect snow is what's causing problems. It continues to pump off the Great Lakes. It really won't stop until the wind direction changes. And these warnings have now been extended through Tuesday. So you can see the lake-effect snow bands coming right just north of Cleveland. Erie has been slammed all weekend. I-90, just a headache, a mess just south of Buffalo where those fans are trying to shovel out all the snow from the stadium for that game later on today. These are the snow totals down already. So far more than three feet off of Lakes Erie and Ontario and counting. We could still get another one to two feet as we go through today and into tomorrow. Some of these totals or parts of western New York, 46 inches of snow again down in just this event, just since Thursday. 38 inches in parts of Pennsylvania. So again, just a lot of snow already and continuing as we go through the rest of the weekend here because we still have these warnings in effect for the lake-effect snow now extended through Tuesday morning because we still have these winds coming over the very warm lakes. The lake temperatures are about in the 50s, 40s and 30s -- that's record warmth. So when you have this colder air coming over the lakes, it picks up the moisture and it dumps the snow. The game for the Buffalo Bills -- the stadium is just south of Buffalo, which often gets hit harder with some of the lake-effect snow because of that wind direction. So already several -- more than a foot of snow down there. And you could still have some snow showers through the game, windy and cold for that bills game later on today. And again, like I mentioned, you've got the warmer lakes that picks up the colder air with all of that snow ad it just continues to pump. Which is why this machine just doesn't stop. Here's a look at the temperatures. I mean, it is 35 degrees in Syracuse right now, 27 in Chicago, only 18 in Duluth. Wind chills in the single digits. So very cold. The coldest air of the season so far. And it's taking up 70 percent of the lower 48 with temperatures below freezing. And it is getting as far south as the Gulf Coast. There are some freeze alerts in effect for parts of north Florida where we still have that growing season. These are the morning low temperatures. 15 degrees as you wake up in Chicago tomorrow morning, 17 degrees in Cincinnati. Even in Atlanta 28 degrees as you start the morning.

Kash Patel worked in Trump's first administration as a national security council official. Trump's selection of Patel would mean firing Wray or Wray stepping down early from his ten-year term.Trump appointed Christopher Wray as the FBI director back in 2017. Patel is a highly divisive figure who has accused the so-called deep state of targeting Trump and proposed a comprehensive housecleaning of the Justice Department. It's a controversial pick that almost certainly sets up another potentially explosive confirmation battle in the U.S. Senate. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from Florida near Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. So Alayna, what more can you tell us about this pick and the reaction to it.",

      "sentences": "Right.Well Fred, I think first of all, just to note that Donald Trump and his choice of Kash Patel is making clear that he's putting in a like- minded loyalist into this role. I remind you that Patel has been a fierce critic of the FBI for several years now. He has called for them moving and dismantling and really shutting down the FBI's Washington headquarters, of firing top leaders at the FBI. And also for what he's referred to as rooting out bias within the bureau. Now, we know that both Donald Trump and Patel have this long held distrust of the agency. On Trump's part, it really began back in 2016 when they began investigating him over his former campaign's ties to Russia. It's actually something Donald Trump brought up in his post in that announcement of Patel yesterday evening. But look, you mentioned that there's likely going to be an uphill battle in the Senate about trying to confirm him. I know from my conversations with those working on the transition, those close to Donald Trump, that there had been some skepticism behind the scenes of whether Patel would be right for the role. Again, because he is controversial and some of the beliefs that he has about wanting to root out the so-called deep state. But also because some of the other comments that he has made about national security in the past, including wanting to go after journalists and seek retribution on Donald Trump's opponents. However, I will also say that today, and you mentioned this, Fred, we've seen a lot of people within the Republican Party including many of Donald Trump's cabinet picks and top advisers to him praising the choice of Patel. Many of them as well, trying to argue that he is the type of disrupter that the bureau needs to kind of root out, again what they have been calling bad actors within the FBI and people who have been biased unjustifiably in their eyes against Donald Trump. Now, as for the Senate part of this, we actually did get some reaction as well from many Republican senators including the incoming, top Judiciary Republican, Chuck Grassley. I want to read for you some of what he wrote. He said, quote, \"Chris Wray has failed at fundamental duties of FBI director. He has shown disdain for congressional oversight and hasn't lived up to his promises. It's time to chart a new course for transparency and accountability at the FBI. Kash Patel must prove to Congress he will reform and restore public trust in the FBI.\" So that's just one key senator that Patel is going to need on his side in order to move through with that confirmation process. And one other thing as well, you mentioned that Chris Wray would need to step down. He is currently still serving out his ten-year term. It expires in 2027. So far, there hasn't been a clear indication that he is going to step aside. So Donald Trump would need to fire him in order to install Patel. So all of that is still likely in the weeks to come, Fred.",

So that's -- that's -- we know that's going to happen. And that's why Biden has to consider whether he's going to pardon his son at this stage. But what we do know is Trump's not messing around. So there's a few weeks in which Biden can respond. I want to also say something about the acts of omission. The FBI has a broad agenda. That's not just national security or political and media enemies. It has civil rights laws to enforce. It has financial rights and protection laws, consumer protections. One can assume that's not a high priority of Kash Patel and that you will see crimes that are committed that are likely not to be investigated.",

But look, I believe the president-elect, when he says that he is picking Patel because of this revenge tour of this, of this attempt to get back at his political enemies. I don't think there's any reason to doubt the president-elect at this stage. So it will weaponize the FBI. It's a large agency. It's distributed throughout the country. There's lots of things it can do without the FBI director maybe meaningfully being able to direct. But what we also have to remember is that the FBI does not investigate in a vacuum. It brings investigations that are ultimately prosecuted by U.S. attorneys. Those U.S. Attorneys also are going to be replaced by Donald Trump. So that's the -- that's the agenda right now. I say this flatly only because there's really no other explanation for the appointment than that as Donald Trump says and writes to go after his enemies.",

He's going to have to educate himself about what it does, you know, to say that everyone has to go out, out into the country. The FBI is actually based around regional offices. Anyone who's ever worked in law enforcement knows that there's FBI agents in every state. And so he's going to have to educate himself on what the FBI actually does, rather than the sort of podcast that he's been on in which he sort of talks really tough. There's also laws, I'd like to remind people, that would prohibit certain behavior, whether they're by an FBI director.

But if you think back just less than a decade ago, when the Syrian government first took control, complete control of Aleppo, it was an absolutely brutal relentless campaign that smashed part of the you know, the ancient city's marketplace, which was you know, a place of a place that tourists from around the world would come to.So there was nothing spared, if you will, in what Assad wanted to do to take control of that city. Right now has been caught off guard. It appears as to his sort of main sponsors, Russia and Iran not ready for this rapid rebel advance. There are reports that Assad is gathering forces in the next largest city to the south, Hama, 60, 70 miles away. Assad himself, meeting with the Iranian foreign minister today, the Iranian foreign minister saying that his visit is shows the strength of support from Iran for Syria and for Assad, and Assad, saying that they will continue to fight back against all what he calls these terrorist elements across the country. So the language is all there. And if you look at what the Russian news agency is portraying, the situation as today, they're saying that the Russian air force, the Syrian air force, together have bombarded and smashed the rebels. You know, the sort of death toll that the Russian state media is claiming usually inaccurate this time appears to be outlandish. But if that's a statement of intent, then the answer to your question is yes. This could yet become a big battle.",

And it's also notable that this trip is long awaited. This was originally scheduled back in October, and Biden at the last minute had to postpone this trip due to two hurricanes that were hitting the U.S. at the time.Now, while there, he will be meeting with the Angola president. He'll also be giving a speech talking about, according to a senior administration official, the shared history. The highlight -- highlight the growth of their relationship over the years. But it is notable, as you referenced, that certainly China and Chinas growing influence in the region will have a big impact on the message that Biden is going to deliver while there. A senior administration official telling us that Biden will be playing -- talking a lot about and playing up U.S. investment in Africa, in infrastructure, in specifically talking about the rail corridor project that the U.S. is in support, that potentially would be something that starts in Angola, something that means a lot to the people there. And that according to a senior administration official, is an initiative that they hope will continue on in the incoming Trump administration. And that is notable because certainly hanging over this trip, every part of this trip is the fact that Biden, Fred, only has two months left in office, and he's about to hand over the White House to present incoming President Trump in just two short months.

I'm wondering that view of the White House on the South Lawn, the quilt that there will be a ceremony today. How significant is that to you? As we look at the live pictures again?GUILAMO-RAMOS: I think that its quite significant because it brings really to the American people to people all over the world of the sort of real lives of people that have been lost to HIV/AIDS and it really centers the importance of World AIDS Day and the progress that we've made, but also the work that we need to do, including in the Latino community, where there remains an invisible crisis.",

The message isn't getting out to the right, you know, corners of the population. I mean, what's happening here?GUILAMO-RAMOS: Well, the good news is that we have many of the tools that we need to end the epidemic in our nation and for that matter across the planet. Those tools prevention and treatment tools are not reaching the Latino community in the ways that they should. And so when we think about, for example the numbers of Latinos that are receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis, the HIV prevention pill or injection, too few Latinos are receiving that who have indications. When we think about Latinos knowing their HIV status and being offered an HIV test, too few Latinos who are at risk are being offered HIV testing as part of their routine care. When we think about Latinos being engaged in HIV treatment for those Latinos that are living with HIV, too few are engaged in care and too few achieve what we call viral suppression, which is really what we want in terms of preserving someone's health who's living with HIV, and also preventing further transmission of HIV to others from the person who is living with HIV. We can do better, Fred, with the Latino community. We know how to do this. We've done it. We've just got to apply the tools that we've applied elsewhere to Latinos in our country. So how optimistic are you to turn to be able to turn things around? I am optimistic, I actually think that we have been shining light on the invisible crisis, and we've made it less invisible. So thank you very much for the opportunity to address the audience today. I think the concern is that we wont take action. We need to collectively come together a multi-sectoral approach from the government, from the private sector, from media, from universities and research scientists, from the Latino community and really, you know, do what we've done in the past 40 years to actually end HIV in Latinos.",
