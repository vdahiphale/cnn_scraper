I'm Isa Soares and you are watching CNN NEWSROOM.I wanted to return to our top story this hour and that's the Middle East, where Russia launched deadly airstrikes against Syrian rebels on Friday. That is according to Russian state media. Moscow claims to have killed at least 200 members of the Syrian jihadist group in Aleppo, as well as Idlib provinces. And it comes after rebel forces kicked off a surprise offensive this week, crossing into Aleppo for the first time in eight years. They were seen pulling down the Syrian flag after reaching the statue of Bassel al-Assad, the late brother of president Bashar al-Assad. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, meantime, is pledging to further strengthen his country's ties with Russia and that is according to North Korean state media. Kim spoke during Friday's meeting with Russian defense minister in Pyongyang. The two countries have already expanded their military ties to levels unseen since the Cold War. And they've signed a mutual defense pact this year. And North Korea has sent thousands of troops to help Russia fight against Ukraine and that is according to Western officials. Well, Washington is trying to give Ukraine some clarity about the future of U.S. military aid. U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart on Friday and Blinken briefed him on what he called or what the official statement called, quote, \"the U.S. goals for sustainable support for Ukraine.\" The future of the U.S. military aid is in the hands of president-elect Donald Trump, who begins his second term in January. Officials say his Ukraine policy is still in the works. But his future special envoy proposed using the aid as a condition to push Kyiv to negotiate with Moscow. Friday's conversation happened after Russia pummeled Ukraine's power system this week, leaving more than 1 million homes in the dark. As Fred Pleitgen reports, those strikes are creating more diplomatic friction between Moscow and Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Kremlin saying that that big attack was a direct response to the Biden administration, allowing the Ukrainians to use those U.S. supplied ATACMS, surface-to-surface missiles, to strike targets deep inside Russia. Of course, both the Russians and the Ukrainians have confirmed that targets were struck in the western regions of Russia using attack ATACMS surface- to-surface missiles. At the same time, the Russians definitely ramping up their aerial campaign against targets within Ukraine. The Ukrainian saying that in the early morning hours of Friday, the Russians launched about 130 strike drones toward Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians are saying they managed to take a lot of those drones down. At the same time, they do acknowledge that there was damage caused, especially in the town of Odessa but also in Kyiv as well. However, the big thing that the Russians are talking about, that Russian state media is talking about, that the Kremlin is talking about is Russia's new gigantic intermediate range multiple warhead ballistic missile called Oreshnik. In fact, Vladimir Putin came out and said that that missile could have a devastating effect on any sort of positions that the Ukrainians would have on the ground. And he said several of those weapons paired together could actually cause an explosion that is almost the size of a nuclear weapon. So the Russians definitely very much threatening. The Ukrainians, of course, trying to dissuade them from continuing to use those U.S. and U.K. supplied weapons to strike deep into Russia -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Federal officials, specifically the TSA, confirming that this stowaway passenger was in her mid to late 50s. She had no boarding pass for this flight this past Tuesday that originated at JFK headed to Paris, had cleared one security checkpoint but then bypassed two subsequent ID verification stations. The TSA saying that she was a Russian passport holder and also held a U.S. green card. And she also failed to secure asylum in France after she applied for that several years ago, which may potentially speak to a possible motive in terms of why she wanted to head to Paris in the first place. The TSA conducting its own investigation right now along with Delta Air Lines. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson said, \"Nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security. That's why Delta is conducting an exhaustive investigation of what may have occurred and will work collaboratively with other aviation stakeholders and law enforcement to that end.\" Rob Jackson, who was a passenger aboard that flight, telling CNN that there were no empty seats aboard that flight, that he overheard the crew discussing how the stowaway was able to hide in one lavatory board and then moved to others during the flight before she was ultimately caught by the crew.
