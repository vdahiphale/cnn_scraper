Because she obviously has enjoyed this surge of momentum. During Hillary Clinton's run for president back in 2016, there was a lot of attention paid to this issue.

I think the way the migrant crisis in Italy has been driving Italian politics in many ways to the right, to the point where they are having conversations about how do we fix this at the source, it really does mirror what is going on here in the United States in the way immigration plays into our politics, particularly right-wing politics and there have been conversations about how to solve the problem in Central America to help people be able to stay where they live, presumably where they would like to be able to live safely, but they can't.So how do you see how this is playing out in Europe, how this is playing out in the United States, and how it impacts our politics really across the globe?",

She is a right- wing politician, and she is really taking some of the ideas from the left, which is to use aid money to invest in African countries, to try to improve those, in the same way as America's trying to do with Central America. If you look at the language, you mention it when you came to, me she's really emphasizing this is not charity, it is investment. I think the left will be impressed by, that the experts will be impressed by that, but what she is trying to convince is the right that this is not charity. We are not just giving money away as a left-wing policy. It is actually investment in the future. I think what will be interesting in her case is whether she can convince the right that investing in Africa is the resolution, and maybe the American right could take lessons from that.

But, of course, the devil is always in the detail with these. What will happen as the storm reaches the coast. I will try to highlight that here. Here's a storm developing across the nation, midsection, a broad look at how the evolution of the storm will take place through Sunday. Remember, this is a Saturday night into Sunday morning timeframe. Timing it out for your home. The nation's capital, you will get your first bout of winter mix, probably mid-morning on Saturday. Then we will get some of our heaviest precipitation along the coastal areas, Philadelphia to New York, mainly rain for this particular system, especially along long island. Boston, you should see mainly snow, especially as you mercury way away from the city center. This is interesting, very telling as well, Weather Prediction Center has a marginal risk of excessive rainfall, notice, that includes New York, Philadelphia, and the nation's capital. So we do believe this will be a majority rain event for the I-95 corridor, but it will be a tight gradient oil changes to snow, probably just west of I-95. And you can see that sharp cut off right here, I will draw that, line notice, that is what makes this forecast so difficult unexciting at the same time. Long Island, you can see Delaware all the way to Baltimore, Washington, don't get me wrong, we still could break that snow drop. Remember, we need one inch of snow on the ground to break that near 700-day snow drop, and we cannot forget the potential of icing across the Carolinas for the system of well, that will be very impactful.
