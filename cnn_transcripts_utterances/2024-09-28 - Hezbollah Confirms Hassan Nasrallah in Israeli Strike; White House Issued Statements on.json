      "sentences": "I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. I'm in for Fredricka Whitfield. I want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. We're continuing to follow major breaking news out of the Middle East.Right now, Israel Defense Forces are warning people across Lebanon to stay away from what they described as Hezbollah facilities. The IDF continuing to launch what they call targeted strikes against the Iran- backed paramilitary group. Our CNN teams are witnessing one of those strikes and they did so earlier today following what was a punishing overnight barrage in the Lebanese capital city of Beirut. This latest strike happening just hours after Hezbollah confirmed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed by an Israeli attack on Friday. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issuing a statement saying that Israel will continue its policies. And he also says he gave the order to assassinate Nasrallah to ensure he could not rebuild the terror group, was referring to Nasrallah. Earlier, I spoke with an IDF spokesperson about what Nasrallah's death potentially could mean for a potential conflict with Iran. Listen to his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESMAN: I would suggest that Iran look very closely how we've dealt with Hamas, the leadership of Hamas, and how in the last week and a half, we've effectively decapitated Hezbollah from its senior leadership all the way down to the operational and tactical staff. There is a lot to lose here. I don't think anybody is interested in a further escalation. a broader war. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris putting out their own statements just a short time ago, saying the death of Nasrallah is what they called justice for his many victims. Meantime, there are growing fears right now that this conflict could spiral into an all-out war in the region. The U.S. State Department is now ordering all non-emergency personnel at the U.S. embassy in Beirut and their families to immediately leave Lebanon. CNN's Ben Wedeman is joining us from Beirut right now. We also have CNN's Kevin Liptak, who's here in Washington. Ben, let me start with you. What's happening on the ground where you are in Beirut right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly President Biden, who is at his home in Delaware today, is receiving continual updates on this. And I think the updates are all with an eye towards whether or not this portends a wider regional conflict, whether or not things will escalate and American officials are watching very closely to see how Hezbollah response, of course, but also how Iran could potentially respond to this action.And we did hear from President Biden in a statement who said that Hassan Nasrallah's death certainly was a measure of justice for his victims, including he noted a number of Americans and he said that Nasrallah and the terror group that he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. And then the president goes on to say that ultimately our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. The president says that it's time for these deals to close, for these threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability. And so you do see the president striking something of a balance in that statement. Certainly no one in the White House is shedding any tears for Nasrallah. And you heard the Vice President Kamala Harris saying that he had American blood on his hands. But at the same time, this action came as President Biden was working to lower the temperatures across the Israel-Lebanon border. And you'll remember, Wolf, just earlier this week, President Biden trying to negotiate a 21-day ceasefire. The U.S. had called it a breakthrough statement when the United States and France came up with this plan that it thought that Israel was on board with. The next morning the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to brush that off, really infuriating American officials. And then by Friday, this operation in Beirut was underway. President Biden was very quick to say that he was not involved, that he had no forewarning. And I think that shows you just how fraught and precarious the U.S. views the situation right now in the Middle East and certainly President Biden, although he says he's working to deescalate, I think there are a lot of people certainly in the region, in Arab capitals, but also some Democrats in the United States who say that he simply hasn't done enough to apply enough pressure on Israel to bring the temperatures down. So President Biden certainly caught in something of a bind here, but I think the ultimate goal, right now is to bring these tensions down. But the U.S. at this point really can't say what's going to happen next.",

When you have Benny Gantz talking positively about a ground op, I think you begin to see that there is no opposition in Israel.There's a lot of loss of confidence in the prime minister, clearly according to the public opinion polls, but his numbers and his political viability his security here seems to be intact. He cares less about the number 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and much more about the number 64, which is the number of seats in his coalition, and frankly, Wolf, Knesset is out a recess until the end of October, that means that Mr. Netanyahu will be in a prime position to see for himself who wins in November 5th and he'll adjust or won't adjust his tactics accordingly. Elections may be in 2025, Wolf, but not scheduled until 2026. His government, hard as it may seem, the most extreme right-wing in Israel's history. Could even go to term.",

Not interested in a ceasefire in Lebanon either.Look, I think, yes, there's a danger, Wolf, that the U.S.-Israeli relationship, the value affinity, the coincidence of interest, a strong basis of domestic support that has made it such an extraordinary and resilient, I think these three elements frankly are fraught, but frankly, Wolf, and you know this far better than I, what, I may not get the math right here. Are there 45 to 50 days before one of the most consequential elections in modern American history? I don't think by the looks in that statement that the president issued, no remorse certainly and no remorse required or needed for Hassan Nasrallah. But it didn't seem -- there was no criticism of Israel. There was no real call -- I've written these talking points before -- for both parties to restrain themselves. Yes. The president reaffirmed the importance of a diplomatic off-ramp. But I'm not sure until Hezbollah makes its next move backed by Iran or not that the administration is in a position to do much.",

And of course, for viewers to understand the West Bank is absolute majority Arab population. Mitzpe Hagit is what's known as a settlement. So it's Israelis who live there, but it's hard to imagine Hezbollah deciding to target a tiny little village of Israel in the midst of a wide swath of Arab population because of the risk of hitting the Arab population. So this just doesn't sort of seem to make sense. But of course there's probably a lot more to learn about this. But that's the strike that has happened this evening. Now there is social media video from that village. We have heard from Magen David Adom, the medical rescue service. They say that they've been to three locations in this tiny village, in this tiny settlement, and they say that they have not seen any casualties there yet.

The threats were current and real, and that's why the prime minister took the decision to send a strike to kill Nasrallah.And he said that this is an example to show Israel's enemies in the region that anyone that tries to harm Israel from this region or beyond, Israel can reach them. So this is a very clear message from the prime minister, and he said that all of this has been done to allow Israeli citizens, those 60,000 or more than evacuated their homes on the 8th of October last year from the border area in the north of Israel to allow them to go back to their homes. Of course, we're also looking at the situation in the north there, having heard from the defense minister in the past couple of hours saying that he's had a review with his chief of staff of the IDF and with intelligence chiefs about the situation on the ground and the expansion, the possible expansion of the IDF's operations along the border.
