I'm Rosemary Church.It is 9:00 a.m. in Gaza where Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend their temporary truce for another day. The news came just minutes before the six day pause in fighting was set to expire. Israel says it agreed to extend the deal in light of mediator's efforts to continue the process of releasing hostages. And we've now learned that Israel has received a list of people to be released in the day ahead. A total of 16 hostages were set free by Hamas on Wednesday, including 10 Israelis under the terms of the truce, one with dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. Four Thai nationals and two Russian Israeli women were released under separate deals. Israel released 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons as part of its agreement with Hamas. Many of them were in administrative detention and never charged. Well, CNN's Scott McLean is following developments. He joins us now live from Istanbul. Good to see you, Scott. So, two hours ago, we got word the temporary truce would be extended by one day. What more are you learning about this?",

      "sentences": "You know, Rosemary yesterday at this time when we spoke, it seemed like all of the signs were indicating that this truce would be extended with relatively little resistance.In fact, Qatar had -- who's mediating all of this had said that it was very optimistic that the truce would be extended for at least another day. But of course, nothing has come easy in all of this. And the hours before this began, both sides were saber rattling, Israeli politicians were making clear that the war would restart if a deal was not agreed. You also had Hamas telling its fighters to be combat ready, unless it got official word that there was an agreement by the deadline. And of course, we know that it came right up to the wire. It was only minutes before that deadline, that we got word that a truce had been agreed, or an extension of this truce had been agreed. Now, the deal should have the same terms that we have seen for the last six days. So, broadly speaking, it involves humanitarian aid going in, 10 hostages, women and children coming out, 30 Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails. But those are not precisely the terms that Hamas was offering to extend this, they had offered seven Israeli women and children and three bodies of women and children that had been killed in the fighting. That was not good enough for Israel, we understand from diplomatic sources close to the discussions that Hamas then came back offering those same seven Israeli women and children and three elderly people, presumably men. And in all of this, it appears that Hamas was the first one to blink. Last hour or two hours ago, just after this deal was announced, a senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev was on CNN and he made abundantly clear that his country will not play games, listen.

Beyond that, we will be talking about civilian men, or about Israeli soldiers, some of whom we know are female. It's not clear how many are female, though.And so, yes, Hamas has turned over this list of 10 people to be released today, women and children. But what happens 24 hours from now is not clear, because it seems like Hamas is coming up empty handed perhaps in the women and children that it is willing to hand over. And if this war does continue, Israel has made abundantly clear, it has telegraphed its intentions to go into southern Gaza. This is despite the fact that Israel has previously said that it intends to make safe zones. Because right now in Gaza, if the fighting were to resume, there would be few, if any of those and this is despite the fact that the Israelis have been getting pressure from the Americans to not continue with the same kind of heavy bombardment that we saw in northern Gaza in the first few weeks of this war, but to take a more cautious, careful approach, Rosemary.",

And so, setting that as a goal means that all Hamas needs to do in order to claim victory is survive. And so they'll likely be focused on that.

Finally, there was a commitment at the last meeting in Egypt for a loss and damage fund for those countries that had the least to do with climate change, but had been affected by it the most, there needs to be concrete action as well. Numbers need to be put on the table for how these poorer countries will be financed by the richer ones to deal with the impact of the climate crisis. These are just three issues.

And as the refugee crisis kind of calmed down and became easier, we started taking humanitarian aid to Kharkiv. And we actually met an elderly woman in Kharkiv last -- in the Kharkiv region, in a village outside Kharkiv. Last September, when we are handing out aid, (inaudible) thanks for the aid but it's not going to do me much good if I die of cold in the winter because I have no windows.And we thought that she probably made quite a good point. And so said that we would bring her windows instead. And from then, it just sort of -- kind of blew up that we started -- she told her neighbors, and her neighbors told their friends and families in other villages. And we just started getting more and more requests, and quite quickly, pivoted to only doing home repairs because we realized that it was what people seem to need the most. It was an area which wasn't covered. You have big organizations who were doing food packages for these areas. But no one was doing home repairs.",

It's repairing of the whole community, and so many of the problems in these communities now come from poverty. And so, trying to kind of help stimulate these economies to enable the local village shop to reopen, to help people stop dependent on humanitarian air, which will at some point will stop, is going to be at the core of what we do. So yeah, buying all products as locally as possible, we are able to get pretty much everything within the Kharkiv region which is amazing.And also employing local people in each village to do the rebuilding. And so, part of that is, as I said to get money into the economy, but it's also to make sure let these communities are at the center of their own rebuilding process. So that it isn't just something of international organizations coming in and dictating how people in Ukraine should live. These people know -- most of these people built their homes themselves to begin with. And so, they know how to repair them. They just need to be given the tools to do so, and that is where we come in.",
