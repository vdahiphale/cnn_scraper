We'll go live to Paris among the protests. Then we're learning much more about the man at the center of a massive U.S. security breach, as the 21-year-old appears in court. We'll have those details coming up. Plus, U.S. President Joe Biden heads to the west of Ireland on his final day of tour. Well, the highest constitutional authority in France has decided President Emmanuel Macron's pension reforms are valid. This means the government's plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 can soon officially become law. Riot police are outside the constitutional court council, the legislation is highly unpopular, leading to strikes all over the country for many months and at times violence. Well, in Paris, protesters have gathered outside city hall, and this, of course, is a big win for Mr. Macron, who had promised these reforms during his presidential campaign. But it comes at a great political cost. The government had to force these reforms through parliament because they did not have enough votes, and his approval rating is almost at a record low. Well, our senior international correspondent Frederik Pleitgen, and reporter Nada Bashir are in Paris for us tonight. Good to have you both with us. I want to start with you first, Fred, so France's top court has given this legislation the green light essentially to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. What is the reaction where you are? How many protesters are still on the streets, months, after we've seen months and months of these protests?",

We understand that they're trying to go to a different location. But as you can see behind me, and we'll show that a little bit, the police here in Paris and in all of France certainly aren't taking any chances. They've actually blockaded. This is a bridge across the river sand. And if you pan a little bit more there to the right, you can see that the second bridge here, they've done exactly the same thing. So the police certainly out here in full force and in full riot gear, as they have been throughout the past couple of days, and that's because there is so much anger that has been unloading here on the streets of Paris, and of course, so many other towns in France as well. And we were among those protesters who had gathered in front of City Hall who are now, we understand, sort of going around the city. And a lot of them had said look, this is not the end of the line. They are going to continue to fight against this pension reform. They want to make sure or they want to try and ensure that it gets repealed. Despite the fact that as you say, we had this big win for Emmanuel Macron today as the Constitutional Council has said that the main provisions of that draft law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 is indeed constitutional. I want to listen in to what some of the protesters who we spoke to had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're saying they felt that this ruling today by the Constitutional Council is something that disrespects the population. Obviously, some of the people or most of the people who are in the constitutional council are political appointees, some of them appointed by Emmanuel Macron himself. And so, a lot of people   felt that this ruling was something that was never going to fully go in their favor. So the people here are saying that they are going to keep coming out. They do believe that they can still make a change. However, it does need to be pointed out that of course, this is a big victory for Emmanuel Macron. You know, one of the things, Lynda, that we have been seeing over the past couple of weeks is the numbers have been getting fewer, have been dwindling a little bit among those who are going out the street and protesting against this draft.",

They say that President Emmanuel Macron has extended that invitation to theunion heads in order to hold discussions of course, he has already expressed his will to sign this new legislation into law over the weekend. But of course, as we've heard from the unions and as Fred was mentioning there, there has been discontinue desire by the unions and other protests to keep this protest movement going. They do not accept that this legislation is going to be signed into law. And in fact, we've heard from one of the heads of one of the larger unions, and one of the larger coalition of unions here in France saying, they will not accept that invitation to meet with Macron next week unless those discussions are focused on not putting that legislation into law. Now, of course, this has been a key focus for the government, for Emmanuel Macron for weeks. And now, this is a significant win for President Emmanuel Macron. But we have seen these protests that have lasted for 12 weeks, and while those numbers have certainly dwindled as Fred was saying, there's still a significant sign of anger that we have seen from the protest movement and from the unions, particularly of course, with regard to the way in which this legislation was pushed through. And this was actually mentioned and referenced by the constitutional council, acknowledging that the government bypassed the lower house of parliament, using executive powers measures reserved for budgetary legislation in order to push this legislation through without a final vote, and that has been a source of real anger for many of these protesters who feel that this has undermined the legislative and democratic processes here in France. So there could well be further demonstrations. We've already heard from the unions saying that they will continue to protest this legislation in some form or other, whether or not that means people actually taken to the streets striking as we have seen over the last 12 rounds of protests or not, that remains to be seen. But certainly, there is a significant amount of frustration, and that will have an impact on President Macron's popularity here in France, Lynda?",

And I do want to ask Fred, if you're still with me, Fred, about this uproar over this, given that President Emmanuel Macron did campaign on this during the last election. He made it clear that he would raise the retirement age, and he was re- elected. Why then there're so many people out on the streets protesting this when he forecasted this would happen?",

And that you see the people who are marching through the streets who are still protesting and who say, well, they will still protest that there are people of all ages. There's a lot of younger people who also joined this protests as well. And I do think that there's two sides to all this. First of all, you're absolute, Emmanuel Macron has always said that he wants to raise the pension age, he wants to push that through, and he was indeed elected again. However, a lot of the population here in this country is against this reform. In fact, two-thirds are against it, but I think right now, if you look at the focus of these protests, yes, they are still on the pension reform, but it's about a lot more than that. And a lot of that is the way that Emmanuel Macron has pushed this bill through using those executive powers, essentially bypassing large parts of the legislative process, certainly bypassing a real vote in the parliament of this country. That is something that has not sat well, not just with people who are closer to retirement age for whom this is something that's a very real prospect very soon in their lives, but also for younger people as well, who simply feel that the democratic process in this country has been severely damaged by this. And it was quite interesting because when we were at City Hall, the big protest was still going on there as well. A lot of the signs that we saw there, a lot of the chants that we heard there from the people who were on that square, they were all about the fact that democracy has been damaged here in this country. There were signs that said that the real democracy lies on the street, lies with the people. And that's why so many of the folks that we spoke to also told us that despite the fact that you have this ruling now from the constitutional council, they do not see that as a reflection of what people here in this country really feel, and that's why so many of them are still out in the streets, and that's why so many of them are saying that even after this ruling, they will continue to go out on the streets. And it's quite interesting that when you see these pictures of the folks who are still marching right now or the folks who marched yesterday, and the fact that despite the fact that you have these dwindling numbers over the past couple of weeks, yesterday, we still had nearly 400,000 people on the streets of various places in France. It certainly does show that there is a great deal of discontent.",

      "sentences": "Right, let's first start with the charges there, Lynda. I mean, you outlined some of it there, but duringthis initial court appearance, and during an initial court appearance, this is where a defendant is read the charges, asked if they understand the charges, and here's what was read in court. Jack Teixeira now faces two federal counts, the first one being unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information, that's the first one. The second one being unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material. Now, at that point, the judge overseeing the proceeding asked the defendant if he understood the charges that he's facing, Jack Teixeira simply said yes. There's a moment -- there's a portion of the courtroom that's set aside for family members, a bench, and at that point you could see Teixeira's mother and what we believe to be his grandmother, they were sitting there, they were praying during the court proceeding, also crying during the proceeding, and when it was over, his father, who was sitting there as well simply shouted out and said, love you, Jack! At that point, Teixeira did not turn around, but simply said you too, dad. Now, as his family exited the court, they were surrounded by reporters and cameramen, reporters, including myself, and repeatedly asked his parents if they had any sort of comment about what it just had happened with their son and what he's accused of, they did not answer any of our questions. Still, a lot of questions, though, about why someone with this type of low- rank in the Air National Guard had access to classified documents, and still even more questions in the Intelligence community about what sort of effect this is eventually going to have. President Biden weighed in on this. And I want to read you just part of what he said. \"While we are still determining the validity of those documents, I've directed our military and Intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information, and our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies.\" So that gives you a sense that the president weighing in on this, just how serious this classified document leak is to the Intelligence community.",

The special forces as they would call them in the West. So that is significant because these guys are very highly trained. There aren't as many of them, and it apparently happened that as you talked about some of those numbers, very high numbers, 90 percent to 95 percent decimated in some of these fights. It's because they pushed these troops, which are really meant for specific operations, into the fight very early because things didn't go as they had planned. So that's I think the most significant thing of this is how long it's going to take to rebuild and replenish these forces. They're valuable to Russia, and using them is a real problem.",

But it's the sheer volume of children on these particular tracks that does indeed shock you. As you said, many of them very young, some of them ill. We saw one child clearly having a respiratory illness that meant his father could only try and carry him for a number of days. He made a miraculous recovery, but for 24 hours, it looked very grim for him. Wilson(ph), who you just saw in that clip there as well separate from his parents, yes, like many parents, they struggled to carry their own children and hired porters to try and escalate the sort of get up the hardest parts of the route, particularly one of the muddier hills up towards the Panamanian border, but were separated from their child. They were reunited a couple of days later. That was a wonderful thing to be, assuredly able to witness another child. We saw two basically epitomizing the real struggle parents are facing on this. A mother with her 12-year-old disabled daughter who had epileptic convulsions occasionally, really realizing she had to leave Venezuela because she couldn't get the medicine she said she needed there to look after her child unless she traveled into neighboring Colombia, where it was affordable and available. And so for her, that the rest of the Darien Gap, she said presented was possibly less than they faced daily with the struggles for medicine in their native country. So a lot of parental problems here, and abidingly, you feel hearing their struggles that for those parents staying where they were was a greater issue for their children, and a greater problem for their future lives than undertaking this week-long risk to get through the Darien Gap, and then try and find a better life up in the United States.

And subsequently, parliamentary elections were held approximately one month after his election, and he lost those elections, he didn't get -- je didn't gain a majority in parliament.

And in terms of many years at 62, other countries, the retirement age is 66, 67. Surely as a population ages and life expectancy increases, it makes sense that the retirement age is going to increase, right? It's hard to continually financially support an aging population. And it's interesting seeing so many young people out protesting this particular reform, when within their lifetime, there probably will be another proposal to increase the retirement age once more. What's your take on that?",

And as is shown by the current episode, the current political episodes, is that each time we're attacked, we fight with all means necessary. And we fight with the utmost energy to defend our rights. Hence, our adversaries having perhaps more difficulties than in other countries to implement at the same pace, at least, their attacks. They still managed to do it, but at a slower pace, because they face much fiercer resistance. But that being said, factually, actually, there are countries even in the developed industrialized world that actually have lower retirement ages than in France. For example, on the top of my head, for example, say China, for example, China has lower retirement ages. And it's actually quite funny, because in China, the political and economical circles, they keep saying we must also raise the retirement age in order to align ourselves with countries like France, because we have like a high retirement age. So wherever we are in the world, the political and economical decision makers will always say we must align to either our neighbors and another country where the rights are lower, and we have worse conditions and terms and conditions. What we are saying, as organized labor, is that given the fact that our society is much wealthier than it was 70, 58 years ago, there is lots of more wealth, lot of -- lots more money, there's enough wealth to finance lower pensions, better public services, better wages, better everything. The thing is that there's more and more money, and yet our terms and conditions are getting worse by the year, every year. So there's something that doesn't add up in the way how the society works. And that's not true only in France. That's true all across the world. And that's also part of the factors that are fueling this anger across France right now.",

Mr. Biden has traced his Irish family tree back to the late 1700's. He will also give a speech outside a cathedral with ties to his ancestors. Well, earlier, he toured the Knock Shrine, a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan joins us now from Ballina, Ireland. Good to see you, Donnie. It really seems like President Biden has relished being in Ireland, back on this trip to his ancestral home. Give us a sense of the feeling there. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, he really seems to be having a very good time. As we know, there are a lot of issues waiting for him when he gets back to the United States tomorrow, not least the leak of that intelligence information online. But here, he seems to be having a great time. And here about now tonight, there are thousands of people all across the River Moy, which is right behind our camera, thousands of people along the keys waiting for Biden to speak here in the next few hours. Last night, when he spoke -- addressed the Irish parliament, he said chances are I'm a little bit of Gaelic and he said \"Ta me sa bhaile,\" which is Gaelic for I'm at home. And he also joked that he wish he could spend a little longer here in Ireland, but he really seems to be having, you know, quite the vacation here. He brought his son and his sister. Where we are standing right now is where his great, great, great grandfather immigrated from in the mid 19th century. He's visited here twice before, but this is his first time here as president and obviously first time to have an event like this.",

Our Chief ClimateCorrespondent Bill Weir shows us how a dried up Lake has turned into an inland ocean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): In California's Central Valley, farmers have spent much of the last 20 years praying for rain. But then came this winter of relentless rivers in the sky, enough to bring a long dead lake back to life drowned over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop. It is mind-blowing to realize that if you'd stood here for the last couple of generations, you'd be watching the sunset over dusty fields of cotton, or alfalfa, or pistachio trees. And now, it is waterfront property. I had no idea Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi, but it was dammed, and dyked, and drained to build a $2 billion agriculture industry. And now it's back. It's proof that water never forgets. And this may just be the beginning because behind those clouds over there, the Sierra Nevadas, are so packed with snow to it. 260 percent above normal, and sooner or later, that's going to melt, which is only going to make this flooding worse and last longer.
