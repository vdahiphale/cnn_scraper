If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is spending the day with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Zelenskyy left Washington on Thursday night. He's expected to address Canada's Parliament later today. Rupert Murdoch stepping down as head of Fox and News Corp. Murdoch is handing over control of his media empire to his eldest son Lachlan. Now, new polling shows a close contest to the to be the runner up behind Donald Trump in the U.S. Republican presidential race. That suggests a sizable share of likely Republican voters are open to changing their minds about their preferred candidate. CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: With the second Republican presidential debate now on the horizon scheduled for next week, the candidates are scrambling to try and distinguish themselves from one another. This really has effectively become a race for second place. Let's take a look at a couple new state by state polls that have just been released. In Iowa, for example, which starts off the nominating process next January. Of course, former President Donald Trump holding a commanding lead in Iowa. But look at Nikki Haley. She has increased her standing there in recent weeks, and now this truly is a race for second place as Governor Ron DeSantis from Florida has fallen. In South Carolina, the same thing. Former President Donald Trump holding a commanding lead in this race. But Nikki Haley is in second place there. Her home state, of course. But it is in New Hampshire, where this race for second place truly is fascinating. Of course, the former president not quite as strong there, but there is essentially a four-way tie for second place. But on Thursday in New Hampshire, Nikki Haley was asked by a voter to distinguish herself from Donald Trump. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He was the right president at the right time. He was thin-skinned and easily distracted. He didn't do anything on fiscal policy and really spent a lot of money and we're all paying the price for it. He used to be good on foreign policy and now he has started to walk it back and get weak in the knees when it comes to Ukraine.",

Distinguishing themselves from the former president without alienating some of his supporters. But one of the central reasons that Nikki Haley is climbing is because she is finding favor among moderate voters. Those voters who want to turn the page from Trump. So there is no doubt this race is starting to feel slightly different in the early voting states, but again, that debate next week, next Wednesday in California, certainly an inflection point in this race.Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington.

He says the crossings have also taken an economic toll on the community because a bridge connecting the town to Mexico had to be closed due to the influx.

The evidence revealed in these commercial satellite images, obtained exclusively by CNN. These are the Russian, Chinese and American nuclear testing.
