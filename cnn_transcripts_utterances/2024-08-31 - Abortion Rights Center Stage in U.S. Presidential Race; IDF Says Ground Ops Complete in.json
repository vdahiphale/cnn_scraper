Donald Trump is weighing in on the abortion initiative that will be on his home state's ballot in November.And Kamala Harris has issued a strong response to Trump's comments. It comes just one day after her sit-down interview with CNN's Dana Bash. Well, we start with Trump's saying he'll vote no on a Florida constitutional amendment that would allow abortions in that state after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Florida law currently bans abortions after six weeks. The amendment will be on the ballot there in November. It's another reversal for Trump, who has previously said he's against a six-week ban. CNN's Steve Contorno has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE CONTORNO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Former president Donald Trump on Friday, saying for the first time that he intends to vote against a referendum that would expand abortion access in his home state of Florida. Trump's remarks come just 24 hours after he was asked the same question and his answer ignited a firestorm among anti-abortion activists who were concerned that he might actually vote for the referendum. Well, Trump, on Friday, sought to clarify those remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So that's a massive numerical challenge in and of itself. And he says, look, we're going to have clinics and our big health centers, our smaller clinics. We're going to have mobile clinics. We're going have teams out in the field, 3,000 people on the ground setting up vaccination spots in the middle of some of the sort of the tent cities and places like that. So they're going to have a lot of people out there to do it. But there are many, many challenges here. And one of those is actually needing to get 90 percent of those 640,000 children vaccinated. And they don't really have a solid number. He says he fears, sadly, many of those children may be under the rubble. So getting the right number of children vaccinated is also a challenge.

But described himself as a pro choice individual when he ran for the presidency.He realized that within the Republican Party overturning Roe v. Wade was a major motivating force, particularly for evangelical Christian voters. And Trump admitted two, appointing judges to overturn Roe. And he was successful in doing that. Overturning Roe was a very unifying message to the Republican Party. But once you overturn Roe, then you have to decide what replaces Roe. And that is decided at the state level. OK, that's been Trump's line. But Trump lives in a state. He happens to live in a state that now has an amendment about changing the abortion laws of that state. And Trump has a vote on that referendum. And that is Trump's problem now, is that he is being pinned down by having to make a state-level decision about abortion rights. Now Amendment IV, I think is particularly tricky for Trump, because Florida has this ban after six weeks, which Trump has said, he's on the record he thinks that's too short. This amendment would push abortion rights up to the point of viability or possibly later, based on consultation with a doctor about the woman's health. Now from a Republican standpoint, that is -- that's too far. But also Trump doesn't like the six-week ban. So he's kind of caught in between. I think Trump might be comfortable with where, say, John Roberts had landed in the Dobbs decision, which was accept the 15 week limit. But that's not on the ballot.

During the primary, that's not unusual for a candidate to do that in a primary contest, is to -- is to hug to the base but then tack to the center in the general election.

      "sentences": "Well, Dr. Mark Chavez is, according to his lawyer, full of remorse and really eager to do whatever he can to make the best of a terrible situation, which ended, of course, with Matthew Perry, the much beloved \"Friends\" actor, dead due to ketamine.He died in his hot tub at his home here in Los Angeles. Now Chavez certainly appears to be doing all that he can to cooperate. He was asked to submit his passport, to surrender his passport today. He had it in his back pocket. Now I asked Chavez's lawyer, is he willing, is he going to testify in court against the other people who've been in charged in Perry's death? He would not answer that question. But Chavez is planning to put a guilty plea in. He waived his right to a grand jury indictment. It certainly appears he is cooperating. What he is alleged to have done, this other doctor, Salvador Plasencia, allegedly called Chavez -- they were friends -- and said, listen, let's get some ketamine. We've got Matthew Perry. He wants the drug. And Plasencia said, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay?\" What allegedly happened is Chavez, Dr. Chavez, bought the drug from a wholesaler by falsifying documents, paid 12 bucks a vial for it and the pair of them charged Matthew Perry $2,000 a vial for the drug. Now that other doctor, Salvador Plasencia, and a woman called the Ketamine Queen, who was a street-level dealer allegedly, who was also supplying Perry, they are due in court next week -- Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.
