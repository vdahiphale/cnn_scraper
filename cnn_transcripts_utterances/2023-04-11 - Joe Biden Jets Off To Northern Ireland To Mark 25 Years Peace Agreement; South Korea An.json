Then South Korea and Egypt, the latest countries to react to the massive leak of U.S. Intel documents. And then Taiwan's foreign minister tells CNN that China is threatening war, but the island is ready for anything. Well, all those stories in just a moment. We'll begin in the United States with a closer look at two significant issues, abortion and guns. Apparently causing the deepest cultural as well as political rifts. First, we'll look at how they are affecting Americans' everyday lives. Then we'll ask CNN's Stephen Collinson what is driving these divides. To start off with, let's get the latest on the 146, let just that sink in, 146 U.S. mass shootings so far this year. And we are learning more about the bank employee who opened fire during a staff meeting, killing five people and seriously wounding eight others in Louisville, Kentucky. The 25-year-old shooter live-streamed Monday's entire event on Instagram. Police say the video shows the gunman firing his AR-15 style weapon inside the bank for about a minute. Officers were on the scene about 90 seconds later. A dispatcher says the shooter alerted his friends to the attack. Have a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

Look, we heard -- I thinkit's fair to say, John, some very chilling details from officials in Kentucky in the last what? An hour and a half or so by the investigation. Help us then piece together how this all unfolded, how the officials say this unfolded here? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELIGENCE ANALYST:  Well, what we learned today from the press briefing and some of the other fragments that have been coming together overnight is that Connor Sturgeon purchased this weapon seven days ago legally from a local gun store, and then began planning what he was going to do at the bank where he had been employed for more than a year as a full-time employee and where he had intern before. And he goes into the bank live-streaming onto the Instagram platform, opens fire on senior staff members in the middle of a meeting in a conference room. There were other people on the other end of that conference watching on Zoom as he opened fire, who witnessed this literally virtually. And then goes on back to the lobby of the building, the bank building, where he stays basically for about a minute and a half until police arrive. That 9-1-1 call refers to him texting a friend, saying he's going to kill everybody in the bank and is feeling suicidal. Waiting in the lobby, he opens fire on police who returned fire, this is, I guess a classic example of what today they call suicide by cop. Isa.",

And something we've seen replicated by other shooters. They call the phenomenon dying lie. Many of these shooters expect not to survive their own actions, but they want to broadcast it so that their evil deeds will live in perpetuity on the internet. But there's more to it than that. The psychological effect is most of these people feel undervalued, ignored, insecure. This is their way of writing the end of their life story in a movie version, to show that they were this dominant, powerful force and live-streaming it is a way to make sure that it gets out, at least, to some people even before authorities or social media can stop it.",

Well, this shooting in Kentucky is sadly yet another reminder, of course, of thegun violence epidemic that's sweeping across the United States. And now, a really sobering new survey shows that most families in America have been affected by a gun-related incident. Have a look at this. Fifty four percent of U.S. adults have either personally experienced or had a family member experience gun violence. That is according to research by Kaiser Family Foundation. And nearly one in five adults had a family member killed by a gun. One in five. These are just some of the staggering statistics here. I want to bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. And Sanjay, this is pretty hard to -- for us to wrap our heads around.

That wasthe numbers in the last year that we had good data for. About half homicides and half suicides. I mean, these are atrocious numbers. For children and teenagers, it is the leading cause of death in the United States. More so than car accidents. And I think the question has been, and I think what the survey was all about is trying to figure out how much of it is a sort of -- what's a psyche really that is here in the United States over gun violence Some of those numbers you mentioned already in terms of just how pervasive this is, 17 percent of people have seen someone get shot, Isa, I mean, almost one in five people, same percentage roughly, have a family member has been killed by a gun, either homicide or suicide. Twenty one percent people have been threatened with a gun as well. That's according to the survey. How often do people then fear gun violence in the United States among adults? Forty percent sometimes, 10 percent almost every day, 8 percent every day, you get a sense of just how much people are thinking about that. The 50,000 number, 49,000 people dying of gun violence, that number jumped over 20 percent over the past few years. So, we're seeing more of it, and it's taking an increasingly greater toll, Isa.",

And just like you said, more than a third, they found initially were not being stored in a way where the gun was not loaded. You're not supposed to store a weapon loaded like this. Forty four percent of the time, it wasn't even locked up, and 52 percent of the time, it was stored in the same location as ammunition. All of these things violates best safety practices when it comes to having guns in the household.

And a lot of my job is just reassuring and making sure people know that this care is available, and it's available including this medication currently. But I think it shows the level of confusion that exists across the country right now. We're already in abortion crisis where people don't know if they can access healthcare in the state, in the communities that they live, let alone what happens when we change this medication.

This is a long- term campaign. Democrats have been, I think you could say complacent. They didn't use this as a sort of motivating factor for their voters for many years, and the Republican majority in the Supreme Court kind of crept up on them, many people thought, well, you know, this will be an extreme right-wing Supreme Court, but they will never do something as -- you know, to overturn Roe v.

Massive majorities of your vote are going to be among Americans in say a rural area of Kentucky who want the right to have guns, they want to have assault rifles, and they don't think anyone should stop them from having them. Notwithstanding, there's been sequence of mass shootings. So, if you're a politician, you're not going to get elected as a Republican if you are calling for severe restrictions on gun laws. That's just a fact. And then when you come to Washington, you know, that motivates Republicans.

CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is in Belfast ahead of the visit and joins us now with more. So, Donie -- I mean, good to see you, 25 years on, I think it's fair to say, the peace has been somewhat uneasy. What does this visit then mean for President Biden and for the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, indeed, Isa, he'll arrive here in Belfast in the next two hours or so, and he'll be meeting with leaders here tomorrow as well as delivering a speech as you mentioned on the 25- year anniversary of that -- quite uneasy speech. But then after that, tomorrow, he heads south to the Republic of Ireland, really where he is going to meet a lot of his cousins, a lot of his distant relatives and we met some of them. Have a listen.
