Now, I co-host a morning show here on CNN that starts in like ten minutes. So, let's get right to what America is talking about. Phoning his friends, tonight Donald Trump is dialing for a vote. He wants Senators to support Matt Gaetz to confirm him as the next attorney general, even as they watch and listen to vivid accusations about what Gaetz allegedly did to women, pay for sex, and engage in sex with a minor.

Well, Donald Trump is now under 50 percent. And when you compare his margin in terms of percentage points against Kamala Harris to every single popular vote winner dating back the last 200 years, his victory isn't so hot to trot. Trump's rate's 44th out of 51. Dare I say, it's a little bit weak and quite a bit shallow. But if Donald Trump's victory was shallow, it's also a bit wide when talking about the electoral map because get this, Donald Trump compared to four years ago gained in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. No party has gained in so many places versus the prior election and presidential elections getting back all the way since Jimmy Carter's win back in 1976.

And to your point, he won every single swing state. So, whether he wins by 2.5, 2.6, whatever, this, a little bit of that, it doesn't matter. He won the popular vote.
