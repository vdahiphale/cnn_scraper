I have talked to a multiple sources who have received them. They are lawmakers, allies, club members. And I'm told by some source -- a source close to Trump that this is really his opportunity to take control of the narrative after we learn what those charges are. So far, he has painted this as a political hoax and a witch hunt. It will be interesting to see whether or not that changes once we learn what those charges are. But I am told by sources who spoke to Trump, members of his inner circle, that in between rounds of golf this weekend, Trump spent his time on the phone, texting, calling allies, and touting the political positive of this indictment. He went over poll numbers that showed him leading in a hypothetical head-to-head with Ron DeSantis. And he talked about those fundraising numbers. We know the campaign has said that they raised $5 million in the first 48 hours after that indictment was announced. We've also learned that Trump and his advisers are looking at ways to politically capitalize on this indictment. One of the things that they had been batting around was actually putting Trump's mug shot onto campaign merchandise, like shirts and mugs. That's something as sort of a rallying cry for his supporters. Now, obviously, as we know, we are still uncertain whether or not he will actually get a mug shot.

Basically just saying Alvin Bragg, the D.A., can disclose that there's an indictment. It will be unsealed on Tuesday. But this was really important moment, because we saw for the first time the case caption: \"People of the State of New York Against Donald J. Trump, Defendant.\" This is real. We also learned over the weekend that there will be at least one felony charge in this indictment. There better be, by the way. If this is just a bunch of misdemeanors, the D.A. is going to have some serious questions to answer. But here's what that could mean. It looks like some of the charges will relate to falsification of business records. The idea is they falsely log these payments as attorney's fees, but that would just be a misdemeanor, the less serious type of charge, with a one-year maximum. The dividing line between a misdemeanor and felony, by the way, is one year. If it's one year or less, it's a misdemeanor as the max. And if it's above one year, then it's a felony. How could you make this a felony? If they can tie those business records to some other crime, to some second crime. And the theory here is that second crime could be a campaign finance violation. If prosecutors charge and prove that, it's a Class E felony, the lowest level of felony in New York state, which has a maximum of four years. And finally, Don, we know from our reporting from John Miller and others here that the indictment is expected to have 34 counts. That's a lot.

You cannot charge a violation of a federal election law -- This is a presidential election -- under state law. And if they do that, by the way, they could knock out this, because that other crime is the federal election violation, leaving them with only misdemeanors. So that's going to be a really important argument. We also know, from listening to Trump's lawyers this weekend, they're going to argue there was no intent to defraud here, meaning in most business records cases, somebody takes a record, falsifies it, gives it to somebody else in order to steal money. That's not the case here. It's a little different scenario. They're going to argue that, as well. Trump's team is also going to argue statute of limitations, meaning you typically have five years from the time of felonies committed to charge it. Two years for a misdemeanor. Now we're beyond both of those time periods. However, they are going to be rescued here, because there's a -- prosecutors are going to be rescued, because there's a New York law that says you can pause that time period when someone's living continuously out of state. Trump has lived in the White House and Mar-a-Lago. And then finally, I am certain that Trump's team -- and they've more than signaled this -- is going to argue selective prosecution.

And, of course prolonging this lingering inflation that President Biden has been dealing with and the country has been dealing with. This production cut is expected to go into play in May. Could last until the end of the year, and Saudi Arabia is building this as a precautionary move to try and stabilize oil markets. But that's not how the White House sees this. And this is a statement from the National Security Council spokesperson, who says, quote, \"We don't think cuts are advisable at this moment, given market uncertainty, and we've made that clear. We will continue to work with all producers and consumers to ensure energy markets support economic growth and lower prices for American consumers.\" Now you'll recall that this follows a similar cut that OPEC did back in October of two million barrels per day. At the White House, the -- at the time, the White House reacted quite angrily, with President Biden vowing that there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia doing this and the OPEC group doing this, saying that it was intended to try and mitigate the economic consequences that Russia was facing as a result of its war in Ukraine. And this comes at a critical time. We've seen gas prices already begin to tick up over the last month by about 10 cents per gallon. We're currently sitting at about $3.51 per gallon. A year ago, that was $4.20 per gallon, though. So Don, we will see exactly what the effect will be on gas prices. It's hard to predict.

And we're in one of those areas where, unfortunately, a woman lost her life in the home, what used to be a home directly behind me.You can see just nothing left. In fact, some of the trees completely spiral -- spiraled around themselves. In the distance there, you can see this vehicle. Just the windows completely smashed out.

And we are only entering the peak of the season. I want you to listen to Jessie (ph) Wilson. She rode out this tornado as it ripped through her home. I want you to hear her harrowing account of what happened to her neighbors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
