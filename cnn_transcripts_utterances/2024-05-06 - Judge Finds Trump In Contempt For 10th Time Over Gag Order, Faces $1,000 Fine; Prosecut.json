We begin the hour, right now, day 12 in the Trump hush money trial. The judge's second contempt finding, against the former President, today, and his warning that a third could mean jail time. That and prosecutors calling two longtime Trump employees, as they try to show exactly how Michael Cohen was repaid, by Trump's trust and personal accounts in 2017, after he paid hush money to Stormy Daniels. Back with the panel. Joining us as well is Harry Litman, who was in court today. He's an L.A. Times Legal Affairs Columnist, host of the \"Talking Feds\" podcast, and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General. I'm wondering what you observed, as Judge Merchan warned Trump about potential jail time.",

And it's sensible in a way because with only $1,000 to work with for other violations, why should he diddle around. But he said, next time, that's it. And he really means it. His credibility would be on the line as well as the integrity of the judicial system. It was a dramatic moment.

But if there are two things, he gets into the minutiae of, it's anything public-facing, how he's going to be perceived in the press, and money. In my experience, press, if there was going to be something that went out under his name, or that became a story that he did? He was incredibly hands-on, incredibly engaged, wanted to direct narratives. I did not deal with him as much on the money side, but we would hear it from dealing with the campaign, and on the outside that he's notoriously a tightwad. He's not somebody who -- he does pay attention to how he's spending his money. So, I think that's where that kind of an argument falls a little bit flat. It's two areas that's just well-documented, that he pays attention to. But it's certainly what his side's going to argue. And it's not about argument.",

So, as far as I know, the Israeli forces are in the surroundings of the Rafah crossing. This was the aim of the operation that we saw tonight, to take over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, which is a strategic site that is really important for Hamas, not only because it's the border between Egypt and Gaza, but also because this, as we think, is a symbol for the fact that Hamas is still the ruling power in Gaza. And without the Rafah crossing, a lot of this image for the Palestinian population as a whole is being tarnished. And that's one of the goals of this operation, including also, to put more pressure on Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, to maybe move and be more flexible, in the hostage talks.",

And then, we understand that the talks between Egypt and Hamas were progressing, but in a way that the U.S. and Qatar, both of those are two other mediators, felt that Israel would not actually end up agreeing to those terms. So, they kind of took hold of that framework, I'm told. And when Burns went to Doha, he worked with the Qatari Prime Minister, to rework the language that was then handed over to Hamas. And that's what Hamas eventually responded to. Now, Anderson, as you've noted, Hamas is saying that they agreed to the framework. What we're told by U.S. officials, it's more that they responded, and they had a take of their own. And we've seen a document from Hamas, that is still going to have, or it still has significant gaps with Israel. The good news is that the talks are progressing, as Barak mentioned, they're going to be going on in Cairo. Israel is expected to send a team. Qatar is expected to send a team.

But here's the important part. I think one of the things that we're overlooking is the element that affects combat and warfare at both the tactical and the strategic level is time. And since the start of this war, time has been on the side of Hamas. It's a critical part of their strategy, along with their tunnels. And they've wrapped themselves around the Palestinians, so that anything that can help create more of a humanitarian crisis, or gives Israel a bad image, is something that they want to do. It isn't just their approach. It's their strategic objective. And we're seeing that today is as soon as, you know, first of all, when the talks were going on over the weekend, as you know, Hamas launched 15 missiles, at one of the crossing sites, and killed several Israeli soldiers. Israel walked away at that point and said, we can't continue to do this. Then today, they announced that all the Palestinians are shown dancing in the streets of Gaza. And Israel now is the bad person, because they're conducting a Rafah operation, which they said they were going to do, if they hadn't heard from Hamas about release of hostages. So, it's continuing to work against Israel, anytime there's a delay, when time is on Hamas' side, it is not on Israel's side, from a strategic perspective, because we're seeing the world increasingly turn against anything that Israel does.",
