Think about the common mafia case, right, where you've got one person who's a kind of ringleader, a puppeteer as you will. Everyone attached to that string involved in the entire theater really is going to be at issue here. The reason it is so important here is because normally, a prosecutor only has the jurisdiction in their own specific area. They have to be nearsighted for justice to prevail. RICO allows you to be broader because whatever you have engaged in, in criminal behavior, that really had an impact in my jurisdiction.

And in this case, it was something that was clearly written. It was a written plan to disrupt January 6th.

Prosecutors really cannot say and should not say anything beyond what they allege in the indictment. Of course, the indictment here was extraordinarily detailed, so she had plenty of room to talk there. But the D.A. was very much by the book. She essentially said, here's the names of the people we charge here.The charges, couple things that do jump out at me. Number one is, I believe the D.A. said that she's going to give everyone an opportunity until Friday at noon to voluntarily surrender. And what that means is that each of these defendants, 19 defendants, is going to have a chance to come in and walk into the courthouse. They'll have to arrange it in advance with the DA and staff and come in and do it the easy way. And presumably, if they don't meet that deadline, then the D.A. will have the option, if she so chooses, of sending somebody out to make an arrest. Now, of course, Donald Trump is going to present extenuate circumstances with his Secret Service detail. We'll see how she negotiates that. The other thing that I think was really interesting, and I think it was Sara Murray, our colleague, who asked the question of, have you had any contact with Jack Smith about potential overlap here? Now, previously, a week or two ago, Fani Willis said, no, I wouldn't know Jack Smith if he was standing next to me. This time, she refused to answer. She just said, I'm not going to discuss the investigation, although she did discuss the investigation at other points. So, that's a fact that we're all going to need to follow up on. By the way, nothing inappropriate or wrong if she did talk to Jack Smith. In fact, that's what normally would happen between prosecutors to make sure you're not stepping on each other's toes.",

I appreciate the fact that she wants to move the case, but that's not going to happen. Uh, there's just no feasible way to do it.You can't try 19 defendants. You're certainly not going to try them on this kind of indictment with these allegations in six months. She also knows where she falls and she has been last to indict. There are other trials already scheduled. So, again, this is a case based on what we're seeing here, based on the number of defendants, based on what's going to clearly be a marathon trial, not to mention a marathon jury selection.

It really is going to turn into more of a task than they could ever be accomplished in a six-month period.It's one of the reasons we talked earlier about the current Rico case that she's prosecuting, that the jury selection has taken more than half a year. And that is very much more limited case with fewer defendants and fewer lawyers in there. So, this case, if she stays on that track, I just don't see any way that the case is going to be tried. And again, he's also -- he is presumed innocent. I think her remarks were perfectly fine, and she laid it out and said what she said. She reminded people that this is an indictment. He's presumed innocent and the court's going to take that into consideration as they think -- especially if he's winning primary in Republican nominee or whether or not you take (INAUDIBLE) and deprive him of a chance to run for the presidency based on a D.A.

Jack Smith said, there's a bunch of bad actors here. I'm going after one person, Donald Trump. I'm going to be very, very narrow. She went after, you know, 18 other people. It's a very different approach. Also, Jack Smith says, hands off Mark Meadows, which signals that Mark Meadows, despite being corrupt and horrible, is cooperating. She puts her hand on Mark Meadows in this. So. you've got a very different player that just stepped on the field with a very different playbook and a very different sense of what justice looks like. And I think the people I'm hearing from are very, very proud because this RICO stuff, conspiracy stuff, you got kids in neighborhoods across this country that have gone to jail on Rico charges, conspiracy charges. You got kids in jail who were standing outside of a convenience store, their friend went inside, did something stupid, and now everybody they know is in jail. So, we're very familiar with the book, the library, half of Amazon.com being thrown at us when somebody does something wrong. And so, this is actually what justice looks like. If you say you don't want a two- tiered justice system, this is what not having a two-tiered justice system looks like. You have an aggressive prosecutor. She's going after you, everybody you know, and she's not messing around. So, this is a very different prosecutor and a very different playbook than you saw with Jack Smith.",

The notion that you would have a six-month trial involving 19 defendants, 19 separate defense counsel, think of what's going on in the Mar-a-Lago documents case right now.

It wasn't just that he wanted to send some of the electoral -- it wasn't just that Trump wanted Pence to send some of the electoral votes back to the states. He wanted -- Trump wanted initially Pence to basically throw the whole thing away so that the election would then go to the House of Representatives, where there were 26 states that had Republican majorities and 24 that had Democratic majorities, and where the theory was the House would have elected Donald Trump president.
