Now, Officer Wilt is injured. He's shot in the head. He's on the ground. And what we're seeing here is body camera footage from Officer Galloway and what we see here. You know, people might be wondering. Well why didn't they go in? Why didn't they rush officers are continually collecting information real time about what's happening. It's clear that is the officers themselves who are the ones drawing fire from the shooter now if the shooter moved into the bank further if they heard the sound of gunfire becoming more faint, they might realize okay, he could potentially go after additional people inside, but it is a tactical advantage for officers to stay there and draw him out as they wait for backup. And, of course, as we see on that body camera footage, you can actually see the shell casings from officers. Galloway's rifle they're rejecting as he fires, what appears to be the fatal shot and taking down that shooter.

There's also this delicate dance that has to be made with Congress and however they're trying to subpoena is called an accommodation process.But Jordan has kind of blown through that. I don't think he's being advised by oversight lawyers. I think he's more thinking about TV screens, so he was prematurely sent the letters to brag before there was no indictment and knew what the charges were. Then, he skip certain steps. You're not supposed to skip steps because Bragg's office said, we'll meet and confer with you. He just rejected that. And then he's escalated it by this idea of having a field hearing in New York about an unrelated matter in a certain sense, crime rates in Manhattan supposedly.

But even these kinds of back and forth, I'm sure that there have beenexamples of Congress trying to -- to weigh in on issues before courts before in American history, but certainly in this particular case, it does seem unique. And so, it's unclear how much actual standing really has. Yes, as you just said, Erica, Congressman Jim Jordan tried to hang his head on it still trying to hang his hat on the idea that Alvin Bragg in New York used federal funds, and then that gives Congress away in for oversight. But there's so much more to this lawsuit against Jim Jordan, not the least of which is this idea that Bragg doesn't want a former prosecutor in his office who is gone out and written a book, very critical of the fact that they had an initially gone after Trump, doesn't want him to be in front of Congress, in front of the TV cameras.",

Doug, I appreciate you joining us today. So, as this investigation unfolds, officials concede at this point they really don't know yet whether the threat is contained, whether more leaks are possible. Given that these documents first appeared on Discord, this is a social media gaming platform if people aren't familiar with it. How likely do you think it is that we could see more documents leaked? DOUGLAS LONDON, FORMER CIA COUNTERTERORRISM CHIEF FOR SOUTH &amp; SOUTHWEST ASIA:  Well, from what we've seen, Erica, it doesn't seem like this was a professional espionage operation. This was the actions of at least one person and their motivations still remain questionable. But the choice of the gaming platform would suggest there was something more personal involved, and it would suggest that he or she didn't take the greatest steps to protect their trail, and there's a whole great number of audit measures that are available on the IT systems in the U.S intelligence community. So, while I certainly understand that suggestion by justice that they want to be thorough, it will take some time.

How so? LONDON:  You know, it's interesting, Erica, having chased the Russians for so many years, the fact that they came out quite so quickly and in somewhat amateurish way to get these documents online and manipulated as they did, and rather evidence fashion suggests their worried, and indeed, the truth is -- as big a problem for Putin as the leak of the information is for us, because he's so concerned about a narrative that protects his position at home by showing strength and control.

Why? Well, look at the electoral penalty that voters assigned to those who believe in election denialism. Five points in the margin, five points in the margin in major statewide 2022 races.
