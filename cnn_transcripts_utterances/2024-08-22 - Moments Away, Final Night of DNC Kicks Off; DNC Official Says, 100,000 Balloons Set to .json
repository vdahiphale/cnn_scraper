She also wants to contrast her vision with that of Donald Trump's and underscore how her policies and views are rooted in patriotism. But Democrats, Wolf, want to seize the concept, idea of patriotism back for the Democratic Party. Now, warming up the crowd before Harris' speech will be pop superstar Pink.

We're likely to see her on a debate stage with Donald Trump, but that's just not going to be the same kind of opportunity she has here to speak directly to millions.And we know from her team that she's got a couple significant themes that she wants to lay out. I think the one that I'm most interested in hearing is her biography, her background. She's going to portray herself as someone who grew up with a middle class life, who worked at McDonald's, who didn't go to fancy Ivy League schools. Some of the things in her background and her way of being are simply a contrast to what the other side of the aisle potentially offers. And to the extent that she is able to make sure that she delivers on what this convention has provided her an opportunity to do, which is to continue this enthusiasm, to not make any significant mistakes or anything along those lines, she, I think, has the real possibility to come out of this convention with the enthusiasm as high as it's ever been.",

You say, reintroducing herself, to a large degree, introducing herself because people didn't pay all that much attention to her, even when she was the vice presidential nominee.The second part of the speech, aides say, is going to be called new way forward. And, you know, that's very important. They really want to give the sense. They're turning the page, not just on Donald Trump and his time in office, but to a certain degree, in a loyal way, on Joe Biden and his administration. So, they're going to have a sharp contrast with Donald Trump, especially the 2025 Project. But in addition, I think she's going to set some markers out in terms of policy on immigration, on economics, on crime, kinds of issues that we know that Donald Trump is going to hit her on, on how she would be different than a second Joe Biden term. The other thing that's so interesting, she's been working really hard on this speech. She's also been working really hard on delivering this speech. And I'm told that she has had a set of teleprompters and that she's been traveling the country going to all these swing states, they set up the teleprompters at a podium in her hotel suite and she gives the speech. And she's been under a lot of coaching about, you know, how to give a speech. Interestingly enough, we were told that Tim Walz, the vice presidential candidate, had never spoken with a teleprompter, and I thought he hit it out of the park last night. So, Kamala Harris has got a show with a lot more experience with a teleprompter. She can do as well as a running mate.",

You know, she has been in Biden's shadow for four years. Obviously, that is the role of a vice president. You have known her personally for a really long time. How do you want to talk about her bio, her personal life to get Americans to be more familiar with her tonight on that stage? SEN. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D-NV):  Yes. I, what you're seeing now and the information that is coming out is the Kamala that I know, strong. She's has the ability to lead this country. She's capable, she's intelligent, but she's also compassionate and she cares about people and she cares about our working families. She wants to make sure everybody has that opportunity to get ahead. That's the Kamala I worked with as attorney general as we were fighting the big banks to help our families that were losing their homes or protecting our communities from the drug smugglers and human traffickers. It was about who was being victimized, who was being hurt, and how do we ensure that they have every opportunity. So, really, that's what you see playing out in this convention. But along with that, there's this hope and joy that we've got a future to look forward to, where an administration is really going to fight for our families, create jobs, grow our economy, and really address the issues that working families and individuals are dealing with right now.",

But the most important thing tonight is Vice President Harris takes step one of the most critical two-step process of her life. She has the ball right now. To borrow Coach Walz's metaphor last night, the Democrats do have the ball. Their convention was later, which has shortened the clock and has shortened the field. She has the ball and she's the quarterback. Think of it that way in the sports metaphor. They have a slight lead maybe in the race, or they're tied, if you look at the battleground states. They're raising money off the charts, new donors, small donors. It's mind blowing and breathtaking.Can she present herself as a center left president, as an acceptable president tonight? That is the challenge. And she does it solo tonight. She has an hour or so on that stage to reintroduce herself to the American people to say, despite what Donald Trump says, I'm not scary. This is what I'll continue from Joe Biden. Here's what I'll be different. She has to address the economy. She has to address immigration. And if she can do that tonight, present herself as a reasonable, rational, center left president, then 19 days from now, she will have the second step of that process. She will stand next to Donald Trump on a debate stage. And if she still has the ball then, if the Democrats still control the ball then, a lot of people, even Republicans are saying today, they're applauding what's happening here. They think the Democrats have run a good convention. Democrats are worried about the shorter field and the shorter clock, as long as she keeps the ball in her hands.",

That's why it's really important for her to come out here today and project that.And at John's point, those 19 days from this convention to that first debate, she's going to have to answer some questions from reporters. So, can she do that as well? I'd say that's the second step, John, on the way to three.

And it's not like the guy I want when we are really doing tough negotiations with our enemies or our friends.So, I think Kamala Harris will -- the times I have been with her, she has grilled me to do the best job I can do because she expects nothing less, and the times I have been there a little bit doubtful of myself, she says, you can do whatever you want, pushing forward.
