New explosions are being reported in Lebanon right now, one day after Israel carried out a series of deadly pager attacks, all this according to Lebanese state media. CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, is joining us right now. First of all, Nick, what do we know about these latest reports, about these latest explosions going on in Lebanon?",

A Taiwanese electronics company, Nick, is facing heightened security right now after multiple photos of the aftermath of yesterday's attacks appeared to show its pagers. What do we know about that?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the Gold Apollo AR-924, not a device that anyone, frankly, had ever heard of until 24 hours ago, but it appears to have been the main conduit, the pager, the model that detonated across Lebanon in its thousands.Now this is something made in Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has no records of direct export to Lebanon. Indeed, the company behind it, Gold Apollo, say that in fact that model was given to a Hungarian company, BAC, to market and sell. I think the official beginning of how these pagers began life, who made them, who first traded them is possibly less relevant. What we need to know is exactly how they found their way into Lebanon. As I said earlier, a lot of times, devices turn up in often ports, areas that Hezbollah effectively control that seem incredibly cheap. You're not quite sure where they have come from, having lived there for a while. So, infiltrating that supply chain not particularly tough. And maybe indeed it is these thousands of devices which CNN has learned were infiltrated and were part of an Israeli Mossad and military joint operation, according to \"New York Times,\" had tiny amounts of explosive put in them. Just imagine, Wolf, the painstaking nature of inserting tiny amounts of explosive in thousands of pagers, then repackaging them, putting them back in a container potentially, and being sure that they will get into the hands of the Hezbollah group you consider to be your enemy, an operation that clearly took months. Wolf, the real question is, why did they detonate yesterday? Is there a larger operation at stake here? Is there a other reason in terms of Israeli domestic politics, where someone decided to launch an operation against Hezbollah in the last 24 hours? Is this a prelude to something bigger? Was there an operational reason, a technical reason why these devices had to be operated sooner, rather than later? Things we don't know at this stage, but I think the second wave of attacks we're seeing today, if indeed it is proven this is part again of an Israeli operation, which, given the timing, given the nature of what we're seeing, seems to be fairly likely, whether this is, as I say, an escalatory measure leading to something else or a bid to damage the psychology, the morale of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah -- Wolf.",

People have reported looking at the pagers, receiving a message, and then them detonating.The question I think today will be whether the walkie-talkies, if it appears that they are the only device that detonated and how many indeed there were, quite what caused these to detonate and whether it was at the same time.",

He also had one of these pagers, but the understanding is that his injuries were superficial.Now, remember, these were pagers distributed to essentially the loyal, those part of Hezbollah's more important communications network, essentially to keep them off smartphones. The smartphones, the Israelis have proven very capable at using to track down targets over the past year plus. So, some twist, frankly, in the plot here, that those low-tech devices were the initial target and now yet more low technology, walkie- talkies used for crowd control, shortwave radio designed to get people to talk to each other just a matter of blocks away, that these somehow have also potentially detonated. Quite how they received an instruction to detonate, things we will be learning, I'm sure, in the hours and days ahead. But you can't underestimate the psychological impact of this on a group like Hezbollah, so proud of their operational security, so confident in the secrets they feel they're able to keep and in their ability to directly challenge Israel, now for two days in a row seeing their innermost sanctums violated by these explosions -- Wolf.",

And, as I pointed out, they have thousands of rockets and missiles that are based in Southern Lebanon that could hit all parts of Israel right now.And, already, what, about 100,000 Israelis have been evacuated from Northern Israel near the Lebanese border.

      "sentences": "The latest estimate is somewhere around 60,000 Israelis who were evacuated from Northern Israel.But there are, of course, people who remain close to that border who are at risk for additional evacuation should the situation continue to escalate. And people, including here in Tel Aviv, who have family members in the north, are constantly concerned checking on them when incidents like this do bubble up to say, is it time for us to move south? Is it time for us to get further outside of the range of those rockets? But, ultimately, Wolf, there is a reality, which is that if there is an all-out war with Hezbollah, this will be much different than what we saw in 2006 during the last major explosion of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. And that's because Hezbollah's rocket arsenal has significantly expanded since then. It has grown more sophisticated. And the range of those rockets and missiles has expanded to include potentially being able to hit targets in Tel Aviv, as well as the airport very near to Tel Aviv as well -- Wolf. BLITZER:  All right, Jeremy, we're going to get back to you as well. I know there's a lot of tension, a lot of nervousness going on right now in Lebanon and in Israel. I want to go back to Lebanon right now. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Ben, you know Beirut. You know Lebanon. You know that -- what's going on very well. How seriously should we be concerned right now that this is going to escalate and there's going to be major Hezbollah retaliation against Israel, which in turn would result potentially in an all-out war?",

About within an hour or two, almost all of them went inside our doors. So this stretched us pretty much too thin. But our capacity, between doctors and nurses, logistics, managed to keep up with the needs and to stabilize the life-threatening injuries and then to provide immediate care and then, of course, transfer them to the hospital, to the operating rooms to undergo the surgery and what need to be done afterwards.

Combs has been denied bail and remained in custody after pleading not guilty to charges of racketeering, conspiracy, and sex trafficking. Those charges are part of a three-count federal indictment that was unsealed yesterday, and it lays out a framework of very serious and sprawling allegations against the music mogul, including kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice. Joining us now, senior legal analyst Elie Honig. So, Elie, what arguments do you expect to hear from both sides at this upcoming hearing today?",

With respect to danger, they argue, look at the seriousness of the crimes. You just listed them off. The racketeering conspiracy charge includes almost any crime you can think of, drugs, guns, assault, robbery, obstruction of justice. And on risk of flight expect prosecutors to say this is a person with enormous wealth. We don't know where he keeps it all and he could flee if he wanted to. Now, look for defendants, the defense lawyers, to say, first of all, the allegations are only allegations at this point, and, second of all, he has self-surrendered, to some extent, and so, therefore, he has no intention to flee.",

I think the judge will keep Sean Combs behind bars pending trial.First of all, federal law tells us that, where you have charges involving force or violence, and here we do have that, the legal presumption is in favor of detention, in favor of prosecutors. The other thing is, if you just take Sean Combs' name out of this, if this, in my experience, was some unknown defendant who was charged with forcible sex trafficking, with racketeering involving all the crimes I just listed, that person would be locked up, no questions about it. So you don't know what's going to happen. It's tough to predict these things, but, if I had to guess, I think Sean Combs will continue to be locked up pending trial.",

You haven't even been proven guilty at this point.And I will tell you, Wolf, from having been in there, the federal facilities here in New York City, there's one in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn, are horrible places, as are all prisons. But, more importantly, it is much more difficult for a defendant to prepare for trial from prison. It is much more inefficient and time-consuming to meet with the lawyers. It's harder for a defendant to assist with other trial preparations. So that's why bail hearings are so high-stakes, as we will see later this afternoon.",
