I'm Jessica Dean in New York.We have breaking news out of northern Gaza tonight where Israel is preparing to reopen the Erez border crossing and to use its Port of Ashdod to get critical humanitarian aid from Israel into Gaza just hours before the Israel-Hamas war reaches its six-month mark. This as the U.N. humanitarian aid chief calling the situation in Gaza a, quote, \"betrayal of humanity\" with 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza killed and many starving. Just this week, a deadly Israeli strike killed seven humanitarian aid workers from the well-known aid group World Central Kitchen. CNN's Nic Robertson filed this report from the Erez crossing.

      "sentences": "Well, that's the crossing right behind me. I'll step out of the way. Matias, if you can kind of zoom in and take a look. That's the Erez border crossing there. On the hill behind you, you can see one of the towns inside of Gaza. We're standing here and you can hear gunfire in the background. The occasional explosion.So we understand that the IDF did have a meeting with the World Food Programme down at the border here on Friday. The expectation is possibly Sunday aid trucks could begin to go through here, but there are a lot of challenges. I mean, not least the fact that we can hear gunfire and explosions. That tells you that it's not going to be very safe crossing over so -- and then there's the issue of the state of the roads. We know from satellite imagery, many of the roads that lead away from the border here have been hit by heavy munitions. The tarmac has been completely blown out in some places. So the logistics of getting those aid trucks and then of course there's the other thing as well. When Hamas had that big attack on October 7th, the Erez border crossing was one of the places they targeted. They killed and kidnapped IDF soldiers there. They shut up the passenger terminal. There is a terminal, a crossing if you will, more used to being ready to deal with foot passengers than heavy transport trucks. But there is a way to do it but there are other issues, too, that could come up. Weve seen before that protesters could block the crossing. That's happened before at other crossings. We know that there's a huge pressure and expectation coming from the White House that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to make good on his commitment here. But there are people in his right-wing government who believed that the best way to pressure Hamas and get the hostages back is not to let the aid convoys in. The Israeli government says they've let about 20,000 aid trucks in to Gaza over the past six months. The U.N. estimates four times that number of aid trucks would have been required under normal circumstances. And the need in the north of Gaza in particular is huge. The U.N. estimates some people there are close to starvation. So there is a huge amount of attention focused here. The Israeli government has said that they'll do it. The White House wants to see them actually do it. Precisely when it happens, how it happens, the problems they're going to face, all of that is unclear. The gunfire right now tells me it's not going to be easy. Nic Robertson, CNN, at the Erez border crossing, Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, again, the U.S. and Israel in close contact preparing around the clock for this attack that they view as, quote, \"inevitable.\" It could unfold in multiple different ways. And it's unclear when exactly it will happen, though officials anticipate it could be as soon as next week. And again, it would potentially target U.S. or Israeli assets in the Middle East. Now of course, this was a major point of discussion between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in their phone call this week. And the top concern for U.S. officials is that if there were to be a direct strike by Iran on Israel, that it would rapidly escalate what has already been a very tense conflict in the Middle East. And that is exactly the type of situation that the White House has been trying to avoid. They do not want to see anything occur here that would spark a broader regional conflict. So all of those quite delicate. But what the U.S. and Israel are doing tonight is keeping close contact as they anticipate this potential attack and preparing for that.",

But this year, I think, Jessica, is testing that proposition because the cash advantage for Biden has been so extreme and he is now on the air in the big battleground states at which there are very few without much pushback at all from Republicans.

You know, Joe Biden is saying he's going to let the Trump tax cuts expire for everybody over $400,000 a year at the end of 2025, or as Trump will extend them, saving people hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. But by and large, I think that each coalition -- in each coalition, there is an activist core that is, you know, enormously concerned about what a victory for the other side means for their definition of the country, even if that doesn't spread out to enthusiasm among the much larger pool of people who will actually be voting.",
