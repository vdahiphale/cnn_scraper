Then they're going to move to this extradition hearing. We are hearing from his attorney that he's going to waive his extradition. And then the process begins of him being in custody of the NYPD. Now, we're still trying to fine tune how he's actually going to get to New York. Is he going to go by helicopter? Are they going to drive him? We're not quite sure about that yet. But certainly going to be here by the end of day today. And that is when he is going to face those charges. Those 11 charges that were unsealed just two days ago here in New York. Unclear - Eli might know more - about when he might be in front of a judge on those charges. But another part of this is now we're hearing from Kara Scannell that he's going to face federal charges. So, it's unclear also when we might hear the unsealing of those charges. So, of course, once he gets here, we know that he has to be booked. He'll be brought to 100 Center, which is the main courthouse, if you remember, where Trump had his trial. So, people are probably familiar with it. He's got to get fingerprinted. They'll take a photo. We won't see that photo because they never released those here in New York. But then that whole process starts.",

First, he'll be formally arraigned on the Pennsylvania charges, which are the gun charges and the false ID charges. The judge will say, these are the charges against you. Do you understand them? Yes. He may plead not guilty. But those charges are going to be back burner while he comes here to face the much more serious New York charges. And it's really interesting. Now it looks like, given the reporting that Brynn just referenced, he's going to be facing two separate sets of charges across the street from each other in New York. The one we already know about is the first and second degree state level charges, which he will be presented on in all likelihood first. That could be, again, that could be tonight. That could be tomorrow. And then if this reporting comes true, he will simultaneously be facing a variation of a federal murder charge in all likelihood. Same courthouse. It's 40 foot away. It's right across the street. But both of those murder prosecutions could be unfolding more or less parallel to one another.",

We think the hearing has begun, or at least it was scheduled to begin by now. The first of two.There are many things we've been looking for today. Questions answered. One of which has already been answered, as we saw the video of Luigi Mangione entering the courthouse earlier. This time there was no outburst. It was a much more subdued defendant in this case walking into that court. And the reason I bring that up is because one of the questions I've had is how this will now all change now that there is a high-profile lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, whom we all know, who has done some work here at CNN, representing Luigi Mangione. That was the footage of him walking in a few weeks ago before he had lawyered up. Also interesting, Elie, it's the family, his family, who is - who brought in Agnifilo, right? And the family hasn't visited him yet. But what are you looking for in this dynamic?",

And there's a couple reasons for that. Number one, those outbursts can be used against him at trial. That video of him going in that you just showed, John, that can be played if it's relevant to prove his motive or something along those lines.The other thing is, ultimately, if he gets convicted, if he takes a plea, if he gets convicted by a jury, the judge will be sentencing him. And there will be some wiggle room, maybe, depending on how the conviction comes down, for the judge to think about things like, is this person remorseful? Has this person accepted responsibility? That's way down the line. But generally you want your client, if you're a defense lawyer, to be on good behavior. So, I assure you, we know Karen has visited and spoken with her client. I promise you, she's a good defense lawyer. She told him, keep it quiet for now.",

If it was done intentionally and there's no excuse for it, second degree murder, 15 year minimum, penalty could be as long as life with parole.On top of that, what they've now charged, the Manhattan prosecutors, is a first degree. In order to bump it up from second degree to first degree, you have to show some special factor. Could be, for example, that the victim was a judge, that the victim was a cop, that the victim was a witness, could be that the murder involved torture, just to give you a sense of what some of the statutory provisions are. The one they're pointing to here is the terrorism enhancement, which means it was intended to cause general public to be fearful, to feel coerced, or to influence policy, presumably relating to health care.",

This morning, a worker near Chicago speaking out against the company.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASH'SHURA BROOKS, DRIVER, AMAZON WAREHOUSE: One thing that I would like to say is that there is a narrative being pushed out by Amazon that we are the monsters and we are the problem and we are not. How are we the problem when we have Amazon drivers in Fort Lauderdale that are delivering packages in a flood? How are we the problem when we have Amazon workers in California who are forced to work during a heat wave? We are not the problem because we're asking for what is owed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The teamsters union represents less than 1 percent of Amazon's U.S. workforce.All right, the attorney for the woman who accused Sean Combs and Jay-z of rape is now suing Jay-z's entertainment company, Roc Nation. Tony Buzbee accuses Roc Nation of soliciting dozens of his clients to file, and I'm quoting here, \"frivolous lawsuits\" against Buzbee's law firm. A spokesperson for Roc Nation calls the lawsuits baloney. Jay-z has denied the rape allegation and is suing Buzbee for extortion. And, multiple sources have told CNN that U.S. officials are investigating a Chinese telecom company to see if their routers posed a potential national security risk. Authorities are trying to see if hackers allegedly used the cheap and widely available routers from TP- Link to target U.S. infrastructure. Sources say the routers could be banned pending the results of the probe. And the world's largest hornet, aka the murder hornet - yes, it's a real thing - has finally been wiped out here in the U.S. Federal officials announcing the invasive hornet has now been eradicated five years after they were first spotted in Washington state. Local residents played a huge part in helping get rid of them, agreeing to place traps on their properties. The hornets, which can be two inches long, killed dozens of people in China just a few years back. Kate.",
