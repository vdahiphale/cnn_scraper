In terms of proving the case, I think that's a little bit harder because they're going to have to prove that Trump rather than some junior, some junior employee in Trump Tower who actually entered this in terms of like entered the business record, that he had control over how it was entered and in terms of the business records falsifying -- LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" JOURNALIST: Can I just jump in just very briefly, though, and just say, I don't think that that's true. This is the whole thing that everyone always says about Trump. We're never going to learn anything new about him. We already know all the terrible things that he's done.
