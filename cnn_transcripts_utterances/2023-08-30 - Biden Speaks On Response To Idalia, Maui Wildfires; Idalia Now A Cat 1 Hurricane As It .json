In St. Petersburg, their fire rescue teams there rescued more than 75 people. But behind me here is State Highway 19, still seeing a lot of action there.

SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: So essentially he lost. The judge said he is forfeiting and that's because he handed over a few documents in this case, but nowhere near the discovery that he was expected to hand over. And the judge said, essentially, you didn't comply with the discovery in this case, the election workers who, of course, Rudy Giuliani talked about publicly in the aftermath of the 2020 election accused baselessly of ballot tampering. They can't meaningfully go through with this kind of defamation case if you're not going to hand over a discovery. So essentially he loses. And what this means is that he could potentially be on the hook for significant damages. Those are going to get determined down the road either this year or early next year at a trial. And perhaps unsurprisingly, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss say that they're grateful to finally get this kind of vindication. They said it was a living nightmare what they had to go through with Rudy Giuliani talking out there publicly about them. Now, Giuliani's political advisor, Ted Goodman, says that he hopes that this will be reversed.
