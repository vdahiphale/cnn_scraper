And here are the lines in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, to be clear. And we now have fixed our technical difficulties with CNN's Brian Todd. He's joining us from Pennsylvania right now.

And these figures will be updated as the day goes on. Now, the Secretary is also busy texting voters who need to cure their ballots. Meaning they need to verify their signatures before they can be counted by the November 12 deadline. Now, according to these new numbers, as of today, 13,906 ballots still need to be cured. 12,939 ballots have already been successfully fixed. But the bulk of the outstanding ballots that need to be cured are in this little county down here, Clark County. That is where Las Vegas and its suburbs are located. And where Democrats really need to drive turnout if they want to carry the state. Now, historically, it's been older voters who often have problems with their mail-in ballots, with their signatures or the dates. But Nevada says it is seeing a trend of younger voters who need to fix their ballots. And they also say those younger voters don't tend to answer their phones when the Secretary of State calls.

Virtually, as we've seen, some of the early voting numbers come in, In some of the states, early women outpacing men. They know they have to make up the ground. They're given the gender gap that's going to exist here. And what are the issues that are driving the voters to the polls today? The economy always number one, but what is right underneath it?
