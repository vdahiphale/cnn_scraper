And this meeting is one that had essentially always been a possibility out there, but it was very unclear whether something like this would happen. So, if you look back at the timeline, 11 days ago, Donald Trump was told that he was very likely a target in this investigation. He very likely could be charged with crimes around his behavior after the 2020 election as he was trying to undermine the vote. And then there often is an opportunity given to defense lawyers to come in and make their appeals, essentially, to prosecutors as to why their client shouldn't be indicted. And our team of reporters, we have been able to confirm this morning that that meeting is currently happening. The Trump lawyers are meeting with special counsel Jack Smith and his team to talk about this looming set of charges against the former president that have not been approved yet. How that meeting resolves is going to be something really to watch today,Rahel. And then, on top of that, we are still watching this grand jury. They have been at work for months. They have heard from many, many witnesses. They were in last Thursday and had even more witnesses to be wrapping up. And so now there is a question, is there more evidence they need to hear? And will the Justice Department, with that meeting happening today with the Trump lawyers, will they want to present the possible indictment to the former -- about the former president at this time?",

I mean, what do you think is going on behind closed doors? And is there any chance they can talk them out of an indictment? REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  John, yes, actually, I was a local prosecutor, but worked with grand juries. And I can tell you, in any prosecution, what they are looking to do is to give them kind of like the last, best chance to make your case as to why an indictment should not occur, and, also, in many ways offer the target of the investigation an opportunity, if they have any evidence, if they want to sit before the grand jury, to do so, so that there's no questions, if an indictment comes down, as to the fairness here.",

It was a terrorizing experience to have to leave the Capitol with gas masks because a mob that Donald Trump assembled and incited and then aimed at the Capitol descended on the Capitol. And so he could be on the hook for conspiracy to defraud the United States, essentially, every voter from having their vote counted. And, of course, we know that he's a guy that likes to obstruct justice. We have seen that in just the way that he publicly talks about things. And so I wouldn't be surprised if there's an obstruction of justice charge.

I don't want Hunter to be treated any better or worse. He did attempt so far -- he's a private citizen, by the way -- to resolve this case and has paid the back taxes. But, to me, my experience in something like this is, the judge wants to make sure both parties understand what they're agreeing to. And they're going to come back, I guess, in two to four weeks and try and resolve that. But at the end of the day, Hunter Biden has tried to accept responsibility. No Democrat, when Hunter Biden was indicted, said that we should burn down the rule of law and that the prosecution is rigged. We accept the outcome because that's how the rule of law works.

Extreme heat is the number one cause of weather-related deaths in this country. And many of the jobs that are affected include farmworkers, construction workers, and also delivery workers. Additionally, the president will be rolling out $7 million of funding through NOAA to help communities improve weather forecasting. There is also about $150 million that is going to be dedicated to water storage and climate resilience. That is really dedicated to some of the communities out West, like California and Colorado. But -- and, oftentimes, the president has pointed to these extreme weather events as moments where he believes that they have been exacerbated by climate change.

That was in Helsinki, when he was -- when McConnell was with a U.S. delegation meeting with the president of Finland. He fell. It was snowy out. He got back up and he continued on with his meeting.
