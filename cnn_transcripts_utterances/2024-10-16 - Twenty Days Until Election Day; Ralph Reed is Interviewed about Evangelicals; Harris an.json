Well, there was this extraordinary thing that happened in American political history, which was 100 days more or less before the election you had a complete change at the top of the ticket. And you remember, there was nothing preordained. There was nothing guaranteed that it was going to be Kamala Harris as the nominee. In fact, the day that that happened, there were a lot of stories at the time, people who would be generally friendly to Democrats who said, we're not sure this is a good idea.There was this behind the scenes drama going on. And the way to understand it is that Kamala Harris basically said, if people want to have town halls, they want to have an open convention, sure I'll join that process, but I'm not waiting around for that to happen. In effect she said, good luck with your town halls. And she was locking down these delegates, making phone calls. And the reason why that's important is that within 24 hours she had this nailed. And the thing that - what that reveals to us is, she is not a casual political player. You know, she has spent her whole life more or less rising rapidly through political offices. She lost the 2019 primary. It's the only time she's ever really lost a race. She then went on and became VP. She is fairly, I would say, fairly fierce when it comes to making political progress, making political achievements, and she's done it for herself, but it's also at the core of her political mission, which is to say it's -",

You know, what was her distinct value-add?After the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it was suddenly clear that she could do something Joe Biden could not. He was a conflicted Catholic president who couldn't talk about abortion in a way that would feel authentic to people. She went out on the road. She started convening people in all kinds of states. And not just abortion rights advocates, but people working on democracy issues in other ways, and saying to them the same thing over and over, you all should be coordinating and cooperating.

And I think it did kind of open up for her the idea of, you know, this is where she could really make a huge difference. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: The other thing that was going on is that she - coming off of the Dobbs decision, started to look at the 2028 primaries and thinking, that's where this is going to play out, and to elbow people out of the - challenging her in 2028. She did not expect to be running in 2024. And there was a lot that was going on as she built up these networks, talk - who would have reporters in - never me, I should say - for off the records.

And if, in fact, they managed to win the popular vote and they don't get the Electoral College, there's going to be a real crisis of legitimacy for American democracy that I think is something we have to prepare for.MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I think that Tim Walz's position will suddenly become mainstream in the Democratic Party about abolishing the Electoral College, number one. But I think one of the things that you talked about I think was very interesting how - when she was making the calls and Shapiro and Whitmer and Mark Kelly, it was immediate that they offered their support, or at least somewhat immediate.

I've talked about him -- talked with him about this issue for years, frankly. And I have no reservations at all. I know that he's pro-life personally.  I know that he is the most pro-life president in American history. He defunded Planned Parenthood. He appointed not one, not two, but three Supreme Court justices that made it possible for Roe v. Wade to be overturned after over a half century of social struggle on behalf of the pro-life movement and many conservative Bible believing Evangelicals. So, I'm very comfortable with where he is.And I would just add one other thing. He's running on a platform that asserts that the unborn child has a right to life that cannot be infringed without due process of law already under the U.S. Constitution, under the 14th Amendment's due process clause. So, he asserts, and the party asserts, that the unborn child is a person who has a right to life and liberty that can't be infringed without due process. That language, in one form or another, has been in the platform since Ronald Reagan in 1984. And in terms of the national abortion law, it's - we certainly favor that, and we would wish that any president would sign it. But the reality is, you need 60 votes in the Senate, and that's not likely to happen in the short term. And behind door number two is Kamala Harris running on the most radical and extreme pro-abortion agenda of any candidate in history, pledging to pass a law that would codify into federal law, not Roe v. Wade, but what would go beyond Roe v. Wade, what would provide taxpayer funding of abortion, elective abortion, under Medicaid for the first time since the Hyde Amendment became law in 1978, and would allow abortion at any stage of pregnancy in all 50 states. It would immediately repeal many of the common sense restrictions on abortion that had been passed in recent decades by the states. So, I think for these voters of faith, Kasie, the - the contrast could not be sharper, could not be more dramatic. And that's why I think they're coming and they're going to come in record numbers.",

Wade. And the sub-headline was, they've been losing ever since. And my concern is that that not be said about our movement in 30 or 40 years. We won a huge victory with Dobbs, but that then lead to a counter reaction by the pro-choice and the pro-abortion forces. And we're in a real fight right now. And he's just simply making the point that, look, I gave it back to the states, the court gave it back to the states. That's where it had been throughout American history prior to Roe. That's where it belongs. Family law has historically always been the domain of the states. And, you know, let's not let them mischaracterize our views on this issue. And let's not let them tell lies about our stands.And they're doing that right now in many of these states. It's really, Kasie, the only issue they've got. They can't run on the economy. They can't run on inflation. They can't run on crime. They can't run on immigration or the border. You know, they got one arrow in their quiver, and that's all they're firing.

I think the - as a communicator, regardless of party, you don't really want either because - and - and the reason I say it is this. Let's say this. If you're - if you don't want to answer a question, you want to make it as seamless as possible that you're not actually answering the question. And you also want to make it the thing that you said ten times feel as if you're saying it for the first time. So, if your criticism - if it's criticism of your candidate or you is that you're too scripted or that you weave all over the place, neither is good. If you want to make it effortlessly that you're avoiding the question, or effortlessly that you're staying on message. I think that's a fine line to hue.",
