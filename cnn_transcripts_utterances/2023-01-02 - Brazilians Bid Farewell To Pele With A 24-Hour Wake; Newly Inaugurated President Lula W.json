And as COVID infections surge in China, more countries impose restrictions and tests on Chinese travelers. We are live in Hong Kong. I'm Eleni Giokos. Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. We're live from Dubai. Now, Brazilians and the world are bidding farewell to a football legend who transcended his sport. A 24-hour public wake for Pele is underway in Santos, Brazil, ahead of his funeral tomorrow. The coffin bearing Pele's body is at the center of the pitch in the stadium where he shot to football stardom, captivating a nation and becoming a global sensation. Pele was just 17, where he helped lead Brazil to the first of what would be three World Cup titles during his playing career. Brazil's newly sworn in president will attend Pele's wake, though it's not clear he will be there for later today or for Tuesday. We are monitoring that. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took the oath of office for a third term as President Sunday after defeating Jair Bolsonaro in the October presidential election. We've been covering Pele's wake with Stefano Pozzebon inside the stadium in Santos and Brazil's leadership change with Julia Vargas Jones outside the stadium. Stefano, I want to come to you first. I mean, a final goodbye to Pele and we're seeing fans lining the streets. And his Hearst will be in the very stadium where he scored some of the most memorable goals. What are we seeing ahead of the funeral?",

And I just want to touch on the fact that the new president just sworn in, Lula da Silva. He has paid tribute to Pele. But importantly, some of the messaging has been interesting, right, in terms of wanting to overturn some of the policies of his predecessor, whether it's climate change, whether it's the social element as well. And it's coming at a really pivotal moment while Brazilians are focused on the legacy of Pele and what he stood for, it feels like a sea change of things coming. Could you tell me what you're hearing and what, you know, the big message has been from the newly sworn in president?",

OnFriday, former President Jair Bolsonaro fled the country -- left the country, I should say, without really explaining why. And then on Saturday, big New Year's Eve celebration here. And then on Sunday, a new president is sworn in. And today, we have the wake of Pele. It's just been nonstop. So you're right, the attention has been divided among all these different topics. But Lula got to work quite quickly today. He already reverted some of the policies from President Jair Bolsonaro. He enacted tougher gun control laws and making harder to buy and carry guns in this country. He's also reversed some of the policies that will protect the Amazon, making it easier for Brazilian environmental authorities to pursue environmental crimes. It's something that Jair Bolsonaro had tried to move away from. And most importantly, he -- Lula is returning to his battle against poverty and hunger. This is a topic very dear to his heart, and it's what he tried to do when he was in office up until 2010. Now, of course, he's coming into a very different Brazil than he left -- when he left office in 2010. It's a country that has much higher levels of poverty, extremely high inequality, and in a sluggish economy. Now, moving on to today, he is expected to come to the wake. We're not sure if that will be today or if that will be tomorrow. Lula is meeting with various world leaders again, bringing Brazil back into the world stage. But also, he will need to stay with his people. This is Lula's state. He built his political career in the state of Sao Paulo, and this is where Pele is from as well. They are both heroes of the state. I want to show you a little bit of this line. It doesn't stop. There have been people coming in and it's moving. It hasn't stopped moving. People are coming in and we're talking to them. They're telling us, you know, I saw Pele play in the stadium with my dad. I want to introduce you to this man, 68 years old. This is Pedro. He is from 2,000 kilometers away from the city of Salvador. And he's here today because he tells me it's just -- he couldn't miss it. (Speaking Foreign Language)",

The Vatican says Benedict died on Saturday at the age of 95. He was the first pontiff in almost 600 years to resign his position, instead of holding office for life.

And I've actually now learned that it's tens of thousands of people who have come by. The Vatican has just come out with numbers saying that as of 02:00 p.m. local time here in Rome, and of course, the Vatican as well, which is about two hours ago, they sort of give regular updates on this. 40,000 people have gone past here and then gone inside St. Peter's Basilica to then pay their final respects to Pope Benedict XVI. So as you can see, there is a great outpouring here in Rome. We're seeing a lot of folks here from Rome itself and from Italy coming here, but also some folks who've seem from Germany as well. Obviously, the Pope was a German national, someone who was also very much attached to his homeland in Bavaria. And I think if you look back at the legacy of Pope Benedict XVI, obviously, the one big thing that he will be remembered for is the fact that he decided to take that step, to step down, to resign, because he felt that he was not strong enough anymore, both his body and his mind. To leave the church in times when it was, of course, very troubled. And we had a lot of these scandals surrounding abuse, for instance. And there are a lot of critics who said that Pope Benedict did not do enough to address a lot of those cases, not just when he was Pope, but also in the time before that, when he was, of course, one of the most powerful people inside the Vatican here since the early 80s. But he also acknowledged in the final months of his life that mistakes were made when he was the Archbishop of Munich in the late 70s and early 80s as well. And it was quite interesting because he put out -- or a letter that he wrote was released after his death, where he begged for forgiveness for all of those that he had wrong. So he acknowledged that he had made mistakes in his life. It was -- it's very hard to say whether or not he was speaking just about that segment of abuse, but whether or not he was speaking about other things as well. He didn't further elaborate on that, but certainly, so that he realized that he had committed sins, that he was not a complete person and he did beg for forgiveness for that. So right now, people that you're seeing here in Rome, many of them just say they want to pay their respect. But I think one thing that we have to keep in mind, Eleni, is that he was one of the most important figures inside the Vatican for decades. Not just as Pope, but before that as well. And so, certainly, inside the walls that you see behind me there, a big era is coming to an end.",

So in Pennsylvania, a very difficult time for one family. Here in Moscow, Idaho, the community, though, is feeling such incredible relief. It was nearly seven weeks this investigation took place. And throughout the entire time, the Moscow police department, it is a very small police department in this small, rural college town here, they've received a lot of criticism because they did not release a lot of information, actually nearly any information throughout the investigation, the entire time they said they were doing it to protect the integrity of the investigation. And now the police chief says that he is receiving calls from people apologizing for criticizing them, for doubting them throughout this process. He says he would do it all over again in the exact same way because they have achieved an arrest. Now, the next step that they're looking for is a conviction, which is why they have kept their tip line open.

Not on the list anywhere, Celine Dion, though Ozzy Osbourne made it at 112, Celine's fans were obviously outraged and wondered why the Canadian singer was snubbed.

Hundreds of millions of views on TikToks with this celebrity death prank, with kids of all ages trying to elicit reactions from their loved ones, like you said, by saying that their favorite celebrity had passed away. And Angela Bassett's son Slater, who is only 16 years old, he did post an apology, which you mentioned, and we have a little bit of that. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's what a lot of people are saying of the camp that is supporting this. Other saying, it's just a TikTok trend, what's the harm? But really, it is serious. And some people are saying that TikTok should be posting disclaimers and warning people about the content before they watch these videos. I was reading this morning on Newsweek saying that these videos have been viewed billions of times, although the hashtag shows about 200 million views with the hashtag celebrity death prank. But, you know, look, I'm definitely at the camp of not supporting it.",

Here is what we know. We know that over the weekend, medical professionals were called to his home for an emergency. His representative said it has something to do with an accident involving a snow plow. He lives in Nevada. He's known to own snow plows. He's constantly posting videos of himself at his home, you know, plowing his driveway, plowing driveways and streets of neighbors nearby. There's been unprecedented snowfall in the area, but we don't know exactly what led to the accident. We don't know exactly how or where he was injured, but we do know that he's in stable condition. We're hoping to get more details, but we do know from authorities, a press release that came out that he was actually airlifted from his home to a hospital to receive medical attention. So the story is developing. Really scary, but, you know, glad to hear that he is stable and that he should make it through this.",
