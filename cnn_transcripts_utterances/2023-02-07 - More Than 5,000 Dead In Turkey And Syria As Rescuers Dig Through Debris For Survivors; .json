AT THIS HOUR, I'm Kate Bolduan.Let's start with the urgent search for survivors after that huge earthquake in Turkiye and Syria. The death toll is over 5,000 people killed and that number is expected to rise. The pictures of the reality and the aftermath of the quakes are devastating. Thousands of buildings collapsed and the weather is making already challenging rescue efforts just that much harder. And add to that, the additional reality that some of the places were already in crisis. Take northwest Syria, for example, with more than 4 million people already relying on humanitarian assistance there. There have been moments of light in the heartbreaking images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOLDUAN (voice-over): This video is showing a small girl being rescued after crawling out of a collapsed building. You can just imagine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: Well, this is still a search and rescue operation, which I hate to say it but it is still good news, because they are still behind me and in buildings up and down this road, still hoping to find survivors of this massive earthquake; 4:30 in the morning, remember, Monday morning. Bitterly cold and this entire area shook for some 20 seconds. The building behind me was 10 stories, including the car park, it has completely collapsed, Kate. The search and rescue team currently on this side still looking for as many, if not more than, 15 people. We have been here for about three hours and there haven't been any live extractions during that time. But as we understand it from the guys working on the site here, they have heard three voices in that time. Now when you have a search and rescue going on like this, what they are looking for in the first instance is coordination of the team and, in the second instance, they are trying to identify voids underneath that rubble. Once they identify those voids, they will put the listening probes and thermal probes inside to see if there is anybody alive. So there have been some signs of life, which is good news and, therefore, nobody giving up. And these guys, I think it is safe to say they are likely to have been working on this site for some 40 hours now. It is bitterly cold as we speak. Clearly, there is concern that anybody who is unaccounted for may not now make it out of this site. I want to bring in Alptekin Talarici, who has a friend who is one of the 15 unaccounted for here. And tell me, first of all, who is Mustafa (ph) and how do you know him?",

People who have come from these buildings, who have lost their entire lives, and many of them are waiting to find out whether members of their families will be rescued alive from this site. And as I say, this is going on up and down this road. There are six buildings that have been massively affected, three of which have almost entirely collapsed. And the building that you see just behind here, the building that you can see here is similar to what was beside it. And you can see there are huge cracks now appearing on the first, second and third floor. Al was just remarking to me when he was here yesterday, that building to the left was standing up completely straight. And so the concern now is that building could also go down. Just to the left of me about 50 yards there is a building with three floors that have collapsed and four remaining. There were 24 people in that building, four of whom have been recovered alive and a 3-year-old, a 7-year-old and two adults, they are there also searching for the 20, who they are hoping that still will have survived this. You are right to point out this is happening all over the region. This is an earthquake the likes of which this region, which is on a fault, has not seen in 100 years; 7.8 was the magnitude of the quake at 4:30 in the morning Monday. There has been a subsequent 100 or so aftershocks, one almost as big as that first quake. Gaziantep itself has relatively new, robust buildings and, to be honest, there are pockets around it that have been affected and affected as badly has this one has. But it is what is happening to a certain subset outside of Gaziantep really concerning people because they just have not got the search and rescue equipment and personnel and emergency supplies into those areas, where the buildings are older and much less robust. And that is in Turkiye. Finally, just, let's spare a thought for those in northwestern Syria, in Aleppo and Idlib. We spoke to someone whose sister is in Aleppo and she says they have no food, water, electricity or fuel. She is in a mosque taking refuge and she said the buildings around her are completely destroyed. We know how difficult it is to get aid into those areas, particularly the opposition controlled areas. So it's a heartbreaking situation. We're 40-odd hours into this. It is still search and rescue and, at some point, it will become a recovery operation. But I can tell you, the enthusiasm of the men and women who are up there on a site like this is unbelievable. I mean, they will keep going until they are absolutely convinced that there is nothing more they can do. Every 15 minutes or so, they have been calling for silence and they will be listening out to see if there is anybody still alive in there. And the hope is that they will still be able to recover some of those who are unaccounted for -- Kate.",

      "sentences": "The State of the Union is kind of a laundry list of policy proposals and laying out the accomplishments of what the president wants to do going forward.But when you have a sense of what the president has been working on and intensely over the last couple of days, what the president wants to accomplish with this speech, it is more than just the policy proposals that he wants to detail. Sitting behind him will be the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. His first major speech in front of a divided Congress and his likely reelection announcement for president, something aides are clear he is moving toward. But when you get into the crux of the speech, he has framed it as a conversation with the American public. And looking at the polling, the public remains uneasy, skeptical, despite his accomplishments in his first two years of office and despite the significant legislative agenda he's implementing. I think part of what Biden will do tonight is connect those accomplishments to people and connect the fact that the inflation is decelerating and the economy is still terrible and the public health crisis has started to wane and lay out how it matters going forward. When it comes to Republicans, he is going to detail what he called last year his unity agenda, talk about bipartisanship, despite that there might not be a lot of legislative possibilities there. But when you want to get a sense of the key elements, look at who will be with the first lady tonight viewing this. You have the mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, who died at the hands of police in Memphis, a visceral crisis that everybody watched on television. Police reform will be a key element. Paul Pelosi, the husband of the former speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will talk about extremism in our politics and try to take the temperature down. And Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador, that will be a central focal point of the foreign policy in the speech. It is going to be a long speech but don't just look at it as a laundry list. This is important, not just for tonight but the months ahead, frankly, the years going forward.",

The overall economy shook off weakness in the first half and ended the year better than expected. The 3.4 percent jobless rate is the lowest since before the moon landing in 1969. And despite the tech layoffs and a looming threat of a recession, here's the tally: more than 12 million jobs added his first two years in office. I'm sure you will hear that tonight. The economy roared back after the COVID lockdowns. And even the stock market, which has had the worst year since 2008, is still higher than it was in January 2021, when the president took office. I think you can expect him to show empathy for Americans who, polls show, are still anxious about the economy and wary of the direction of the country. He going to highlight investments in American, efforts to lower drug and health care costs for real families, to give them more breathing space. And that he action do this while lowering the deficit, aside from a money fight with Republicans to raise the debt ceiling, he'll talk about building the economy from the middle out and the bottom up in contrast to Republican trickle-down economics.",
