If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Four Republican presidential candidates face off Wednesday night in Tuscaloosa. Alabama. Donald Trump did not participate in the debate, yet the former president remains the front runner for the party's nomination well ahead of the other candidate. Three people were killed in a shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on Wednesday. We're told that the gunman who was dead was a 67-year-old career college professor. The motive for the shooting is as yet unknown. Former U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from his leadership post in October, is calling it quits after 17 years in Congress. McCarthy wrote Wednesday in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that he'll be officially resigning at the end of the year. Those who know and work with McCarthy on both sides of the aisle had this reaction. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Kevin serve the House with great, you know, with the great distinction for a long, long time. I mean, you brought us back to the majority. He of course served as speaker. But you know his leadership and in so many different ways is going to be missed around here. REP HAKEEM JEFFERIES (D-NY): I had a very good working relationship with Kevin McCarthy. And I wish Kevin McCarthy and his family nothing but the best in terms of the next chapter professionally in his life. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Democrats want Israel and Ukraine and everything else tied together as one big package. But they first have to agree on the policy, and they're nowhere near an agreement on that.

As of Tuesday, Israel said the limit is two tankers of fuel daily, which is roughly 60,000 liters. The exact amount of the increase was not announced and will be determined from time to time. But Israel's war cabinet says the extra fuel is intended to prevent the outbreak of diseases. The move also comes after pressure from the U.S. to boost fuel shipments to Gaza.Meanwhile, the Palestine Red Crescent Society reports 80 trucks with food, water and medical supplies crossed into Gaza on Wednesday. It's well below the daily average of 170 trucks during the humanitarian pause, according to the United Nations. France says it will send another 549 tons of aid to Gaza, including emergency shelters and food rations, and that is in addition to the 180 tons of aid that France says it's already delivered.

They're here because Israeli forces ordered the Al Shifa Hospital in the north evacuated, claiming Hamas terrorists operated from there. Baby formula is the only source of nutrition here. Many of the mothers have not been found yet. Nobody knows if they're alive or dead. Shaimaa Abu Khater just arrived and is meeting her daughter for the first time since she was born 38 days ago. Your father says to tell you that he loves you. She tells Baby Kenda, her voice breaking. This is the closest she can get to her own child. She was incubated as soon as she was born.

When the truce came, I found out that she was in Egypt.

Their mother never thought she would see them again. AMSHA (through translator): Shifa was under siege. Out of despair, I lost hope and I left. I wanted to take my girls with me, but the doctor said if I did, they would die. They said to leave them and God would protect them.
