      "sentences": "Good evening. Tonight in 360Also tonight, Mitt Romney issuing a warning and a timeline for low polling presidential candidates to get out of the race to save the party from a third Trump nomination. And the latest on the alleged Gilgo Beach killer. Meet the woman who says she went on a date with him and survived. Good evening. We begin with new information about Special Counsel Jack Smith's keen interest in a 2020 Oval Office meeting that has not been previously reported on. The meeting took place in February 2020. In attendance were the former president, senior US officials, and White House staff. Sources tell CNN that Smith is focused on comments the former president made during this meeting about the state of US election security and how those private remarks may differ from the baseless lies he would start publicly spreading about election fraud in the coming weeks.   Legal analysts suggest that one hurdle Smith has to overcome in any potential indictment of the former president on charges related to attempts to overturn the election is whether he can prove the former president actually knew he'd lost. It's been eight day since the former president was informed he was a target in the January 6 investigation, a possible indictment could come as soon as tomorrow when the grand jury meets again. Our senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez who helped break the story about this meeting joins us now with more. So, what more have you learned?",

He said, you should go out and do a public press conference to try to tell the public about this. Of course, this -- within weeks, the former president began talking about his concerns that the 2020 vote would be the subject of fraud, that there would be interference in the election, including because the Democrats were using mail-in ballots. Of course, we know, Anderson that once the former president realized that he had not won the election, once he did not like the election results, he quickly abandoned all of those experts who he had been -- who had stood with him, obviously, and were starting to listen to people, his non-experts, people who are telling him that the election had been interfered with by Venezuela, by China, and of course, by Italian satellites, all of which, of course, was false.",

Did he actually think there was fraud? Did he think that this election had been interfered with by Venezuela or the Chinese satellites?That is one of the key things for prosecutors to try to cross the hurdle, certainly if they bring a case against the former president. So we expect certainly from one of the questions that we understand witnesses were asked, the prosecutor seem very much focused on that, the former president's state of mind, whether he actually believed these bogus claims, or whether he really believed his experts that the election was, as the Homeland Security Department said, the most secure in US history.",

Again, they have not had the access to this. This is something that the January 6 committee in Congress had asked for and did not receive. And so, Anderson, one of the things we're trying to figure out as we wait for the grand jury to reconvene tomorrow and certainly on Thursday is whether this batch of new documents, thousands of pages is something that puts off their work or you know, finally completing their work, buy some time or whether this is something that perhaps they already have enough evidence that they are ready to go forward with an indictment -- Anderson.",

In fact, proving what Donald Trump actually did is not going to be that tough, because a lot of it was done publicly, a lot of it was captured on audio or videotape.What you have to prove, and this is the hardest part is that Donald Trump knew that what he was doing, knew that what he was asking for was fraudulent, was false. And so as a prosecutor, this is a great starting point to make that argument. You say ultimately to a jury, look, here he is. He is getting advice from the best election security experts in the world in his own administration, and not only is he accepting it, he is celebrating it, and then later on, he would argue there are times when he acknowledges to certain witnesses -- Mark Milley, Alyssa Farah -- that he knew he had lost the election, and still other times there are reliable people telling him, you've lost the election. And so all taken, you know that he knew he lost and this was therefore a fraud.

Now, we may say, who would trust Rudy and Sidney Powell? His response to that, I think would be, sure, maybe I was wrong, but you can't say that's criminal. That's not necessarily a fraud.",

This Republican Party is not the party that Mitt Romney ran in, even in 2012. This is Donald Trump's party.

Tim Scott has always been kind of the guy who said, I think really could surprise people similar to Bill Clinton in '92, when nobody had heard of him for a little bit. Chris Christie actually has a shot if there is a widespread kind of understanding that Donald Trump is utterly unfit for office, and he has been the one who has really taken Donald Trump on head on. It's a very small path, of course. And then I think -- you know, I think it's people like that may have a shot. But no, this is Donald Trump's campaign and this is Donald Trump's race.

The Transfiguration Cathedral was severely damaged, probably got the most damage in the city. We were there for hours earlier today. We saw the windows blown out in the dome. We saw the altar that had been very badly damaged, the corner of the cathedral where a rocket had come in and gone down two floors. So it was pretty bad, and it was one of the 25 architectural monuments we are told by a local military official that was damaged in a strike on Sunday. And then today, early in the morning, there were drone strikes against a port far west in the Odesa province on the Danube River right up against the border with Romania. So not only were they targeting a grain storage facility, continuing to go after these grain and food facilities, but Anderson this was the strike that was closest to a NATO country by Russia's military since this war began, these drones striking a site just hundreds of yards from the Romanian border, which of course is a NATO member  -- Anderson.",

There is some GRU activity as well. And my understanding is that they got -- the drone itself got within about half a block of the main Ministry of Defense building in the south of Moscow. The second one a little further outside, outside what they refer to as the MCOD (ph), which is sort of the beltway that goes around the outskirts of Moscow. It's in the southwestern region, but it is interesting, it's only a few miles away from a place called (INAUDIBLE), which is the head of the SVR Headquarters in Moscow. So unclear as to whether or not that was a target or not. But the really interesting part of all of this, I think, is the Ukrainians now claiming responsibility, and in my view, they're trying to determine or trying to encourage, I suppose the Russian people to say, well, this is now at our doorstep, the war is here, we've got to do something about this and maybe it has to do with complaining to the government or getting rid of the government.
