When theprice of oil and other commodities are plummeted in 2015, Venezuela`s revenues dried up almost overnight. And the entire country basically went bankrupt. Inflation was rampant and most of everyday goods were impossible to find. Since then, the socioeconomic crisis has not improved under the government of authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro. And research shows then more than 80% of the population here, still leave below the poverty line. While they may not have all headed to the U.S. between 2014 and 2020, more than 4 million Venezuelans left the country, according to the United nations. Right now, more than 7.7 millions leave outside of Venezuela. And that is about 25% of the population. To give you an idea, it`s like if the entire population of California and Texas left the U.S. in less than a decade. In the last few years, a growing number has started moving north directly towards the U.S. southern border through the Darien Gap, a dense stretch of jungle that connects the South America and Central America. Social media has also played a significant role because more and more people are documenting their trip and posting it on the likes of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and TikTok. Informal migrant networks and businesses that help people just at the beginning of the journey have also sped up the pace of migration. More than 400,000 people have already crossed the jungle as of September this year. And the largest group are from Venezuela. Currently, there are over half a million Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. This month, the White House has starting deporting Venezuela migrants might enter the country illegally, directly back here to Caracas. Political change in Venezuela is not happening anytime soon, with months deposition candidates bar from running for election. And over 270 political prisoners are still behind bars. Countries in the region are saying that they`re looking for conservative solutions to handle this historic migration flow. But as long as Venezuela remains in such dire straits, this emergency only since destined to continue. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
