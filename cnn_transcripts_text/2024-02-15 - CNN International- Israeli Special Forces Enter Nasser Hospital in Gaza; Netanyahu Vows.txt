BIANCA NOBILO, HOST, "CNN NEWSROOM": Hello, and welcome to a special hour-long show of CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca in Nobilo London. 
 
Just ahead, Israeli Special Forces enter Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza. We will have the very latest on this ongoing operation. Then, NATO defense ministers discussed support for Ukraine and more. It's their first meeting since Donald Trump's controversial comments about the alliance. So, we'll have a live report from Brussels on that. And Police in Kansas City are trying to figure out who opened fire at the Super Bowl victory celebration, and why, what we know about the ongoing investigation.
 
Israeli Special Forces have entered Nasser Hospital in Gaza, the largest remaining functioning medical facility in the Palestinian enclave. A video from inside the hospital shows smoke, dust and debris, and people walking around with flashlights. The IDF says it's conducting a precise limited operation and has apprehended a number of suspects. Gaza's Ministry of Health says more than 1,500 displaced people are still inside the facility. Doctors and medical officials in Gaza say Israeli snipers have fired on several people as they try to flee. 
 
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing powerful action in Rafah despite mounting international concern about what that might look like. More than one million displaced Palestinians are sheltering in that southern Gaza city. 
 
CNN's Nic Robertson is following all of these developments and he joins us live now from Tel Aviv. And Nic, there have been developments around what the IDF is doing inside Nasser Hospital today. Tell us more.
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. The images that have been sent out by local journalists inside the hospital showed dust and debris falling, and doctors trying to help patients who have been caught underneath the falling debris. That's in the orthopedic part of the hospital. And hospital officials say that the IDF breached the southern wall of the hospital complex, and in doing so, creating that damage. They also ruptured an oxygen pipeline. And hospital officials say that one person has died as a result of the destruction this morning at the hospital. They say that they are now concerned that, as the oxygen supply has been damaged, that will affect patients in the ICU, in the Intensive Care Unit. 
 
Now, "Doctors Without Borders" say that they understand that the IDF has issued instructions to all the displaced people inside the hospital to leave. There are believed to be more than 1,000 of them there, and some of them were trying to leave yesterday. And during that process, hospital officials say that some people leaving, some exits of the hospital were sniped at. But, the "Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders" say they understand that the IDF is telling the hospital that the doctors and patients can remain there. The situation does appear to be chaotic. 
 
The IDF describe it as a precise and targeted operation that they've already detained some suspects at the hospital that they're inside the compound there. And they say the reason that they've gone in, the IDF says the reason for the operation is because they have credible intelligence from sources and from former hostages that say hostages had been held at the hospital. And they have reason to believe that there could be bodies of hostages buried at the hospital, in many of these hospitals that come under siege like this. When the doctors can't get the dead to cemeteries, they're buried in the hospital compound. 
 
And we understand from hospital officials that the IDF is digging up some of those bodies. And typically what we've seen the IDF do in the past is take those bodies, test those bodies, and if some of them are found to be dead hostages, they retain those bodies, and the other bodies they return. And this has been going on, in many instances. 
 <br>[08:05:00]
 
But, this hospital has been essentially an intense center of the battle around western Khan Younis now for many, many weeks. But, now it seems the IDF has actually got inside the hospital after these many weeks.
 
NOBILO: Nic, the specter looming over these distressing developments is the possibility of a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, which the international community has been raising alarm bells about. Also, what we're seeing at the hospital might indicate some of those concerns, which is what happens to civilians, especially those who are particularly vulnerable and needing medical care. Are there any indications that the IDF is preparing to launch something more intense?
 
ROBERTSON: That's certainly what the Prime Minister said yesterday that there will be a strong operation into Rafah. Now, he conditioned it, saying that that's when all the civilians are evacuated. And he has tasked the IDF with coming up for a plan to evacuate what we understand to be about 1.4 million people, displaced people in Rafah. That's right against the border with Egypt. Many of them have been displaced many times. 
 
So far, the IDF has not put forward publicly a plan to evacuate that many people. And it doesn't appear from what we understand that the IDF has been given orders yet to go into Rafah. But, I think the expectation is that this operation could be coming. Even if it doesn't feel imminent, it could still be very, very close. But, it does appear as if the IDF is still tied up in Khan Younis, and the fight there has been going on much longer than they anticipated, in part because of the many tunnel systems that are inside Khan Younis. 
 
But, for the IDF and for the government here, they see Rafah not so much as the last sort of safe place for 1.4 million displaced people. They see it as the last place of refuge for the Hamas leadership and potentially the place where many of the hostages are being kept and hidden. We know that two hostages were freed from Rafah just at the beginning of this week. So, from that perspective, it is still from the Israeli government perspective, a viable target. 
 
Now, is the Prime Minister doubling down on his language to put pressure on Hamas during the hostage negotiations, which is also pressuring Hamas by saying that they have to change their terms of what they want over the negotiations to release the hostages? Is it all just pressure? Well, I think we've seen until now that while it can sound like pressure on a negotiating position, it can also very quickly turn actually into action on the ground. 
 
NOBILO: Nic Robertson for us in Tel Aviv, thank you. 
 
NATO defense ministers are gathering in Brussels to discuss spending and support for Ukraine. Ahead of the meeting, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned against trying to divide Europe from North America. It follows comments by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who suggested that Washington might not protect NATO allies who didn't spend enough on defense
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: NATO has all also called for European Allies to invest more in the high-end capabilities, more forces, high readiness and now European Allies are delivering that, and that's a good thing. But, that's not an alternative to NATO. That is actually a way to strengthen NATO. And we should not pursue any path that indicates that we are trying to divide Europe from North America. The strength is that we have Europe and North America together in NATO.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: The NATO meeting comes as Ukrainian officials say Russian strikes targeted cities across the country this morning. Seven people were reported injured. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell joins me live from Brussels. Melissa, how large are former President Trump's comments looming over this summit?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've heard so many reactions to them over the course of the last few days and hours coming into this meeting, not only from Jen Stoltenberg himself pushing back on the suggestion that NATO allies are not doing their fair share very forcefully and pointing out that for the first time it is 18 of NATO's 31 alliance members that will be meeting their commitment to two percent of GDP spending on their defense budgets. And of course, that is in direct response to what Donald Trump had said. Jen Stoltenberg had spoken to his comments on Sunday and he has done so again coming to this meeting. 
 
But, we've also heard from other defense secretaries coming here in Brussels, also reminding the world of the importance of the strength and unity of NATO, not least from the American Defense Secretary. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
Now, he hasn't been attending in person, Bianca, because he is still recovering from his bladder issues in Washington. But, he did speak to his counterparts via video conference, saying that --speaking not only to the fact that he believed that the bill currently in Congress, now approved by the Senate but still uncertain in terms of its progress on the floor of the House, will get through, also saying that he believes that not only would Ukraine not surrender, but the United States wouldn't either. So, there was a very strong message there from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin going into the meeting to sort of counteract the kind of rhetoric and language that we've been hearing from Donald Trump, which really has rattled NATO allies, and specifically Europeans, at this time when they feel very keenly, Bianca, their vulnerability vis-a-vis Moscow. 
 
So, a real sense that this needed to be as loud message of NATO members meeting here today as a result, not only that they would remain unified, but that they would remain very firmly behind Ukraine.
 
NOBILO: Melissa, what discussions are being had about the nature, duration and extent of future support for Ukraine? And is there unanimity among ministers of defense from NATO member countries when it comes to that?
 
BELL: Well, that is exactly the question that is being discussed now in -- by the Ukraine contact group. The NATO defense ministers have now moved into this other format, where they speak to their Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, by video conference, and it is specifically that question of the briefing he will give alliance members about the situation on the ground, and no doubt what we talked about yesterday, Bianca, which was the sinking says Kyiv of the Russian warship. He is briefing his counterparts about military operations inside the country. But, it will also be about what kind of support they can continue to get from their NATO allies going forward. 
 
We know that that latest tranche of American money, the $60 billion, is currently stuck in Congress. It is 50 billion Euros worth of European support that was unblocked only a few weeks ago. And Jens Stoltenberg speaking to that very clearly in those comments you just heard there. It is, of course, about allies remaining united behind the central Article 5 of NATO that the attack on one would be an attack on all, the article that pledges mutual support in case of attack, but it is also, of course, very firmly about staying behind Ukraine in terms of the funding. 
 
And for the time being, whilst there has been less unity than there was, you need to only look at the holdup in the European funding and the holdup now in the American funding to see that the longer this goes on, the more difficult the unity and the strength of the support, keeping that momentum becomes, and yet, Europeans have managed it, and as I say, Lloyd Austin suggests that he is confident that the United States will too, Bianca.
 
NOBILO: Melissa Bell for us in Brussels, thank you so much. 
 
The Kansas City Chiefs have issued a statement saying they are saddened by the senseless act of violence at a rally celebrating their Super Bowl win. There are so many questions after Wednesday's shooting in Kansas City. Here, you see a crowd of fans dressed in red shirts, running from gunshots. According to police, 29 people were injured, most of them shot. A local radio DJ was shot and did not survive. Police have three people in custody in connection with the shooting. They found at least one gun at the scene. 
 
CNN's Whitney Wild joins us live from Kansas City. Whitney, what is the mood there like and what more can you tell us about those people who've been detained?
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: We're learning very little about the people who've been detained. We don't even know necessarily that they've been arrested because the police think they're the shooter. I mean, at this point, we know so little. We're hoping to learn more from Kansas City Police today. The mood here, shock, surprise. Brittany Mahomes, the wife of the Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tweeted out that she was highly embarrassed. I think it is a sense of total shock, because yesterday was a perfect day. The weather was beautiful. Million people turned out. All of that was ruined in an instant.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD (voice-over): A Super Bowl celebration marred by tragedy. In Kansas City, gunfire rang out following the parade celebrating the Chiefs' back-to-back Super Bowl wins.
 
CHIEF STACEY GRAVES, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, POLICE: I'm angry at what happened today. The people who came to the celebration should expect a safe environment. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Kansas City Police say three people are in custody for questioning. One person was killed and at least 21 others were shot. 
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
In a statement to CNN, Kansas City area radio station, KKFI, confirmed DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan was killed, writing they are devastated by this loss, as Lisa worked to bring a voice to the KC community. Children's Mercy Hospital confirms at least nine of the gunshot victims are children. Kansas City schools were closed Wednesday to allow students to attend the celebration. Kansas City's Mayor spoke about how he even considered bringing his child to the event. QUINTON LUCAS, MAYOR, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: I don't want us to have to in our country for every big event think about a concern of being shot. 
 
WILD (voice-over): The Kansas City Chiefs also speaking out, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and defensive end Charles Omenihu, who posted on X, "When are we going to fix these gun laws? How many more people have to die to say enough is enough?" 
 
And estimated one million people gathered in Downtown Kansas City to celebrate when shots rang out in quick succession just steps from where the team was holding a rally. 
 
ALYSSA MARSH-CONTRERAS, SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING WITNESS: You just hear pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And like I said, we're at a celebration, and I think a lot of people thought it were fireworks because nobody really ran or anything.
 
WILD (voice-over): Witnesses in the crowd spotted the alleged shooter and gave chase.
 
TONY, SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING WITNESS (VIA TELEPHONE): Once he took off running like instinctually, I just took off running after him. He was hopping barriers. I was hopping barriers, just trying to stay in somewhat distance of him, and that way I could -- if I could see a cop and help him identify that was the guy.
 
WILD (voice-over): Good Samaritans tackled the individual. Moments later, Police detained him. One of those good Samaritans says he saw a gun. 
 
PAUL CONTRERAS, SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING WITNESS: You don't think about it. It was just a reaction. He got close to me. I got the right angle on him and I hit him from behind. And when I hit him from behind, I either jarred the gun out of his hand or out of his sleeve, because as I'm taking him down to the ground, we were fighting him to keep him down. We didn't want to let him up and take off running because he had one gun. He may have had another one in that big bulky jacket.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD: It is still a horrible moment frozen in time here. There was debris everywhere. There are personal belongings littered all over Downtown Kansas City by Union Station. Normally, crews would be cleaning all of this up. Instead, Police are still working through a crime scene. Back to you. 
 
NOBILO: Whitney Wild, thank you. 
 
The coming hours could see a dramatic change for the racketeering case against Donald Trump in Georgia. A judge will hear a motion to disqualify the Fulton County District Attorney prosecuting the case. It all stems from allegations of an improper relationship between Fani Willis and the lead prosecutor in the case, Nathan Wade. They acknowledged their personal relationship but denied any wrongdoing. And we'll have more on that later in the hour. 
 
Still to come, a serious threat or political strategy, a U.S. Republican lawmaker says he has concerning new intelligence. So, why don't some of his colleagues seem quite so worried, when we come back?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: There are new concerns in the United States this morning of a potential new threat from Russia. It all began when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner announced the panel had information concerning a "serious national security threat." Multiple sources familiar with the Intel say it's related to Russian efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space. In a controversial move, Turner announced that he'd made the information available to all members of Congress, and he is urging President Biden to declassify the intelligence. But, several senior members of Congress briefed on the matter say the intelligence does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. or its interests. 
 
CNN's Katie Bo Lillis joins me now live from Washington. Katy Bo, what can you tell us about the capabilities of this technology, and whether or not that would pose a direct threat to the U.S. or its interests?
 
KATIE BO LILLIS, CNN REPORTER: Yeah. So, here is what we know at this point. U.S. officials who described this intelligence to CNN say that it is about a Russian effort to develop a nuclear anti-satellite capability for use in space. Now, it's important to emphasize right off the top that it's not clear at this point whether or not the intelligence refers to a nuclear-armed capability or a nuclear-powered capability. Obviously, a big distinction here. 
 
But, what is clear is that this technology, in theory, could imperil America's vast network of both commercial and military satellites, to include the satellites that are vital to America's command and control over its nuclear arsenal. Also important to note, this technology hasn't been deployed yet at this point. And it's not clear right now, according to sources that we spoke to, how far along the development process actually is, right, how sophisticated or effective this technology has actually become. 
 
And at this point, right now, according to officials that we spoke to who reviewed this intelligence, this is more in the realm of a longer term strategic threat to the United States, something that is important, something that U.S. officials need to know about and need to be able to respond to over the long term, but not an acute national security crisis, as some U.S. officials felt that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner, made it out to be in that cryptic statement that he issued yesterday, urging all members of Congress to come down to the Intelligence Committee's classified spaces to view a matter of urgent national security concerns. So, a lot of questions, I think, on Capitol Hill right now about why
 
 the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee chose to at this moment sort of push this incredibly sensitive intelligence into the public eye in such a dramatic fashion. By halfway through the day, we were hearing from the House -- from the Speaker of the House, a Republican also, Speaker Mike Johnson, who was coming out publicly and trying to allay some of the concerns about this urgent national security threat that the Intelligence Committee Chairman had referenced. 
 
Now, Turner, at this point, urging the Biden administration to declassify and make public as much information about this threat as they can about this intelligence as they cannot clear that that's going to happen. We heard even from the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that making this information public could likely damage very valuable sources and methods that the intelligence community uses to acquire this sort of intelligence. So, at this point, we are waiting right now for a briefing from the National Security Advisor to key members of the House today. That certainly will focus, I think, on the question of what can or cannot be made public. 
 
NOBILO: Katie Bo Lillis, thank you so much. 
 
LILLIS: Thank you.
 
NOBILO: As we reported earlier on in the show, Ukrainian officials say Russian strikes targeted cities across the country this morning. Explosions could be heard in the capital Kyiv, Lviv and Zaporizhzhia. At least seven people were injured. Regional officials say the strikes damaged apartment buildings and infrastructure. It comes a day after Ukraine says it sank a Russian warship in a sea drone attack off the coast of Crimea. Kyiv cave claims it's now disabled a third of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. 
 
Michael Bociurkiw, Global Affairs Analyst and Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, joins me now live from Odessa in Ukraine. It's fantastic to have the opportunity to speak to you, Michael. 
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
Always follow your work with interest. Let's start on those strikes, if I may. Tell us more about the extent of them, the damage that it has caused. We hear about these strikes happening so often now, but really paint a picture for us of what they were like for Ukrainians today.
 
MICHAEL BOCIURKIW, GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, &amp; SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Sure. Good to be with you, Bianca. Well, this was a massive strike. And we're finding more and more, the Russians are moving from overnight strikes to daytime strikes. This one was early in the morning, but went as far as Lviv in western Ukraine, which is closer to the Polish border. I heard from contacts there that there were loud explosions. Around a dozen or so old buildings were damaged, a school, a kindergarten. And elsewhere, further east in Ukraine, there were deaths reported. And just yesterday, in another Russian rocket attack, a maternity hospital once again was struck by Russian forces. You may remember, they did that in Mariupol. 
 
So, it's worried officials, but of course, civilians here, because we don't know when these attacks will happen. And also, they're using a mix of drones of rockets. And interestingly, Ukrainian officials say there may have been North Korean rockets involved this time.
 
NOBILO: That is interesting, indeed, as we heard in the latter half of last year that North Korea was stepping up its support of Russia via ammunition and military supplies. I'd like to get onto some of that in a moment. But, first, what is your view on the aid package that's currently being held up in the United States when it comes to Ukraine, the impact and essential nature of that in order for Kyiv to fend off the Russians or even hold the lines?
 
BOCIURKIW: Well, it's disgraceful that Republican lawmakers would even consider delaying it. This is money, Bianca, not only earmarked for defense, it's also earmarked for budget support. Currently, there is a $5 billion monthly gap in the Ukrainian budget. They need money desperately. If that money doesn't come, that means that teachers will not get salaries. It means that pensions will not be paid. It also is meant to go towards humanitarian support. 
 
I believe it was CNN's Nick Paton Walsh who said, if that money doesn't come in, it's so crucial that within two years we could see Ukraine fully occupied by Russia. What people have to understand on that side of the Atlantic are two things. Number one, this is a real deal what the U.S. is doing. With less than five percent of the U.S. Military budget, annual budget, they've enabled Ukraine to disable about 50 percent of conventional Russian military capability. And, of course, the other thing it's going to do is prevent further bottlenecks happening in the Black Sea. We're already experiencing serious bottlenecks in the Red Sea. This could delay further people's Tesla's, people's appliances, furniture, this sort of thing. So, it's going to hit people everywhere.
 
NOBILO: Ukraine is obviously already struggling when it comes to numbers. And there will be increasing manpower shortage, especially when we compare it to the numerical superiority of Russia that it's historically always had when it comes to conflict. That also emphasizes the importance of technology. This conflict has been quite novel in the way that it has used drones. And there is also some reports that Russia might be employing autonomous drones as well. What more can you tell us about how technology is changing this war?
 
BOCIURKIW: Well, Ukraine has not performed well on this long battlefront, and a big reason for that is the drip, drip approach of Western allies. So, let's turn to technology, and its technology that has allowed very savvy strikes on Russian forces, but it's also the very same technology we're talking about that enabled Ukraine to sink that Russian boat, the Black Sea Fleet the other day. So, they're not expensive. And the other thing that's happening, I mean, before the war, Ukraine had a very robust high tech sector, especially in the field. That is now being repurposed for military purposes. So, Ukraine has a very big advantage there, but it isn't going to allow them to achieve victory alone. NOBILO: You're in Odessa, which is on the Black Sea. Tell us more
 
 about what's happening there and Ukraine's success in targeting Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
 
BOCIURKIW: Sure. Well, in a news story, where there is not very much good news, especially among the battlefront, what Ukraine is being able to achieve on the waters is absolutely stunning, second time in two weeks that Ukraine has been able to use these high tech maritime drones to sink a vessel of the Black Sea Fleet. We're talking about the Caesar Kunikov. It carries troops, tanks and other cargo. It can carry about 87 men. And it's also been used in other theatres of war by Russia. So, what is happening is it has forced Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of War, to base -

REAR ADM. MARE MIGUEZ, COMMANDER, CARRIER STRIKE GROUP 2: -- electronic attack.
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (VOICE-OVER): The Commander of the Carrier Strike Group told CNN they will stay in the Red Sea for as long as necessary.
 
MIGUEZ: The sustainability, we can go for a long time. We've got our logistics train already mapped out to stay here as long as the President needs us to stay here.
 
BERTRAND: Now, one of the biggest questions that we were left with, Poppy and Phil, is just how much of the Houthis' capabilities the U.S. has managed to destroy in its strikes inside Yemen on Houthi targets over the last several weeks, These strikes have become extremely regular, happening on a near daily basis. But, officials could not give us a good sense of just how much of the Houthis' weaponry the U.S. has actually managed to destroy. That is going to be a really key part of how the U.S. determines how long this operation against the Houthis is actually going to need to last. Poppy, Phil.

But, that's not an alternative to NATO. That is actually a way to strengthen NATO. And we should not pursue any path that indicates that we are trying to divide Europe from North America. The strength is that we have Europe and North America together in NATO.

NOBILO: The NATO meeting comes as Ukrainian officials say Russian strikes targeted cities across the country this morning. Seven people were reported injured. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell joins me live from Brussels. Melissa, how large are former President Trump's comments looming over this summit?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've heard so many reactions to them over the course of the last few days and hours coming into this meeting, not only from Jen Stoltenberg himself pushing back on the suggestion that NATO allies are not doing their fair share very forcefully and pointing out that for the first time it is 18 of NATO's 31 alliance members that will be meeting their commitment to two percent of GDP spending on their defense budgets. And of course, that is in direct response to what Donald Trump had said. Jen Stoltenberg had spoken to his comments on Sunday and he has done so again coming to this meeting. 
 
But, we've also heard from other defense secretaries coming here in Brussels, also reminding the world of the importance of the strength and unity of NATO, not least from the American Defense Secretary. 
 <br>[08:10:00]
 
Now, he hasn't been attending in person, Bianca, because he is still recovering from his bladder issues in Washington. But, he did speak to his counterparts via video conference, saying that --speaking not only to the fact that he believed that the bill currently in Congress, now approved by the Senate but still uncertain in terms of its progress on the floor of the House, will get through, also saying that he believes that not only would Ukraine not surrender, but the United States wouldn't either. So, there was a very strong message there from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin going into the meeting to sort of counteract the kind of rhetoric and language that we've been hearing from Donald Trump, which really has rattled NATO allies, and specifically Europeans, at this time when they feel very keenly, Bianca, their vulnerability vis-a-vis Moscow. 
 
So, a real sense that this needed to be as loud message of NATO members meeting here today as a result, not only that they would remain unified, but that they would remain very firmly behind Ukraine.
 
NOBILO: Melissa, what discussions are being had about the nature, duration and extent of future support for Ukraine? And is there unanimity among ministers of defense from NATO member countries when it comes to that?
 
BELL: Well, that is exactly the question that is being discussed now in -- by the Ukraine contact group. The NATO defense ministers have now moved into this other format, where they speak to their Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, by video conference, and it is specifically that question of the briefing he will give alliance members about the situation on the ground, and no doubt what we talked about yesterday, Bianca, which was the sinking says Kyiv of the Russian warship. He is briefing his counterparts about military operations inside the country. But, it will also be about what kind of support they can continue to get from their NATO allies going forward. 
 
We know that that latest tranche of American money, the $60 billion, is currently stuck in Congress. It is 50 billion Euros worth of European support that was unblocked only a few weeks ago. And Jens Stoltenberg speaking to that very clearly in those comments you just heard there. It is, of course, about allies remaining united behind the central Article 5 of NATO that the attack on one would be an attack on all, the article that pledges mutual support in case of attack, but it is also, of course, very firmly about staying behind Ukraine in terms of the funding. 
 
And for the time being, whilst there has been less unity than there was, you need to only look at the holdup in the European funding and the holdup now in the American funding to see that the longer this goes on, the more difficult the unity and the strength of the support, keeping that momentum becomes, and yet, Europeans have managed it, and as I say, Lloyd Austin suggests that he is confident that the United States will too, Bianca.
 
NOBILO: Melissa Bell for us in Brussels, thank you so much. 
 
The Kansas City Chiefs have issued a statement saying they are saddened by the senseless act of violence at a rally celebrating their Super Bowl win. There are so many questions after Wednesday's shooting in Kansas City. Here, you see a crowd of fans dressed in red shirts, running from gunshots. According to police, 29 people were injured, most of them shot. A local radio DJ was shot and did not survive. Police have three people in custody in connection with the shooting. They found at least one gun at the scene. 
 
CNN's Whitney Wild joins us live from Kansas City. Whitney, what is the mood there like and what more can you tell us about those people who've been detained?
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: We're learning very little about the people who've been detained. We don't even know necessarily that they've been arrested because the police think they're the shooter. I mean, at this point, we know so little. We're hoping to learn more from Kansas City Police today. The mood here, shock, surprise. Brittany Mahomes, the wife of the Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tweeted out that she was highly embarrassed. I think it is a sense of total shock, because yesterday was a perfect day. The weather was beautiful. Million people turned out. All of that was ruined in an instant.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD (voice-over): A Super Bowl celebration marred by tragedy. In Kansas City, gunfire rang out following the parade celebrating the Chiefs' back-to-back Super Bowl wins.
 
CHIEF STACEY GRAVES, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, POLICE: I'm angry at what happened today. The people who came to the celebration should expect a safe environment. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Kansas City Police say three people are in custody for questioning. One person was killed and at least 21 others were shot. 
 <br>[08:15:00]
 
In a statement to CNN, Kansas City area radio station, KKFI, confirmed DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan was killed, writing they are devastated by this loss, as Lisa worked to bring a voice to the KC community. Children's Mercy Hospital confirms at least nine of the gunshot victims are children. Kansas City schools were closed Wednesday to allow students to attend the celebration. Kansas City's Mayor spoke about how he even considered bringing his child to the event.
 
QUINTON LUCAS, MAYOR, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: I don't want us to have to in our country for every big event think about a concern of being shot. 
 
WILD (voice-over): The Kansas City Chiefs also speaking out, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and defensive end Charles Omenihu, who posted on X, "When are we going to fix these gun laws? How many more people have to die to say enough is enough?" 
 
And estimated one million people gathered in Downtown Kansas City to celebrate when shots rang out in quick succession just steps from where the team was holding a rally. 
 
ALYSSA MARSH-CONTRERAS, SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING WITNESS: You just hear pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And like I said, we're at a celebration, and I think a lot of people thought it were fireworks because nobody really ran or anything.
 
WILD (voice-over): Witnesses in the crowd spotted the alleged shooter and gave chase.
 
TONY, SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING WITNESS (VIA TELEPHONE): Once he took off running like instinctually, I just took off running after him. He was hopping barriers. I was hopping barriers, just trying to stay in somewhat distance of him, and that way I could -- if I could see a cop and help him identify that was the guy.
 
WILD (voice-over): Good Samaritans tackled the individual. Moments later, Police detained him. One of those good Samaritans says he saw a gun. 
 
PAUL CONTRERAS, SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING WITNESS: You don't think about it. It was just a reaction. He got close to me. I got the right angle on him and I hit him from behind. And when I hit him from behind, I either jarred the gun out of his hand or out of his sleeve, because as I'm taking him down to the ground, we were fighting him to keep him down. We didn't want to let him up and take off running because he had one gun. He may have another one in that big bulky jacket.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILD: It is still a horrible moment frozen in time here. There was debris everywhere. There are personal belongings littered all over Downtown Kansas City by Union Station. Normally, crews would be cleaning all of this up. Instead, Police are still working through a crime scene. Back to you. 
 
NOBILO: Whitney Wild, thank you. 
 
The coming hours could see a dramatic change for the racketeering case against Donald Trump in Georgia. A judge will hear a motion to disqualify the Fulton County District Attorney prosecuting the case. It all stems from allegations of an improper relationship between Fani Willis and the lead prosecutor in the case, Nathan Wade. They acknowledged their personal relationship but denied any wrongdoing. And we'll have more on that later in the hour. 
 
Still to come, a serious threat or political strategy, a U.S. Republican lawmaker says he has concerning new intelligence. So, why don't some of his colleagues seem quite so worried, when we come back?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: There are new concerns in the United States this morning of a potential new threat from Russia. It all began when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner announced the panel had information concerning a "serious national security threat." Multiple sources familiar with the Intel say it's related to Russian efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space. In a controversial move, Turner announced that he'd made the information available to all members of Congress, and he is urging President Biden to declassify the intelligence. But, several senior members of Congress briefed on the matter say the intelligence does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. or its interests. 
 
CNN's Katie Bo Lillis joins me now live from Washington. Katy Bo, what can you tell us about the capabilities of this technology, and whether or not that would pose a direct threat to the U.S. or its interests?
 
KATIE BO LILLIS, CNN REPORTER: Yeah. So, here is what we know at this point. U.S. officials who described this intelligence to CNN say that it is about a Russian effort to develop a nuclear anti-satellite capability for use in space. Now, it's important to emphasize right off the top that it's not clear at this point whether or not the intelligence refers to a nuclear-armed capability or a nuclear-powered capability. Obviously, a big distinction here. 
 
But, what is clear is that this technology, in theory, could imperil America's vast network of both commercial and military satellites, to include the satellites that are vital to America's command and control over its nuclear arsenal. Also important to note, this technology hasn't been deployed yet at this point. And it's not clear right now, according to sources that we spoke to, how far along the development process actually is, right, how sophisticated or effective this technology has actually become. 
 
And at this point, right now, according to officials that we spoke to who reviewed this intelligence, this is more in the realm of a longer term strategic threat to the United States, something that is important, something that U.S. officials need to know about and need to be able to respond to over the long term, but not an acute national security crisis, as some U.S. officials felt that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner, made it out to be in that cryptic statement that he issued yesterday, urging all members of Congress to come down to the Intelligence Committee's classified spaces to view a matter of urgent national security concerns. 
 
So, a lot of questions, I think, on Capitol Hill right now about why the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee chose to at this moment sort of push this incredibly sensitive intelligence into the public eye in such a dramatic fashion. By halfway through the day, we were hearing from the House -- from the Speaker of the House, a Republican also, Speaker Mike Johnson, who was coming out publicly and trying to allay some of the concerns about this urgent national security threat that the Intelligence Committee Chairman had referenced. 
 
Now, Turner, at this point, urging the Biden administration to declassify and make public as much information about this threat as they can about this intelligence as they cannot clear that that's going to happen. We heard even from the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that making this information public could likely damage very valuable sources and methods that the intelligence community uses to acquire this sort of intelligence. So, at this point, we are waiting right now for a briefing from the National Security Advisor to key members of the House today. That certainly will focus, I think, on the question of what can or cannot be made public. 
 
NOBILO: Katie Bo Lillis, thank you so much. 
 
LILLIS: Thank you.
 
NOBILO: As we reported earlier on in the show, Ukrainian officials say Russian strikes targeted cities across the country this morning. Explosions could be heard in the capital Kyiv, Lviv and Zaporizhzhia. At least seven people were injured. Regional officials say the strikes damaged apartment buildings and infrastructure. It comes a day after Ukraine says it sank a Russian warship in a sea drone attack off the coast of Crimea. Kyiv cave claims it's now disabled a third of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. 
 
Michael Bociurkiw, Global Affairs Analyst and Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, joins me now live from Odessa in Ukraine. It's fantastic to have the opportunity to speak to you, Michael. 
 <br>[08:25:00]
 
Always follow your work with interest. Let's start on those strikes, if I may. Tell us more about the extent of them, the damage that it has caused. We hear about these strikes happening so often now, but really paint a picture for us of what they were like for Ukrainians today.
 
MICHAEL BOCIURKIW, GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, &amp; SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Sure. Good to be with you, Bianca. Well, this was a massive strike. And we're finding more and more, the Russians are moving from overnight strikes to daytime strikes. This one was early in the morning, but went as far as Lviv in western Ukraine, which is closer to the Polish border. I heard from contacts there that there were loud explosions. Around a dozen or so old buildings were damaged, a school, a kindergarten. And elsewhere, further east in Ukraine, there were deaths reported. And just yesterday, in another Russian rocket attack, a maternity hospital once again was struck by Russian forces. You may remember, they did that in Mariupol. 
 
So, it's worried officials, but of course, civilians here, because we don't know when these attacks will happen. And also, they're using a mix of drones of rockets. And interestingly, Ukrainian officials say there may have been North Korean rockets involved this time. NOBILO: That is interesting, indeed, as we heard in the latter half of last year that North Korea was stepping up its support of Russia via ammunition and military supplies. I'd like to get onto some of that in a moment. But, first, what is your view on the aid package that's currently being held up in the United States when it comes to Ukraine, the impact and essential nature of that in order for Kyiv to fend off the Russians or even hold the lines?
 
BOCIURKIW: Well, it's disgraceful that Republican lawmakers would even consider delaying it. This is money, Bianca, not only earmarked for defense, it's also earmarked for budget support. Currently, there is a $5 billion monthly gap in the Ukrainian budget. They need money desperately. If that money doesn't come, that means that teachers will not get salaries. It means that pensions will not be paid. It also is meant to go towards humanitarian support. 
 
I believe it was CNN's Nick Paton Walsh who said, if that money doesn't come in, it's so crucial that within two years we could see Ukraine fully occupied by Russia. What people have to understand on that side of the Atlantic are two things. Number one, this is a real deal what the U.S. is doing. With less than five percent of the U.S. Military budget, annual budget, they've enabled Ukraine to disable about 50 percent of conventional Russian military capability. And, of course, the other thing it's going to do is prevent further bottlenecks happening in the Black Sea. We're already experiencing serious bottlenecks in the Red Sea. This could delay further people's Tesla's, people's appliances, furniture, this sort of thing. So, it's going to hit people everywhere.
 
NOBILO: Ukraine is obviously already struggling when it comes to numbers. And there will be increasing manpower shortage, especially when we compare it to the numerical superiority of Russia that it's historically always had when it comes to conflict. That also emphasizes the importance of technology. This conflict has been quite novel in the way that it has used drones. And there is also some reports that Russia might be employing autonomous drones as well. What more can you tell us about how technology is changing this war?
 
BOCIURKIW: Well, Ukraine has not performed well on this long battlefront, and a big reason for that is the drip, drip approach of Western allies. So, let's turn to technology, and its technology that has allowed very savvy strikes on Russian forces, but it's also the very same technology we're talking about that enabled Ukraine to sink that Russian boat, the Black Sea Fleet the other day. So, they're not expensive. And the other thing that's happening, I mean, before the war, Ukraine had a very robust high tech sector, especially in the field. That is now being repurposed for military purposes. So, Ukraine has a very big advantage there, but it isn't going to allow them to achieve victory alone. 
 
NOBILO: You're in Odessa, which is on the Black Sea. Tell us more about what's happening there and Ukraine's success in targeting Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
 
BOCIURKIW: Sure. Well, in a news story, where there is not very much good news, especially among the battlefront, what Ukraine is being able to achieve on the waters is absolutely stunning, second time in two weeks that Ukraine has been able to use these high tech maritime drones to sink a vessel of the Black Sea Fleet. We're talking about the Caesar Kunikov. It carries troops, tanks and other cargo. It can carry about 87 men, and it's also been used in other theatres of war by Russia. 
 <br>[08:30:00]
 
So, what is happening is it has forced Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of war, to base their Black Sea Fleet further away from this theater of war, but also it has allowed Ukraine to resume use of the port, which is about a five-minute walk away for me. It's absolutely bustling. Bianca. You'd be so impressed if you saw it. It's back to about 70% to almost 100% capacity, grain, sunflower oil, going to the world's consumers. So, it's a very, very crucial part of the global food supply chain. It's fantastic news for everybody. 
 
NOBILO: Michael Bociurkiw, thank you so much for joining us today from Ukraine with your thoughts. Really appreciate it. 
 
BOCIURKIW: My pleasure.
 
NOBILO: Coming up, Donald Trump's legal calendar is once again filling up. Today, he has two separate hearings in two different states. We'll break it all down when we come back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
NOBILO: Welcome back. More now on our top story. "Doctors Without Borders" is calling for Israeli forces to immediately stop the attack on Gaza's largest functioning hospital. The IDF says Hamas terrorists are likely hiding behind injured civilians inside Nasser Hospital. Hamas has denied that it's operating inside the facility. 
 
The move comes a day after the IDF ordered hundreds of displaced Palestinians, who were using the facility as a shelter, to leave. Doctors and medical officials say Israeli snipers shot at some of those people trying to flee. 
 
Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office is rejecting talk of a Palestinian state, saying this is not the time to be speaking about "gifts for the Palestinian people." Benjamin Netanyahu is also vowing what he called powerful action in the southern Gaza city of Rafah despite mounting international concern about that. 
 
CNN's Paula Hancocks is covering these developments from Abu Dhabi, and she joins us now live. Paula, there are evacuation orders and a corridor, if you'd like, in place, technically the IDF has outlined, although there is reports of sniper fire of people who are trying to use that. However, what are people, who are patients within the hospital who are requiring medical attention, expected to do in this scenario? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, it is an extremely difficult situation we're hearing from some of those medics within the hospital itself. "Doctors Without Borders" saying that their staff did have to leave the hospital and they did have to leave patients behind, saying that one of their members was also detained by an Israeli military checkpoint on the way out of the hospital itself. 
 
So, the Israeli military is within this compound, within part of the area. We can see from the images that came through to us from some of those still in the hospitals that were filming Israeli strikes, just how difficult the situation is. There were bloodied patients, a very dusty area. The "Doctors Without Borders" saying an undetermined number of people have been killed and have been injured in this particular operation. 
 
Now, we're hearing from the Israeli side that they believe and they say they have credible evidence also from former hostages that some hostages were held in that hospital. They believe that could be the bodies of deceased hostages. And we're hearing from a doctor, medical sources within the hospital where IDF bulldozers are digging up some of the graves that have been formed within the compound itself looking for those bodies. So, an incredibly difficult situation, not just for patients, for doctors, also for the displaced, who may have been hiding in that particular area believing it was safer than other areas. The Israeli military saying they should evacuate. 
 
But, we have been hearing from eyewitnesses and from medical personnel within the hospital that there have been Israeli snipers that have taken out and killed some of those that have tried to leave. Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Paula, when we spoke earlier to our colleague, Nic Robertson, he was saying something I've heard several people say in recent days, which is that Netanyahu might be using this specter of a further ground incursion into Rafah as leverage in these peace talks that are going on these hostage negotiations with Hamas. Is there any suggestion that that's working? What do we know about the state of those discussions? 
 
HANCOCKS: Well, we've heard from Hamas that if there is an Israeli invasion of Rafah, then then the hostage negotiations are at an end, that that would, in their words, blow up the hostage exchange negotiations. Now, there have been suggestions that the Israeli Prime Minister is being so determined and doubling down on this invasion for the very reason of trying to put more pressure on Hamas. We simply don't know if that is the case. 
 
But, what we are seeing is an incredible number of world leaders vocalizing their concern, using quite emotive language in many cases, warning Israel not to carry out this invasion. We've heard the UN aid chief, for example, say that it could be a slaughter of it were to go ahead. We heard Israel's leader saying that it should not go ahead, that it appears that Israel is not listening to any other country in the world, including the United States. We have had a joint statement from Australia, Canada, New Zealand today saying it would be catastrophic if this were to happen. So, the sheer number of world leaders against this is growing by the day. Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Paula Hancocks, always good to speak to you. Thank you. It's another busy legal day for Donald Trump. These are live pictures
 
 of his motorcade which just left Trump Tower. He is headed for yet another court hearing. He actually has two court hearings this morning, one in New York, the other in Georgia. In Manhattan, a judge is going to hear the former President's bid to throw out his hush money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump is expected to attend that one in person. 
 <br>[08:40:00]
 
And in Georgia, Trump's lawyers will be seeking to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis and her top prosecutor over what they're calling an improper relationship. Trump is being charged t there with election interference. 
 
CNN's Katelyn Polantz is all over this, and she joins me live from New York. Katelyn, what are you looking out for today? 
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Bianca, the two hearings, they're both in criminal cases against Donald Trump, two of the four criminal indictments that Donald Trump faces as a defendant. But, take note of the one he is attending today by his own choice, the one in New York. This is potentially a momentous day for Donald Trump as a criminal defendant, because not only is the judge going to be talking about the validity of the charges against him and ruling on whether that case should be tossed, or certain counts of it, 34 different criminal charges, whether any of that should be tossed, the judge is also going to be talking about the trial date. 
 
And this case in New York, the hush money case, where Trump is alleged to have falsified business records to cover up $130,000 payments to Stormy Daniels, the porn star that he was trying to silence before the 2016 election, that is a moment that we could see the judge say, Donald Trump is going to trial. This will be the first trial and it will stay on the calendar for the end of March, which is what it is scheduled for now. So, we could have this moment in court today where Trump is facing the judge, and that date is locked in as best as it could to have him sit before trial for the very first time, as soon as this spring while he is still running for President and could be the nominee of the Republican Party by that point. 
 
On the other side in Georgia, this other criminal case, what's happening there is a stress test of the ethics of the prosecution team. There is a relationship that the District Attorney Fani Willis has admitted to having with her top prosecutor on the Trump case, Nathan Wade. They are special prosecutors leading this case against Donald Trump and 14 other people, a racketeering case, a very large case not scheduled for trial yet. But, in that case today, the judge is looking at whether there has been any ethical and financial impropriety that would pose such a conflict of interest or such a smear on the validity of the case and people's confidence in the case, the public's confidence for the prosecutors to bring this case. The judge will look at whether Fani Willis and her top prosecutor need to step down. 
 
Katelyn Polantz, thank you so much. CNN will have special coverage of both hearings that are set to begin very soon, coming up next hour. 
 
Also we have some stories. So, for same-sex couples in Greece today is set to be a landmark day. We'll explain why that is, as well as a couple of other stories for you after this short break. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: In South Korea, three former police officers have been sentenced in connection with the 2022 deadly Halloween crowd crush tragedy. Nearly 160 people were killed in the capital Seoul during a surge in a crowded alley. A former intelligence officer was sentenced to 18 months in prison for destroying evidence. Two subordinates got shorter suspended sentences. Court documents say they deleted police reports warning of crowd-related incidents. 
 
In a few hours, LGBTQ couples in Greece could welcome a new future. The country's parliament is voting to legalize same-sex civil marriages, despite opposition by the Greek Orthodox Church. If passed, the legislation will give same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples. 
 
Journalist Elinda Labropoulou joins me now live from Athens. Elinda, tell us more about the history of how the country has got to this point, and how people feel now about the likely passage of this bill. 
 
ELINDA LABROPOULOU, JOUNALIST: Well, if you ask the activists, they'll tell you it's been a long and uphill battle that has been going on for years. Now, Greece recognized civil partnerships 10 years ago, so same-sex parents could go into a partnership, but not a wedding. This is likely to change today, giving them more rights, putting them on an equal footing as other couples. The debate at stake here has been very much about parenthood and whether people can adopt. So, this is something that now they will be able to do. Same-sex couples will be able to adopt. But, it has stopped ahead of a surrogacy issue. This is something that they will not be allowed to do. This has been the most controversial issue along the way. 
 
The history of this battle basically has very much involved the church, the Orthodox Church of Greece. About 80 percent of the population of Greece are Orthodox. It's a majority Orthodox Christian country, and the church is very, very influential. The church has been extremely against all this from this very beginning. And now, it seems that it has taken a center-right government to come into this and try to vote this through. It is quite remarkable that this is actually happening. 
 
If you look at the public opinion, people are very much divided on whether they should or shouldn't. Most people seem to agree that, yes, to the weddings, but not necessarily to the parenthood. Well, the Prime Minister has said this as a matter of equality. It's something that puts Greece on the same footing as other European countries. 15 out of the 27 EU countries have already voted in support. But, the difference in Greece is that you're looking at a southern country, a country with more traditional values. So, it has taken a lot of effort and also a lot of support from the parties of the left to see this through. We expect the bill today to go through, but we expect that the Prime Minister will not enjoy full support from his own party, and it will take the parties from the left to come in and assist him. 
 
Meanwhile, activists are starting to gather around parliament, which is where I am, and now we also expect opponents to come later on as this battle continues and leads us to the vote later tonight, Bianca. 
 
NOBILO: Elinda Labropoulou, thank you very much. Good to see you. 
 
In Peru, same-sex marriage is not permitted. But, that didn't stop these couples from taking the plunge. Surrounded by their families and friends, the LGBTQ couples exchanged rings and vows in a so-called Love Park. The organizers of the annual event in the capital Lima are calling for marriage equality in the conservative South American nation. 
 
Still to come, from slow to sluggish to just stop, Japan's economy shifts are going into reverse gear and into a recession. Unfortunately, more details on that when we return. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:50:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NOBILO: They say that with age comes wisdom, but unfortunately, that is no consolation to Japan. Its aging population means the country's productivity has fallen, and now its economy has slipped into recession. 
 
Hanako Montgomery explains how that happened. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Japan's economy is now the fourth largest in the world, a reflection of its aging demographics and weak currency. We know that Japan is experiencing a demographic crisis. Over 10 percent of its population is over the age of 80. Nearly a third of the country is 65 and above, which is very close to retirement age. Now, what this means for the Japanese economy is that it's less productive. You have less people working and making money in the country, which means the GDP gets smaller and smaller. According to the latest data from the Japanese government, the 2023 nominal GDP in Japan was $4.2 trillion. Germany, on the other hand, was $4.4 trillion in 2023, which means that Germany now has the world's third largest economy. 
 
Now, I've been living in the country for over three years now, and it's not hard to tell that Japan is a super-aged society. You don't have to go very far. Just a trip to the doctor's office and most other patients there are elderly people. But, it's not just the demographic crisis that's affecting Japan's GDP. It also has to do with currency movements. So, right now, the Japanese Yen is very weak against the dollar, and we calculate GDP in dollar terms. Last year, on average, the Japanese Yen was worth about 141 Yen to the dollar. 10 years ago, it was worth 80 Yen to the dollar. 
 
Now, the final factor affecting Japan's shrinking GDP is private consumption. We know that over half of Japan's economy is private consumption. But, in the last quarter, it fell 0.2 percent because prices in Japan were soaring, and people were less inclined to buy food, goods and other items. These are all reasons why Japan's economy is now the fourth largest in the world, not the third. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NOBILO: Your word is also bad news for Britain's Prime Minister, who pledged to grow the economy ahead of this year's general election. A combination of higher inflation and interest rates dampened consumer spending. UK GDP dropped by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter following a slight decline in the third quarter. And of course, a recession is defined by two or more consecutive quarters of contracting output.
