UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today, we acknowledge Juneteenth as a global celebration for freedom.
 
Now a national holiday, Juneteenth is the direct result of centuries of resistance and revolution by Black people leading a fight for their liberation.
 
In 1861, tension between the North and the South reached its breaking point over slavery and statehood, and the Civil War began.
 
On January 1, 1863, as the nation approached its third year of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation declaring that all people held as slaves within the Confederate-controlled states were now free. The Proclamation also granted Black men access into a struggling Union Army.
 
By the end of the war, more than 200,000 Black soldiers known as the United States Colored Troops had enlisted, becoming instrumental to the union's victory.
 
The Civil War officially ended in April of 1865, but it wasn't until June 19th of that year, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation that thousands of colored troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, alongside Major General Gordon Granger to read General Order Number 3, informing the last enslaved Black people that they were now free. That day would become the true marker of freedom in America.
 
In 2021, Juneteenth, also called Emancipation Day, Freedom Day, Jubilee Day and Black Independence Day became an official federal holiday sparking a global celebration.
 
On this day, we honor the resilience, ingenuity, and determination it took for Black people to take hold of the very essence of what it means to be in American.
 
Freedom.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here to lead us in the singing of the Black national anthem, please welcome gospel music legend, Kirk Franklin

ANNOUNCER: Juneteenth is an American story where the last remaining slaves of the Confederacy were officially set free two years after Emancipation. After that day, many newly freed men and women traveled to what is recognized as the Emancipation Trail, a route that led them directly from Galveston to the heart of a newly developing city in Texas called Houston.
 
Jack Yates, a formerly enslaved and educated Black man was among the free people who settled in Houston. Within the first year of his arrival, Yates started the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church to be a safe place for Black folks to learn, gather, and build.
 
JACKIE BOSTIC, YATES GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER: Reverend Yates was a community leader, a visionary and he helped to ensure that the Houston area had a viable community of Black citizens that had their own businesses, had their own homes and their own institutions.
 
LOU MCELROY, PASTOR, ANTIOCH MISSIONARY: This area was Houston's Black Wall Street, you had blacksmiths. You had folks that ran printing shops. You saw Blacks elected to public office.
 
And so this is this drive that's coming out of slavery and beating the challenges that were set before them.
 
ANNOUNCER: As Freedmen Town and others surrounding Black neighborhoods began to take shape, Yates set his sights on leading a community effort to purchase land. That land became Emancipation Park, serving as a hub for all freed Black people to congregate, organize, and celebrate Juneteenth for more than 150 years.
 
BOSTIC: It was bought by the formerly enslaved people. No one gave it to them. They had the imagination. They had the vision and they had a willingness to do what it took to own the land.
 
Emancipation Park is actually the first park that was bought and owned by citizens in the city of Houston. There was no other park period in the city of Houston in 1872 for anybody.
 
JACQUELINE BOSTIC-ELROY, YATES GREAT-GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER: They wanted to be able to come together as a community, a broader community, and purchasing the park gave them that opportunity.
 
BOSTIC: They would dress up. They would get on their horses and their buggies celebrating their freedom. They were very proud of being freed.
 
ANNOUNCER: Today, Emancipation Park remains a historical site in the city of Houston and as new generations embrace its history, build new memories, and join in on the celebration of Juneteenth, its existence serves as a reminder of what is truly possible with freedom.
 
BOSTIC: We owe it not only to ourselves, but to our children, our grandchildren, our great grandchildren and to everybody around us to help us out to understand how important freedom is.
 
ROMEO, KDAY MORNING SHOW W/ ROMEO: Welcome back to JUNETEENTH: A GLOBAL CELEBRATION FOR FREEDOM.
 
LA, make some noise. My name is Romeo from 93.5 KDAY Morning Show and yes, we've get a lot of special artists coming on stage, but coming to the stage right now, he is the best in the game. He ain't never changed.

 <br>[20:20:10]

MIGUEL: Love you, LA. Happy Juneteenth.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Welcome back to the global celebration for freedom. Here to celebrate Juneteenth, all the way from our nation's capital, the 49th vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. And happy Juneteenth.
 
So tonight, with joy, we gather with friends and family to celebrate America's newest national holiday.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
So when I served in the United States Senate, I was proud to co- sponsor a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. And as vice president, it was my honor to stand beside our President, Joe Biden, as he signed the legislation that finally made that dream a reality.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Today, Americans from all walks of life come together to celebrate Juneteenth, to honor black excellence, culture and community, to remember our nation's full history, and to celebrate one of our founding principles, the principle of freedom.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
America is a promise. A promise of freedom, liberty and justice. The story of Juneteenth as we celebrate it is the story of our ongoing fight to realize America's promise, not for some, but for all.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
So, as we gather tonight, let us remember the words of the great Coretta Scott King. The fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation. She reminds us that our freedoms will not be permanent unless we, in each generation, are vigilant to protect them.
 
So let us all stand together as Americans to teach and honor our history, to protect our liberty and to continue the fight for freedom. Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
And now it is my honor as a proud HBCU graduate to welcome to the stage a group of incredible performers from our Divine Nine. Have a good evening.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[20:45:55]
 
OMAR TATE, CO-OWNER &amp; CHEF: Food insecurity happens to anyone who simply can't reach it. Like if you can't reach food, then you are food insecure. You can be sitting on the mountain of money, but if you can't come down off that mountain and get yourself an onion, how you going to eat?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Renowned chefs Omar Tate and Cybille St. Aude- Tate have chosen to plant their food and their talents in the heart of West Philly on 48th Street.
 
CYBILLE ST. AUDE-TATE, CO-OWNER &amp; CHEF: Honeysuckle Provisions is an Afrocentric grocery cafe. This area, it was very difficult to find like fresh produce, fresh ingredients, so this felt like the right place to be. Omar's mom was living in like, a couple of blocks away from here at the time, and I think it really hit -- close to home that she had to go pretty far to find produce to live. That was pretty obvious to us that we were needed and more stores and more places like us are needed.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thousands of cities in the U.S. face the same access challenges as West Philly. In North Tulsa, Oklahoma, just a mile from historical black Wall Street, AJ Johnson, born and raised in the city, responded to the need by opening Oasis Fresh Market, Tulsa's first black owned grocery store in 50 years.
 
AJ JOHNSON, OWNER: There are $10 generals, but yet this is the first fresh and healthy access grocery store in North Tulsa.
 
C. TATE: We did a lot of market research and case studies before we kind of settled down to understand what our community needed. And what we found was that folks were literally leaving our community, leaving their community to go and find healthy food.
 
JOHNSON: If we were to overlay a U.S. map and highlight food deserts, the majority of the food deserts that exist in America, anywhere from 70 percent to 80 percent of that are black and brown communities. And then if you were on top of that to lay a map of the life expectancy for these communities, you would see that underserved communities, not just in Tulsa alone, but across the country, are dying because of that very shortage or lack of fresh and healthy access.
 
We might be free as a people, but if we're tied to an unhealthy diet or an unhealthy food system, are we truly free?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The legacy of disparity in America has created a problem that requires both policy change and united community work to solve.
 
O. TATE: I think there's a bit of a revolution happening where these communities, these neighborhoods, us, we are either creating or demanding fresh access to foods.
 
JOHNSON: Really, we just want to meet the needs of our community where they are. That's the hope for Oasis. That's the hope for North Tulsa in Baltimore and Memphis and Atlanta and Chicago and L.A. and Dallas, is to bring that hope, is to bring that refuge, that safe place, shelter and serve people in a great way.
 
ROMEO, DJ &amp; HOST OF "THE KDAY MORNING SHOW": We are all the way live on CNN L.A. When I say June, you say teenth. June.
 
ALL: Teenth.
