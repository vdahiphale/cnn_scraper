KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I absolutely agree that I think there's still a dark horse candidate out there. I still think I'm sure I'll be -- I'll be shouted down later, but I still think Nikki Haley as a possibility here. 
 
You had Donald Trump come out of the events this weekend, saying he wants to put forward a unifying message. He said he's alluded to the fact that his choice is going to be a surprise. 
 
He wanted -- if you want to send a message that your about to --
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Unifying is the name.
 
BEDINGFIELD: Unify. And another -- another possibility, I would argue that Haley carries a little bit more of the -- she sends a more unifying signal in this moment. But you know, we'll see.
 
COOPER: We'll see.
 
JONAH GOLDBERG, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, I think there's a lot of logic to picking Nikki Haley in terms of winning over the Haley anti-Trump vote. 
 
The problem is, is that Haley divides the GOP now in a way that a Glenn Youngkin does not every.
 
Not everybody loves Glenn Youngkin, but nobody hates Glenn Youngkin in the GOP coalition. There are people who have very hard feelings about Nikki Haley. I think they could get over them, but -- and maybe they would if Trump picked her. Because the party would -- would unify around anybody.
 
I agree with Amanda on Vance, though. The pick has never made much sense to me in that people always say, well, he can win over blue- collar people in Ohio and Michigan.
 
The blue-collar people that are inclined to go for Trump are already going for Trump. And J.D. Vance is not the guy to win them over. And he's certainly not the guy to win over skeptical suburban housewives or any of those -- that crowd.
 
But I've also always said, including a bunch of times on air, that the more the Trump team thinks he's going to win, the more Vance's chances improve. Because he's not a campaign pick. He's a governing pick.
 
To put in much more serious MAGA people in all of those positions in government that -- like Mike Pence did a lot of good work doing. And that spells a real change in the Republican Party they're going forward if that -- if that's the case.
 
VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This is scary dude, scary dude. Because if you are hoping that, after this near-death experience, we're going to have a kumbaya convention, this is not a kumbaya pick.
 
And so this would signal that Donald Trump is planning on doing a lot of hard governing. He's got somebody in there who is a pit bull. He's an attack dog. He went to law school. He's going to be in there making a whole bunch of stuff happen. 
 
So if you're worried about the Project 2025 and all that type of stuff, this is the guy that's going to really keep you up at night. 
 
The only thing I want to say is that we've talked a lot about Biden not being healthy. Donald Trump is -- he eats cheeseburgers all times. He's got heart disease. That's been reported. 
 
This could be the president of the United States here. We talk about Kamala Harris. If J.D. Vance is next in line, either now or later, you're talking about a hardening of the Republican Party around a MAGA agenda with a very capable guy that does scare the crap out of a lot of Democrats. 
 
And so this is not going to be a kumbaya convention if he's the pick.
 
COOPER: Coming up, suspense building for the announcement of Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick. We're standing by for that. And for Trump's official nomination for president.
 
We'll be back in a moment.

JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: And we're live at the Republican National Convention here in Milwaukee, battleground state of Wisconsin, standing by for the identity of Donald Trump's running mate to be revealed.
 
CNN has learned that two of the three contenders that we've known about, Senator Marco Rubio and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, both of them have been told they have not been chosen. 
 
There's this third other contender. Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, apparently still in the running. And also there's always a possibility of a wildcard.
 
Let's go to CNN's Phil Mattingly, who is with the Ohio delegation.
 
Phil, do they know anything that we don't? PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Jake, what's been fascinating is there has been a buzz as there has been reporting about the two individuals who we're in the running that are no longer in the running. 
 
That seems to leave it to one. Although, people in the Ohio delegation say they're not of knowledge of anything at this point.
 
But it's been fascinating. You see cameras coming over to the Ohio delegation, which, in the last couple of cycles, has not necessarily been the battleground or the center stage for politics as it used to be. 
 
MATTINGLY: I'm joined now by the Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted.
 
I'll ask you what Jake Tapper just asked me. Do you know anything about whether or not J.D. Vance will be the selection for vice president? 
 
LT. GOV. JON HUSTED, (R-OH): Well, I think that there are a lot of us that are hopeful that's going to happen. It's never official until it's announced. But I'm pretty optimistic J.D's going to be the guy.
 
MATTINGLY: You say, Ohio, which used to be sort of center stage for every general election race, it's been a little red, I would say, over the last few cycles. What does it mean for the state to have J.D. Vance, should he get this nomination? 
 
HUSTED: Well, it means a great thing for the country because J.D. Vance is a Make America Great Again advocate. He's a full-throated defender of Donald Trump's agenda. He's an articulate one. 
 
He has a great background. Grew up in poverty. He was a Marine Corps veteran. He has -- he's an articulate advocate for closing the borders, making "Made in America" an agenda for -- for manufacturing, protecting our communities. 
 
He's just got it all and would make a great nominee. 
 
MATTINGLY: And certainly the people from Ohio -- did you guys see Buckeyes earlier somewhere? Can we see the Buckeyes --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
HUSTED: J.D. is a graduate of the Ohio State University, so he's pretty excited about it.
 
MATTINGLY: And as a fellow graduate of the Ohio State University, Jake, I should say it is a great institution, apolitically great institution. 
 
Jake, back to you. 
 
TAPPER: Yes. We're going to get Daniel Dale, on the fact-check team, out on that later on. 
 <br>[14:40:02]
 
Let's go to Kaitlan Collins, who's near the Michigan delegation right now.
 
Kaitlan, what are you hearing about the vetting process for whomever President Trump picked to be vice president?
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CO-HOST, "THE SOURCE WITH KAITLAN COLLINS": Jake, I should just note, when we're talking about Ohio, Michigan is actually the ones that have the national championship right now. Obviously, I would know that because they beat Alabama. 
 
But on this front of this V.P. pick and what this has been looking like, let me just shed some light on how crazy this has been over the last several days inside Trump's world, where it was very clear that Donald Trump is someone who is often influenced by the last person he speaks to, the last person to kind of put in a good word for someone. 
 
And that is why all of these people who we're up for consideration for V.P. we're having their advocates and allies calling Donald Trump basically on a nonstop basis. 
 
It almost turned into kind of a battle of the billionaires at one point, where Rupert Murdoch, of course, the chairman emeritus of Fox Corp, was calling on but a half of Doug Burgum. He was someone who had been advocating for him. He was in his corner and certainly wanted to see Burgum on the ticket with Donald Trump.
 
Meanwhile, for Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, he had people like Elon Musk on his side, who we're pushing for him and told Donald Trump they thought he would be better suited to serve as his vice president should he be re-elected in November.
 
It really became, to a degree, a battle of the billionaires in the last several weeks as Donald Trump was weighing these picks on who would be the best running mate for him -- Jake?
 
TAPPER: Kaitlan, thanks so much.
 
Coming up, as we await Donald Trump's running mate announcement, we're also counting down to his official nomination here at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
 
Our coverage continues right after this quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:46:97]
 
ANDERSON: House Speaker Mike Johnson has just began speaking at the convention in Milwaukee. Let's listen.
 
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): -- for vice president shall not exceed 15 minutes.
 
It has also been the custom at past conventions to permit the chair to recognize nondelegates for the purpose of making nominating speeches and seconding speeches.
 
Without objection, the reading of the roll call of states for presenting the names for candidates for nominations is dispensed with and nondelegates shall be permitted to make nominating and seconding speeches.
 
At this time, the chair now recognizes the delegate from Iowa and the chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, Jeff Kaufmann, for the purpose of nominating.
 
Please give him a warm welcome.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE) 
 
JEFF KAUFMAN, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN PARTY OF IOWA: Good afternoon. I'm Jeff Kaufmann. And I'm humbled and honored to stand before all of you this afternoon.
 
As you've just heard, I come from Iowa, home of the first-in-the- nation caucus where our party's nomination process begins. 
 
Our caucus is a part of a lengthy democratic process, in which everyday Americans listen to the candidates, considered what they have to say, and then make a profoundly important choice on who should lead the nation that we love.
 
Earlier this year, Iowa Republicans overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: Then the vast majority of Republicans in primaries and caucuses across the nation, seconded Iowa's good judgment in a nominee.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: Today is the final step before Election Day in this venerable and time-honored process. As we all gather here in Milwaukee, it's important for us to remember that this is a grass- roots party.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: It's a party of the people, not a party of the bosses.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: Donald Trump has earned the trust of the people. He has listened to them. And Donald Trump has kept his word.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: Over the next four days, we will hear about the many failures of the Biden-Harris administration. The sustained criticism does not proceed from a mean or narrow partisanship but from the broad and sincere concern for the well-being and safety of our fellow Americans. It's part of our service to our country. 
 
More importantly, we will also hear about Donald Trump's broad and inspiring vision for our country. That is not a program just for Republicans, but one for all Americans. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: It reflects the value of America. It's a program that acknowledges that our nation has seen better days and we can and we will blaze a brighter future. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: We love America and we want to restore her security, her prosperity, and her excellence. I invite all of you to join me in supporting President Donald Trump in this great endeavor. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: This is an endeavor that's going to make America wealthy again!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: This is an endeavor to make America safe again! 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
KAUFMANN: This is an endeavor to make America strong again!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE) KAUFMANN: And say it with me, fellow Republicans. This is an endeavor to make America Great Again.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[14:50:11]
 
KAUFMANN: So here we go. It is my honor to nominate Donald J. Trump for the office of president of the United States!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(CHANTING)
 
JOHNSON: Amen to that. Amen to that.
 
The chair now recognizes the delegate from Nevada and the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, Michael McDonald. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MICHAEL MCDONALD, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN PARTY OF NEVADA: Good afternoon. I'm Chairman Michael J. McDonald from the state of Nevada. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
MCDONALD: It's been an honor of a lifetime to stand by President Trump's side since 2015.
 
In Nevada, we held the first-in-the-west caucus where we blew the Democrat's narrative apart, that you cannot have voter I.D., that you could not have paper ballots. And then you could not have results of an election on Election Night.
 
In Nevada, a state that is resilient on the service industry, President Trump has proposed to eliminate taxes on tips on day one!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MCDONALD: Unlike the Biden-Harris administration and the Democrats that increased taxes on tips.
 
(BOOING)
 
MCDONALD: President Trump has transformed our party to the champion of the working men and women. We fight for what's right, not for what's easy.
 
We're in a battle for the soul of our nation. Because we want the best future for our family and for our country.
 
President Trump is our fearless leader, who stood -- who stood -- withstood the persecution of a weaponized lawfare. And he has fought even harder and stronger to represent and fight for all of us.
 
I ask all Americans to join me in taking back our nation by supporting President Trump as he leaves us back to victory once again!
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MCDONALD: It is my honor to second the nomination of Donald J. Trump for the office of the president of the United States of America.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
MCDONALD: God bless you. 
 
TAPPER: All right. We've been hearing some nomination speeches from state party chairmen. We heard a rousing nomination speech from Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. The Iowa caucus, obviously, the first one this year to give President Trump the nod to be the nominee of the party. 
 
Then we just heard from Michael McDonald, the Nevada GOP chairman, who gave a second. And Nevada obviously a battleground state. 
 
And we have a musical interlude right now. Michael McDonald, not the one from the Doobie Brothers, so a different Michael McDonald. So he, sadly, not providing the musical interlude. 
 
Dana, we should not discount the possibility that, even though of the three that we've believed to be the finalists to be Donald Trump's running mate, two of them, Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, we've been told that they are not the nominee. 
 
We have not yet heard from Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, who, we should note, I think, is 39-years-old, turning 40 next month. 
 
There's also the possibility of some dark horse candidate, somebody who may be speaking tonight. We don't know. 
 <br>[14:55:01]
 
For instance, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin is in a battleground state. There was a recent poll showing that Trump is only three points behind in that purple state. And he's speaking this evening. I'm not saying we know anything. We do not. 
 
There we're rumors aplenty out there. But it is possible that we don't -- that it's not J.D. Vance. Possible.
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: We have reached the buzz/rumor witching hour --
 
TAPPER: Yes.
 
BASH: -- as we --
 
TAPPER: Absolutely.
 
BASH: -- for -- for the actual announcement to come.
 
As you mentioned, Glenn Youngkin is speaking tonight. He's on the schedule. I was told that he is being given a little bit more time to speak tonight. 
 
Now, if he were the actual running mate, he would have a completely different day to speak. Does it -- you know, we're just tea leaf reading.
 
TAPPER: Right. A lot of people speaking tonight that are definitely not going to be the nominee.
 
BASH: Because -- because there are -- yes. Because there are -- these cards are being held very close the former president's chest and -- and others as well.
 
What we do know is that this is the drama, this is the made-for-TV sort of performative aspect of politics that Donald Trump absolutely craves.
 
TAPPER: Kasie? 
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, one of the things -- and Van touched on this earlier -- about one thing that, you know, as I've been talking privately with Republicans leading up to this, is the reality that this weekend changed this race. It fundamentally altered this race. 
 
And for someone like Donald Trump, who is willing to do things that shock and awe, so to speak, in terms of the media and the attention that he's getting, I do think there are very real the questions.
 
And Van mentioned that J.D. Vance has said inflammatory things in the past. And within hours of the assassination attempt, he was talking can you about the rhetoric that President Biden has used and directly connecting it with the assassination attempt. 
 
And that was something that, you know, others in the party were trying to steer clear from. And frankly, what we heard from the former president himself in the hour since doesn't line up with that. 
 
He is speaking about it being something that has spiritually affected him, that it was divine intervention from God. I mean, I've gotten notes from Democrats who have read some of the things he has said on truth, social, and said --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
TAPPER: Let's listen in. Speaker Johnson speaking right now.
 
JOHNSON: As required by Rule 37 of the convention rules, during the roll call, the states will be called in the order determined by the secretary of the convention.
 
During the roll call, the chairs of each respective delegation or their designee will announce the vote of each state.
 
During the roll call of the states, the secretary will announce each state and that state's total number of available votes.
 
Additionally, the chair would like to remind all delegates that the secretary will record delegate's votes in accordance with their obligations under Rule 16 of the rules of the Republican Party, state law or a state party rules regardless of the delegation's announcement.
 
The official results from each state are those announced by the secretary.
 
Lastly, just -- just one reminder. We want to remind all our delegates, our alternates and guests that maintaining order during the roll call is extremely important. 
 
If the convention is not in order, it's difficult for the secretary or presiding officer to hear the vote announcement. 
 
Now, without objection, the complete list of votes recorded for president shall be considered as announced.
 
To conduct the roll call of the states. I'm pleased to announce and introduce at this time our distinguished secretary of the convention, Vicki Drummond.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
VICKI DRUMMOND, CONVENTION SECRETARY: Delegates and alternate, let us commence with the roll -- with the call of the roll of the states.
 
Iowa, 40 delegates.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Madam Secretary, I speak for the delegation from the great state of Iowa, the inspiring home of Caitlin Clark. 
 
And, Madam Secretary, the great state of Iowa proudly casts all of its 40 votes for President Donald J. Trump.
 
(CHEERING
 
(APPLAUSE) DRUMMOND: Pursuant to the announcement of the delegation and the rules and procedures of this convention, Iowa, 40 votes for President Trump.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
DRUMMOND: Nevada, 26 delegates.
 <br>[14:59:55]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Madam -- Madam Secretary, the great state of Nevada proudly casts all of its 26 votes for President Donald J. Trump.
 
(CHEERING)
 
(APPLAUSE)
