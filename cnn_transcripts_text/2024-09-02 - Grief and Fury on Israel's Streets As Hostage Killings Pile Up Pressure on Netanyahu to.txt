DEAN:  Russia launches new attacks on key Ukrainian cities, leaving dozens dead as the two sides trade blows. Plus, Donald Trump's rhetoric shift on abortion laws and his pitch for IVF protections has his team now clarifying where he stands on reproductive rights ahead of November. 
 
It is 5:00 a.m. here in New York, this is a live look at Capitol Hill on this Labor Day, good morning, everyone, I'm Jessica Dean in for Kasie Hunt today, it is great to be with you. We're going to begin this morning with Israel paralyzed by protest and now a general strike.

DEAN:  Thousands of Israelis demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate the release of all remaining Hamas-held hostages after the military discovered six hostages killed in Gaza. Among them, Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
RAFI KRECHMER, ISRAELI PROTESTER:  We are here to protest against the Israeli government that is making wrong decisions. This country was built on some core values, one of them is strictly that the government of Israel will do everything in its power to bring back hostages and soldiers from captivity wherever they are. 
 
And this government, because of political reasons and for the right extreme coalition of Netanyahu is great in those values. 
 
(CROWD CHANTING) 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DEAN:  Israel's largest labor union striking in protest today, threatening to shut down the country. The killing of the hostages also putting Gaza ceasefire talks in jeopardy. Netanyahu vowing to keep trying to negotiate a deal with Hamas. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): Hamas is continuing to steadfastly refuse all proposals. Even worse at the exact same time, it murdered six of our hostages. Whoever murders hostages does not want a deal. For our part, we will not relent. 
 
The government of Israel is committed, and I am personally committed to continue striving towards a deal that will return all of our hostages and ensure our security and our existence.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DEAN:  U.S. National Security official saying the next few days will either make or break ceasefire and hostage release negotiations. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is joining us now live from London. Salma, good morning to you. What is the current status of these talks after this weekend?  
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, more anger and anguish on the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities and towns across Israel today. The call is a nationwide strike. The Labor Union's stated goal here is essentially to stop, halt Israel's economy and force Prime Minister Netanyahu's hand. 
 
For these protesters, it's really the details of the death of the six hostages that have fueled unprecedented anger, again, against Prime Minister Netanyahu. It's the fact that three of the six hostages were set to be released in any future deal. It's the fact that Israeli troops were just a few hours away from reaching again, the six hostages in their underground tunnel.
 
It's the fact that one of these, the Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg- Polin, his parents had really made him the face of this movement. They were at the DNC just a couple of weeks ago saying, bring them home, and that is the sentiment you're hearing on the streets. You might ask me, well, is Prime Minister Netanyahu listening? Could he change his mind? 
 
The problem with that is that the structural issues remain the same. Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet, the most far-right government in Israel's modern history is against this deal. In fact, several ministers have threatened to resign if he takes the deal. Only one voice out of Sunday's cabinet meeting came out in favor of a hostage deal. 
 <br>[05:05:00] 
 
That's Yoav Gallant; the Defense Minister who called Prime Minister Netanyahu's failing to reach an agreement so far, a moral disgrace. The pressure will continue from the streets, the pressure will continue from the United States, U.S. officials are meeting with the American families of some of the hostages as well. 
 
But how Prime Minister Netanyahu fixes this loggerhead when you have a government head-to-head with people on the street, I simply don't know what breaks.  
 
DEAN:  All right, Salma Abdelaziz from London this morning, thank you very much for that reporting. And outrage over the killing of the six Israeli hostages, palpable here in the U.S. as well. In just hours, Israelis will bury one of the hostages Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Democrats and Republicans alike expressing anger and grief. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  Well, my heart breaks for the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. What we need now is an end to the war.  
 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  Heartbroken -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes -- 
 
GRAHAM:  Devastated, mad, Jon and Rachel had done everything in their power to help their son be released.
 
SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR):  My heart goes out to all the families, especially Hersh Goldberg-Polin's family, a fellow American, there are other fellow Americans still to be accounted for. 
 
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  These sons of -- who did this ought to be hunted down and brought to justice. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DEAN:  President Biden, Vice President Harris set to talk with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team in the situation room in just a matter of hours. Both presidential candidates also weighing in, Vice President Harris sharing her condolences to the family of the Israeli- American among those killed, noting she spoke to Hersh's parents, writing quote, "I told them as they mourn this terrible loss they are not alone, our nation mourns with them."  
 
Donald Trump using the moment to grieve and bash his political opponent, writing quote, "we grieve the senseless death of the Israeli hostages", and later adding, quote, "make no mistake. This happened because comrade Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden are poor leaders."
 
Joining us now, "Semafor's" Shelby Talcott. Shelby, good morning to you, thanks so much for getting up on this Labor Day with us. First of all, they're -- they are -- we are seeing all of the political fallout here in the U.S. Walk us through the reaction that we've heard in the last 24 hours.  
 
SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, SEMAFOR:  Yes, thanks for having me. I think the reaction has been by-and-large, obviously, outrage at Hamas' renewed calls for a ceasefire and to bring the remaining hostages home. Remind us that these are not the only hostages that are there, there are more remaining. 
 
And there's also been just general grieving calls and mourning for these families and for the people who were killed. 
 
DEAN:  Yes, I want to play a clip from Rachel and Jon, Hersh Goldberg- Polin's parents who spoke at the DNC, it was quite a moment there in Chicago. Let's watch this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, MOTHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN:  Hersh, if you can hear us, we love you, stay strong, survive. 
 
JON POLIN, FATHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN:  Bring them home. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DEAN:  Shelby, his parents really just became such a face of this. Of course, Hersh was Israeli-American born in California, and it was not lost on the Biden administration and others that they were -- there are Americans still being held this morning by Hamas there in Gaza. 
 
What does it say to you that we still have Americans being held and what do you think? We know that the Biden administration is meeting with -- the President and the Vice President are meeting with this team that's negotiating that, there are still Americans being held in addition to the Israelis.  
 
TALCOTT:  I mean, I just think this underscores what a tumultuous situation that says, but also how this situation, despite it being in Israel and being in Gaza, it is affecting Americans in a way that a lot of other foreign issues maybe aren't, right? And so, it's just -- it underscores the reality that there are Americans over there as hostages and as all of these politicians said, is not political to say that we need to get them home. 
 
DEAN:  And then there is -- there is the how do you do that? And we heard from a host of politicians yesterday, we saw all the clips coming into your interview here. I do want to play one from Ro Khanna, who was on "Meet the Press" on Kamala Harris. Let's listen to that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
KHANNA:  What she has -- her team has expressed openness is to a new direction. And look, anyone looking at this policy, you have hostages who still aren't released. You have a war that has lasted almost 11 months. You have over 40,000 people in Gaza died. We need a new direction of policy to bring the war to an end.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 <br>[05:10:00] 
 
DEAN:  Now, Shelby, when she spoke at the Democratic Convention, and then also in an interview with our colleague Dana Bash, she -- Harris has been pretty much in lockstep with the Biden administration on this. Do you think this is just wishful thinking on Ro Khanna's part?  
 
TALCOTT:  I think a little bit. I think this is a really tough situation for Kamala Harris and for the Biden administration to talk about. But I also think there's an argument to be made that something needs to change, right? And so, that's where we're seeing his comments come from. OK, this isn't working.  
 
What can we do differently? But as for what she has said publicly, it doesn't indicate that, that would be the case.
 
DEAN:  All right, well, more to come on this, Shelby Talcott, again, thanks for getting up this morning, great to see you.  
 
TALCOTT:  Thanks. 
 
DEAN:  Coming up on CNN THIS MORNING, in a matter of hours, Pope Francis beginning his longest trip as pontificate, as he starts a marathon 12-day tour of Asia and South Pacific. Plus, we're going to speak live with a freed hostage survivor whose husband remains in captivity, as demands for a hostage release deal ring loudly. 
 
And Donald Trump's surprising IVF proposal, leaving some GOP allies splitting with the presidential nominee on that issue. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But you wouldn't support this idea of mandating insurance companies to cover this, would you? 
 
GRAHAM:  No -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you've already voted against it -- 
 
GRAHAM:  No, I would, because there's -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes -- 
 
GRAHAM:  No end of that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[05:15:00] 
 
DEAN:  Just a few hours from now, Pope Francis will embark on a trip to Asia and the South Pacific. It's a 12-day four-nation visit, the longest and most challenging of his pontificate. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JORGE MARIO BERGOGLIO, POPE, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
DEAN:  Long over 20,000 miles by air between now and September 13th with stops in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore. No small feat for a pope who is turning 88 in December. CNN Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb is joining us now live from Rome. He's going to be traveling with the pope. This is quite a trip. 
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Jessica, it is quite a trip. It's not just the longest visit that Francis has made of his pontificate. It's the longest trip that any pope has embarked upon. Francis is as you say, traveling almost 33,000 kilometers across the globe. 
 
And a really important part of this visit is going to be inter-faith dialogue, building relationships with the Muslim world and other religions. When Francis is in Jakarta, in Indonesia, he's going to be having an important meeting at a Mosque, which is the largest Mosque in southeast Asia. 
 
It's a Mosque that's connected physically by a tunnel to the Catholic Cathedral across the road. A kind of example, embodiment of the vision that Pope Francis wants to see. He of course, in Indonesia, be in the world's most populous Muslim country. And I think the pope will be hoping that his message of dialogue and peace and friendship can resonate across the world at a time when we see growing conflicts and wars. 
 
And these problems that France has been trying to address many times. And now, he will be hoping that his visit can have an impact globally. Now, as you mentioned, the pope's age, Francis is 87 years old. Some people are asking, can he actually carry out this trip. Is going to be a long and grueling schedule. 
 
But Francis has shown he's determined to do so. One of his advisors said that the pope told him that, look, I didn't become pope to have rest. He is determined to keep going and show his critics and those who might be doubting him, he still has gas left in the tank. Jessica? 
 
DEAN:  All right, we'll keep an eye on that. Christopher Lamb, thank you so much for that reporting. Coming up on CNN THIS MORNING, Russia's war on Ukraine escalating, dozens injured overnight, including children in a missile strike targeting Ukraine's second largest city. 
 
Plus, the Trump campaign trying to clarify exactly where the former President's stands on reproductive rights. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[05:20:00]
 
DEAN:  Twenty two minutes past the hour now, and here's your morning roundup. At least, 47 people including seven children injured after a Russian missile attack on Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv. The attack hitting a shopping mall and a major sports center not far from the border with Russia.    
 
Russia also targeting the capital Kyiv with a combination of cruise and ballistic missiles and attack drones. We know at least two people were injured. San Francisco 49ers wide-receiver Ricky Pearsall is in good spirits after being shot in the chest during an attempted robbery. 
 
His mother posting an update, saying the bullet exited through his son's back and missed all of his vital organs. He was released from the hospital yesterday. Disney now in a standoff with "DirecTV" just as football season gets started. Disney pulling "ABC", "ESPN" and other networks off "DirecTV" due to a dispute over a new distribution deal. 
 
This means 11 million "DirecTV" customers could not watch the Sunday night college football game between LSU and USC, and their access to upcoming games from games(ph) in the year. Cooler weather and scattered storms in parts of the U.S. could impact your grilling or your travel plans for this Labor Day. We're going to go now to meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, what are you tracking? 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, METEOROLOGIST:  All right, so, if you're across the northeast or the Midwest, you're in luck, we're going to extend this holiday weekend, pretend like it never ends, the sunshine, the cooler weather, that's perfect in my opinion, and we're going to talk about the early parts of September. 
 
Not the same across the southwest where the heat is building. There's a flood threat across Texas, we'll cover it all for you here. But here's a glimpse of the temperatures for your Monday, your Labor Day, 75 in Chicago, a comfortable 78 in New York, the nation's capital just shy of 80 degrees, and the comfortable weather stretches right through the early parts of this work week as well, Tuesday, Wednesday, as we head back. 
 
So, get out those barbecues, enjoy today, traveling home this evening should be a breeze as well. Now, across the southwest, this is where Triple-digit heat will build through the course of the weekend, our work week, I should say in temperatures across the Pacific Northwest perfect as well. 
 <br>[05:25:00] Look at what's happening though across the inter-mountain west, this
 
 is where we have a red flag watch that's in place, that's because fire conditions continue to build through this weekend as the heat builds as well as the stronger winds that will start to form over the coming days.
 
Let's a flood threat across Texas, flash flood watches in place for San Angelo northward, and you can see the rainfall totals  for this location, could pick up a 2 to 4 inches of rain. By the way, monitoring just a weak disturbance off the Texas coast could develop 20 percent chance according to the National Hurricane Center.
 
And a few different waves we're also monitoring across the main development region of the Atlantic. Back to you -- 
 
DEAN:  All right, Derek Van Dam, thanks so much for that update. Still ahead on -- 
 
VAN DAM:  OK -- 
 
DEAN:  CNN THIS MORNING, the crisis in Gaza and a new scrutiny after the murders of six hostages. Coming up, we're going to talk to one survivor freed from captivity. Her husband remains a hostage. Plus, Donald Trump's changing positions on reproductive rights are drawing criticism from allies and opponents.

SCHIFF:  Donald Trump has changed his position four times on abortion in the last 48 hours.
