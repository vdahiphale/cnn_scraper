BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: The man convicted of attacking Paul Pelosi, the husband of Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, in October of 2022 -- the former speaker -- has been sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
 
CNN's Veronica Miracle is following all of this from San Francisco. 
 
Veronica, tell us what we learned from the sentencing? 
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna, David DePape, he's going to serve his two sentences concurrently. So he's received 20 years in federal prison for the attempted kidnapping of a federal official and 30 years for the assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. 
 
So concurrently, 30 years in prison, minus time already served. 
 
It's been a little more than a year and a half since David DePape broke into the home of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi's house when she wasn't there and attacked her husband, Paul, with a hammer, severely injuring him.
 
And all of this was caught on cameras. Both the break-in was caught on surveillance video and then the assault itself was caught on body-worn camera in front of two police officers.
 
And Speaker Emerita Pelosi and her husband, Paul, they were not in court today, but their daughter, Christine, was. And she read victim statements on their behalf. 
 
Paul saying in his statement that he continues to have health issues to this day, had fainting spells back in November. And they continue to be scared. They've had to re-up security as they continue to get threats to this day. 
 
Speaker Pelosi saying -- Speaker Emerita Pelosi saying that their home is a heartbreaking crime scene, a reminder every day of what happened.
 
Now this wraps up David DePape's federal case. He now moves onto his state trial, which should happen later this summer where he is facing charges of attempted murder, as well as burglary and assault -- Brianna? 
 
KEILAR: All right. Veronica Miracle, live from San Francisco with the latest on that, thank you. 
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: Partisan politics hitting a new low on Capitol Hill with lawmakers insulting how each other look in the middle of an Oversight Committee hearing. That chaos -- chaos unfolding last night during a House Oversight hearing.
 
The committee meeting to consider advancing contempt proceedings against Attorney General Merrick Garland and then this happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): Do you know what we're here for? You know we're here about A.G. -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Just to -- 
 
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): I don't think you know what you're here for.
 
CROCKETT: Well, you're the one talking about, I guess -- 
 
GREENE: I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.
 
CROCKETT: No, I ain't -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Hold on, hold on.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Order.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Mr. Chairman, would you -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Order -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: That's beneath -- 
 
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I have a point of order. I would like to move to take down Ms. Greene's words. That is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person.
 
GREENE: Are your feelings hurt?
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Move her words down. 
 
Oh girl, baby girl.
 
GREENE: Oh really?
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Don't even play.
 
GREENE: Baby girl? I don't think so.
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: We are going to move and we're going to take your words down. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: I second that motion.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: So that was Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jasmine Crockett and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all in there, going back and forth.
 
And then it continued. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: That Ms. Greene agrees to strike her words.
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I believe she's apologizing.
 
GREENE: I'm not apologizing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Hold on. Then Mr. Perry shall be recognized -
 
GREENE: I am not apologizing.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Well then, you're not striking your word.
 
GREENE: I am not apologizing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Come on, guys.
 
GREENE: Why don't you debate me?
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Mr. Chairman, the minority -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think it's pretty self-evident.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: No, the chair -- you're not -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
GREENE: Yes, you're -- you don't have enough intelligence.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: I order the chair recognizes Mr. Perry. 
 
(SHOUTING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: OK, move to strike -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I'd like to strike those words as well.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: I move this -- 
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Order.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: I would like to strike the lady's words again.
 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: That's two requests to strike. That's two requests to strike.
 
GREENE: Oh, they cannot take the words.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: If there's another --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: Congresswoman Greene refused to apologize. Congresswoman Crockett then hit back.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CROCKETT: I'm just curious, just to better understand your ruling, if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach blond, bad built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: What now?
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: Chairman, I make a motion to strike those words. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: I don't think that's a -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: Come on.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: -- part of it.
 
CROCKETT: I'm trying to find clarification on what -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: Chairman, motion to strike those words.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: I had no idea what you just said.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: We're not going to do this. Look, you guys earlier literally just -- 
 
CROCKETT: You just voted to do it.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CROCKETT: You just voted to do it.
 
(CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Order, order.
 
CROCKETT: I'm trying to get clarification.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: OK, calm down. Calm down.
 
CROCKETT: No, no, no, no, because this is what you all do. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CROCKETT: So I'm trying to get clarification.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Hey, Ms. Crockett, you're not recognized. Ms. Crockett?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: OK, so get -- calm down. Calm down. 
 
CROCKETT: No. Don't tell me to calm down.
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: Clam down.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSWOMAN: You're out of control.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Mr. Chairman --
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: I'm joined now by Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia. He's a Democrat from California. He is a member of the Oversight Committee where that unfolded last night.
 
Congressman, thanks so much for being here.
 
We just watched those clips. How is that serving the American people? 
 
REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): Well, I mean, look, it's not. I mean, I was there last night. And let's be very clear, Marjorie Taylor Greene is 100 percent the person that not only started what happened last night but continued to egg folks on throughout the hearing. 
 <br>[14:35:07]
 
She was disrupting. It was shameful what she did, disgusting the way she disparaged Ms. Crockett, our colleague. The ways she disparaged Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. And we saw that over and over again that she kept harassing folks. 
 
She should be -- honestly, she should apologize. She should not be on the committee, and she should be ashamed of herself. DEAN: I hear you. But it sounds like we're on a playground and someone is saying, but she started it first. And you're supposed to be doing the work of the American people. And they watch these clips and go, what is going on up there? 
 
GARCIA: Well, let's -- let's remember why we were there in the first place. This was a Republican ploy that happened at 8:00 p.m. because, instead of having the hearing at 11:00 a.m., which we're supposed to have, the Republicans canceled that so they could all fly to go see Trump's trial in New York. 
 
And so now were having an 8:00 p.m. hearing, which, by the way, is rare and doesn't happen on Capitol Hill, because Republicans thought it was more important to play politics with President Trump than it was to actually have this hearing. 
 
And then we're having a hearing about what? About President Biden and accusing -- them accusing him of being too old, accusing the attorney general of malfeasance, and trying to support President Biden in some way. 
 
And so we were there to do work, to actually get the facts out. And the very first thing that happens is Marjorie Taylor Greene starts attacking the appearance of one of our colleagues. 
 
That is what started last night. It enraged people, not -- not just myself, but clearly a lot of other folks. And things devolve from there.
 
So, no, that should not be happening in the House of Representatives. But let's be clear, it's because of the politics of the Republicans and because Marjorie Taylor Greene has no business being in the U.S. Congress.
 
DEAN: And in response to last night's happenings, Senator John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, tweeted, "In the past, I've described the U.S. House as the "Jerry Springer Show." Today, I'm apologizing to the "Jerry Springer Show."
 
What do you think of his comments? 
 
GARCIA: Well, I -- first of all, I disagree with both sides in this issue. I think -- first of all, I was proud and I support the fact that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez stepped in to defend Representative Crockett. And both of these women were then attacked by Marjorie Taylor Greene and others. 
 
Again, I know that you guys played a clip, which I saw, which certainly highlighted some of the worst moments. But they also attacked Alex's intelligence. They attacked Jasmine Crockett a few times. And so what are we supposed to do? Just sit there and take it all night? 
 
I think that we responded, the members responded. Obviously, ideally, that would not be happening. But it would not have happened had Marjorie Taylor Greene essentially not debased the institution like she continuously doesn't. 
 
And this isn't the first time. She's the person, by the way, that shows pornography at these same hearing. She's the same person that is showing all these horrible images at the same hearings. 
 
So the bottom line is she should not be on the committee or any committees, quite frankly. 
 
DEAN: And she certainly does -- yes, she -- she just needles at people, to your point, and really goes after them. 
 
But she exists there on this committee as it is today. And so what do you think can be done to avoid this happening in the future? Is there anything that can be done besides her leaving the committee?
 
GARCIA: Well, first, look, I think -- I'm the -- I'm the only Democrat that sits on the same three exact committees as Marjorie Taylor Greene. I have the great fortune of being the only one so I see this over and over and over again.
 
I've said this before. She shouldn't be on any committees. She has no business, not just being in Congress, but certainly not being on a committee. She can't legislate.
 
And it is against our rules to attack the appearance of other members. And so what she did last night -- by the way, because we're meeting late at night because they have to go support President Trump during the day, wasn't called for. 
 
And at this point, it's on the speaker. The speaker should -- should step in. The speaker should remove her from these committees. She is a danger to the House. She causes all sorts of problems. And I think everyone is just sick of it. 
 
And so we need to move on and actually get back to work for the American people. I hope that what -- what happened last night won't happen again. 
 
DEAN: Congressman Robert Garcia, we really do appreciate it. Thanks so much.

Coming up, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito facing sharp criticism over a flag reportedly flown outside his home after January 6th. We'll have details on that controversy next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:44:02]
 
KEILAR: Today, a "New York Times" report reveals an upside-down American flag flew outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in the days leading up to President Biden's 2021 inauguration. 
 
Trump's supporters had been flying the inverted flag as a sign of support for the Stop the Steal movement. 
 
Today, FOX News Anchor Shannon Bream tweeted that she had spoken to Justice Alito and he attributed the flag to his wife, saying that it was her reaction to an argument with a neighbor who had put an "F Trump" sign very close to a school bus stop in their neighborhood. 
 
Bream tweet, quote, "Following that exchange, Mrs. Alito was distraught and hung the flag upside down for a short time."
 
A spokesperson for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. CNN has not independently verified the flag's use.
 
Joining me now is retired federal judge, John E. Jones.
 
Judge, that short time, according to "The Times," I believe, was a few days. Does this explanation from Alito cut it in your opinion? 
 <br>[14:45:06]
 
JOHN E. JONES III, RETIRED FEDERAL JUDGE: Brianna, good to be with you.
 
And it does not cut it. You know, that it is simply shocking that a Supreme Court justice would allow this to happen for that many days, if, in fact, it was up for a couple of days. I think it's a breach. 
 
And it's one more thing, unfortunately. And I really believe in the integrity of the federal judiciary. But this tears at the fabric of their credibility and their integrity.
 
KEILAR: So what do you think this should mean for Alito's role on the court? Should he recuse himself from cases involving January 6th, for instance? 
 
JONES: Well, it certainly calls into question, particularly when they just had oral argument recently in the case involving immunity. And honestly, I thought Justice Alito, my view, over complicated the issue. 
 
It may take the court so long to decide that the January 6th trial that involves foreign President Trump isn't going to take place. 
 
And you have to wonder, you know, when you see this, and I think people do wonder, should he recuse? I think he should seriously consider it. Will he? I'm quite sure that he won't. 
 
KEILAR: I mean, by that measure, you know, I suppose you would think that Clarence Thomas maybe should also recuse this himself because of Ginni Thomas' involvement in trying to change outcomes and talk to people around this effort to change outcomes in the election. 
 
What does that mean for where the court the stands when it comes to adjudicating these very important issues?
 
JONES: You know, I got thinking today, Brianna, it is 70 years to the day since Brown versus Board of Education was decided. And you likely know your history. There were signs that sprung up then and after some other cases by -- by Justice Warren, Chief Justice Warren's court that said, "Impeach Earl Waren" and "Impeach the members of the Supreme Court." 
 
And you know what they did in response to that? They did absolutely nothing. You know, they did their jobs. They put their heads down and they acted as good federal judges and justices should.
 
I mean, look, I have a wife who has very strong opinions about things. I took some real shots when I was on the federal bench. But you keep that in the house.
 
And it is -- I think it's inelegant -- and I'm going to be kind here -- to hang this on your wife. Own it. You know, if the flag's up for a couple of days, at least apologize and say, you know, somebody got out over their skis.
 
To hang it on her and say he had absolutely no knowledge of it, I'm sorry. I have met Justice Alito, decent person. He was our circuit justice when I was in the Third Circuit, under the Third Circuit as a district judge. I had a reasonable relationship with them. 
 
I think this is just beyond the pale. At this point, you can't have people doing this. 
 
KEILAR: What do you think that chief justice should do? How should he approach the situation on the court?
 
JONES: I have said before, Brianna, that I think Chief Justice Roberts, who is a very, very good man and a person of great integrity, a person I -- I admire, I think all he can do within the power of the chief justice is exercise some persuasion and talk internally to people. 
 
But from what I'm seeing, it's not having much of a result. I don't care what the sign was at the bus stop, by the way. People died about a week-and-a-half before this flag went up. You know? And it was carried by protesters. 
 
I mean, I can't imagine a worse sign. I just think it's -- it's just a bad, bad look. 
 
KEILAR: Yes. It wasn't the spouse of another Supreme Court justice who had put up that sign, we should mention, if were trying to talk apples to apples. You know, one household is the household of a Supreme Court justice. The other household is just the neighbor of a Supreme Court justice. 
 
Judge Jones, always appreciate your perspective. Thank you so much.
 
JONES: Thanks, Brianna. Thanks for having me. 
 <br>[14:49:06]
 
KEILAR: The WNBA's Caitlin Clark era is off and running. The superstar rookie already selling out arenas and drawing huge TV viewership. We'll have details when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:53:26]
 
DEAN: A frustrating home debut for Caitlin Clark. She scored only nine points in a 102-to-66 blowout, a loss to the New York Liberty last night. It does sound like she's doing just fine in the ratings though. 
 
CNN's Hadas Gold has more on that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNOUNCER: Here's Clark off the screen. Gets a (INAUDIBLE). Yes!
 
(CHEERING)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Caitlin Clark's WNBA debut may not have ended in a win on the court, but it was a win in the ratings. 
 
The Indiana Fever versus Connecticut Sun match drew in an average of 2.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched WNBA game in more than two decades, even beating the competing NHL Stanley Cup playoff game airing on ESPN that same night.
 
Women's sports is at a precipice with viewers and revenue exploding.
 
ANNOUNCER: 1:04 left.
 
(CHEERING)
 
ANNOUNCER: The crowd loves it.
 
GOLD: While women's sports have long been relegated to second-class status by broadcasters, the industry's biggest media companies are now racing to get a piece of the action. 
 
Amazon, ESPN, ABC, CBS, Disney Plus, and Scripps, all just some of the networks airing WNBA games this year. 
 
BRIAN LAWLER, PRESIDENT SCRIPPS SPORTS: We've made it so much easier to be a women's sports fan. And now people are watching the game and saying, these players are really good. 
 
GOLD: The I.N. network from Scripps will air Friday night WNBA games and is hosting the first ever dedicated WNBA weekly studio show. 
 
LAWLER: We knew there was growth there. We knew there was interest there. And we just believe that if we can make the games more visible, fans would latch on.
 
GOLD: And then momentum is just building. Clark helped draw a record 18.9 million viewers to the women's NCAA final in April, crushing the men's ratings.
 <br>[14:55:01]
 
The WNBA draft night, later that month, drawing more than 2.4 million viewers.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Caitin Clark --
 
(CHEERING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- University of Iowa.
 
GOLD: Those numbers are also attracting advertisers. The media buying firm, GroupM, which represents companies like Google, Unilever and Mars, say they plan to double their ad spend on women's sports this year. 
 
DENISE OCASIO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENT, GROUPM, U.S.: Because these women that are watching these sport and these men that are watching women's sports, they're engaged with the brands that are supporting these areas. 
 
So there's seen real business tangible results in terms of moving product, which is ultimately the goal of what we're trying to do in advertising.
 
GOLD: While the revenue generated by women's sports is still a fraction of even just a single male sport, the business is ripe for development. 
 
OCASIO: I think it's the tip of the iceberg. I think we're only just starting to see how big women's sports can be. 
 
For me, we truly reach the pinnacle when we stop calling it the women's basketball game last night. We just say the basketball game and everybody knows we were talking about the Fever game last night. 
 
GOLD: Broadcasters and streamers are also looking beyond the basketball court to the soccer field, The volleyball court and more. Where a good game is just a good game, no matter who the players are.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
GOLD: And that Caitlin Clark debut game on Disney Plus was actually on the Disney Plus landing page when you opened up the app on your Smart TV. It was actually the first time that Disney Plus has ever aired a live sports game. And the ratings are showing that that likely paid off. 
 
And an important note. As these broadcasting rights and the advertising dollars grow, so hopefully should the player salaries -- Jessica, Brianna? 
 
DEAN: All right. Hadas Gold, thanks so much. 
 
And when we come back, exclusive video, obtained by CNN, shows Sean Diddy Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, during a 2016 altercation. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
