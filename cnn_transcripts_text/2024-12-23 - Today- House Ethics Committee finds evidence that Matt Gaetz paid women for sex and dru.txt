PATRICK DE HAAN, SENIOR PETROLEUM ANALYST, GASBUDDY.COM:  Averages out to about 3 million flyers per day. We're already, as of the 19th, looking at about 2.65 million that were screened. So, it's going to be very busy, while they're on the nation's interstates or flying the friendly skies. 
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR:  I forgot about the work-at-home thing. That does make a difference if you can do some work when you get there. Just bring your computer along. 
 
Patrick De Haan, thank you so much for bringing that to us, and have a great holiday. 
 
DE HAAN:  Thanks, Sara.
 
SIDNER:  Appreciate it. 
 
All right, a major merger of automakers. How a deal between Honda and Nissan could shake up the car industry. 
 
And we're following the breaking news about the House ethics report on former congressman Matt Gaetz. CNN has the final draft. What it says about allegations that he paid for sex with women and used illegal drugs while in office. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:34:50]
 
SIDNER:  Breaking news. A damming report by the House Ethics Committee on Matt Gaetz's conduct while he was in Congress. CNN has obtained the final draft of the report, expected to be released today. The Committee found evidence that the now-former Congressman paid women for sex or drugs on multiple occasions. 
 
CNN's Lauren Fox is live in D.C. with this final draft of the report, expecting the full report be released to the public very soon. 
 
What are you learning from it?
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well we have learned from this report, the final draft, which was obtained by CNN, is that Representative Matt Gaetz, now former Representative Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for drugs or sex on at least 20 occasions. This report obtained by CNN also includes an allegation that Gaetz paid a 17-year-old for sex back in 2017. 
 
And I just want to read about the conclusions this committee's report comes to. It says, "The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct, prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges and obstruction of Congress."  
 
Now this report also, about that incident with the 17-year-old says, quote, "The Committee received testimony that Victim A and Representative Gaetz had sex twice during the party, including at least once in the presence of other party attendees. Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex."
 
Now at the time, the Committee said she had just completed her junior year of high school. The Committee also said the 17-year-old did not tell Gaetz that she was a minor at the time. And that the report also says Gaetz did not ask her age. 
 
Now we have reached out to former Representative Matt Gaetz for comment. He has not responded yet. But last week when CNN reported that this committee, the Ethics Committee, had met earlier in December to secretly release this report after Congress had finished its end- of-year business, Gaetz did tweet several things, including, "In my single days I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated, but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. I never had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim I have would be destroyed in court, which is why no such claim was ever made in court."
 
We should also note that Gaetz often refers to the fact that back in 2023 the Justice Department, which had been investigating him, declined to bring charges. 
 
Sara?
 
SIDNER:  This is a bipartisan committee. They came to these conclusions in the final draft that you have there. But there were a lot of Republicans who did not want to release this report. What can you tell us about them?
 
FOX:  Yes. We know now that we have a draft version of this report that CNN has obtained, that Michael Guest, who is the top Republican on this committee, was opposed to releasing it because he argued that it broke with past precedent that once a member has resigned that the Ethics Committee typically doesn't release these ethics reports or investigations into those members. 
 
Now what we also know is that the House Ethics Committee is evenly divided, Sara, which means in order for this report to have been released there would have had to been at least one Republican who voted with Democrats. 
 
Now, we should note, that in the past there are two examples that CNN has found of members who resigned from Congress and then later the Ethics Committee actually did release their investigations, or at least part of their investigations into those members. Both Representative Bill Boner, a former House member and Senator John Ensign. 
 
Sara? 
 
SIDNER:  Lauren Fox, thank you so much. A lot of reporting this morning. Breaking news at that final draft you guys have and the whole report expected to come out a bit later this morning. 
 
Kate? 
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Absolutely. Joining us right now to discuss, CNN Political Commentator, Democratic Strategist Karen Finney and former White House Spokesperson under George W. Bush, Pete Seat. 
 
It's good to see you guys. Thank you so much for being here. 
 
Pete let's start with what we have just learned in Lauren Fox and her great reporting. Tens of thousands of dollars paid for sex and drugs on at least 20 occasions is what the Ethics Committee found, when it comes to Matt Gaetz, including paying a 17-year-old girl for sex in 2017. And the Committee finding that violated Florida state laws. 
 
He's no longer in Congress, we know this. He is also promising that he's not going away. What impact do you think this report and that, I'll call it the Matt Gaetz chapter of the Republican Party, means for the party? 
 
PETE SEAT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON:  Well, this report and what we're hearing is incredibly disturbing. The allegations were problematic and now that the Ethics Committee has corroborated those allegations and concluded they were, at least in part if not all of them, accurate, is a troubling end to this story, or at least this chapter, as you said. 
 
But I want to quickly review how we got to this point. 
 <br>[08:40:07]
 
Matt Gaetz was, while a member of Congress, a walking tornado. He burned bridges. He tried to derail well-laid plans for sport and for attention during his time in the chamber. He didn't make a lot of friends. 
 
And so, while he thought he was immune to this, first denying the allegations and then abruptly resigning to try and prevent the release of the report and then eventually saying that he, quote, "Had done some embarrassing behavior over time," he was not immune. 
 
He was not immune because these are serious, serious allegations that have now been proven true. And hopefully, he goes away. But as we've seen in this era, Kate, folks like him only get louder and more obnoxious when something like this happens. 
 
BOLDUAN:  And Karen, Matt Gaetz is actually - was just speaking out yesterday at the same event that Donald Trump was speaking at. And spoke about his possible future plans from the stage. 
 
Let me play this. 
 
(VIDEO BEGINNING)
 
REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FORMER FLORIDA REPRESENTATIVE:  My fellow Floridians have asked me to eye the governor's mansion in Tallahassee. Maybe special counsel to go after the insider trading from my former colleagues in Congress. 
 
(CHEERING)
 
It seems I may not have had enough support in the United States Senate. Maybe I'll just run for Marco Rubio's vacant seat in the United States Senate and join some of those folks. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  He's getting applause.  Yes, this was before the details of this report came out this morning. I will say that. But now seeing this report, Karen, it does - look, this brings forth an important question that everyone needs to ponder, which is this type of behavior disqualifying anymore for someone in public office? 
 
KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  It's a really important question. Obviously, the charges against Donald Trump, for example, where it was he was found liable for sexual abuse, I think I got that right, but still also found guilty and a convicted felon on other completely different charges and other cases that we'll never know the answer to now. I mean, there does - there is a question, is there any means, is there any, you know, line that once you cross you should not be eligible to run for office. 
 
Certainly, I think in this instance, it's important that the - that this report was released because, again, I don't think Matt Gaetz was planning on going away. Maybe this will give him pause. But, and I think this should be a standard. 
 
And I think, as a society, we need to, you know, decide, you know, it's one thing if you're a leader and you've made a mistake and you come back and you - and you are remorseful and you have tried to right the wrong. It's a completely different thing where, I mean, Matt Gaetz knew what was in that report. He probably had a good sense it was coming out today. And yesterday he was full of bluster, right? 
 
I mean, so again, and (ph) knew what was in there. And so, I think there does need to be this question. And I think the answer is, yes, there needs to be a line passed which once you've crossed it you're not eligible to run for office and to be - have - hold the public trust. I mean, he - you know, making decisions about, you know, our government, our - the finances of this country, the laws of our country, if you are someone who has broken those laws without any remorse or, you know, restoration, you shouldn't be able to be in elected office. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Pete, also happening this morning is President Biden announcing he's commuted the death sentences for 37 people on federal death row. They'll now serve out life sentences, without the possibility of parole, behind bars. 
 
And in part in making the announcement, Joe Biden also made clear that this has to do, in part, with blocking the Trump administration before they come in. And the way that he - the way that it was said is, "In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted."  That aspect of it, he did not say Donald Trump. It's very clear he's talking about Trump's intentions that in how Donald Trump has talked about what he would like to do with federal death row. What do you think of that, Pete? 
 
SEAT:  Well, the president also said that he's convinced now more than ever that the federal government should not execute criminals. And I am convinced, more than ever, that he is absolutely wrong. 
 
I personally have a very hard line on this particular topic. I have no sympathy for those who have committed heinous acts against their fellow humans, have committed murder. And I personally believe in capital punishment. 
 
But look at what President Biden is doing in these final months. 
 <br>[08:45:03]
 
He is on a pardon and commutation frenzy. It started with his own son, Hunter Biden, and now these 37 commutations of those on death row. This is what the American people are going to remember about Joe Biden, is these final months of him hiding, not actually being on the public stage and demonstrating any sort of leadership. but instead, letting criminals off the hook. That will be a large part of Joe Biden's legacy. 
 
BOLDUAN:  It also because you're using it kind of a form of speech, they will stay behind bars. These are not pardons. 
 
FINNEY:  Yes. 
 
BOLDUAN:  They will stay behind bars for life sentences. I'm only saying that just to make - for point of clarification. 
 
Karen, I want to ask you. I want to jump to this really quickly. Joe Manchin, on a bit of a post-mortem kind of tour is on his way out the door, he sat down with Manu Raju and gave a very rough review of the Democratic Party, as he his now about to leave office. 
 
I want to play - let me play this for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  I am not a Democrat in the form of what the Democratic Party has turned itself into, the national brand, absolutely not. And they know that. And what I told them. I said you ought to figure out how you lost somebody like me. The brand got so bad, the D brand has been so maligned from the standpoint of its just - it's toxic. And the Democratic Party, the Washington Democrats, are trying to mainstream the extreme. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN:  So it's interesting, right, Karen? Because we often hear people say that it's a Republican Party that is not where the American people are now. Joe Manchin is saying is the Democratic Party that is moving away from where the American people are now. 
 
FINNEY:  Yes, so don't agree with his full assessment. But here's what I do believe. I believe, having been at the DNC in 2005 after John Kerry lost and we were going through a similar type of process, of reexamining the brand had we lost - this quest - similar questions. I think if you look at what we're fighting for, in terms of building more affordable housing, keeping healthcare costs low, all of the things that, frankly, President Biden had been working on, those are issues that address working-class issues, middle-class issues. 
 
At the same time, I do not believe that our party has done a good job of two things. Number one, talking about what we're trying to do from the perspective of our values, which I think is where we do connect. And number two, connecting with people in a modern context, I don't think we've done a good job. 
 
And by that I mean, whether it's podcasts, whether it's, you know, in the digital channels where people are, where they get their news and information, and on cable, and in newsprint, you know, all - we have to do all of it to meet people where they are and to constantly have that conversation. I don't think we do a good job of that. I think Republicans do a much better job. 
 
So I agree. But I also think we should listen to someone like Joe Manchin, because I think we have to be open to hearing the criticism but not - but remember, we did lose and election but our values and the things we're fighting for are still very much I think aligned with the American people. I just don't think we've done a great job connecting. 
 
BOLDUAN:  It's good to connect with you two, as always. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. 
 
SEAT:  Thanks. 
 
BOLDUAN:  Coming up for us, a holiday drone display goes terribly wrong. A young boy is now in the hospital after being hit by a falling drone.
