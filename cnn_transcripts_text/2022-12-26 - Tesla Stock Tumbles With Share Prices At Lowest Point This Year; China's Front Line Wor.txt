(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
POPPY HARLOW, HOST, "CNN THIS MORNING": Rough year for Tesla's stock, 123 bucks a share. It is now at its lowest point of the year. Elon Musk's love affair with Twitter, is that what we're calling it these days, is not the only reason why Tesla shares have lost so much value though.
 
Joining us now to talk about that and a whole lot more, Editor-in- Chief of Semafor, and former New York media - New York Times Media Columnist, Ben Smith. Ben, it's good to have you. This is interesting, because, remember, there was that court hearing and this lawsuit, Tesla shareholders mad, that Elon Musk has focused so much on Twitter. But, there is a lot more behind Tesla's share drop. What is it?
 
BEN SMITH, EDITOR IN CHIEF, SEMAFOR: Yes. I mean, in some ways, just the law of gravity is starting to apply here. Tesla is valued - is the most valuable car company in the world. It's way more valuable than Toyota, which sells a lot more cars. And, that's all based on the idea that Tesla is going to become like the iPhone of cars. It is just going to become this massively dominant company that, huge share of cars, maybe 20 percent, maybe more, will ultimately be Tesla's. And then, he suggested that things aren't going to pan out quite that way, just that it's going to be one of many car companies with a pretty good car. These are really - if you've driven a Tesla, fun to drive good car, but maybe not going to be the only car on the road. And, any sign that that's the future is going to gradually bring in the stock to Earth.
 
SARA SIDNER, HOST, "CNN THIS MORNING": It's really interesting. We've also heard from Elon Musk himself, there is a movement on his part where he is selling some of his Tesla stocks, a large amount, for someone like me.
 
HARLOW: I am worried about bringing one.
 
SIDNER: Maybe not for him. But, let's listen to what he said on a podcast about the economy, and what's happening with it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELON MUSK, CEO, TWITTER: It does seem like we're headed into a recession here in 2023. The magnitude of that recession is debatable, but I think it's at least a light to moderate recession. Potentially, it's on the order of 2009. So, that's - so, I think it's wise to kind of like prepare for the worst - hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: He is sounding like he is making a prediction that the Fed might make. What do you think of this?
 
SMITH: I know it's funny to hear Elon just talking like a - like an economist, but inbred - but that's - but certainly, I mean, demand for car - for new cars is slowing down.
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
Demand for used Tesla's has been going down too. As somebody who is actually vaguely been shopping for one, the price is gradually coming to earth, and it's a luxury car, and ultimately, they hit a moment when people may not be looking for luxury things.
 
HARLOW: Let's switch gears here. I loved your - is it your last newsletter of the year, Ben? And,--
 
SMITH: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Yes. It was great. And, what I loved the message about sort of thanking your readers for returning to like trying to - like embrace sanity, and not all the yelling voices. But, also, you said something really interesting, Ben. You talked about what you believe is going to be this New Year, the beginning of the end of social media in journalism.
 
SMITH: Yes. I mean, I think all of us have sort of, journalists in particular, have been both - we've been addicted to Twitter. Our companies have been addicted to Facebook just - and over the last 10 years, I was at BuzzFeed. Before, I was at the time certainly felt that that ride up of seeing so much traffic, so much attention, and particularly attention to news run through these big social platforms. And, I think there is lots of interesting things happening at Facebook, happening at Twitter.
 
But, when you step away from that, what you're seeing is just people who consume news, finding that less and less a useful way to get it. I don't think a lot of people wake up in the morning and think the most efficient way to understand what's happening in the world is to look at one of these feeds. There is a level of chaos. They've shifted away from journalism as well in the interests of their ownership, both of them. And so, I think that opens a lot of space for morning news broadcasts, for email newsletters, for websites, old fashioned things.
 
SIDNER: But, Ben, they've always said the cable is dying.
 
(CROSSTALK) SMITH: --helping people to organize the world.
 
HARLOW: Did you notice that plug there?
 
SIDNER: I did. But, where are people going? I mean,--
 
SMITH: I'm doing my best here. It's the holiday spirit.
 
HARLOW: You ask a good question.
 
SIDNER: Yes. I mean, where are people going, because, if they're not going to social media, which is where everyone we thought was going to go, now what?
 
SMITH: Well, the pendulum swings, and there is both all sorts of new things. But, TikTok, for example, vastly the biggest and the most important of the new things, isn't social media, right? It's mostly entertainment. It's not 100 million people creating and 100 million people consuming. It's much - very tilted toward a relatively small number of creators. And then, I think people are swinging back toward more conventional ways of consuming, which is to say, editor, human editors or algorithmic editors putting together what they think is the most interesting stuff for you so that you don't have to just sift through the casts.
 
SIDNER: Too much algorithm.
 
HARLOW: Curating. You know what I did last week? I was on vacation. I read books, like physical actual wonderful books, and it was lovely to read those instead of Twitter. Thank you, Dan.
 
SIGNER: Dan, thank you.
 
SMITH: But, print is definitely the future.
 
HARLOW: Yes. All right.
 
SMITH: Bye.
 
HARLOW: I'm going to like put that on a plaque in my office. Ben, thank you.
 
Let's talk about China, an unprecedented surge of COVID again in China, the country's top health authority announcing it will stop releasing daily case counts immediately. We'll talk about why?
 
SIGNER: And, the Taliban warning U.S. officials not to interfere, after banning all female employees from working at any non- governmental organization.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HARLOW: Welcome back to "CNN This Morning". China is struggling with an unprecedented surge in COVID cases. But, this may become a lot more difficult to track soon, because the country's National Health Commission has decided they will stop publishing daily COVID case numbers. Selina Wang is live in Beijing for us this morning. I think the big question is, why, why now after the zero COVID policy, all of these lockdowns and a dramatic shift, are they now not going to publish the numbers?
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Poppy, health authorities, they're not saying why, but this decision was made after widespread criticism over just how unreliable the data was. So, in the first 20 days of December, health authorities publicly reported less than 63,000 COVID cases. But, leaked documents from China's top officials showed very different internal estimates that almost 250 million people may have caught COVID in that first 20 days. So, if correct, that estimate, which CNN cannot independently confirm, it would mean this is the largest COVID outbreak to date globally.
 
But, Poppy, again, that information was not made public, and China also has only reported a small handful of COVID deaths for the whole month. But, when I visited a crematorium in Beijing, body bags were piling up, and those scenes, they are playing out in major cities across this country.
 
HARLOW: And, that's part of what we were just seeing in the video on screen is body bags of corpses being put in what appear to be extra storage containers. That's how severe it is. What about the medical system? How much strain is it under across China right now because of this search?
 
WANG: Yes, Poppy. That is a footage we took at the crematorium that was very busy and overcrowded. And look, the medical system, it's under a huge amount of pressure. Even here in the capital Beijing, which has some of the best medical resources in the country, doctors are saying they're overwhelmed with elderly patients with COVID symptoms. A doctor at Beijing United Family Hospital said there was no preparation for this wave of COVID cases, no stockpiling of medicine.
 
There was this viral video I want to point to in the southern city of Guangzhou, and it shows this man kneeling on the ground at a fever clinic. He is breaking down, begging the nurse to let him see the doctor after waiting for hours. The nurses kneeling, trying to calm him down, saying he may have to wait six to eight hours. It just speaks to some of the desperation we're seeing. Fever and cold medicine, also nearly impossible to get at drugstores, antivirals, also very hard to get. But, Beijing just announced it's going to start distributing Paxlovid to community health centers in the coming days, Poppy.
 
HARLOW: Woe, what a crisis. Selina Wang, thank you for the reporting from Beijing.
 
SIDNER: From one crisis the next, the Taliban have now banned women from working at aid organizations inside Afghanistan, and also, the Taliban issued a warning to the U.S. to not interfere in their internal affairs.
 <br>[06:45:00]
 
This comes after the group, just days ago, banned women from attending universities. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from London. Nada, I want to ask you about, this is the one thing that everyone feared. I have been to Afghanistan many, many times, and the women there have always feared that this was what was going to eventually happen. What is the Taliban saying the reason for this is?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: You're absolutely right, Sara. I mean, this was a huge concern for many women in Afghanistan, and of course, internationally. The concern now that this is a vital bridge between Afghanistan and the international community providing that almost life-saving support for women and girls across the country. The Taliban has said that they have come to this decision much as they did with the ban on university education for women last week because of violations of what they believe are their Islamic values, namely, dress code regulations, which are very strict, which they have enforced since their takeover in Afghanistan, and also relations and activities of women, between men and women across the university sector, education sector, and now crucially in the aid sector.
 
Now, that has been the response from the Taliban. As you said, they've told the U.S. not to interfere in their internal affairs. We've already heard that condemnation from Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying he is deeply concerned by this development. Now, four aid agencies have pulled out, crucial development there, concerning development in a string of erosion of women's rights and freedoms in Afghanistan.
 
SIDNER: It is going to make things harder for everyone. Nada Bashir, thank you so much for joining us.

SIDNER: Good to see you again. The Buffalo Bills had to spend Christmas morning in Chicago, after their win on Saturday.
 
HARLOW: But, they won.
 
SIDNER: They won. So, the team ended up flying into Rochester yesterday as the airport in Buffalo, as you might imagine, because it was crazy out there, remained close, but they would land and see die hard Bills fans, of course, waiting to see them. CNN's Sports Carolyn Manno joins us now. Quite the welcome back for a Buffalo.
 
CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You clinched the division, and you have to shuffle your car, all right, but that's OK. I mean, as they acknowledged, so many people around the country are dealing with so much worse than that. They said emergency workers, everybody, working hard than us. But, it was wild. And, you talk about Bills fans really showing up.
 
I mean, there are some of the most passionate fans out there, and this is proof of that. I mean, the journey did not stop there, though, for Bill's players. Once they landed in Rochester, they took the buses back to the facility at Orchard Park. And, this is where they would find their cars. They were completely buried. Bills' safety Damar Hamlin documenting this wild scene on Instagram, a terrible weather was just one of the themes of Week 16 in the NFL, just like it's been all around the country. The Bills last month had a home game move to Detroit. So, grabbed a bunch of shovels, guys, and just had to dig their cars out. I mean, I think it is awesome.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
HARLOW: They are just like the rest of us.
 
MANNO: Yes.
 
SIDNER: But, what nice little cars.
 
MANNO: Yes. And, I actually tied for the best record in the conference as well. So, they might have playoff games at home in January. So, Buffalo, just something to keep--
 
HARLOW: And, they have to move a Buffalo game?
 
MANNO: They did. It went to Detroit last month. So, something to keep an eye on for Buffalo fans, but that's why they're some of the best in the business.
 
Elsewhere in sports, on Sunday, Tom Brady delivered a Christmas day come back. We've come to expect this. Tampa rallying to beat the Cardinals in overtime. There were a few times on Christmas night where he actually looked more like the Grinch than the man in red. We've seen that this season as well, most of the games, not up to his standards. He threw a pair of interceptions to Marco Wilson in regulation, the second one coming while the game was tied at six in the third quarter, with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter, though, the Buccaneers would find themselves down 10. This is when Tom Brady really went to work, third in goal here, finds Rachaad White to cut the Cardinals lead down to three.
