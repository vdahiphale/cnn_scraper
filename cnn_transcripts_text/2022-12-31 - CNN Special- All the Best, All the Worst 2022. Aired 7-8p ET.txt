(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: U.S. officials, today said, all travelers, originating in China, will be required to show a negative COVID test, before flying to the States. China has been battling a surge, since it dismantled its strict zero-COVID policy. And the new U.S. rule will take effect, January 5th.
 
Coming up next, all the best and worst moments of 2022, a CNN SPECIAL REPORT, "ALL THE BEST, ALL THE WORST 2022" starts now.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Buckle up, strap in, and brace yourself. This year brought more twists and turns, ins and outs, and ups and downs than anyone could have predicted, in Big News, Politics, Movies, Music, Sports and more.
 
We're going through it all, with our guests, Comedian and actress, Helen Hong; former NFL player and commentator, Donte Stallworth; CNN's own John Berman; Conservative pundit, S.E. Cupp; and comedian, Gina Brillon. They're all on board, for the wildest ride ever.
 
ALL THE BEST, ALL THE WORST 2022.
 
FOREMAN (on camera): Welcome, I'm Tom Foreman.
 
And depending on who you are, and where you were, and what you believe, this year may have been pretty good, or really bad, or somewhere in the murky middle. Many of us started with high hopes, but the troubles of recent years are fading oh, so slowly. And that was clear in all sorts of huge news events that rocked our world.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Let's start with the biggest, baddest, worst story, runaway inflation.
 
S.E. CUPP, CONSERVATIVE PUNDIT: Things felt very abnormal, when it came to what we could buy, what we could afford, where we could go.
 
GINA BRILLON, COMEDIAN: I'm going to have to start selling off other things that I own, so I can buy milk.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Prices for food, clothing, houses, and more jumped sharply.
 
HELEN HONG, COMEDIAN: I bought a sandwich, at one point, at not even a fancy shop. And it was $22!
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Driven by lingering Pandemic supply issues, strong demand, and perhaps some price gouging too.
 
DONTE STALLWORTH, FORMER NFL PLAYER: It's hit every American, at some point, whether if it's been you personally, or someone, you know.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Worst constant reminder, gas prices. The nationwide average for a gallon climbed over $5, at one point, a new record.
 
CUPP: Yes, I mean, filling up my SUV sometimes cost over $100.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Best part?
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Some parts of the economy that were just humming, right? Unemployment, very low. Wages, up significantly, for the first time in a very long time.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): So, is a recession coming?
 
STALLWORTH: I don't think it's a definite no, if you listen to a lot of the economists.
 
HONG: I don't even care if there's a recession coming. It already feels like we're in a recession.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Despite topping a million deaths in the U.S., the COVID Pandemic brought some good news. More than 80 percent of all Americans have now received at least one dose of vaccine, and the rate of new infections, hospitalizations and fatalities has dropped.
 
BRILLON: I feel like the Pandemic, we just kind of let it go. Like you know, when you date somebody for a little bit, and then you just eventually stop calling them, and that's how you break up?
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): But new variations, long COVID, and complications remain, for many vulnerable groups.
 
CUPP: This isn't over for them. And so, I'm still mindful of the folks, who are still dealing with it.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Internationally, the worst story was the invasion of Ukraine, with Russia's army hammering Military and civilian targets alike.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: (FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERMAN: What Vladimir Putin did is something that really just hasn't been done, in decades and decades and decades. He invaded another country, for the purpose of conquest.
 
STALLWORTH: A lot of people were saying he's losing his mind, he's becoming more isolated.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: (FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Best counter-punch? Ukraine's response.
 
CUPP: It was The Little Engine That Could.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his forces, defied all predictions of quick defeat, and in some places, put the Russians on the run.
 
HONG: Listen, before Ukraine was invaded, nobody had heard of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But now? Hot daddy!
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): The world outlook was not great.
 
Wide portions of Africa were wracked by disease.
 
Iran stepped up its repression of human rights, especially for women, amid protest.
 
Flooding plagued Pakistan.
 
BRILLON: I need to talk to some serious astrologers, and figure out when are we going to get out of this, because this seems like madness.

FOREMAN (voice-over): China rattled over COVID lockdowns and Taiwan tensions.
 
North Korea tested more missiles.
 
South Korea and Indonesia were saddened by fatal crowd crushes.
 
Japan was shaken by the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
 
And London watched a revolving door of leaders.
 
BERMAN: The United Kingdom seems to like having a lot of different Prime Ministers, because they keep on changing whose in-charge there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Prime Minister.
 
(CHEERS) (END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[19:05:01]
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): As the new King Charles stepped up, following the passing of Queen Elizabeth, the longest serving monarch in British history.
 
BRILLON: I mean it was a heck of a sendoff. And, honestly, I didn't expect anything less.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Closer to home, Hurricane Fiona pounded Puerto Rico, and Ian hammered the Caribbean, before hitting Florida hard. Both storms raising fresh alarms about climate change.
 
CUPP: It's hard to deny the science, when it's flooding your home.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Add other places, afflicted by wildfires, heat waves, blizzards, and drought so bad, it was draining lakes. And?
 
BERMAN: The Earth is telling us something, right? The planet is telling us that we can't just keep going on like this.
 
STALLWORTH: I look at my nieces, and nephews, and they'll be the ones that are inheriting the planet from us.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Among many worrisome predictions, the glaciers in Yellowstone and Yosemite could be gone by 2050. And sea levels may rise in the next 30 years, as much as they did in a century.
 
HONG: I live in Los Angeles. And it's probably going to be underwater, in about five years. So, I'm just working on my doggy paddle right now!
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Mass shootings, once again, haunted shopping centers, subways, public squares, nightclubs, and so many places.
 
CUPP: It is exhausting. And it is depressing.
 
STALLWORTH: Seems like this is our new normal. And no one wants to be there.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stay over there.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): The massacre, at Robb Elementary School, in Texas, drew particular notice, after 19 students, and two teachers, died while Law Officers waited more than an hour, to engage and stop the gunman.
 
BERMAN: And to see them, in that video, looking like they're just waiting, for something, as more people, we feel, or saw, were dying? It's very upsetting. BRILLON: I am petrified, to have my son, in any school, because I don't know what's safe anymore.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUDGE TIMOTHY R. WALMSLEY, SUPERIOR COURT EASTERN JUDICIAL CIRCUIT: Today, the defendants are being held accountable for their actions.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Best news, for many looking for justice? Three Georgia men, involved in the murder of jogger, Ahmaud Arbery, received stiff federal and state prison sentences.
 
And so did Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis cop, who knelt on George Floyd's neck, until he died.
 
STALLWORTH: Hopefully, we start to see that, maybe this is a trend, where people are held accountable. And then, when you go from there, it's, you're held accountable, and everyone gets to be able to see, like this is how the justice system is supposed to work.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): On the border, the battle raged, over undocumented immigration. Some Republican governors fed up with new arrivals, started shipping them to faraway Democratic strongholds.
 
HONG: First of all, refugees are not props.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Worst supply chain issue, the shortage of baby formula that sent parents scrambling.
 
BRILLON: I can't imagine the moms that are going crazy, looking for formula. Because if you got a hungry infant? Man, that's a fight!
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Best case for infrastructure reform, the drinking water issues facing Jackson Mississippi, and other places.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): Worst purchase order, in less than 300 characters, billionaire Elon Musk's on again, off again, on again acquisition of Twitter.
 
HONG: Oh, Elon Musk! Thank you for proving to us that you don't have to be smart or mentally stable, to be a billionaire.
 
FOREMAN (voice-over): And the best way to get away, from all the maddening, saddening craziness? Give it to those spectacular images coming back from the Webb telescope, way off in space, where everything at least looks so beautiful!
 
BRILLON: They were so good that they almost seemed fake. They were so pretty that I was like "Is this real?"
 
HONG: You know, now that we've officially turned our entire planet into a dumpster fire? Space is looking pretty gorgeous, right now!
 
FOREMAN (on camera): Coming up, we'll have the year's most spectacular sports, the must-see TV, you might have missed, full-contact politics. And hit it!
