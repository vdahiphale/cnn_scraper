BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Infrastructure for sea level. And now inland infrastructure for droughts like this. You know, got to talk about this more guys. It's here.
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: You have been - well, look, you've been ringing the alarm bells on this for years and years and years and years and showing us and warning us and now it accelerates. 
 
Bill Weir, we appreciate you being there always. Thank you, friend.
 
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks, Bill.
 
WEIR: Yes.
 
HARLOW: All right.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: All right, Michigan State has suspended four players who were involved in that post football game brawl. But, Michigan's coach, Jim Harbaugh, says he wants criminal and expects there to be criminal charges. 
 
LEMON: And Pfizer announcing a major development after promising results for an  RSV vaccine. We're back in a moment. 
 
HARLOW: Great news for parents (ph). 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
LEMON: So, we have this news this morning, Pfizer says that it will seek FDA approval for its  RSV vaccine by the end of this year. Pfizer says that the vaccine is administered to pregnant women, who can then produce antibodies and pass them on to their babies. 
 <br>[08:35:00]
 
A study found that after birth the vaccine was 82 percent effective at preventing severe lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized babies for the first three months of life. And about 70 percent effective at preventing severe RSV in hospitalized babies for six months. Pediatric hospitals across the country say beds are filling up fast with infected children. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, a big concern for parents. 
 
Meanwhile, Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh says he expects the four Michigan State players who were suspended after they appeared to assault his players to potentially face criminal charges. New video appears to show one of the players from Michigan State swinging his helmet in the tunnel. You can see the violence that broke out after their game. Coach Harbaugh says the suspensions are not enough. Not even close, in his view.

JIM HARBAUGH, HEAD FOOTBALL COACH, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: There needs to be accountability. There needs to be a full, thorough, timely investigation. 
 
I can't imagine that this will not result in criminal charges. The videos are - are - are bad. And it's clear what - what transpired. It seems very - very open and shut. You know, as they say, watch the tape. 
 
An apology will not get the job done in this instance. There should be serious consequences for the - the many individuals that are culpable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: Obviously two of the Michigan players were injured in that violence that broke out. The attorney for Gemon Green, who is one of the players who suffered a concussion, told, quote - told us, quote, they have every intention of pressing criminal charges against those persons who are responsible for this vicious assault. 
 
I mean it's just - obviously I'm a huge college football fan, but it's just unacceptable to see what happened. 
 
HARLOW: (INAUDIBLE).
 
LEMON: Yes. Yes. Unnecessary, uncalled for and there's no excuse for it. 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
LEMON: The political discourse in America, speaking of no excuse for this, sinking to new lows. Are calls for civility futile? We're going to take a closer look. That's next. 
 
HARLOW: We also - we're going to have some fun this morning. Why not on day one? We have a little surprise coming up that you will not want to miss. Stick around. Who is it? 
 
LEMON: (INAUDIBLE). Yes.
 
COLLINS: (INAUDIBLE).
 
HARLOW: Who is it? 
 
COLLINS: We've got to guess who it is. LEMON: It's not LZ.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:41:17]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Sir, sir, this is - this is what I'm saying. Look, we - we got - we've got a -- there is a process that we set up in our democracy. Right now I'm talking. You'll have a chance to talk sometime. 
 
This is part of the point that I want to make. Just basic civility and courtesy works. And that's what we want to try to encourage. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: That was like a champ, the former president, Barack Obama.
 
COLLINS: Did you see Whitmer's face during that? She's just sitting there watching it all. 
 
LEMON: That's how you handle it. I mean that was on the campaign trail in Michigan calling for basic civility. But is that call too late for America? We need to go back to that. I mean people talk about, you know, when - when John McCain did his thing or what have you. That's how you handle hecklers and disinformation. We don't do that anymore. 
 
Joining us now, LZ Granderson is a columnist for "The L.A. Times." His the latest column asks if we are part -- if we're past, I should say, the point of civility. Also, my friend, and our friend, friend of the show here. 
 
COLLINS: Friend of the show.
 
LEMON: I was joking. I was like, LZ, we - we never get to talk to each other. 
 
LZ GRANDERSON, CO-HOST, "MORNINGS WITH KEYSHAWN, LZ AND TRAVIS": We talk every day. 
 
LEMON: Like, I - like at least 15, 20 times a day.
 
GRANDERSON: Congratulations. This looks amazing, you guys. Happy first day. 
 
COLLINS: Looks good. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you for coming.
 
LEMON: And, guess what, this is not even our permanent set. Wait until you see our new home. 
 
GRANDERSON: Oh.
 
HARLOW: Setting the bar high. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GRANDERSON: I hope I can come back. 
 
HARLOW: You will.
 
LEMON: LZ, let's talk about this. You - you have a new column that is going to drop this morning for "The L.A. Times," but everybody goes back to that, you know, when they go low, we go high. Is that -- from the former first lady, Michelle Obama. Is that realistic in this moment? 
 
GRANDERSON: You know, that's what I was trying to explore in this piece, right? Like, I want to still believe in that higher calling, right? But as we're still reaching for the higher calling, the people who are reaching for the lower callings are getting things done, right?
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GRANDERSON: Like the Supreme Court situation. (INAUDIBLE) -- 
 
LEMON: And they're the loudest voices. 
 
GRANDERSON: And they're the loudest voices, right? And there comes a point, and I have, you know, spoken to a lot of voters, I've spoken to a lot of grassroots leaders over the years and they're beginning to get more and more frustrated with playing nice with Republicans or conservatives
 
LEMON: Did you - did you see my - 
 
HARLOW: I was just think that.
 
LEMON: My conversation with Elissa Slotkin earlier? Because I said, listen, I - you know, I'm - I'm not sure what - I understand what she's saying. But I wanted to be clear about what people may be hearing about what she's saying. She's saying, you know, this win at all costs, obviously she's saying it is a bad - it's bad for democracy. And she's right on that - that point. 
 
But when you say, you know, winning is not the most important thing, Democrats may -- could be turned off by that and they may think, like, Democrats aren't strong enough because the whole point is to win and get your legislation passed to make it better for your particular constituents. Am I wrong about that? 
 
GRANDERSON: No, no, you're not wrong. And we're in this weird transition as a nation, we're in this weird transition politically. I think we're still trying to figure out what Covid did to us culturally, if you will. I know I'm interacting differently interpersonally. I'm assuming a lot of us are. I mean when I hear a cough in a public space, it triggers me, right? You look, like - 
 
COLLINS: I'm the same. GRANDERSON: So we're -- so we're still trying to process what it means to trust one another again. And so while it is true that, yes, you want to try to win, you want to get your policies through and you want to do it as much as possible and sometimes that requires back room dealings, but because we are dealing with the end hopefully of Trumpism, because we are still trying to assess what happened to us after Covid, we're not necessarily in a position culturally to trust one another that you're going to do what's best for me if you look differently, or if you're in a different party, or if you're of a different gender, or if you worship differently. And that's where we are right now. 
 
COLLINS: Something Obama said as he's been on the campaign trail -- he's being very outspoken -- that really stood out was, he talked about birtherism and obviously the lies that were spread about him. He made a joke to Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin saying, you know, get your birth certificate ready, you're a Democrat with a funny name. 
 <br>[08:45:05]
 
But he said, remember those, those were the good old days. Basically saying that our political discourse has gotten so much worse even from that really ugly moment. 
 
GRANDERSON: It has. And is - and it's really unfortunate. I think, you know, in 100 years or so, knock on plexiglass, if we're still here, that there will be like some Ph.D. student that will go back and look at what went wrong during this time period. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GRANDERSON: And I think one of the biggest things that went wrong was allowing the lie to breathe in spaces where truth is supposed to reside. If you --
 
LEMON: Allowing the lie - you mean the birtherism lie?
 
GRANDERSON: The birtherism lie.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: And also allowing the person who perpetuated that lie to give them a platform. 
 
GRANDERSON: And allowed the person - exactly. Right. If that person had said, you know, the earth is flat and I have documentation, I'm going to show you soon that the earth is flat, we probably would not entertain that, right?
 
COLLINS: (INAUDIBLE). Yes.
 
GRANDERSON: But we did, for that purpose, because it was considered harmless and now it has (INAUDIBLE).
 
HARLOW: Well, look at what -- we just had Elissa - Congressman Elissa Slotkin on, and she's going to be on the campaign trail tonight with Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, right, working together, even though they have many disagreements on issues. 
 
My four-year-old, Luca, working in his classroom, the teacher emailed us, on partner days. They pair them with people that they have different views on things with and they have to work together. Four years old, right? So, my kids don't know yet what it's like to go into a world where if you disagree it becomes like that for so many. And somehow that wins you points and votes in some circles, right? How do we get what we're teaching the four-year-olds to teach the people in charge? 
 
GRANDERSON: You know what's interesting about -- we started this conversation about the former first lady's, when they go low, we go high. The larger part of that conversation, she was actually talking to her children about that. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GRANDERSON: That's where that phrase comes from. So --
 
LEMON: After an attack on the White House. 
 
GRANDERSON: Exactly. 
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
GRANDERSON: So the - so, what you're talking about, Poppy, is exactly that. Like, this is how you do it. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GRANDERSON: You raise adults who don't need to be reminded of this by having your children go through these type of programs.
 
HARLOW: Yes. I just sometimes think, sometimes watching our kids helps remind us how to live. What they're learning.
 
LEMON: Yes, and the context of that again was when someone took shots at the residents in the White House -
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: And she was teaching her kids that just because they go low, you don't have to go low.
 
HARLOW: That's right.
 
LEMON: Thank you, LZ. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, LZ.
 
COLLINS: You'll be back with us on Thursday, right? 
 
GRANDERSON: Always good to see you. Yes, I am.
 
HARLOW: See you Thursday. 
 
COLLINS: OK. Good.
 
LEMON: Coming up -- 
 
COLLINS: Coming up, we have a mystery guest that Poppy and I know who it is -
 
LEMON: Oh, boy.
 
COLLINS: But, guess what, Don Lemon does not. So we're going to reveal it next and we'll make him guess who it is first. 
 
HARLOW: Guesses? Guesses? Guesses?
 
LEMON: I hate surprises. I hate surprises.
 
HARLOW: Sorry. Sorry, you're going to like this one. 
 
LEMON: Oh, boy. 
 
HARLOW: You're going to like this one. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
LEMON: I told you who I think it is. 
 
COLLINS: All right, to help -- 
 
LEMON: Oh, my gosh, I have a feeling this has to do with me. 
 
HARLOW: We're - we're back. We are back from commercial break. And to help promote this new show, we all went to a coffee shop in the best borough, Brooklyn, obviously, and chatted about life, chatted about our careers -
 <br>[08:50:02]
 
COLLINS: Had a lot of coffee.
 
HARLOW: Talked about our family. Had a lot of coffee. And we talked about what and who inspire us. 
 
LEMON: Ah, interesting. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What was the moment you fell in love with journalism? 
 
LEMON: I turned on the television one day and I saw Bryant Gumbel. And I was like, that is what I want to do. 
 
HARLOW: That.
 
LEMON: And I would pretend in the mirror and on my little 8mm or later VHS that I was like, you know, anchoring a show like the "Today" show. And I would say -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anchoring the morning shows.
 
LEMON: Yes. And I would say, this is "Today" on NBC. But - but, whatever.
 
COLLINS: OK, but now you're about to be anchoring a morning show. How cool is that? 
 
LEMON: Yes.  Yes. And so - and that's when I fell in love with - like, I realized like just from watching those VHS tapes and that -- that I could do it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: What? 
 
LEMON: I - it's just that. It's Bryant Gumbel. 
 
HARLOW: All right. So, this is a surprise for Don. We have a special guest. The legendary, the one -- 
 
LEMON: I knew it. I got it. 
 
HARLOW: (INAUDIBLE) Bryant Gumbel's live on set.
 
LEMON: Oh, my gosh. 
 
BRYANT GUMBEL, HOST, HBO "REAL SPORTS WITH BRYANT GUMBEL": A really tough guess. 
 
LEMON: Bryant, I love you, man. 
 
GUMBEL: How you doing, man? 
 
LEMON: Yes, I - look, don't make me cry on my first day. 
 
GUMBEL: Oh, you're not going to cry. You're not going to cry.
 
COLLINS: It's like he thought it was going to be -
 
HARLOW: OK. You get my chair, my friend. You get my chair. Come sit next to Don.
 
LEMON: Wait, you didn't bring the person I love the most. Where is - where is your beautiful wife? 
 
GUMBEL: Thank you. 
 
LEMON: Where's Hillary (ph)?
 
GUMBEL: She's back at the house relaxing. 
 
LEMON: Hi, (INAUDIBLE).
 
COLLINS: Good morning. How are you? Thanks so much for joining us. 
 
GUMBEL: My pleasure. 
 
COLLINS: It's an honor to have you. 
 
LEMON: Oh, Bryant Gumbel.
 
HARLOW: This is all you.
 
LEMON: What's up?
 
COLLINS: Don thought it was going to be his family.
 
GUMBEL: Why don't you tell me?
 
HARLOW: Oh, yes.
 
LEMON: You remember what you -- I had dinner with you, what was it, two weeks ago? 
 
GUMBEL: Yes, I think so. 
 
LEMON: Bryant is celebrating his 50th anniversary in the business two weeks ago and we sat down for dinner with Bryant and a bunch of friends, and you gave me advice. You said, two minutes in the show. What did you say? 
 
GUMBEL: Everybody always - everybody will always ask you what time you get up. They want to make a big deal about the sleep. I said there's two things that are common to everybody. Number one is, whatever time you get up you bitch about it. And, number two, the second you're in the shower it doesn't matter, right?
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: Clearly. 
 
COLLINS: I actually think that -
 
LEMON: Only Bryant Gumbel can say you bitch about it on - I just said it now. 
 
HARLOW: And now Don Lemon can say it.
 
GUMBEL: Oh, we're not - 
 
COLLINS: And you thought I was going to be the first one to curse on TV. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: That's not one of the seven deadly words you can't say. 
 
LEMON: That's not one. Plus -
 
GUMBEL: But it's not something you should say. You're right.
 
LEMON: You were on broadcast. This is cable, Bryant, you know, as you know.
 
HARLOW: That's right (ph).
 
LEMON: And you should know that. You're the host of "Real Sports" on HBO. 
 
GUMBEL: But I don't use bad language on it. 
 
LEMON: You don't - you don't do that.
 
GUMBEL: I try not to. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: I was raised better than that.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
COLLINS: It was a really special moment, though, when we were talking about what this show would look like and what it meant to all of us. And Don really did talk about how he watched you and envisioned himself in a similar role. 
 
GUMBEL: Bet he wishes he was watching something else at the time. You weren't watching cartoons and said, no, I'd like to do that? 
 
LEMON: No, no, no, I should have been watching, I don't know, the -- a movie or something and become a movie star. But you did. Bryant, you did inspire me. And you were perfect on television. You never flubbed a word. You're - I mean, you were great and you -
 
GUMBEL: I have a different memory of it, but thank you. I mean I never walked away from one saying I couldn't have done it better. 
 
HARLOW: Really - yes.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: You know, I find a zillion things that are wrong with everything I try. 
 
But I was given a good opportunity and I was fortunate. I really was.
 
HARLOW: What did you learn over the years? Right, like this is day one. We have so many days ahead together. I think we're pretty darn lucky to be - like you, the group, you guys were great together and you were lucky to be with one another and you all were different and added so much. We're lucky to be together. What did you learn over the years? 
 
GUMBEL: First of all, I will tell you this, I learned incremental. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: OK. You don't learn everything in a hurry. You try to learn something each day and pick up on that. But I guess patience is one of them. And understanding, tolerance,
 
 civility, like Barack Obama just said. You know, I mean I think just trying to be yourself on a day in, day out basis. As you know, it's a very difficult thing to do when everybody's watching. 
 
HARLOW: Don's OK with it that I come in with my color-coded folders with sticky tabs. 
 
LEMON: Do you have them with you?
 
HARLOW: They're all - I've gone through all of them. We'll see them tomorrow morning.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: I was worse. I was worse.
 
HARLOW: Were you? Listen to this.
 
GUMBEL: I was worse. In my early days of the "Today" program, I color- coded guest materials based upon what their background was. In other words, if it was politics it was blue. If it was economy, it was green. If it was Hollywood, it was red. Et cetera. Honest to God. 
 
LEMON: I'm not surprised. 
 
Well, speaking of -- since we're in this moment, how has it changed? 
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: And, you know, we talk about civility and all of that. And, look, politics has always been a rough and tumble sport, but has it changed? 
 
GUMBEL: Yes. Yes, I really think it has, and not for the better. 
 
LEMON: Not for the better.
 
GUMBEL: Not for the better. I mean I do remember as I was watching you with Governor Sununu, I remember when Rob Brown died in a plane crash in Croatia, and at the time Republicans said nothing about it. And I went on the air and I asked somebody if that was politics as usual or just plain bad manners. And I got a reprimand from NBC. And NBC apologized, but I didn't. And so - and so I was watching that this morning and I was thinking, wow, the more (INAUDIBLE) the more (INAUDIBLE) -
 
LEMON: This is where I get it from, everybody. This is where I get it from. 
 
Sorry, I (INAUDIBLE). What were you saying?
 <br>[08:55:01]
 
GUMBEL: No, no, no, I said - so - and so I was watching this morning, I was thinking, well, the more things change, the more they remain the same. 
 
LEMON:  Yes. But it aside, we - you know, I don't like to both sides things. And, listen, I'm not neither a Democrat nor a Republican.
 
GUMBEL: It's a false equivalence. 
 
LEMON: It's a false equivalence. What's happening now is just beyond the pale and more people should vehemently speak out about the madness. 
 
Look at - I mean Paul Pelosi could have died. 
 
GUMBEL: Yes.
 
LEMON: And so every Republican should -- any available microphone should be speaking out and saying it's terrible, but they're not doing it for the most part. 
 
GUMBEL: No, they're not. They're not. It's unfortunate. 
 
LEMON: So, yes. 
 
GUMBEL: Yes.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: Yes.
 
COLLINS: And so what do you think is the way to handle that? You know, when you do see - you see people like Governor Sununu saying he expresses sympathy with the family, he condemned the attack, but then you've got another candidate for - to be a Republican governor, Kari Lake, who's laughing about it and making jokes about it. 
 
GUMBEL: I saw making - making a joke about it. And heaven knows DeSantis hasn't said anything either, that I'm aware of anyway. I should - I shouldn't do that. 
 
I don't know. I don't know any way other than to call it out when you see it. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: And you would ask that - you would ask the same of anybody in any position in society. When you - what is it, when you see something, say something.
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: So, talk about seeing something. You've got - these are the two sports brains over here.
 
GUMBEL: Oh, I know. They're going to hate each other this weekend.
 
HARLOW: Yes, I know. They're going to Alabama, LSU -
 
LEMON: We'll hate each other this weekend through the Alabama game.
 
GUMBEL: They'll hate each other this weekend. 
 
HARLOW: And they ask me, they're like, Pop, you want to come and you can referee. I was like, I am refereeing my four and six year old at home this weekend. That is that. 
 
GUMBEL: That's a task.
 
HARLOW: But, have fun. We'll bring the cameras. You'll see it on Monday, guys.
 
But - but, in all seriousness, sport, I mean, "Real Sports," this is your wheelhouse. And we just saw - we just played for the viewers what happened at Michigan. 
 
LEMON: Oh, the Michigan - the Michigan.
 
COLLINS: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: Yes. And, you know, it's funny that they still - it's not funny. It's sad that they still do that at - at that stadium at UM. They go through the same tunnel. 
 
COLLINS: They go through the same tunnel.
 
GUMBEL: And they just had an incident I think two weeks ago of going through that same tunnel and, you know, cooler heads did not prevail. Yes, I mean that's -- that's clear assault. And I would expect some charges. 
 
I saw - I think I read that five of the kids have been suspended from the team during an investigation - pending an investigation. 
 
HARLOW: Just, those are the role models that so many people look up to. 
 
LEMON: But, you know what, this reminds me, one of the reasons that I did this when I talked to you and other people and they're like, it's -- not often do you get to do something different at the place you already work, right, and sort of -- and challenge yourself.
 
GUMBEL: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Good point.
 
LEMON: But you did that with "Real Sports." And you have - I think what you always knew, but what you get to explore is that sports -- I mean, look, that -- that's what really changes things in the culture. It has a big impact on (INAUDIBLE).
 
GUMBEL: It has a huge impact. 
 
LEMON: So this whole idea about shut up and dribble, and that's never been the case, right? GUMBEL: No. No. And, you know, it's -- when people ask me about "Real Sports," they always say, well, I - you know, I shouldn't watch because I'm not a sports fan. I say our show is about sports like "Rocky" is about boxing. 
 
LEMON: Right.
 
GUMBEL: You know.
 
HARLOW: That's right.
 
GUMBEL: I mean we use -- we use sports as a vehicle to get to other stories about race, about gender, about equality, about income, you know, and that's how we use sports. Whether it's 3-2, it really doesn't matter much to us.
 
LEMON: Yes, look - look - I'm sorry.
 
COLLINS: And you see with Kyrie Irving with what happened.
 
HARLOW: Oh, yes.
 
LEMON: Oh, yes.
 
GUMBEL: Yes.
 
COLLINS: He was saying he wasn't going to apologize for talking about that movie that pushed these anti-Semitic tropes. And then you saw people seated on the court last night wearing their t-shirts about standing up to anti-Semitism.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: Oh, I didn't see it. I missed it. I was out Halloweening.
 
LEMON: Yes, but if - I mean, but look - if you look at what happened, you know, in baseball. If you look what happened in tennis with Arthur Ashe, you know, on the basketball courts, or whatever, about social justice and civil rights, a lot -- that came from sports. 
 
GUMBEL: Yes, a lot of it comes from sports but it backfires sometimes too. Like, keep an eye on Georgia on Tuesday. 
 
LEMON: Oh. (INAUDIBLE). 
 
GUMBEL: Just saying. It backfire sometimes. 
 
LEMON: Keep an eye on Georgia on Tuesday.
 
HARLOW: We'll be up all night, all day, all night covering all of that. 
 
But let's get back - let's get back to Don. 
 
LEMON: Can I tell you this is - this is an out of body experience -
 
HARLOW: Right.
 
LEMON: Sitting here with you on this set. I mean it's - I grew up -- I know you hate that I hate it now because -
 
GUMBEL: I know, I'm old. I know, I get it, I'm old. 
 
LEMON: People come up to me and say, Don Lemon, I grew up watching you. I'm like, hey, I'm not that old. But I grew up watching you, Bryant, wanting to be you. And here you are sitting on the set with me on CNN. 
 
GUMBEL: Thank you, though.
 
LEMON: And I get to spend, as I said to you at your anniversary is that it is just an honor for me to even be in the room with you. 
 
GUMBEL: I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. Happy for you. 
 
LEMON: Thank you. 
 
GUMBEL: Happy for you.
 
LEMON: Thank you. You got any advice for me? 
 
GUMBEL: Yes, be nice to these two ladies. 
 
HARLOW: Oh, that is not - that is not a challenge. He's a dream (INAUDIBLE). 
 
COLLINS: I'm curious, what did you think when you -
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
COLLINS: What you heard about Don getting this show? 
 
GUMBEL: I sent him a text right away. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: I was surprised, but I wasn't. I knew that, you know, while it hadn't run his course, he was interested in doing something else. I didn't foresee this. But I told him I was here to help if he needs something. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
GUMBEL: But he doesn't need anything.
 
LEMON: So, are you getting to bed earlier now that you don't have to watch me? 
 
GUMBEL: You know, I go to bed late. It doesn't really matter. And I don't sleep much. 
 
LEMON: You don't sleep.
 
GUMBEL: I'm not a sleeper.
 
LEMON: He just does not sleep. 
 
GUMBEL: When I used to do this thing in the morning, I slept an average of about three hours a night.

COLLINS: And what do you sleep now?
