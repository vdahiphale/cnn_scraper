JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: And to suggest in the face of that, that I wouldn't do anything differently on a witness stand. Wow. What a disconnect. What is it that you don't understand? 
 
So, yes, he tried to walk it back today. But I think at the trial was the opportunity to own it. It wasn't owned. And as a result of that, this is a sentence he gets. 
 
But again, bigger picture, I think the world is safer because of the sentence and because of this convict -- these convictions and prosecution/
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: so much pain that we heard today, but the hope is that maybe there will be a little less in the future. 
 
Joey, thank you so much for your analysis. We do appreciate it. 
 
JACKSON: Always.
 
KEILAR: Still ahead, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has set a date to go into southern Gaza, into Rafah, the Biden administration says they have not been told when the military operation will happen. Well talk about it, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:35:33]
 
KEILAR: New today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to push forward with military operations in Rafah. He says, nothing will stand in Israels way. 
 
Netanyahu saying that he's set a date for the IDF invasion of the southern Gaza city where about 1.5 million Palestinians have taken shelter. 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: The secretary of state, Antony Blinken. says that Israel still hasn't given the U.S. that plan date for the invasion. On Monday, CIA director, Bill Burns, gave hostage and ceasefire negotiators in Cairo a new proposal aimed at bridging the gap between the two sides.
 
Let's discuss with former us secretary and coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority, retired Army lieutenant General Mark Schwartz.
 
General Schwartz, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
What do you make of this statement from Netanyahu that there's no force in the world that'll stop the operation into Rafah? Do you see any way that the U.S. might persuade him otherwise are present him with alternatives that might guide him in another direction?
 
LT. GEN. MARK SCHWARTZ, U.S. ARMY, RETIRED: Brianna, Boris, great to be with you.
 
I think really speaking the prime minister that is speaking to multiple audiences. His resolve to go into Rafah and certainly the minister defense, the very hard right? 
 
Israeli political establishment is (TECHNICAL PROBLEM).
 
KEILAR: All right. We're having a problem with the general's connection there. 
 
Let's see if we can try to establish. Let's see if the general can hear us.
 
He cannot. 
 
OK. We're going to try to get General Schwartz back up online. And then we will continue our conversation about what's happening in Gaza. 
 
SANCHEZ: There's still plenty more news to come. There's a blistering new filing from special prosecutors in New Mexico about Alec Baldwin and his alleged behavior on the set of the film, "Rust," saying that it led to the fatal shooting of the film's cinematographer. An important update when we come back.

SANCHEZ: In the race for the White House, President Biden is facing a challenge that he didn't have in 2020, wavering support from young black voters because of his support for Israel and its war in Gaza. 
 
KEILAR: That's right. Some of them even told CNN that even the possibility of another Trump presidency may not change their mind. And that is a huge red flag for the Biden campaign. 
 
CNN's Rene March spoke to young black voters in the key swing state of Georgia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
RENE MARCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This November will be the first time Lonnie White and Rokiya Garbo will be old enough to vote in the presidential election. 
 
And just the second time Malik Poole and Mozn Shora will cast a presidential ballot. 
 
None are planning to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump. 
 
ROKIYA GARBO, NOT VOTING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: If I were to vote tomorrow, I wouldn't vote, period. 
 
MOZN SHORA, VOTING FOR THIRD PARTY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: Ideally, I would like to vote third party. 
 
LONNIE WHITE, VOTING THIRD PARTY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: I'm all for an Independent candidate. 
 
MALIK POOLE, VOTING THIRD PARTY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: I'm considering either voting for Claudia Dela Cruz or Cornell West at this point. If there is no substantive policy change when it comes to the genocide in Gaza, then there's not really a discussion for me.
 
MARSH: When we met at this barbecue restaurant in Atlanta, all four told me they were raised and originally registered as Democrats. But this year, the president's handling of the Israel-Gaza war has turned them away.
 
SHORA: I think what Biden has done in aiding and abetting a genocide is just something I cannot stand for. 
 
MARSH (on camera): You're willing to withhold your vote in the presidential election unless there is a ceasefire.
 
GARBO: Yes. 
 
MARSH: And it's implemented? 
 
GARBO: Yes. 
 
MARSH: Not voting could mean Donald Trump gets into office. Do you think he'll be better on Gaza?
 
SHORA: Trump champ would probably say, flatten Gaza and make it into a golf course. I have absolutely no faith in him. 
 
MARSH: Would you not say that all so the people who are not voting for one of the two people who are the likely people to really be in this race have a role to play in kind of giving the race to Donald Trump? In a state like Georgia, where it's going to be like razor thin?
 
POOLE: I'll do you one better actually, I think that just means that's why the Democrats should listen. WHITE: Exactly 
 
(CHANTING)
 
MARSH (voice-over): Radical and more tapped in than their peers is how the group describes themselves. R
 
okiya, even helping to organize this demonstration in Atlanta last October, calling for peace and aid for the Palestinian people.
 
While they don't speak for the majority of Black voters, their dissent poses a real concern for Democrats in battleground states like Georgia, where Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes. 
 
Black voters under age 30 made up only about 6 percent of voters in Georgia in 2020. That group voted for Joe Biden by more than 50 points. 
 
POOLE: We are holding their election in the palm of our hands and they're not listening 
 
GARBO: We're tired of just hearing him say these things, these empty promises. We have no trust in Joe Biden.
 
MARSH: The Republican Party isn't earning their vote either.
 
GARBO: Both sides or just equal. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 <br>[14:45:02]
 
BARBO: Nothing is being done for us. 
 
SHORA: If enough people vote third party, we can win. That's my thoughts. 
 
MARSH: President Biden's campaign has touted his success on key issues affecting young voters, including student loan forgiveness, lowering unemployment, and tackling inflation.
 
Still though -- 
 
SHORA: I don't feel it. People may be employed, but can they survive off of it? 
 
WHITE: The federal minimum wage has stayed the same since 2009. I was five and 2009, I'm 20 years old now. Well, I work at Goodwill now for $12 an hour. And cost of living keeps increasing, especially here.
 
MARSH ()C): What could President Biden do to change your mind as far as how you vote in November?
 
GARBO: Call for a permanent ceasefire and actually implement it. 
 
SHORA: I would like us to stop giving aid to Israel. WHITE: If he doesn't get elected, that is his fault. That's not our fault. That's not the black voters here. That's not XYZ, no, it's on him.

SANCHEZ: Our thanks to Rena Marsh for that report.
 
Stay with CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:50:26]
 
SANCHEZ: Monday's eclipse across North America was the rare event that offered something for everyone. 
 
KEILAR: I feel like Stephan from SNL. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
KEILAR: New York's hottest nightclub, is it clips, this place has everything -
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
KEILAR: -- weddings, marriage proposals, animals going wild, even a couple of anchors who maybe might've been in costume. So we hear.
 
CNN's Bill Weir (INAUDIBLE).
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Every day, the shadow of the moon bounces willy-nilly across the lifeless Milky Way. And when it hits earth, it mostly darkens ocean or ice with no human witnesses.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The darkness has settled into Kerrville, Texas.
 
WEIR (voice over): But on this day, random fate sent that shadow on a North American tour like no other. And from Mexico to the Maritimes, that shadow moved people to weep and cheer.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.
 
WEIR (voice over): Marry.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you.
 
WEIR: And propose.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you marry me?
 
(CHEERING)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
WEIR: It moved animals, triggering both flamingos and penguins at the Dallas Zoo to bunch their flux tighter for nighttime safety.
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The penguins are all clustered together. The flamingos are all clustered together.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Yes, all the birds are joining together -- 
 
WEIR (voice over): The swath of darkness over 100 miles wide moved clouds.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, it's amazing.
 
WEIR (voice over): And dropped temperatures by 10 degrees.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The chill in the air is getting cooler and cooler.
 
WEIR (voice over): But for science lovers --
 
REPORTER: What did you think of it all?
 
WEIR (voice over): -- there were chills for other reasons.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought it was incredible. You know, I've seen several solar eclipses. This though, one of the best I've ever seen. Because we saw the diamond ring effect. And then, Bailey's beads, you know, the sun coming through the mountains.
 
WEIR: And with the sun less blinding than normal, this was also a rare chance for NASA to use high flying planes, and a rockets to study the sun's corona.
 
And the massive eruptions of plasma happening as the sun cycles through its most active phase.
 
Solar storms have the potential to destroy satellites and fry entire electrical grids. So scientists are hungry for clues that could help predict space weather.
 
WEIR (on camera): If it is the sun's energy that hit earth, much like that shadow, the results could be destructive. Elon Musk lost a couple of dozen satellites to a solar storm recently. It can affect power grids. 
 
To understand what triggers that, what kind of notice we'll get is vital these days as well. But there was a lot more wonder than worry on this one.
 
And just for perspective, newborns today will be old enough to drink the next time, a full solar eclipse hit the United States 22 years from now. Bill Weir, CNN, Atlanta.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
SANCHEZ: Our thanks to Bill for that report. 
 
It really was something to behold and summing incredibly rare. We were lucky to be there.
 
KEILAR: Yes, we really were. It was fantastic.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. 
 <br>[14:53:42]
 
Next, we're getting more reaction in from Arizona after the Supreme Court in that state ruled that they must adhere to a Civil War-era law that bans nearly all abortions. A Planned Parenthood director in Arizona is going to join us live right after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:58:44]
 
KEILAR: As the first over-the-counter birth control pill in the U.S. hits store shelves, the company behind the product is trying to get the word out that they're calling -- in what they're calling a coming out party. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. The maker of Opill is hoping the WNBA can help bring more exposure. And they're partnering to raise awareness, not just about the pill, but also reproductive health and women's health equity. 
 
This isn't the first time the league has taken up a major social issue. 
 
Let's get some perspective now with CNN contributor, Cari Champion.
 
Carry, great to see you this afternoon. 
 
Walk us through why this partnership is so important for the WNBA.
 
CARI CHAMPION, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's important for Opill as well. I think what we have to say -- and I just ill make it really simple and then I'll build from there.
 
And 18.7 million people just watched a college basketball championship game. And what that looks like for me, as a fan, as a player, as a business relationship, there is a following. If you build it, it will come. We know that saying.
 
And they are there -- this is a moment in time where people are paying attention to what's happening in college basketball and women's professional basketball. 
 <br>[14:55:54]
 
Why not take this momentum that we have been able to see over these last few months and partner?
 
And to me, this is a perfect relationship. Because women who play sports, more specifically than any other industry, in my opinion, are constantly worried about: What happens if I have a child? What about my reproductive health? Will I not be able to work? What systems are in place for me?
