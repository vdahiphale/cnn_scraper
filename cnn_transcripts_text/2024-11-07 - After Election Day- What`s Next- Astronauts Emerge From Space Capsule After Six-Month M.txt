ISABEL ROSALES, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to CNN 10. I`m Isabel Rosales filling in for Coy Wire. 
 
I am so happy to be with you again. Today is Thursday, November 7th, and it has been one historic week. So let`s get right into the news. 
 
We start with the political comeback of former President Donald Trump, projected to be the 47th President of the United States. CNN projected 
 
 Trump`s victory yesterday morning after the state of Wisconsin secured him the electoral votes to put him over that 270 votes needed to win the 
 
 presidency. Trump is not only projected to win each of the seven swing states up for grabs in this election, but he also got more votes in some 
 
 places than he did during his 2016 election win. Trump will return to the White House four years after leaving a controversial term and an attempt to 
 
 overturn the 2020 election to stay in office.
 
He`s also the first president to be impeached twice and run for office with criminal convictions and other criminal charges. This is a stunning loss 
 
 for Democrats who ran on keeping Trump from returning to the White House and changing a divided political landscape. It was only in July that Vice 
 
 President Kamala Harris was quickly swapped in as the Democratic Party`s nominee for president. After an already unpopular President Joe Biden gave 
 
 an ill-fated performance at the CNN debate against Trump in June. 
 
Vice President Harris called President-elect Trump on Wednesday to offer her congratulations before delivering a concession speech in front of 
 
 supporters in Washington, D.C.

KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for 
 
 the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we 
 
 fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America`s promise will always burn bright.

ROSALES:  Meanwhile, CNN projects Republicans will win control of the Senate, delivering the party`s first majority in the chamber since 2021. 
 
 The Senate will then have its own election for a Republican leader set to happen next week. At the time this show was written, control of the House 
 
 of Representatives has yet to be called. Republicans are defending a narrow majority there and it could take a week or more before those races are 
 
 determined. 
 
The work of an election doesn`t stop now that Donald Trump is the projected winner of the contest. Our Phil Mattingly walks us through what happens 
 
 after every ballot is cast and shows us how we get to inauguration day.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT:  So what happens after an election? Turns out, a lot. Officials count the ballots in the states. And 
 
 while news agencies like CNN may project a winner -- 
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST:  -- of the presidential race -- 
 
MATTINGLY:  -- doesn`t mean it`s over, especially if there are legal challenges, it could actually take weeks. Now, the vote must be certified 
 
 by December 11th, and that`s where the Electoral College comes into play. See, you might remember, you actually vote for electors.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Has the tally been completed? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, Lieutenant Governor. 
 
MATTINGLY:  And on December 17th, those electors meet, cast their votes, and then send them off to Washington. And if you`re wondering why electors 
 
 don`t go rogue, well, it turns out in most states there are laws binding them to the decision made by their voters. They can`t actually go their own 
 
 way. And then in January, just a few days after a new Congress is sworn in, those votes are read.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  232 votes. 
 
MATTINGLY:  And then they are counted before the new House and Senate chambers. 
 
JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT:  Dissolved.
 
MATTINGLY:  And after all of that, on January 20th of 2025, the new president and vice president are sworn in to begin their four-year term in 
 
 office.

ROSALES:  Ten-second trivia. 
 
In addition to the International Space Station, the United States, Russia, and what other country have each independently launched and operated their 
 
 own space stations? 
 
Canada, India, Japan, or China?
 
Your answer here is China, which constructed the Tiangong Space Station, a crewed space station operated by the China Manned Space Agency.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is the moment China`s Shenzhou-18 capsule touched down on Earth on November 4th. 
 
LI CONG, SHENZHOU-18 CREW MEMBER (through translation):  Although we have successfully completed this Shenzhou-18 mission, the exploration of space 
 
 never ends. 
 
LI GUANGSU, SHENZHOU-18 CREW MEMBER (through translation):  Space is vast, magical and beautiful. We all really enjoy the unique experience of 
 
 weightlessness. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The three-person crew spent six months at China`s space station. There, they ran dozens of experiments, including monitoring 
 
 a tank of zebrafish in a closed mini-ecosystem, according to China`s state broadcaster CCTV.
 
The astronauts also brought back more than 50 samples. Some of these could be used to study the habitability of space environments, reports China`s 
 
 Xinhua news agency.

ROSALES:  Imagine a school where one of your classrooms is the second longest coastline in the world. Well, this unique school, UWC Red Cross 
 
 Nordic, is located in one of Norway`s many fjords, or inlets, and is home to hundreds of students from over 80 countries. The school`s humanitarian 
 
 and environmental focus strives to unite people of all cultures for peace and sustainability.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  The fjords of Western Norway provide a breathtaking backdrop 
 
 to a unique international organization rooted in Nordic culture.
 
JAMES CONNELL, STUDENT, UWC RED CROSS NORDIC:  UWC Red Cross Nordic is an international school teaching students aged from 16 to 19 located on the 
 
 west coast of Norway.
 
MACFARLANE:  With 200 students from 90 countries, UWC Red Cross Nordic offers a unique learning environment.
 
MAHDULIKA SINGH, TEACHER, UWC RED CROSS NORDIC:  The college has environment as one of our base pillars, so we focus a lot on environment 
 
 and impact on environment. So this sort of comes in everything we do.
 
MACFARLANE:  The school is supported by the Red Cross and encourages students to take action to protect people and places in need. At the center 
 
 of their education model is a project-based learning, or PBL.
 
SINGH:  Project-based learning basically implies that they are the ones who are part of the planning and they do the project and then they evaluate and 
 
 look into how things work.
 
MACFARLANE:  A recent study found that Norway contributes an estimated 15,000 tons of plastic waste into the environment annually, and with almost 
 
 29,000 kilometers of coastline, plastic pollution poses a threat to marine ecosystems around the country.
 
SINGH:  Norway has one of the longest coasts in the world and that is why it makes it so complicated, right? 
 
MACFARLANE:  During the coastal cleanup PBL, the students are leaving their dorms and embracing Norwegian coastal culture.
 
DALMAS OREJE NGANYI, STUDENT, UWC RED CROSS NORDIC:  We`re living in a boat for five days. It`s just a joy being when you wake up and there`s a little 
 
 bit of waves you wake up to, you know, some rowing and it`s totally magnificent.
 
NORKIS VALERO MENDEZ, STUDENT, UWC RED CROSS NORDIC:  It has been really great. I haven`t been in a boat before. Sometimes it moves and it`s a bit 
 
 scary but it`s really, really cool.
 
MACFARLANE:  The project has been running for the past four years. During this time students have removed several tons of plastic from coastal 
 
 islands, significantly impacting both the environment and the participants.
 
CONNELL:  Within the space of about six hours we collected around 300 kilograms of plastic and it was -- it was totally surprising.
 
ANA POL MAYORAL, STUDENT, UWC RED CROSS NORDIC:  It`s been quite bittersweet. So just opening up and seeing like layers and layers and 
 
 layers of plastic where you take out one and there there`s even more and more.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Crazy.
 
VALERO MENDEZ:  I still really want to make something that thanks to this experience will allow me to inspire other people and to tell them that this 
 
 is going on. Thanks to the fact that I saw it with my own eyes.
 
SINGH:  It doesn`t have to be changing the whole world but if they can make an impact in their own little way in the spaces they are in that little 
 
 sort of drop in the ocean probably many drops will make a big difference.

ROSALES:  Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, get a whiff of this sensational souvenir. For a cool $11 you too can take home a breezy can of 
 
 air.
 
Yes, air from Italy`s Lake Como. Communications company ItalyComunica, says it has bottled 400 millimeters of 100% authentic air from the super trendy 
 
 tourist destination. Some may call it a gimmicky gift but hey it`s going to fit in your carry-on.
 
Time now for the best part of the day. We are sending a shout out to the Panther Cubs of Beverly Middle School in Beverly, Massachusetts. All right 
 
 keep on shining superstars. 
 
Today has been so much fun everyone. I`m Isabel Rosales. Thank you so much for letting me join you all. I am ready to take on the rest of the day and
