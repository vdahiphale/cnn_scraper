DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Love that song. You are watching CNN's "Fourth in America." There is a lot ahead before the big finish with fireworks displays on the West Coast, including Alaska. Victor Blackwell and Cari Champion are standing by in San Diego as our coverage continues into the night. Hi, guys.
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: Hey, you guys have had a great couple of hours. But there is a lot more to come. We've got some great shows, including here from the San Diego Bay.
 
CARI CHAMPION, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, we do. And I think it's funny because we were talking about some of these songs. When you hear them, they take you back. And I know not necessarily the concert because I feel as if 4th of July is like a huge concert, "All American Rejects," I love them.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
CHAMPION: But you're here for the fireworks as well.
 
BLACKWELL: I'm here for the fireworks. I love an old-fashioned firework show. No shade at the drone shows --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- that some cities do. But I like a boom. And we're going to get that big baby boom here, one of the biggest fireworks shows in the country.
 
CHAMPION: Yup.
 
BLACKWELL: And then we've got shows across the country, including -- and I'm excited about this -- this year, for the first time in 4th of America, we're going to Alaska.
 
CHAMPION: Okay. That's going to be amazing. 
 
BLACKWELL: Over the mountains in Alaska. Wait until you see this. It's going to be beautiful.
 
CHAMPION: I'm looking forward to Darius Rucker as well. He is coming up.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: You guys know him from "Hootie &amp; the Blowfish." He's just Darius now.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
CHAMPION: But I do know for a fact he is a huge sports fan. That's where I first met him, in that world. So, I'm looking forward to seeing what he's going to give us tonight.
 
BLACKWELL: You know, I just want -- we've got a shot, I think, we can take to show you what's around us. The boats are out. There are people who have brought their chairs and their families to the seawall.
 
CHAMPION: So nice. 
 
BLACKWELL: It is amazing here now.
 
CHAMPION: We hear some fireworks.
 
BLACKWELL: We hear some fireworks.
 
CHAMPION: We hear some fireworks now.
 
BLACKWELL: These are like the independent family fireworks that we are hearing right now. 
 
CHAMPION: The ones I did when I was a kid?
 
BLACKWELL: Right. Yeah, that is coming.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
But, I mean, this is a beautiful setting. So, be with us tonight for this amazing show over San Diego. We've got San Francisco, we've got Philly, we've got some -- 
 
CHAMPION: Nashville! 
 
BLACKWELL: Nashville as well. 
 
CHAMPION: They actually showed a shot of Nashville earlier and it was packed. That's going to be huge. That's going to be a good thing to see. Have you been in Nashville recently?
 
BLACKWELL: Uh, been a couple of years.
 
CHAMPION: A couple. Okay.
 
BLACKWELL: We'll go together tonight.
 
CHAMPION: We'll go together tonight. 
 
BLACKWELL: Boris, back to you.
 
BASH: Can we come?
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Would love an invite, guys.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, of course. You can all go is what we mean. 
 
SANCHEZ: We are just behind you as the sun is starting -- the sun is starting to set in San Diego, and we're going to join our friends, Victor, Cari, and Dana as we go to Nashville right now for more fireworks and a performance like country music superstar Brad Paisley at the "Let Freedom Sing! Music City July 4th" show. Brad?

SANCHEZ: He is fantastic, yeah.
 
BASH: And yes, we are wearing silly glasses. But you know what? It's late and why not? Our colleague, John Robinson, got these for the bureau and so we thought, we should wear them, we should honor them.
 
SANCHEZ: We needed some eye protection from the brightness --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
-- of Braid Paisley star and obviously all the lights up in Nashville. And shout out as he gave to members of our armed services. He offered them a beer. Their sacrifice is so important. And obviously, we honor that as we celebrate our nation tonight.
 
BASH: I'm going to take off my mine for now until I can talk about what is up next because we have a lot, a lot more. After a break, there's going to be fireworks in the San Diego Bay. Demi Lovato is putting on a very, very big show in the City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia. Stay right there.

CHAMPION: We're ready to do some fireworks, have a good time. BLACKWELL: Yes.

CHAMPION: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: -- of our country. You've got to go to Philly and show the show.
 
CHAMPION: You have to show the show. Look at Nashville. Take a look over there. They had an entire city street lit with people waiting to see this concert and, obviously, the fireworks. A city that I think represents what we are celebrating tonight. That's the nation's concert.
 
BLACKWELL: You know, Nashville, this show has been going on for some time now. I don't know if we're at the finale yet, but they have really put on a show tonight. And, I mean, Nashville has really rivaled some of the shows we have seen from D.C. --
 
CHAMPION: Yeah.
 
BLACKWELL: -- New York and Philly had a great --
 
CHAMPION: I would say equally. I would say equally in terms of what they bring. It's obviously one of the fastest-growing cities. They have so much there. People are watching in terms of where to go. That is the next place that you and I will attend, a concert.
 
BLACKWELL: You are determined to get me to a concert in Nashville.
 
CHAMPION: I am determined to get Victor to a concert in Nashville.
 
BLACKWELL: It's a great music city.
 
CHAMPION: It's so -- so you say yes.
 
BLACKWELL: I've said yes.
 
CHAMPION: Okay. I don't know. See, we sit on camera. We can roll the tape back. Okay?
 
BLACKWELL: Yes. I've said yes.

And it is now getting dark here in San Diego.
 
CHAMPION: Yeah.
 
BLACKWELL: We are standing here on San Diego Bay on the pier here waiting for the big bay boom, one of the great shows, one of many great shows still to come tonight as "Fourth in America" special continue.
 
CHAMPION: Yeah. And I'll tell you this. This is one of the days I'm really happy that I have an opportunity to work with someone like you. We still have much more to come, as Victor just mentioned. The Zac Brown band still ahead. You don't want to miss it. We are live from San Diego on Coronado Pier.

BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
CHAMPION: But I want everyone to know at home, it really is a family friendly event. Over to our right, you can see all of these families walking along the pier, walking along the bay --
 
BLACKWELL: They got white lights on, riding along the seawall.
 
CHAMPION: They got their bike lights on. They're bike riding. It really feels like the celebration were supposed to have for 4th of July.
 
BLACKWELL: It is beautiful. The people are here waiting for the big show. The big bay boom that's coming to cap off the show here. It has been a fantastic weekend --

CHAMPION: That was an absolutely wonderful performance. I did a little research on "The Roots of Music" and the guy who actually started the academy was a CNN hero.
 
BLACKWELL: Derrick Tabb.
 
CHAMPION: Yeah, which I think is so amazing. And these kids, between the ages of 9 and 14 years old.
 
BLACKWELL: I love that we're highlighting that this year as, of course, we're watching the New Orleans fireworks show.
 
CHAMPION: Yeah.
 
BLACKWELL: The second group you saw, they are 9 to 14.
 
CHAMPION: Yeah. BLACKWELL: And then the older group you saw first that were performing "When the Saints Go Marching In," 15 to 19. 
 
CHAMPION: I love it. 
 
BLACKWELL: What's great about this also is that "The Roots of Music Academy" --
 
CHAMPION: Yeah.
 
BLACKWELL: -- is a 10-month program that teaches them more than music but how to start a music production business.
 
CHAMPION: Which is so important. Yeah. And it's for low-income kids. They have all the support around it. Ancillary support programs.
 
BLACKWELL: And they are good. 
 
CHAMPION: And they're -- on top of, they're good, although, I said they should wear some jackets because I was, like, oh, their arms are cold.
 
BLACKWELL: Put some jackets on these kids.
 
CHAMPION: I turned into a grandma, put jackets on.
