ABDUL ABDULLAH, FOUNDER, AFROFUTURE FESTIVAL: People tend to think about Africa, like as one country, where they have 54 different countries, several different experiences, within each country. Now, we don't have anywhere we can go, and celebrate these cultures. And we've created one to be able to do that.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Across the world, there are communities of African descent that make up the Global Diaspora, with one of the highest concentrations, being in the United States.
 <br>[21:30:00]
 
Through curated experiences, such as the AfroFuture Festival, in Ghana, a new space is being created, for Black folks, to return to the continent, for what feels like a multi-century delayed family reunion.
 
ABDULLAH: We're in a very unique time, where everybody wants to have a greater education about themselves. Black people have different experiences, across the world, but similar experiences. You're not alone in the world.
 
AfroFuture Festival, for us, was an opportunity to bring together the Black diaspora. They feel seen, as soon as they touch down on the ground.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The art, culture and music of the motherland, is creating an energy that is now re-centering Africa's presence in the world. Now, a multibillion-dollar industry, Afrobeats Music is playing a key role, in the global spotlight being put on the continent.
 
ABDULLAH: We wanted our music to become world music. And now, you're hearing new sounds that are changing your perspective. So, it's pretty exciting. And I think there is a connection between the diaspora connecting, and the music taking off.
 
Our powers, as the global Black diasporas, within each other, and the more we get to know each other is the more that we're able to really hone that power.
