BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Carla (ph), you are from the D.C. area. But you're here with Valenton (ph) who is your husband. You married a Frenchman. What are you hoping to show him, tonight?
 
CARLA (ph), WASHINGTON, D.C.: Some lovely fireworks. Hopefully it doesn't rain. And a good time. I'm here with my dad as well. So, it's a nice family moment.
 
KEILAR: And this is your first time seeing this. What are you expecting?
 
VALENTON (ph), CARLA's (ph) HUSBAND: Well, I expect it to be great. It's the U.S. So, the U.S. usually do it like very big and very -- very great. So, I expect -- expect the best.
 
KEILAR: A very fun couple, considering the story of our independence.
 
VALENTON (ph): Yes.
 
KEILAR: Back to you guys, Boris and Dana.
 
DANA BASH, CNN HOST (on camera): Thanks, Bri.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST (on camera): Yes.
 
BASH (on camera): We are really feeling the Fourth of July spirit. The fireworks are about to begin. You know what we need now?
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): How about some of America's most rousing and patriotic tunes? The U.S. Air Force Band has been warming up behind us.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): And now, it's showtime.

SANCHEZ (voice-over): There's nothing like the voice of "Old Blue Eyes" Frank Sinatra, looking at the Statue of Liberty, watching that skyline of Manhattan in the background, light up the way that it just did. What an amazing fireworks display in New York City.
 
BASH (voice-over): Absolutely.
 
I mean, just still taking it all in.
 
BASH (on camera): Let's go though, to Harry Enten, who really took it all in, from overlooking New York City, overlooking the Hudson River.
 
Harry, what was it like in-person?
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Let me just tell you. You might have been able to see it on your TV. I literally smelled it. The smell of the fireworks drifted their way over here. I smelled it. I felt so proud to be an American. This is exactly where I want to be.
 
And I'll note. I'm a little bit of a nihilist. But when you see fireworks, like that, you can't help but be proud. And more than that, guys, it started to rain just a little bit. So, I feel so lucky that we were able to get that show in. It just felt like everything came together, tonight, guys.
 
BASH (on camera): All right. Harry, thank you so much.
 
Our July 4th Party is still going strong.
 
BASH (voice-over): Much, much more of America's impressive firework shows, getting underway, any minute, including Philadelphia, and in Nashville, where the streets downtown are packed with people. They are so excited for the action to begin there.
 
Get ready to see the iconic Gateway Arch in St. Louis, light up.
 
You've got it all, right here, along with an extraordinary roster of big-name musical talent.
 
Popstar Kesha will perform some of her best-known hits.
 
Country Music great Keith Urban will debut a brand-new song, right here.
 
And rapper T-Pain will bring down the house.
 
Those are just some of the must-see moments, coming up.
 
This is the Fourth of July in America on CNN. Don't go anywhere.
