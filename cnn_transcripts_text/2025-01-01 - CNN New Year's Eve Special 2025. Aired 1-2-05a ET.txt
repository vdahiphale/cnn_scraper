SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: This is my first time having your barbecue. I don't go to Michelin star place. Y'all are fancy. Y'all might go. 
 
CARI CHAMPION, CNN HOST: I don't believe that. No.
 
HARRY ENTEN, SENIOR POLITICAL DATA REPORTER: No. 
 
SIDNER: You know Chipotle. You know that. I know that's a sacrilege around here. You don't need to do that.
 
CHAMPION: I believe there are things that there are meals you eat as you bring in the New Year. Right? 
 
SIDNER: For sure. 
 
CHAMPION: Black Eyed Peas that people talk about. 
 
SIDNER: Right.
 
CHAMPION: Greens perhaps depending on how you grew up, there's something you have to bring in the new year. I do believe barbecue needs to be red beans and rice. I do believe barbecue needs to be a part of our new regimen as we celebrate the new year. I'm so excited that were able to do that with her. This food is amazing, Harry. Did you not enjoy it? 
 
ENTEN: I absolutely enjoyed it very, very much. 
 
SIDNER: How big are the lines? That's what I want to know. How big are the lines? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On the weekends, they can be up to about an hour and a half, two hours. 
 
SIDNER: That's how good they are. And we'll -- I'll wait an hour and a half to two hours. Oh, we're on the countdown. Y'all were about to be in the new year in 2025. How far away are we just yet? 
 
CHAMPION: About 15 --
 
SIDNER: 12, 11, 10, nine. Count it down with me. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year. ENTEN: Yes. 
 
SIDNER: I'm hugging you. Come on. 
 
ENTEN: Thank you. I don't feel I'm lonely on that side. 
 
SIDNER: Got to get the flow. Come here. Come on. Come here. All right, it's happening. Well, that's awesome. What is this? It's a Whoville one. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are we ready? 
 
(MUSIC)
 <br>[01:12:00]
 
CHAMPION: Do you have any New Year's resolutions? 
 
ENTEN: Lame, lame. Lame. Lame.
 
SIDNER: I don't make New Year's resolutions. 
 
ENTEN: Do you make New Year's resolutions? 
 
CHAMPION: Of course. I make a New Year resolution. 
 
ENTEN: OK.
 
SIDNER: What is yours? 
 
CHAMPION: New Year's resolution is always to better. That's it. 
 
SIDNER: That's it. 
 
CHAMPION: That's it. 
 
SIDNER: That simple.
 
CHAMPION: Whatever that means. There's no --
 
SIDNER: You know what I do have, Harry knows. I don't make New Year's resolutions because I find that I fail at them and it's just depressing. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes, that's not true.
 
SIDNER: But I do have a theme of each year. 
 
CHAMPION: OK.
 
SIDNER: The theme this year is finding more joy. 
 
CHAMPION: Finding more joy. 
 
ENTEN: You got to hang out with me more. 
 
SIDNER: I do have to hang out with Harry more. 
 
CHAMPION: Well, your headdress suggests there is more joy coming. 
 
SIDNER: There is. 
 
CHAMPION: The sequence suggests joy is on the way. And yes.
 
ENTEN: There's more joy right here. 
 
CHAMPION: And you. 
 
ENTEN: Do you want to know what my New Year's resolution is? 
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: Please tell us. 
 
ENTEN: It is to be cleaner. Be cleaner. If you check out my desk at work, it's the most disgusting thing in the world. So I'm going to try and be cleaner. Now, I shall note that my New Year's resolution last year was to be cleaner. And I failed. But this year, I swear I'm going to succeed. 
 
CHAMPION: But Harry --
 
SIDNER: I pray.
 
CHAMPION: -- I'm concerned about cleaner. 
 
SIDNER: Are y'all hearing that? Like the fireworks are awful. 
 
ENTEN: Poor doggies. Oh my God. The Susan Laughos. How horrible. Unbelievable. 
 
CHAMPION: I don't know what you're saying, because it's so loud. 
 
ENTEN: It's so loud. It's so loud. The dog. 
 
SIDNER: You are asleep. 
 
CHAMPION: Oh, I don't have my -- OK. 
 
ENTEN: Here we go. Now, Sidner, give me yours. 
 
SIDNER: Yee-haw. 
 
CHAMPION: OK. OK. OK.
 
ENTEN: OK, now I'm going to switch it around. Here we go. And now we got it.
 
SIDNER: And that was the fireworks show. It's apple cider. 
 
CHAMPION: It's apple cider. 
 
SIDNER: It's not alcohol. Sorry, guys. CHAMPION: OK, so whose is this? I don't want to -- OK. Oh, he drank
 
 it. 
 
SIDNER: It doesn't matter. He's like my brother. 
 
CHAMPION: I know. I know. You guys -- but he wants to be more clean. 
 
ENTEN: I'm clean now.
 
CHAMPION: He says he wants to be more clean. He says he wants to be more clean. You're not concerned. You're drinking after a man who says to be more clean. 
 
ENTEN: There you go. 
 
SIDNER: It's good times. 
 
ENTEN: Clean desk, not necessarily clean living. 
 
SIDNER: Your girlfriend's over there going, yes, he has to clean it on up right now. 
 
CHAMPION: All right. So still more New Year's fun to ring in. We had a great firework show here, but we have more from 50 Cent. 
 
ENTEN: Fifty.
 
CHAMPION: It's pronounced the 50. It's 50 Cent. And some special guests to help us bring in the new year here in Austin. We'll be back in just a few moments. Happy New Year. 
 
SIDNER: Happy New Year.

SIDNER: Their amazing dance team. These ladies work hard. Oh, are you a member? 
 
ENTEN: Actually, there's something you guys need to know. Why I've been absent from work the past few weeks. It's because I came down here to Austin. I have a second life. And that is, I am, of course a member of the dance team down at Utah. 
 
SIDNER: How -- OK, so we've got the two captains here. I just wanted to ask you, did he try out and make the team or is he making this up?

ENTEN: They're better than me. 
 
SIDNER: And now, speaking of someone who's quite good at what he does, our Gary Tuchman is live for us. Gary, where are you and what is going to be dropping? Because there's always something different with you that drops from the sky on New Year's. 
 
GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sara, Cari, Harry Happy almost 2025 from Prescott, Arizona, this is Whiskey Row. It's a launch street. It is city of 45,000 people. Music behind us. Police estimate between 15 and 20,000 people here. And what's going to happen here on Whiskey Row shortly the stroke of midnight. 
 
Right up here you can see a big cowboy boot. This is the Whiskey Row boot drop. That boot is going to come down at the stroke of midnight in the Mountain Time zone to signify 2025. 
 
Why is it called Whiskey Row? Well, I can tell you there are a lot of saloons on this street today in this day and age. It's very classy. It's a beautiful place. There's stores, there are boutiques, there are bookstores, there are art galleries. 
 
The Whiskey Row name comes from a century ago, in the late 19th century, the early 20th century, because there are more than 40 saloons on this one block. And this was the middle of the Wild West. Literally at that time, there were cowboys here. There were prospectors looking for gold and silver. There were also outlaws. There was also all girls who were here. Opium dens, gambling. 
 
I can tell you there still is gambling here. There's casinos nearby and there's also upped bedding inside some of these restaurants. But it's been a swinging place the 1890s and the 1910s. It's still a great place to come today. Where are you guys from? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: India. 
 
TUCHMAN: You're from India? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
TUCHMAN: India is a long way from Arizona. Did you come here, Arizona just for New Year's or have you been in the United States or anything? 
 <br>[01:25:00]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are from Tempe. We are ASU grads, so.
 
TUCHMAN: So you go to college? OK. Happy New Year to you. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you do. 
 
TUCHMAN: I want to give you guys a look at something very historic. Have you ever seen a more beautiful courthouse, a more beautiful holiday lighting job at a courthouse? This is the courthouse in this county. And here's some historic news to tell you about this. The late Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona, when he ran for President 1964, against Lyndon Johnson, this is where he announced his candidacy right here in the Alapai Courthouse, right front of the courthouse. 
 
So there's some news that happened here as well as being the famous Whiskey Row. So you see the celebration going on here. We're going to have a very festive and happy New Year's here in the Mountain Time zone. Very shortly, that boot will come down to signify the beginning of the new year in this part of the United States. Back to you. 
 
SIDNER: I love it. The boot's going to come down. He gave you a little presidential history. 
 
ENTEN: He did. I believe --
 
CHAMPION: He's a professional. 
 
ENTEN: He's so -- Gary is just the --
 
CHAMPION: Gary, you are a professional. 
 
SIDNER: And he's one of the nicest guys ever me. 
 
ENTEN: The nicest. And --
 
SIDNER: It's true. 
 
ENTEN: And I will note, although Barry Goldwater did not win that election, I do believe he carried his home state of Arizona. I say, I think by just a point, if my mind is correct. 
 
SIDNER: Wow. He's always got --
 
CHAMPION: The boot is a whole historic moment. And it's only been, it's like what, since 2010, 2011. 
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: I was reading that earlier. It's amazing. 
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: Gary, we thank you for the education. 
 
SIDNER: Than you, Gary.
 
CHAMPION: Have we given an education? We did some dancing. 
 
SIDNER: We've gotten our --
 
CHAMPION: We talk about new edition.
 
SIDNER: Can we just show on dancers real quick. 
 
CHAMPION: We have -- 
 
SIDNER: There they are, ladies and germs. 
 
CHAMPION: They're dancing. 
 
SIDNER: The team from the University of Texas, the dance team. They have been standing out here. I know that they're not cold anymore because they have been dancing their butts off. 
 
CHAMPION: How do you know that? 
 
SIDNER: I know. You guys are good, right? You're not too cold? See.
 
ENTEN: They're freezing. 
 
SIDNER: See? 
 
CHAMPION: We also want to give you guys a quick shout out. Tomorrow you're in the Peach Bowl against Arizona State. That's why went to Gary, who was (INAUDIBLE). Congratulations. Good luck. Throw them up again. One more time. Peach Bowl, y'all going for it. They're playing in Atlanta tomorrow at the Mercedes Benz Zone. So we got to say shout out to them as well.
 
SIDNER: I think ranked -- they're ranked like 2 or 3. 
 
CHAMPION: You guys, where are you ranked at? Ladies, do you know your football team? 
 
SIDNER: I think it's three. I think you guys are ranked three in Arizona. 
 
CHAMPION: They're like don't bother us with that. Which is great. 
 
ENTEN: I had it, right, I had it, right? 
 
SIDNER: See. They know. They know what's going on. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes. Don't bother us with that. 
 
SIDNER: OK, now let me tell you who's ranked number one. He's not a dollar, but he's 50 Cent. 
 
CHAMPION: Hey, fifty. He's 50 Cent. He fifty. He's ranked number one. 
 
SIDNER: And here's the thing. He's going to take us to the candy shop. 
 
CHAMPION: What happens there? 
 
SIDNER: Kids, don't go to the candy shop.
 
CHAMPION: What happens at the candy shop? 
 
SIDNER: I can't say. It's an adult situation. 
 
CHAMPION: Have you all been to the candy shop? 
 
SINDER: No. 
 
ENTEN: What candy shop is this? 
 
CHAMPION: Harry hasn't been to the candy shop. 
 
ENTEN: No, I don't think so. I have the cue card here which says he's in the club residency at Ph Live at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino.

SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: All right. We are back here in Austin, Texas where we have about 30 minutes ago had the countdown, enjoyed everything except for we have one more fantastic guest with us here today.
 
Live and in person, the Jones Family Singers -- five sisters, four brothers -- 
 
(CROSSTALKING)
 
SIDNER: -- and a bishop, Papa. He's here. Tell me about this. Tell me. Yes. Top dog.
 <br>[01:34:50]
 
SIDNER: Tell me about this group. Because not all families get along the same. And yet you all -- I mean, let's tell the truth. I mean, come on. 
 
Not all -- and that you all have managed to be singing with each other for almost 30 years. How did you do it? What's the secret sauce? 
 
BISHOP FRED JONES, JONES FAMILY SINGERS: The secret to it is the two Bs, the Bible and the Belt. 
 
CHAMPION: Oh, dang. Well, tell me about the latter. 
 
SIDNER: Why don't we just move over a little bit. 
 
CHAMPION: I know about the bible but what happens with the belt? 
 
JONES: Well, when you get out of line, the belt helps to put you right back. 
 
SIDNER: Wow. 
 
ENTEN: My girlfriend is taking lessons from you right now. 
 
CHAMPION: Are we? When do we stop using the belt? Never. Or is there an age? JONES: Well, I think as long as you live, if you cross the line,
 
 you're subject to get it. 
 
CHAMPION: Ok. Listen, listen. Hey, I'll tell you what I'm not going to do, Bishop. I'm not going to cause you any trouble at all. 
 
I'm going to be as good as a little angel around you, because I don't want that belt.
 
JONES: Good enough.
 
CHAMPION: At all. 
 
SIDNER: We want no trouble here, Bishop. No trouble. 
 
And when you all -- How did it turn out that you decided, like, hey, look, all my children, all the folks in my family can sing. How did you know? 
 
JONES: Well, I've sung with other groups and it didn't pan out. And I said, I got all of these kids here that need to be productive. They need to learn something. And so their mother and I started working with them, working with them. 
 
They called me Joe Jackson and started working with them until they learned their parts. They got themselves fixed in music, gospel music.
 
CHAMPION: Yes. 
 
JONES: And it was a downhill from then on. 
 
SIDNER: I love it. And I've already heard you all singing, and I know you can bring the heat. 
 
So we are going to wait and listen to you bring it for us. Love train, right. Thats what we're hearing first. 
 
JONES: All right. That's it. 
 
SIDNER: All right, Bishop.
 
CHAMPION: Thank you so much.
 
SIDNER: We'll be back. 
 
ENTEN: Let's get some dancing.

SIDNER: Before we get there though, I have to just say, do you all know, I've got to put on my (INAUDIBLE) because I love me some dolly.
 
CHAMPION: I love the Dolly hat.
 
SIDNER: And Dolly have done a duet, and they sang "Every Breath You Take" together on her first ever rock album. 
 
ENTEN: Oh, I didn't know that. 
 
SIDNER: So I am excited about that. Also I must say I was going to say don't stand so close to me. Please don't stand so.
 
CHAMPION: That's a Dolly song. I think.
 
It's Sting. It's Sting.
 
ENTEN: It's Sting. It's not Dolly, it's Sting.
 
CHAMPION: Wait, but I want to know why aren't you a DJ? You know, every song. Like she knows every song. 
 
ENTEN: She knows everything.
 
CHAMPION: She knows everything that's going on. You're bringing out props. No one has their Dolly Parton props. 
 
SIDNER: I had to. 
 
ENTEN: Can I try that? I want to try that Dolly. 
 
SIDNER: Ok, ill switch hats. 
 
CHAMPION: Meanwhile, they're switching out. 17-time Grammy winning artist Sting, "I Wrote Your Name Somewhere Upon My Heart". Oh, there you go. 
 
(MUSIC)
 
STING, SINGER: So here's a new song. It's a romantic song, but it's noisy. It's called "I Wrote Your Name Upon My Heart". 
 <br>[01:48:43]
 
(MUSIC)
 
CHAMPION: Many times I have been told to write my name upon someone's heart. I've tried not to. I tried not do.
 
ENTEN: I know you broke up my heart.
 
CHAMPION: I am a heartbreaker.
 
SIDNER: I know you, heartbreaker. I know.
 
CHAMPION: But I'm a recovering heartbreaker.
 
SIDNER: ok.
 
CHAMPION: Because there are two things that I do not want. I don't want the belt. And I don't need nobody to throw the bible at me. Ok. 
 
SIDNER: Don't upset Bishop. 
 
CHAMPION: Do not upset Bishop behind us.
 
SIDNER: Don't upset Bishop Jones. 
 
CHAMPION: Thank you guys for being here. We have one more amazing performance from The Jones Family Singers again. Five brothers, two sisters. And obviously we heard Bishop Fred Jones earlier give us our message. A belt and a bible. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. I've heard it. 
 
CHAMPION: Now they are performing. You heard it too. 
 
ENTEN: I heard it loud and clear. 
 
CHAMPION: Loud and clear. They are performing their song. What is it?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: We are back live here in Austin, Texas. 
 
We just got done just praising it. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. SIDNER: Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. 
 
The Jones Family Singers just sounded like a combination of James Brown, Aretha Franklin, like, thank you all. 
 
CHAMPION: Give it up for yourselves. Thank you so much. Thank you. 
 
SIDNER: The crowd loves you too. 
 
CHAMPION: Thank you, crowd, for being here and giving it up. Yes. 
 
ENTEN: I got to say, as a Jewish boy from the Bronx, even I was getting down with it. 
 
SIDNER: You were getting it, ok? 
 
ENTEN: If I ever converted, it'd be because of songs like that. 
 
SIDNER: Ok, well, your phones ringing and it's -- 
 
ENTEN: Uh-oh.
 
CHAMPION: It's your mom. But, you know.
 
ENTEN: Dr. Strasberg, not too pleased with that. 
 
SIDNER: Not happy. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes, but this has been just an absolutely wonderful time with you guys. It has really been enjoyable with the crew that we've had here. 
 
SIDNER: And we have more because we have not yet celebrated the new year in the next time zone.
 
CHAMPION: In the next time zone. The professors here are historian, our person who is going to give us all the information that we need. 
 
SIDNER: He is here. Gary Tuchman is live for us in Arizona. Gary, you are getting real close. What's happening where you are? 
 
GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sarah, Cari, Harry, welcome to beautiful Prescott, Arizona. Is everyone having a good time? 
 
All right. We are in the Mountain Time Zone. This is known as Whiskey Row. Whiskey Row because this downtown stretch on Montezuma Street has lots of saloons. 
 
125 years ago, it had even more when the 40 saloons on this one stretch of block. And that's where it got the name Whiskey Row. So these are some of the saloons on Whiskey Row. 
 
This is Matt Saloon right here. You can see the lights of 2025 on top.
 <br>[01:59:47] TUCHMAN: And right here on top it is the Whiskey Row boot drop. And that is the big Prescott cowboy boot that will come down starting 30s before midnight. 
 
This restaurant and saloon is called The Palace Restaurant and Saloon. It's the oldest restaurant and saloon in the entire state of Arizona. It was built in 1877, and it's been here all those years since.
 
In 20 seconds now, let's get a look at the food. And it's about to come down now. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year! 
 
(CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE)
 
TUCHMAN: And a wonderful firework celebration here. What's so unique about this celebration here in Prescott, at 10:00 local time, midnight in the east coast in Times Square. They also lowered the boot to celebrate New Year's at the east coast. So it's two celebrations in a town that is terrific.
 
Prescott, Arizona, we thank them for hosting us. And everyone, Happy New Year to all of you!
 
ALL: Happy New Year!
 
TUCHMAN: Happy 2025, everybody.
 
Back to you in Austin, Texas.
 
CARI CHAMPION, CNN HOST: Gary gave me a great idea, OK? A great idea.
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN HOST: OK.
 
CHAMPION: Because we haven't really done this.
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: Can we turn around and face the crowd and tell them Happy New Year?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: Yes.
