And now, your hosts Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen.
 
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, "ANDERSON COOPER: 360": And welcome to Times Square in the last four hours of 2024. I'm Anderson Cooper here with Andy Cohen in the middle of thousands, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of partiers who did not let the threat of rain dampen their spirits or water down their drinks.
 
ANDY COHEN, AMERICAN RADIO AND TELEVISION TALK SHOW HOST, PRODUCER, WRITER: Although, by the way, we just walked through.
 
COOPER: It's like a morgue here.
 
COHEN: They don't seem that psyched. Just so you know, they got to ep it up, everybody. Its New Year's Eve.
 
COOPER: We went to see Sandra Bernhard perform last night, and her crowd was kind of dead, too.
 
COHEN: Yes, exactly. But the earlier crowd was better.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: It's a great show and we have a great show planned tonight. We have a night of music, comedy, alcohol and mayhem. We have so many great guests. I am very excited for this, our eighth year together.
 
COOPER: And they said it wouldn't last.
 
COHEN: And they said, it wouldn't last.
 
COOPER: I thought you would have been fired by now.
 
COHEN: I thought you would have turned on me by now, Anderson.
 
COOPER: That too.
 
COHEN: Yes, you know, Anderson --
 
COOPER: There had been moments.
 
COHEN: Yes, I know, just about 10 minutes ago, Anderson, I thought you were in something of a foul mood.
 
COOPER: I was.
 
COHEN: The camera seems to have lit you back up. And I'll tell you a moment that you had this year --
 
COOPER: Oh, what a moment.
 
COHEN: -- which should have put you in a horrible mood. And it's the moment that really, I think, propelled us to where we're about to be. That was you in the hurricane. Look at you getting pounded by debris, Anderson. Look at this clip.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COOPER: It's coming in from down the north, I guess northeast. And the water now is really starting to pour over. If you look at the ground. Whoa, okay that wasn't good.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: No, that wasn't good.
 
COOPER: That wasn't good. it was styrofoam, I just want to say, like, there were hundreds of articles the next day saying I was hit in the head by debris.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: None of them said styrofoam, which I pointed out immediately afterward. It was a piece of styrofoam.
 
COHEN: Well, you're not implicated in anything. What happened as a result --
 
COOPER: Would I have been implicated.
 
COHEN: Well, the twittersphere --?
 
COOPER: Andersphere --
 
COHEN: I don't know, went crazy. Anderson Cooper is out here getting doinked. Okay, keep going. There's more, there's more. Basically, they felt that after the year that you have had --
 
COOPER: CNN had better let Anderson Cooper blackout on New Year's Eve.
 
COHEN: Yes. Well guess what? That's where I come in. I brought the Tequila, Anderson. I brought the shot glasses.
 
COOPER: But is that -- I've never seen a bottle like that.
 
COHEN: I know it's a beautiful bottle. We are going to do this at the top of every hour.
 
COOPER: Okay.
 
COHEN: Okay, and we want you to join us. And you can join us with toast. With whatever you're drinking, water -- 
 
COOPER: And for the record, I do not really drink.
 
COHEN: Well, I know, but that's the fun of New Year's Eve. Anderson doesn't drink.
 
COOPER: Is that really the fun?
 
COHEN: Well, no, it's part of it. Here --
 
COOPER: Thank you.
 
COHEN: We are going to have a toast. And this is our virtual celebration. Whether you are at home alone or with family or with one other person, we are all here together. This is an incredible community that we've built up together over these eight years. And so, I am excited. And you know what? I'm starting with a big one.
 
COOPER: Wow, this is very smelly.
 
COHEN: I know, I'm a little edgy right now.
 
COOPER: Are you? COHEN: Yea, I just want to --
 
COOPER: All right, thank you. All right, well, Happy New Year.
 
COHEN: Okay, Happy New Year, everybody. First toast of the night. Cheers.
 
COOPER: Hoo.
 <br>[20:05:10]
 
COHEN: By the way, you said you have a cough. I think I'm going to get it because I'm going to be drinking out of your glass all night.
 
COOPER: Wow, that hurt.
 
COHEN: Sorry about that, Anderson.
 
COOPER: Did you -- what -- Oh, Lord.
 
COHEN: You know what? It was a beautiful day. Oh no, before we get to that, our kids are watching, Anderson.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: My kids, I told them they could watch the first ten minutes only.
 
COOPER: I don't think -- I don't know if my kids are watching, but I hope they are.
 
COHEN: I hope they are because what I want to do. Sorry, to everyone else who's watching.
 
COOPER: Oh, you're not going to do like a wave.
 
COHEN: I want to wave. Hey, Ben and Lucy, Happy New Year.
 
COOPER: We've become these people. We've become the people we used to mock.
 
COHEN: Wave, hi, I love you.
 
COOPER: In life if any young people are watching at a certain point in life, you will become the people you used to make fun of. And that's what we've become.
 
COHEN: That's what we've become, anyway.
 
COOPER: I also just want to -- just take a moment before the whole program begins and before the rain begins, because it is supposed to rain.
 
COHEN: It was a beautiful day.
 
COOPER: It was a beautiful. COHEN: It's supposed to rain basically, from now --
 
COOPER: Wow, I'm really feeling that tequila. It's like its emanating, it's like a warming --
 
COHEN: Brought us down --
 
COOPER: It's like bringing up -- wow, that's what tequila does, I don't know. I'm not sure where this is going --
 
COHEN: Good, like it's just blood.
 
COOPER: But I just wanted to say thank you. And not just on behalf of me because not a lot of people know this about, Andy, but he is a big activist. And when he takes a stand on something, I mean, he really takes a stand.
 
Several years ago, Andy was on this stage pouring rain. We were not allowed to have umbrellas -- not allowed umbrellas because of the Times Square lines or whatever, there was a rule. It was a security rule, couldn't have umbrellas. I don't understand why. Maybe it was blocking people's view. We had transparent plastic umbrellas. I think we may have a clip. Andy went on a rant, no surprise, about the lack of umbrellas. Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN: It's more than drizzling in Times Square. It's not putting a damper on anything, but I will say this. I had this umbrella. The lady from the Times Square Alliance came over and said, you have to get rid of the umbrella.
 
COOPER: This has been going on for an-hour-and-a-half all already.
 
COHEN: Off the air and I said, I won't do it.
 
COOPER: He was like, what are you going to do, arrest me?
 
COHEN: Yes, I go get the paddy wagon if that's what it's going to take. Now, they are threatening to pull CNN's spot from the credential, you know, from Times Square --
 
COOPER: It's like --
 
COHEN: -- for next year. This is some grade A BS, honestly.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COOPER: Well, because Andy Cohen, like the activist that he is, he made a stand and he changed the law.
 
COHEN: I did.
 
COOPER: Umbrellas are now allowed on the riser. So if it pours with rain, we will be allowed to have umbrellas. So, I just want to say thank you. COHEN: You're welcome.
 
COOPER: I appreciate it.
 
COHEN: And you're welcome, and all of you are welcome. Telemundo over here --
 
COOPER: I was actually obligated -- Andy and his contract, he insisted I praise him for that.
 
COHEN: Yes, somehow Seacrest always got an umbrella, but we can never have an umbrella.
 
COOPER: I'm already scared. Oh, God. Don't start it.
 
COHEN: No, it's okay.
 
COOPER: Don't start it again.
 
COHEN: Everything is cool.
 
COOPER: Every time he starts it --
 
COHEN: For now, anyway, listen, I have to say, we we're talking about, Anderson and I were looking back on the year.
 
COOPER: I do want to do--
 
COHEN: My highlight of the year, besides all the stuff I did with my kids, which I'm not going to bore you with, was going to Sphere in Las Vegas to see Dead and Company. This is --
 
COOPER: Don't show, don't, don't.
 
COHEN: Oh, great, you have the video, that's what you're laughing at? Have you guys seen this?
 
COOPER: He went, I mean -- okay.
 
COHEN: Someone videoed me dancing in a concert video. Having the best time of my life --
 
COOPER: Look at this --
 
COHEN: I'm not going to look at it. I lived it, man.
 
COOPER: Oh my God, what are you --
 
COHEN: Have you ever had fun? You ever had fun? No, this is sad.
 
COOPER: No, it's not sad. You are 56 years old, that is sad.
 
COHEN: You put me on last year.
 
COOPER: That is just. I mean --
 
COHEN: What are you talking about?
 
COOPER: What are you even wearing? Are you wearing a circus tent?
 
COHEN: Don't worry about it. I'm wearing very cool pants.
 
COOPER: Where did you find that? Did you buy that in the parking lot outside?
 
COHEN: It look great, from Camp High, oh, Greg, okay.
 
COOPER: Well, actually, okay -- all right, well, I'm sorry.
 
COHEN: And the shirt was a gift from someone in the parking lot.
 
COOPER: But I mean, Sweetie, did you know you were being filmed?
 
COHEN: No, I didn't. I was at a concert, okay.
 
COOPER: Don't always assume --
 
COHEN: I was having a ball.
 
COOPER: Again, to the young people watching, just always assume you're being filmed. This, I mean, Sweetie--
 
COHEN: Wow, it's still playing.
 
COOPER: Are you, are those cargo?
 
COHEN: No, they're not cargo shorts.
 
COOPER: Wow, were you really doing this?
 
COHEN: Yes, I was feeling it. Have you ever had fun? Have you ever had fun?
 
COOPER: I don't understand.
 
COHEN: Yes, yes.
 
COOPER: I can't believe you did -- when I saw that online, I knew he was going to the show. He loves the show. It's so funny. I saw it online --
 
COHEN: I didn't -- you never mentioned it to me.
 
COOPER: I was so ashamed for you. And I can't believe you brought it up on TV as a good thing. I didn't know you were going to do that. That's why I'm so freaked out.
 
COHEN: You know what I'm excited about? To change the subject.
 <br>[20:10:14]
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Talking about fun, we were going to do something fun.
 
COOPER: We are.
 
COHEN: In 2025.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: We're going to take our kids together to Disney.
 
COOPER: Yes, yes, very excited.
 
COHEN: And I am so excited. We are so indoctrinated into the whole --
 
COOPER: I went to Disney for the first time. This is not like some Disney thing. I went to Disney when I was five years old. The first time I was away from my family. I went with Carter Burton --
 
COHEN: Did Mickey Mouse, take you on a private plane?
 
COOPER: No.
 
COHEN: Vanderbilt boy.
 
COOPER: No, no.
 
COHEN: What is this? 
 
COOPER: I was so invulnerable, every night, I had to call like, my dad and my nanny every night and talk to them. And I was inconsolable, yes, very relatable.
 
COHEN: Yes, your dad and your nanny. Do you know who the Big Five are?
 
COOPER: The Big Five?
 
COHEN: The Big Five?
 
COOPER: Like lions.
 
COHEN: No. What characters are the Big Five in Disney?
 
COOPER: Oh, well, Mickey.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Minnie.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Pluto.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Donald Duck.
 
COHEN: Yes. COOPER: And Grumpy.
 
COHEN: Goofy.
 
COOPER: I think Grumpy.
 
COHEN: Yes, you are grumpy. Grumpy.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Yes, although, you know what my daughter's favorite is Daisy Duck.
 
COOPER: Oh, I'm not familiar with Daisy.
 
COHEN: She's not in the Big Five, look, Daisy Duck is Donald's girl. She's not in the Big Five, very limited sizing of Daisy Duck merch.
 
COOPER: Oh, really?
 
COHEN: At the store, I was at the Disney store last week. I'm starting a petition to get Daisy Duck in the Big Five.
 
COOPER: I think, you know, again, with the activism. Thank you.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Thank you.
 
COHEN: This is my activism.
 
COOPER: It is time Dear Daisy Duck got her due.
 
COHEN: I use my platform, yes, I do, Anderson. You are so nasty about me dancing at a concert.
 
COOPER: I mean, I literally it is etched -- can we show it again? Can we just show it again?
 
COHEN: That is so -- no, no.
 
COOPER: Because it is so --
 
COHEN: No, no. I am going to take you to a Dead show and you're going to dance.
 
COOPER: No, I am not -- sorry.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Yes, I can't. Nothing against the Dead, but I just --
 
COHEN: Okay, you don't need to play it again. We are good, wea re good.
 
COOPER: So sad. COHEN: Oh my God.
 
COOPER: So sad.
 
COHEN: It is actually not sad. You're going to get really hazed online for your --
 
COOPER: Okay.
 
COHEN: This is -- by the way, this is what they call in 2024 a bad take.
 
COOPER: Oh.
 
COHEN: Yes. This is a bad take.
 
COOPER: Wow. You're trying to turn everybody down.
 
COHEN: Do your thing, Internet. Are you for the guy having fun at a concert privately?
 
COOPER: I felt the first drop of rain.
 
COHEN: I did, too. I know. Where is that umbrella?
 
Oh my gosh.
 
COOPER: Oh goodness.
 
COHEN: Anderson, did you have any fun this year?
 
COOPER: I did, I had a lot of fun.
 
COHEN: Yes, tell us.
 
COOPER: I got -- I hung out with -- I got to hang out with -- I got to meet Dua Lipa.
 
COHEN: Great.
 
COOPER: I did a piece on "60 Minutes" about her.
 
COHEN: For "60 Minutes."
 
COOPER: That was super fun.
 
COHEN: Okay.
 
COOPER: And I really want to go see her in concert.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: She's got a big world tour.
 
COHEN: Well, God forbid someone, you know, videos you having fun.
 
COOPER: Well, I would hope -- no, I would be. I would hope not.
 
COHEN: Right.
 
COOPER: Yes. I want to go see the Scissor Sisters with -- I want to go see with you.
 
COHEN: Yes. World tour.

COHEN: Yes. I saw Charli XCX.
 
COOPER: How was that?
 
COHEN: Unbelievable.
 
COOPER: Yes, I would like to see that. I would have liked to seen that as well.
 
COHEN: That was so good.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: All right.
 
COHEN: Anderson, it is going to be a long night.
 
COOPER: It's going to be a really long night.
 
COHEN: Should we go to break?

Joining us now, the queen of entertaining on the biggest night for entertaining and the funniest person, I know, Amy Sedaris.
 
SEDARIS: Oh. Hi. Happy New Year.
 
COOPER: Happy new year.
 
COHEN: She's also the sanest person in the room.
 
SEDARIS: Always. I am always the sanest in the room.
 
COHEN: Did you know that?
 
COOPER: I didn't know that.
 
COHEN: She is always the sanest person in the room?
 
SEDARIS: Yes.
 
COHEN: According to her, but I agree, I do agree.
 
SEDARIS: Thank you. You do agree.
 
COHEN: I do agree actually.

COOPER: We did a weather report early on.
 
SEDARIS: I should and now, it is raining.
 
COHEN: I know.
 
COOPER: Yes, I know.
 
SEDARIS: Yes.
 
COHEN: But not only that, you and I have spent so many New Year's together.
 
SEDARIS: We really have.
 
COHEN: This morning on my memories. It is so crazy. This picture came up of us in 2004. We were pretending -- COOPER: Wow.
 
COHEN: This is us on New Year's Eve. We're pretending to be a married couple fighting on New Year's Eve.
 
SEDARIS: We look like it.
 
COHEN: Yes we do.
 
SEDARIS: We look like a couple though, don't we.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: You guys look great.
 
SEDARIS: Yes, that's when you were straight.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
SEDARIS: Yes.
 
COHEN: I was. As a matter of fact, I made love to you all night that night.
 
SEDARIS: Bring a book. Bring a book to that book.
 
COHEN: Amy, where are you headed after you get done with this?
 
SEDARIS: I am going back to my apartment. And I have a few friends that are there waiting for me.
 
COOPER: Oh, nice.
 
COHEN: Anyone you want to shout out?
 
SEDARIS: Adam Selman. There are lots of people.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
SEDARIS: So that's going to be a fun thing to walk into my apartment. So it will be fun to enter.
 
COHEN: The party will already be going on.
 
SEDARIS: It'll already be going on.
 
COHEN: You will not have had to deal with what I think is the most annoying part of parties, which is the very beginning, waiting for them to kind of lift off. Is that right?
 
COOPER: Did you give out keys or they're already there?
 
SEDARIS: It is unlocked, baby.
 
COOPER: Oh.
 
SEDARIS: Unlocked.
 
COOPER: All right.
 
SEDARIS: Unlocked all night long.
 
COHEN: Oh, wow. Wow.
 
SEDARIS: That's right.
 
COHEN: Have things --
 
SEDARIS: But you know what? I am going to tell you something new -- two new things in my life.
 
COOPER: Go ahead.
 
COHEN: Yes, tell me.
 
SEDARIS: I got an air purifier for the first time.
 
COHEN: Okay.
 
SEDARIS: And I had a little rash on my finger. Gone.
 
COOPER: Wow. From the air purifier?
 
SEDARIS: It's changed my life.
 <br>[20:20:03]
 
COHEN: From the air purifier?
 
SEDARIS: Yes.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
COOPER: Wow.
 
SEDARIS: And then I got a minimizer bra for those ladies out there who are full chested. I got a minimizer. Look how -- I look as flat as a board.
 
COOPER: What?
 
COHEN: What?
 
SEDARIS: Its changed my life.
 
COHEN: Do you want to look flat as a lady?
 
SEDARIS: Yes. I'm too short to have --
 
COOPER: You know, that was the style in the 1920s, flat as a board.
 
COHEN: Really?
 
SEDARIS: Flat as a board.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
SEDARIS: Buxom. Flat as a board.
 
COHEN: Minimizer bra.
 
SEDARIS: Minimizer. Ladies, i highly recommend. It is fantastic.
 
COOPER: Wow.
 
COHEN: Speaking of brassieres, you spent a good chunk of this year listening to Barbra Streisand's audiobook.
 
SEDARIS: I did.
 
COHEN: How did you --
 
SEDARIS: It was gold.
 
COHEN: Wasn't it great?
 
SEDARIS: It was gold. I would probably do it again.
 
COOPER: How long did it take you?
 
SEDARIS: It took two weeks. But it was like having a roommate who doesn't stop talking. But I didn't want her to stop talking. And so, like you, you paced it, you know?
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
SEDARIS: Paced it out.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
SEDARIS: And that's what I did. And I used to imitate her when I was younger, I was obsessed. So it is just a different voice. It is just a little older and deeper. So I got to, you know -=-
 
COOPER: Can you do a little Barbra?
 
SEDARIS: Oh, it's just a little bit more like this you know, like a down. More like the walnuts in the brownies instead of the walnuts in the brownies. You know, it is just a little deeper. Obsessed. You gave me a poster. You and Sarah Jessica Parker.
 
COHEN: Oh, yes. We did.
 
SEDARIS: Yes.
 
COHEN: Amy, since you are always the sanest person in the room, we solicited for questions for you.
 
SEDARIS: Oh, okay.
 
COHEN: You are the queen of hospitality. I know some queen had to make this box. I will tell you that much.
 
SEDARIS: Some raving queen,
 
COHEN: I know, Nick.
 
SEDARIS: Nick.
 
COHEN: Anyway, okay, so we have a lot of questions for you.
 
SEDARIS: Okay. Okay.
 
COHEN: What fashion trend do you think should make a comeback in 2025?
 
SEDARIS: Oh, knee socks.
 
COHEN: Okay. What is your favorite cooking utensil and why?
 
SEDARIS: Tongs.
 
COHEN: Tongs?
 
SEDARIS: Because I didn't always use tongs until recently, and I am like, wow, these are really handy.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
SEDARIS: Yes. I have tongs a lot as gifts.
 
COOPER: How do you handle a friend who is always canceling plans on you? Because this is me.
 
SEDARIS: I cancel on them.
 
COOPER: Oh.
 
SEDARIS: Yes, Sorry. That's a good question.
 
COHEN: Sorry.
 
SEDARIS: Like tonight.
 
COHEN: I ran out of party poppers for my New Year's Eve party. What should I do to celebrate instead?
 
SEDARIS: Oh, poppers.
 
COHEN: No party poppers. Not like poppers.
 
SEDARIS: Well, my mind went right there. Can't you just bang on a pot?
 
COHEN: Yes. Bang on a pot.
 
SEDARIS: Bang a pot with a wooden spoon.
 
COOPER: Here is another one. My mother always says don't get her anything but then pouts when we listen to her and don't. What's the best gift for someone like that?
 
SEDARIS: Oh, when they don't want something?
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
SEDARIS: Give them -- if they say they don't want something, don't give them anything. That's just the rule.
 
COHEN: What's your favorite kind of gift to give someone you really don't know?
 
SEDARIS: Parmesan cheese. Because it is a good thing to regift.
 
COHEN: Right.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Oh, you can regift parmesan cheese.
 
SEDARIS: Sure. Everyone likes cheese.
 
COHEN: I am hosting a birthday party for 12 three-year-olds. What should I put in the goodie bag?
 
SEDARIS: Valium.
 
COOPER: I am single and still searching for the one. What green flags do you think I should be looking for as I date in the New Year?
 
SEDARIS: Oh, that's a good question. I would find out what hair products they use, especially for men.
 
COOPER: Ah.
 
SEDARIS: I've been hearing a lot about hair products for men, to make their hair grow.
 
COHEN: Really?
 
COOPER: Oh.
 
COHEN: What do you do if you're hosting a New Year's Eve party and you politely want to let everyone know it is time to leave.
 
SEDARIS: Time to go.
 
COOPER: What should -- at what point should I take down my Christmas Tree?
 
SEDARIS: It should already be down.
 
COHEN: Really?
 
COOPER: Really?
 
SEDARIS: Tomorrow. Tonight. COHEN: Right. Oh, really?
 
SEDARIS: Yes.
 
COHEN: It should be down.
 
SEDARIS: Tomorrow. A lot of people leave it up. That's just my personal.
 
COOPER: Wow.
 
COHEN: Are you enjoying the rain?
 
SEDARIS: No.
 
COHEN: Who made your dress?
 
SEDARIS: Molly Goddard made my dress.
 
COHEN: Oh, my God. It is so pretty.
 
SEDARIS: It is so pretty, right?
 
COHEN: Who made your hair?
 
SEDARIS: Jamison Eaton did my hair.
 
COHEN: I love it.
 
SEDARIS: And even did my makeup. Yes, it was fun getting ready.
 
COHEN: I don't want to mess it up.
 
SEDARIS: It is always fun getting ready to come here.
 
COHEN: It is.
 
SEDARIS: It always is.
 
COOPER: Yes, well we love having you.
 
COHEN: What's more fun? Coming or going?
 
SEDARIS: Going.
 
COOPER: By the way, Amy and her brother David are going to be in my podcast next week.
 
SEDARIS: That's right. I will --
 
COHEN: That's right.
 
COOPER: Tuesday night.
 
SEDARIS: I want like you to just trash it.
 
COOPER: Oh my gosh. No, it is so good.
 
SEDARIS: Oh, really?
 
COOPER: It's so good.
 
SEDARIS: Oh, I've laughed so hard. We thought you said weepy, not grieving.
 
COHEN: Coming up, the one and only Jon Hamm joins us.
 
SEDARIS: Wow.
 
COHEN: Later, music from Sting, Meghan Trainor and more as we count down to the New Year. It is raining.

We will be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[20:27:45]
 
COOPER: We are back in the glamorous Times Square.
 
COHEN: Yes, it is raining.
 
COOPER: It is raining.
 
COHEN: They are trying to torture us it seems. And you know what? Bring it on, everybody.
 
COOPER: Bring it on. Bring it.
 
COHEN: You know what? 2024 was such a year.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Bring it on. This is all you've got?
 
COOPER: This is nothing. This is nothing compared to what we've been through.
 
COHEN: This is nothing.
 
You know who is such a stud?
 
COOPER: Jon Hamm? COHEN: Yes. Our next guest and Jon Hamm is here, joining us from the NHL Winter Classic at Wrigley Field. Hey, Hamm.
 
COOPER: Hey, Jon Hamm.
 
JON HAMM, ACTOR: Yes, sir.
 
COOPER: Andy has got his jersey on, too.
 
HAMM: I'll see you your reign and raise you 32 degrees. It is freezing cold here, but it is beautiful. Happy New Year, almost.
 
COHEN: How nice. Well, our hometown team, the St. Louis Blues just wrapped up the winter classic against the Chicago Blackhawks. How did it go, man? How did the Blues do?
 
HAMM: Six-two. We won. We scored early and often, and we thoroughly dominated. It was excellent.
 
COHEN: Hey, Hamm, have you been drinking Busch beer all night?
 
HAMM: Not Busch beer. Anheuser-Busch products for sure. A little Michelob Ultra mixed in for sure. Got to watch the calories.
 
COHEN: Nice.
 
HAMM: Come on.
 
COOPER: All right. Did you guys know each other growing up in St. Louis?
 
COHEN: We did not know each other growing up in St. Louis but we've come together --
 
HAMM: Absolutely not.
 
COHEN: -- over the last few years. People from St. Louis love to bond about St. Louis. Sweetie, you're like dripping right on my --
 
HAMM: We definitely found each other for sure.
 
COHEN: Yes, for sure. Can you explain St. Louis pizza to the people at home, Hamm.
 
COOPER: Is there such a thing?
 
HAMM: Yes. Imagine a cracker covered in plastic, microwaved and injected into your bloodstream. It's sort of like that.
 
COOPER: Wow.
 
HAMM: But it is somehow delicious.
 
COHEN: And very addictive. That is a very good description --
 
HAMM: And very addictive, indeed. COHEN: You know, Hamm, I've got to tell you something. I was looking at your year, and I was looking at everything you are in. You are the male Nicole Kidman right now. You're in everything, "Landsman," "Fargo," "The Morning Show."
 
You're a voice on "Grimsburg." You have a new Apple TV+ show. "Your Friends and Neighbors." Do you feel as an actor you should share a little bit more?
 <br>[20:30:10]
 
HAMM: Listen, I'm achieving peak Kidman (ph). I think you called it. I love it. It's all I can do. I love working. I get to work on great stuff. And, yes, why not me? I vote -- I vote yes, more me.
 
COOPER: Why not? I agree.
 
COHEN: Yes. Why Jon Hamm.
 
COOPER: I want more Jon Hamm. I want more Jon Hamm.
 
COHEN: You know how CNN puts headlines on the top -- 
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: -- of the thing? It's going to say, Jon Hamm, why not me? I love it.
 
You know, Jon -- 
 
COOPER: I'll take it.
 
COHEN: -- since we've talked sports, We got to talk Bravo. What -- what's your takeaway on the current season of the "Beverly Hills Housewives?"
 
COOPER: Jon -- is Jon Hamm a fan?
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: Really?
 
HAMM: OK. OK. I have some thoughts. I have some thoughts. Dorit is not doing it for me these days. I'm having some issues with her -- with her mentality and her issues. I'm -- I also -- I've also -- I got to pour one out for Craig and Paige. My goodness. End of an era. Geez. Who the -- 
 
COHEN: Very sad. You know that Craig and Paige announced that they're splitting up?
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
COOPER: I love watching what you guys do.
 
COHEN: Thanks, man. You know, Hamm, next year is the 10th anniversary of the "Mad Men" finale.
 
COOPER: Wow. Is it really? That's incredible.
 
COHEN: Isn't that incredible? When you look back at the show's legacy, what does it mean to you how lasting that show continues to be?
 
HAMM: Well, it's obviously, it's the -- it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my career. And it's something that I consider a tremendous feather in my cap. But I guess what I really am impressed with is that now new generations are kind of discovering the show, and especially when you're in a town like Chicago, which has a huge advertising fan base, just like 30-year-olds come up to me and are like, oh, my God, I love -- I love that show.
 
I was like, you were 10 when it came out. What are you talking about? But it's -- but it's impressive. And it's obviously something I'm tremendously proud of.
 
COOPER: I -- you also made a cameo Jerry Seinfeld's "Unfrosted" film's, Don Draper alongside John Slattery, who by the way, every time I see him and run into him, we always immediately go and say hello to each other because we vaguely look alike.
 
COHEN: You do.
 
COOPER: And people are always sort of like squinting at me -- 
 
HAMM: Yes.
 
COOPER: -- wondering like, is that John Slattery?
 
COHEN: Right.
 
COOPER: And I'm like, no, I'm probably much older than John Slattery is. I wish I was John Slattery.
 
HAMM: The silver foxes find each other, absolutely.
 
COOPER: Yes, exactly.
 
HAMM: And Andy and I, by the way, will be joining you in that club very soon.
 
COOPER: Well, don't rush it. I regret. And I wish -- 
 
COHEN: I'm not that far.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Did doing that part -- did being Don Draper in that Pop-Tart movie make you feel like, we should do this again?
 
HAMM: No. And a short -- and a short answer, no. But it was -- it was tremendously fun. I had a blast. Like we had such a good time. Jerry was such a good sport to invite us all on to do that. And it was -- it was very cool.
 
COHEN: Hamm, what are you doing tonight? It's like 7.30 in Chicago. I have to assume your night is going to take you to all over town.
 
HAMM: We're heading out to dinner. We're going to -- my wife and her sister and her best friend are in town. We're going to go out to dinner. We're going to have a great night in Chicago, ringing the New Year. And we'll see. We'll see where the night takes us.
 
Chicago's -- you have to have a -- you have to really try hard to have a bad time in Chicago. So we're going to have a great one.
 
COOPER: I got to say, I've spent a little bit of time in Chicago the last couple of months just on stories. It is such a great city.
 
COHEN: I love it.
 
COOPER: I wish I lived in Chicago.
 
COHEN: As a St. Louisianan.
 
HAMM: It's a beautiful architecture, food, entertainment, all of that.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
HAMM: It's a fantastic city.
 
COOPER: Everything.
 
COHEN: It's like a Midwestern New York.
 
COOPER: Yes, it's awesome. Do you have a New Year's resolution? Do you do that? Are yours as boring as everybody else's?
 
HAMM: Oh, God. No. I don't -- you know what? I gave up on those. I just resolved to be a good person and try to keep that going and do what I can. Good Lord.
 
COOPER: I like that.
 
COHEN: By the way, Ham, did you have a -- 
 
HAMM: The thought (INAUDIBLE) working on me at this point and it ain't getting fixed.
 
COHEN: Did you have a favorite binge this year of a show that you weren't in besides anything on Bravo?
 
HAMM: Ooh. That's a good question. I feel like the Menendez was the binge that we really binged hard. We went in -- we went in hard.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
HAMM: We went in deep. And this is already getting dirty.
 
COHEN: Yes. Did you -- you know -- COOPER: Wow.
 
COHEN: I got to tell you -- by the way, will there be a second season of "Landman?"
 
HAMM: I'm hoping. Stay tuned.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
HAMM: That's all I can say.
 
COHEN: All right.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: All right.
 <br>[20:35:01]
 
COOPER: Have you ever been in Times Square on New Year's Eve?
 
HAMM: I've never been in Times Square on New Year's Eve. But I'm taking that as an invitation for next year.
 
COHEN: Yes, it is.
 
COOPER: Yes, absolutely. Hundred percent.
 
COHEN: Yes, it is. We have shots waiting for you, Hamm.
 
HAMM: If I don't know my way around a good segue, then.
 
COHEN: There you go. Hey, Hamm, maybe this is the year you and I will open a bar in St. Louis together.
 
COOPER: How come -- how come you get to call him Hamm?
 
COHEN: Well, you can call him Hamm too.
 
COOPER: Well, I don't -- I -- no.
 
COHEN: Should we open a bar in St. Louis?
 
HAMM: Of course, he can.
 
COOPER: OK. St. Louis then.
 
HAMM: Let's do it. We'll invite Cooper.
 
COHEN: Ooh. All right. Jon Hamm, thank you very much. Have fun in Chicago. Tell Anna hi. 
 
HAMM: Love you guys. Happy New Year.
 
COHEN: Have a great night.
 
COOPER: Happy New Year, Jon.
 
COHEN: See you soon.
 
COOPER: Thanks so much for doing this. Really appreciate it.
 
Coming up, next week. See you. Bye. Coming up, Ralph Fiennes.

COOPER: I'm so out of it.
 
COHEN: Contributed New Year's resolutions. Did you not know who -- 
 
COOPER: Not a lot. Yes.
 
COHEN: You know who Julianne Moore is.
 
COOPER: Of course.
 
COHEN: Or the cute guy from the Menendez show. I don't know who he is.
 
COOPER: I was unfamiliar with him.
 
COHEN: What?
 
COOPER: I was unfamiliar
 
COHEN: Well.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: We'll talk.
 
And the rain is really coming down.
 
COOPER: Yes, yes, yes. So -- 
 
COHEN: Yes. I mean, no joke.
 
So is this the hardest it's going to fall or it's going to get -- COOPER: Do you know you're not supposed to talk about things like that
 
 because obviously it's only encouraging the weather gods to make it worse?
 
COHEN: The weather gods?
 
COOPER: Yes. It's like a -- 
 
COHEN: Do you believe that?
 
COOPER: Not really.
 
COHEN: Oh.
 
COOPER: Sorry. So they -- we're going to do a segment on talking about the year in pop culture. 
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: I really know nothing about the year in pop culture.
 
COHEN: Yes. Anderson watched nothing.
 
COOPER: I watched one thing.
 
COHEN: Well, tell us about it.
 
COOPER: Which is -- 
 
COHEN: Share what you watched.
 
COOPER: "Love Has Won." It's on Max. It is the greatest documentary. It's three parts. It's about this cult called "Love Has Won."
 
COHEN: Mother love.
 
COOPER: Mother -- no, no, Mother God.
 
COHEN: Mother God.
 
COOPER: She's looking for Father God. And she finds several of them.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: And the last one is a doozy.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: It is -- I mean, it's a -- I'm giving you a gift, telling you about it to watch it if you haven't seen it. It's three parts. They live-streamed everything. Oh, so good.
 
COHEN: Oh, yes, they did.
 
COOPER: Oh, my God.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: If you don't know what colloidal silver is, you will.
 
COHEN: Oh, yes.
 
COOPER: Yes. Not a good idea.
 
COHEN: And, you know, spoiler alert, it does not cure all colloidal silver. I love it that you remembered colloidal silver.
 
COOPER: Who could forget?
 
COHEN: Wow. Well, I forget.
 
COOPER: I actually knew a lot about it beforehand.
 
COHEN: You did? Why?
 
COOPER: I'm obsessed with that kind of thing.
 
COHEN: What?
 
COOPER: It's like Guinea-worm disease. I know about this.
 
COHEN: Guinea-worm disease?
 
COOPER: Yes. Jimmy Carter eradicated Guinea-worm disease. I was obsessed with Guinea-worm disease since like 1985. When I was a kid.
 
COHEN: Wow. Tell the people -- tell the people what you told me about Jimmy Carter. I'm sure everybody knows.
 
COOPER: Oh. Just that -- to me, the most amazing fact I learned about Jimmy Carter, his mom delivered his wife. His mom delivered Rosalynn Carter when she was born. Jimmy Carter was 3, toddled over to the house next door to their house, peered over the crib, saw Rosalynn Carter, his future wife. How crazy is that? Amazing. They're together 77 years. Incredible.
 
COHEN: I have to shout out going -- that is incredible, by the way.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Going back to those New Year's resolutions, I love it that Casey Wilson said her goal is to get work done to her face. That was -- that was -- that was a great resolution.
 
COOPER: What -- so you talk about -- you've had -- like every day you live the pop culture lifestyle?
 
COHEN: Yes. Yes.
 
COOPER: So what was your -- what were your top pop culture moments this year?
 
COHEN: Well, I mean, Amy brought up -- you know, the Barbara book, which I talked about, I think, here last year.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: It took me into March of this year because it was a 48-hour audiobook. So I really enjoyed it. And then I ended the year.
 
COOPER: You and I have both done audio. Like, how long do you think it took her to record 48 hours?
 
COHEN: So long. And I do not care for recording an audio book. Do you?
 
COOPER: I don't mind it. It's like a two -- I can do it in like a two day -- two and a half day. 
 
COHEN: Anyway. I love that. And then I ended the book with the Cher book, which I read.
 
COOPER: Oh, I haven't read that. No, I really want to read that.
 
COHEN: It is so good. And it's part one of her memoir. She's going to come out with part two -- 
 
COOPER: Right.
 
COHEN: -- either next year or the year after.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: It ends with like her and Gene Simmons, I think.
 
COOPER: OK.
 
COHEN: So you go through the sunny years. It is great. And talk about a childhood that I'm stunned that she kind of survived and thrived, and it's no wonder she turned into the amazing person that she is.
 
COOPER: My mom -- you know, my mom used to say that Cher was her fantasy daughter. So as a kid growing up, I was like, is Cher my sister?
 
By the way, this is the difference between us. Andy just finished the Cher book. I just finished Bill Gates, the first part of his three- part memoir.
 
COHEN: Oh, wow. OK.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: And how was that?
 
COOPER: I very much enjoyed it.
 
COHEN: Wow.
 
COOPER: Fascinating.
 
COHEN: I also read a great novel called "The Bee Sting," which is great.
 
COOPER: Who are you?
 
COHEN: I highly recommend it. If you like sweeping narrative fiction about one family. So good. The Bee Sting.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: My favorite thing that I saw on Broadway this year was "Sunset Boulevard."
 <br>[20:45:02]
 
COOPER: I heard that's great. I've heard it's great.
 
COHEN: Unbelievable.
 
COOPER: I've seen that -- I saw a cabaret and I saw "The Eyes of Tammy Faye."
 
COHEN: Yes. We saw that together. Absolutely.
 
COOPER: I have not yet.
 
COHEN: The movie that I loved --well, I loved two movies this year. One was "Conclave."
 
COOPER: Do you go to the theater for free? Do people give you tickets?
 
COHEN: No. What?
 
COOPER: I don't know.
 
COHEN: No.
 
COOPER: I don't know.
 
COHEN: "Conclave" is absolutely incredible. You saw it.
 
COOPER: I love "Conclave." Yes.
 
COHEN: Ralph Fiennes -- 
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: -- is going to be joining us.
 
COOPER: Yes, yes, yes.
 
COHEN: -- in a bit.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: It's -- 
 
COOPER: And like, it looks like they shot it in the Vatican. I mean, they can't -- 
 
COHEN: They did not.
 
COOPER: Right, but it looked -- 
 
COHEN: We'll talk to him about that.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: It's incredible.
 
COOPER: I'm sure we have more movies.
 
COHEN: It is about the -- not the coronation of a pope, but the choosing of a pope.
 
COOPER: Oh, sweetie. Oh, sweetie. Don't even try.
 
COHEN: OK. Don't try to say what the movie's about?
 
COOPER: The "Conclave" that's what it's about.
 
COHEN: Oh, right.
 
COOPER: It's about this thing, it's like a con, it's like a corona -- cor -- con. It's called conclave. 
 
COHEN: OK.
 
COOPER: Yes.
 
COHEN: Take my wet card. I don't know what to do with it.
 
"Wicked." Did you see "Wicked"?
 
COOPER: I've never seen "Wicked."
 
COHEN: Oh.
 
COOPER: Never seen the play, the movie. I don't know. I've never seen anything about it. 
 
COHEN: Unbelievable. Old Hollywood to the max.
 
COOPER: Really?
 
COHEN: The music, the acting.
 
COOPER: Would my kids like it?
 
COHEN: I think it's too -- 
 
COOPER: Is it too scary?
 
COHEN: -- slow for our kids. No, it's not scary at all.
 
COOPER: Oh, OK. No. I -- you know, I have a slow policy with -- so my kids only watch old Disney films.
 
COHEN: I know. I know.
 
COOPER: Like seven -- 1960s. I like slow editing.
 
COHEN: Yes.
 
COOPER: I don't want them to get used to like -- 
 
COHEN: But you are very smart, which is why we've been -- I mean the Netflix kids shows, no offense, to our friends. They're very fast.
 
COOPER: I haven't seen them.
 
COHEN: I like slow.
 
COOPER: I don't know.
 
COHEN: They -- my -- you know what, Apple TV has the whole suite of new Peanut stuff. And it's -- 
 
COOPER: We want this to be interesting for everybody.
 
COHEN: OK. Well, you -- 
 
COOPER: Yes.

My head, my heart was immersed in this business.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: His life had some extremely joyful moments.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Four albums and all of them platinum.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And some really difficult moments.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He would say, God has given me everything I ask for, except one person who loves me.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I keep getting the feeling that the best part of my career is still ahead of me.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we were to be able to talk to Luther, as fans, we would have said --
