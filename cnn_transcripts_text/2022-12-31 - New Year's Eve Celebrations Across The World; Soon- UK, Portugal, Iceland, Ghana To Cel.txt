UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our Queen. It's just all over the world. The Queen is such a huge figure everywhere, not just the UK, but all across the world. So it was lovely to see people flock from all over the world come in memorial with that.
 
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: The longest serving monarch in history. Guys, it is a pleasure to share this evening with you. We have minutes to go until the fireworks, so enjoy it. Happy New Year. And we will be right back after this quick break. Stay with us. New Year is coming. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our New Year's Eve Live special. I'm Lynda Kinkade and we are counting down to midnight in London, Ireland, Iceland, Portugal, Ghana and much of West Africa. It's great to have you with us. I want to go straight now to our Christina Macfarlane who is ready to see in the fireworks at the London Eye. We are just minutes away. Happy New Year, Chrissy. 
 
MACFARLANE: Happy New Year, Lynda. We are what, less than two minutes here. It is the first time these fireworks are back in London since the start of the Copa Pandemic. I can tell you there is an enormous sea of people in front of me, cheering, shouting, some of them waving banners. To the left of me I can see the tower of big bands looming over us, waiting until the midnight hour win (ph) all time 12 times.
 
And then behind me we're going to see a fireworks display like none other. I think 12 minutes of 12,000 fireworks due to go off around the London Eye. As I look down the Thames here, I can see a flatilla of boats. I think there's roughly about 2,000 people here on the Thames with a perfect view of the London Eye. And we are in the final minute now. Lynda, do I have watched these fireworks since I was a little girl and I have never had the privilege of being this close. 
 
It is quite an emotional moment, I have to say, for me. We know that there's going to be a musical backdrop that has been carefully orchestrated for this moment. It's been four months to build the scene that we're about to see play out just here behind me, and I can see some drones flying above the London Eye right now as well. It is a year where we will remember, I think chiefly our queen who passed away in 2022 and the royals.
 <br>[19:00:10]
 
That is one thing I think many people have been talking to me about here tonight as we count down, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy New Year to everyone on the river and around the world. We welcome you with an offer (ph) from around the world.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II, FORMER QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.
 <br>[19:05:15]
 
Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Farewell, Ma'am. And thank you for everything.
 
CHARLES III, KING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: As stewards of this precious planet, it is our actions and our actions alone that will determine this future.
 <br>[19:14:18]
 
MACFARLANE: Well, I may be biased, but I think that was one of the best New Year's Eve displays of fireworks. We are going to see around the globe this year. Yes, I was standing right in the shadow of the London Eye when it happened 12,000 fireworks exploding right over my head.
 
But we also saw, for the first time in history, a drone display as part of this New Year's festivities at the Horse Guards Parade. And how emotional was it to see a tribute to our late Queen Elizabeth II? And of course, hear the voice of King Charles as well. A truly special and personally very emotional experience for me to be witnessing this live here on CNN with you tonight.
 <br>[19:15:04]
 
So stay with us. We will be back with much more on our CNN live around the world after this quick break. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PAUL OKOYE, RECORDING ARTIST, "P-SQUARE": I would love to see good stuff happening in my country, Nigeria. I just want a good living state. Nigeria a good country. A country whereby is not about tribe, it's not about religion, it's not about where you from. I prefer to be a Nigeria whereby I can walk on my shoulder up. I be proud of Nigeria.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lynda and Christina, cheers and best wishes from all of us on the national tour of Les Miserables. We are honored to celebrate with you and all of your viewers as we bring in the New Year together. Happy 24601. 
 
CROWD: Happy 2023.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back to London where the New Year has just come to the United Kingdom and right on queue, so has the rain. Would you believe it, just moments ago, the fireworks were filling the sky around the London Eye behind me here, and were stinging and celebrating with it just before the rain came. Thousands are on hand here.
 
I can see about, I don't know, we're reckoning 80,000 or 90,000 people here down the banks of the Thames ringing in the New Year's celebrations. My goodness, it was something we haven't seen before, I can say that much. An army of drones also accompanied the fireworks this year, wishing the crowd a very happy New Year.
 
And with it, we heard the voice of our late Queen Elizabeth II ringing out over the airwaves here, as was the voice of King Charles. We also heard Ukraine mentioned during these fireworks celebrations. We heard the song Stefania by the band Kalush Orchestra. We knew Ukraine was going to be recognized as part of tonight's festivities. And it was pretty special to hear Stefania ringing out here live tonight on New Year's Eve.
 
But let's now go to our Lynda Kinkade in Atlanta with a look and the further celebrations to come in the hours ahead. Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Christina, as you say, it's going to be hard top the celebrations there in London. Thanks so much to you. Well, the New Year is now heading to the Americas. In less than 3 hours, the clock strikes midnight in Argentina, Chile and parts of Brazil. The celebrations will undoubtedly be big in Rio, a place known for partying.
 
Stefano Pozzebon is soaking up the atmosphere further south in the Brazilian city of Santos. Well, our friends, like you, Stefano, in Latin America, know how to party. Where is the best place to be this year? 
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Well, the best place is definitely Lynda, South America. I mean, you guys are feeling the cold up there in the Northern Hemisphere. Right now I'm talking to you from a beach wearing flipflops in the sand. It's definitely a different atmosphere and an atmosphere that is pure party and pure cheerful.
 
But it's also an atmosphere of great traditions here in South America, all across the continent, because people here take New Year very, very seriously with plenty of issues be taken.
 <br>[19:20:10]
 
One of them, for example, is about dolls from Colombia. I took one mine with me. To learn about these dolls, check this out what we take, we prepare for you, Lynda. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
POZZEBON (voiceover): In with the new, out with the old. People in Latin America have some unique traditions to ring in the New Year. In Brazil, when the clock strikes 12, many people celebrate at the beach by watching fireworks and jumping over seven waves while making seven wishes.
 
In Colombia, people burn dolls made of cardboard, sodas and cloth that symbolize the old year. It's a way of letting go of the negativity of the past and making a fresh start.
 
A dowsing of water or cider or tea is also symbolic of renewal in Uruguay. So a splash from above by people throwing water out of their windows on New Year's Eve, it's actually considered a blessing.
 
And if you're up at midnight, many countries follow the Spanish tradition of eating 12th grapes, one for each month of the new year to ensure good luck and good health. Yet another way to secure some good fortune is to wear yellow underwear. 
 
So stores around Latin America will stock up on the skippies this time of the year. But many places agree that there is one thing you shouldn't wear that's black on New Year's Eve, as it will supposedly bring you bad luck in the New Year. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
POZZEBON: So, Lynda, I'm in Brazil, but you know, I live in Colombia. Here's my goal. You can bet in a few hours I'll set it on fire and hope for the best for 2023. 
 
KINKADE: Well, wishing you all the best, you and your family. Stefano Pozzebon, Happy New Year. Thanks so much. We'll chat again very soon.
 
Well, the lights are bright once more on Broadway. After the COVID pandemic forced the longest shutdown in history, there's now a full roster of shows on tap for theater loving fans. I spoke to the creative team behind the Neil Diamond musical a Beautiful Noise, one of the hottest new shows in town. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE (voiceover): The life of one of the best-selling artists of all time. Now set on stage. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 39 albums.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 40 top 40 hits. The 120 million albums sold. 
 
KINKADE: Neil Diamond was a kid from Brooklyn, New York, who had planned to enter medical school and steady entered the Music Hall of Fame. Tony nominee Will Swenson stars as the younger Neil Diamond. 
 
WILL SWENSON, TONY AWARDS NOMINEE: I think the secret to doing this show is lots of sleep and lots of caffeine maybe.
 
KINKADE: Another Tony nominee, Mark Jacoby plays Diamond now.
 
MARK JACOBY, ACTOR: I'm still counting. 
 
KINKADE (on camera): So you play title roles in The Phantom of the Opera. The judge in Sweeney Todd, the Wizard in Wicked. What was it like when you heard that you had the role of Neil Diamond? 
 
JACOBY: A bit overwhelming, frankly, because it's not just playing Neil Diamond the show is about Neil Diamond. It's his life. And in the case of our rehearsals here in New York, in front of that person, seven, eight feet away, but it's so hard not to be thinking about what does he think and how is he reacting to this? Does he hate me or does he love me? Or something in between?
 
KINKADE (voiceover): Neil Diamond toured for nearly 50 years. But in 2018, he was forced to stop after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In a note in the Playbill, he says, my heart and soul would tour until the day I die if only my body would cooperate. 
 
KINKADE (on camera): What input did Neil have in the show? Because I understand you went to his house with a draft of this musical. 
 
ANTHONY MCCARTEN, WRITER: Yes, I was kind of misled. They said, just deliver it. When I got there, they invited me in and seated me down at this table and said, can you perform the entire musical for me? What? Here we go. At one, lights up and do the whole thing. It was kind of terrifying. But at the end he said, Get your producer on the telephone. So we called the producer and he spoke to the phone. Three words I'm a believer. 
 
KINKADE (voiceover): I'm a believer. Words from the hit song Neil Diamond wrote for The Monkees a clear endorsement. New Zealander Anthony McCarten, four time Academy award nominee is the show's writer. He's also the screenwriter behind the Winston Churchill drama "The Darkest Hour" and the Queen biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody."
 
KINKADE (on camera): People go for the music, but they want a good story, right? 
 
MCCARTEN: Absolutely do, not only want a good story, they want to hear something they've never heard before. 
 <br>[19:25:00]
 
KINKADE (voiceover): Four-time Tony nominee Steven Hoggett did the choreography. 
 
STEVEN HOGGETT, FOUR-TIME TONY NOMINEE: With a show like this, creating big, high energy, watch star moments is in the music. 
 
KINKADE: Broadway was battered by COVID.
 
KINKADE (on camera): For 18 months Broadway shutdown went dark. What impact did that have on you and other performers? 
 
JACOBY: There was nothing, literally nothing in the way of live theater. So it was devastating. You know, I know so many people who left the business and without any intention of coming back. 
 
KINKADE (voiceover): The longest running show ever, the Phantom of the Opera, is set to close in April, 35 years after opening on Broadway because it was struggling to sell enough tickets to offset costs, attendance in January was the lowest it had been since 2003. Now the Broadway league says capacity is closer to 90 percent and shows like Tina are once more touring.
 
KINKADE (on camera): Here on Broadway, theater goes is starting to return in large numbers after the longest shutdown in history. And things never seemed so good. 
 
So you're a local New Yorker.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am a local New Yorker.
 
KINKADE: What's it like having Broadway back close to full capacity?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's amazing. It was a really dark two years. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sweet Caroline. Bump, bump, bump.
 
KINKADE (voiceover): Remarkably, when the curtains rose on opening night, Neil Diamond willed his body to perform once more. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy New Year. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Happy New Year to everyone in Times Square. And a toast now to our friends and colleagues at Warner Bros. 2023 officially marks their 100th birthday and what a milestone and a celebration of quality film and television.

CHRISTINE MACFARLANE, CNN ANCHOR: 2023 has arrived here in the UK and true to form, so has the rain right on time. The banks of the River Thames were lit up with fireworks just a few minutes ago. I was standing underneath this display and I can tell you it was extraordinary. It paid tribute for 12 minutes to our late Queen, King Charles, the war in Ukraine, the people of Ukraine, and, of course, to 50 years of pride here in London. Something we celebrated this summer. 12,000 fireworks just above my head here.
 
But, you know, we're not the only ones. Portugal has just brought in their New Year. Here's a look at the fireworks on the island of Madeira. One of the biggest New Year's Eve parties in the world, of course, is taking place in New York City.
 
I want to bring in CNN's Richard Quest, who is back with us now. I tell you, Richard, New York is going to have to come up with something pretty special top what I just saw here in London. 
 
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Please, this is Times Square. This is New York Central. This is where it happens since we last spoke. Take a look up there. You can see the ball. Well, it's sort of flashing now. It has now gone up to the top of the pole so that at 1 minute to midnight, it can start its journey down the pole and then will ring in the New Year. Typical, it is absolutely pissing (ph) it down. Here in New York. It is raining, but that has not stopped. Rahel. 
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: No. Hi. 
 
QUEST: Welcome. 
 
SOLOMON: Happy New Year. 
 
QUEST: No, not yet. Rahel Solomon is with me here in. Now, is this your first time? 
 
SOLOMON: It is not so. So I have been a spectator once before a few years ago when I was in college. All I remember, Richard, is how cold it was. I was wearing a dress because again, I was in college. So young and dumb. Anyway, I promised and bowed I would never come back here again. And yet here I am, because I cannot miss a good party. So here I am. 
 
QUEST: You said you wouldn't do it --
 
SOLOMON: No.
 
QUEST: -- and you're doing it. You know, that's the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing. expecting a different result. 
 
SOLOMON: I really like a good party. Where is the best party in the world? It is right here tonight. So here I am to enjoy and partake. 
 
QUEST: All right, let's meet some people over here. Now, you are from --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: India. Bangalore. 
 
QUEST: Bangalore. Where it's about 20 degrees warmer and not as raining. Madam, much as beautifully attired, you're not very appropriately attired. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know it's really cold in here, and it's raining really bad. I just hope it gets warmer and stops raining.
 
SOLOMON: It's a once in a lifetime trip, Richard, you know, I mean --
 
QUEST: I've done it 20 odd times. You've done it twice.
 
SOLOMON: Once in most people's lifetime. Also, we have some friends from Morocco. 
 
QUEST: Hello.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello.
 
QUEST: Welcome. 
 
SOLOMON: Tell us about yourself.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, I wasn't born in Morocco, but my whole family was. I'm the first one that was born in America.
 
SOLOMON: Congratulations to the team --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. I'm from France. 
 
SOLOMON: -- in the World Cup.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.
 
QUEST: Where you from?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm from France.
 
QUEST: It's already been New Year. What time did you get here?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 2:00.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 2:00.
 
QUEST: 2:00 are late comers. Late comers. Move to this side overall. 
 <br>[19:35:00]
 
SOLOMON: All right. We have some friends from Guatemala. We have some friends from Brazil. We've been making friends all night even in the rain. We have a friend from the US. Where are you from again? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm from Kansas City. 
 
QUEST: Kansas City, Missouri. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Missouri. Go Chiefs.
 
QUEST: It's my whole knock card is based I only know that because I've been there a couple of times over the years. You're not dressed very appropriately. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm dressed warm --
 
QUEST: Richard, that's not very nice because we met this guy here because he was complimenting your attire. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, you're a tire of looking very dapper in the shoes. 
 
QUEST: OK. Yes. But unfortunately, the shoes fell apart and are now being held together by Daffer tape. But you're looking rather splendid. 
 
SOLOMON: Well, I don't know about that. It's one of the trade secrets, right? It's all about what you look like from the waist up. And then what we're wearing on the bottom, no one really sees. So no one would normally see those boots. 
 
QUEST: Well, happy to you. Whose cell phone is running out of power. Now you see, they've all planned. 
 
SOLOMON: Everybody still feeling good? Yes?
 
QUEST: All right. Give us a Happy New Year, well, give us a cheer. I promise you, it does get louder. It does get more excited. 
 
SOLOMON: You see better than this? 
 
QUEST: Oh, yes. We haven't even big guns. Christina. 
 
MACFARLANE: Happy New Year, Richard to you and to Rahel, really love what you're doing with that bubble hat. Really sets off the outfit here tonight for New Year's Eve. Thank you both very much.
 
And now we are moving on to another superstar, a special performance from internationally acclaimed artist Ellie Goulding. She's singing her new track for CNN, Let It Die from the album Higher Than Heaven. 
 
Perform specially for CNN. That's Ellie Goulding's new song, Let It Die. The album releases on February 3rd, and we will have a lot more coverage of New Year's Eve just ahead, including this New Year's classic.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy New Year.
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: An incredible sight here in Hong Kong. This is the first time I've seen fireworks over the Hong Kong harbor in almost three years. Wow, this really feels like a new beginning. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy New Year.
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Taiwan's reopening for the world after three years of pandemic. This is a democracy that is ready to showcase a positive message of peace on earth. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world with over 160 floors, with certainly one of the most saved. It's always ready to ring in the New Year. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like one of the kids here enjoying a ride on a camel, getting some ice cream, and Swahili food, as they all anticipate that moment at midnight when East Africa, Mombasa in this region celebrates 2023, the beginning of a new year. Happy New Year from Mombasa, Kenya. That's spectacular. 
 <br>[19:45:05]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are hugging, shouting Happy New Year, shoots in a car horn. There's a lot of hope. There's a lot of joy on the streets of Lagos tonight. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That fireworks display at the (INAUDIBLE) has been absolutely spectacular. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy New Year. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Well, besides the parties and the fireworks, there is another New Year's tradition popping the question. Well for couples getting engaged tonight, we wish you congratulations. Our Christina Macfarlane is back now with a very personal story about New Year's proposals. Christina, your proposal did not go to plan. 
 
MACFARLANE: That's right, Lynda. And as you can see, I am joined on stage here by a very special guest, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, who our viewers may be familiar with as one of our intrepid foreign correspondent reporters. For me personally, though, I'm more familiar with him as being my husband and the father of our daughter, one year old Grace. Nick, Happy New Year. 
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR: Happy New Year. Hello. I brought along this slightly menacing looking bottle of champagne. 
 
MACFARLANE: OK, good. Let's not pop it just yet. I want to tell the viewers my story, which revolves around our proposal, my proposal to you on New Year's Eve. Now, Lynda, this happened in 2019. We were in Buenos Aires for weeks. I had been thinking about asking Nick to marry me on New Year's Eve. We've been building up to it all day, and then at about quarter to midnight, I thought, right, I'm just going to do it. So were drinking beers in Buenos Aires. I turned to Nick and I said, Nick, will you marry me? And you said, no. No. 
 
WALSH: It was mango daiquiris, not beers. 
 
MACFARLANE: Can we not please avoid the point? Nick said no. I was entirely crushed. And the reason, Nick, that you said no is because you said to me it is, and I quote, the man's job to propose. Yes, ladies, that is what he said to me. I'm sure it's something you're regretting now, Nick. It took you another, no, I'm not letting you speak. I'm not letting you speak. It took you --
 
WALSH: Perfectly. It's fantastic. Excellent news. You two are gang off me quite specially. 
 
MACFARLANE: OK, well, the conclusion to the story is that it took you then another nine months to propose to me. Anyway, I will let you have your say. 
 
WALSH: No. Nine months. Particularly biologically important period of time, but I just felt I needed to have some slight control with these very forceful anchor types. Once again, you know, ambush you at certain moments. And looking back, I think really yes, would have been the immediate first, best response. And as you can tell, I'm totally ambushed and flummoxed. And back to you. Thanks.
 
MACFARLANE: Nick, look at our viewers when you're speaking, please. No, look, it's absolutely fine. I understand the reasons why you did it, but I think the moral of the story here, Lynda, and to any of our viewers watching around the world whose girlfriends may have chosen the time to pop the question tonight. Gents, just say yes. We are living in the modern age after all, aren't we, Nick? 
 
WALSH: Thank you very much. Yes.
 
MACFARLANE: OK. I know. I know. Well, look, I'm going to ask you again tonight in front of the London Eye and maybe 90,000 people. Nick Paton Walsh, will you marry me? 
 
WALSH: Obviously a bit late now because we will be married for what? 
 
MACFARLANE: We're married and we've got a baby. It's a bit late now, but maybe we should pop the champagne. Lynda, Nick can't hear anything you're saying, but I know you sympathize with me. 
 
KINKADE: I completely sympathize with you. But he was a bit slow off the mark, but I glad it only took him nine months. I do remember the plans for your wedding, Christina, which, of course, COVID played havoc with. I was very much looking forward to celebrate you two and style in the UK that didn't quite go to plan. I'm glad that you guys are happily married with a beautiful baby girl. Happy New Year. 
 
MACFARLANE: Happy New Year to you, Lynda. And you never know, if we get around to it and we pull our finger out, we might still have those wedding celebrations sometime in 2023. But it has been absolute delight, Lynda, being live with you tonight from me and from Nick. Say Happy New Year to Lynda. 
 
WALSH: Happy New Year, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Happy New Year, Nick. Happy New Year, Chrissy. So good to have you guys on the show. Such a pleasure. Have a wonderful 2023 and give Gracie a big cuddle for us.
 <br>[19:50:00]
 
Congratulations also to all those engaged around the world tonight and also those celebrating new babies. A special shout out to the newest additions of our family who arrived in the past few weeks. My nephew Timothy Kinkade in Sydney and my niece Evelyn Kinkade Jones in Melbourne. Both beautiful babies. I can't wait for a cuddle. Happy New Year to everyone celebrating in Australia and around the world.
 
Well still to come, we will welcome the new with a magnificent performance by the Georgia Boys Choir. Do stay with us for that. It's very special. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade. I'm here with the Georgia Boy Choir. In recent years, they have toured the globe, performing in more than a dozen countries, including Italy, Estonia, China and Sweden. More recently, they performed in cities right across Iceland.
 
Well, just in a moment, they will be performing the New Year's Eve classic Auld Lang Syne. But first, I spoke with a couple of the boys about their impressive international to it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: What's the best thing about sharing the globe performing? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The best thing is like, sharing our music with everyone, and I like to see their faces and how they enjoy our music. 
 
KINKADE: What are you looking forward to most about going to Germany? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd like to see all the views and singing for other people around the world.
