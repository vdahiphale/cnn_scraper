COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Just like presidents before him, many of those themes were discussed last night when U.S. President Joe Biden gave his 
 
 annual State of the Union Address to Congress.
 
I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, reporting from Phoenix, Arizona, for you all week long.
 
The U.S. Constitution does not require a president to give this speech. In fact, Article II Section 3 only says, quote, he shall from time to time 
 
 give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and 
 
 expedient.
 
So the fact that this speech happens every year, that it`s done in person, that it`s televised, and the fact that it`s followed up by a response from 
 
 the opposing political party -- well, those are all traditions associated with the State of the Union, not requirements by the Constitution itself.
 
Still, the event is an opportunity for the U.S. president to tout what he sees as successes by his administration and it`s an opportunity for the 
 
 opposing party to lay out a different vision for the country. This was President Biden`s second official State of the Union Address, but it was 
 
 first given to a divided Congress.
 
After Republicans took control of the House of Representatives following last year`s midterm elections. Have a listen to some of the highlights of 
 
 what the president had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never ever 
 
 giving up. It`s a story unique among all nations. We`re the only country that has emerged from every crisis we`ve ever entered stronger than we got 
 
 into it.
 
Look, folks, that`s what we`re doing again. Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight after we`ve created with the help of many 
 
 people in this room 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president`s created in four years because of you all, because of 
 
 the American people.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Two years ago -- and two years ago, COVID had shut down -- our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much, and today, COVID no longer 
 
 controls our lives. And two years ago, democracy faced the greatest threat to the civil war and today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed 
 
 and unbroken.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
As we gather here tonight, we`re writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders 
 
 asked me to define America and they do believe it or not, I try to define it in one word, and I mean this -- possibilities. We don`t think anything 
 
 is beyond our capacity, everything is a possibility. You know we`re often told that Democrats and Republicans can`t work together, but over the past 
 
 two years, we`ve proved the cynics and naysayers wrong.
 
Yes, we disagreed plenty and yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together, came 
 
 together to defend us stronger and safer Europe. It came together to pass one in the -- one in a generation, once in a generation infrastructure law, 
 
 building bridges connecting our nation and our people.
 
In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming president, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, the Electoral 
 
 Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work 
 
 together the last Congress, there`s no reason we can`t work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
Well, folks, so let`s look at the results. We`re not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination, but the unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 
 
 50-year low.
 
A near record -- a near record unemployment, near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We`ve already created your help eight hundred 
 
 thousand good paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.
 
So, I`ve come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report in the State of the Union and here`s my report, because the soul of this nation is 
 
 strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.

WIRE:  Now, as for the tradition of the opposing political party`s response to the state of the union address, it started in the 1960s and it`s a 
 
 speech given by Republicans when there`s a Democratic president and by Democrats when there`s a Republican president.
 
Last night, the rebuttal came from Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas. Sanders became Arkansas`s first female governor after 
 
 she was elected in November.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R), ARKANSAS:  From out-of-control inflation and violent crime, to the dangerous border crisis and threat from China, 
 
 Biden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it, and it`s time for a change.
 
Tonight, let us reaffirm our commitment to a timeless American idea, that government exists not to rule the people but to serve the people. Democrats 
 
 want to rule us with more government control, but that`s not who we are. America is the greatest country the world has ever known because we`re the 
 
 freest country the world has ever known, with the people who are strong and resilient.
 
President Biden inherited the fastest economic recovery on record, the most secure border in history, cheap, abundant, homegrown energy, fast rising 
 
 wages, a rebuilt military and a world that was stable and at peace.
 
But over the last two years, Democrats destroyed it all, a new generation of Republican leaders are stepping up not to be caretakers of the status 
 
 quo but to be change makers for the American people. We know not what the future holds but we know who holds the future in his hands. And with God as 
 
 our witness, we will show the world that America is still the place where freedom reigns and liberty will never die.
 
Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.

WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:
 
Which of these painters was known for his "drip technique" of splashing paint onto a surface?
 
Salvador Dali, Jackson Pollock, Claude Monet, or Pablo Picasso?
 
Modern American painter Jackson Pollock became famous for us look out I`m about to splatter some paint technique in the mid-1950s.
 
In today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, an accidental art installation on a highway in Australia. Take a look at this -- a cargo truck on the highway 
 
 lost control and spilled more than 260 gallons of paint. That`s enough paint for hundreds of canvases and aren`t the results just so perfectly and 
 
 perfect it turned the coastal area into a scene that would certainly catch the attention of Jackson Pollock. Hang this one in the Louvre, people.
 
All right. I want to give a special shout out to Hyatts Middle School in Powell, Ohio, for the work of art you created in the comments section of 
 
 our CNN 10 YouTube Channel and my @CoyWire social accounts. Thanks for the love and go Eagles.
 
All right. My perfectly imperfect people out there -- remember, of the nearly 8 billion people on this planet, there is no one in the world like 
 
 you.
 
I`m Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.
