JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The head prosecutor in Maricopa County says she will be personally reviewing this case -- guys? 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Yes, that testimony certainly does back up what men -- what has become very clear in so many cases across the country, which is that that kind of training is really essential and not done enough. 
 
Josh Campbell, thank you so much for the report. 
 
Next, polling shows a close Senate race in Texas. Could Democrats, as they have so long dreamed, pull off a major upset there? 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: There is so much focus on the White House, understandably. But the race for the Senate is a big deal right now. Republicans are poised to gain seats, maybe even win control of the upper chamber. 
 
Democrats are hoping to stop them, in part, by winning over deep-red Texas. Could it be?
 <br>[14:35:08]
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Yes, and they're pouring a lot of money into Congressman Colin Allred's campaign hoping to pull off a big upset against Republican Senator Ted Cruz. 
 
These two actually held a debate last night. Watch this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Colin Allred is Kamala Harris. Their records are the same. I've served with both of them. They voted in favor of open borders over and over and over again. 
 
REP. COLIN ALLRED (D-TX): What he wants you thinking about is kids in bathrooms so you're not thinking about women in hospitals.
 
CRUZ: Congressman Allred was an NFL linebacker. It is not fair for a man to compete against women. 
 
ALLRED: You can't be for the mob on January 6th and for the officers. You can't. And it's not funny. Because you're a threat to democracy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: CNN political director, David Chalian, joins us now. 
 
David, Republicans have been pumping money into this race, perhaps a sign that it's closer than they anticipated it would be.
 
DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: No doubt. They see Texas has changed over time, but we've also seen sort of like Lucy with the football, like --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CHALIAN: -- Democrats trying recycled the seat. Is this the cycle that they can flip Texas? 
 
Listen, if you look at the latest Marist poll in this race, you see it is a close race between Allred and Cruz, 51 percent to 46 percent. But a five-point race obviously is one where Cruz is probably feeling a little bit better today than Allred about the outcome here. 
 
But that's not going to stop Democrats making a play here because of the map. They don't have many offensive opportunities. So even if it is in a slightly more red-leaning state like Texas is, they've got to try to play offense where anywhere is remotely possible for them to do so. 
 
KEILAR: Lucy with the football, that's a good image to show you what's been happening. 
 
So Texas, we should note, it has one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation. There's no exception for rape or incest. And moderators in this debate actually the press Ted Cruz about that last night. Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: You said that you agree with the Texas law that has zero exceptions. So tonight, the question is, where do you stand on this? And we're asking for your personal opinion as a Texan and as a father? 
 
CRUZ: Well, listen, abortion is an issue that many Texans, many Americans care deeply about. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: Senator, you did not directly answer the question. I want to ask it to you again. Do you support or oppose exceptions for rape or for incest? Again, asking as a Texan and as a father tonight. 
 
CRUZ: So I want to be very clear, if you listen to Congressman Allred's answer -- UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: Why is this an issue you won't address about --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: -- about saying whether you support or oppose exceptions --
 
CRUZ: I'm curious, why do you keep asking me that, but yet --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CRUZ: Hold on a second. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEILAR: So he never did answer the question, which is a sign of how difficult this issue is in these races this year. 
 
CHALIAN: I think when we look at all the votes get counted in all the Senate, House and presidential races on November 5th, guys, we're going to see that abortion rights is still a very potent issue coursing through American politics. 
 
We saw it in the '22 midterms. That was the first election right on the heels of the Dobbs decision. It has not dissipated with time all that much. 
 
This is -- this is still going to be very evident in these election results, I would say. And we see it in the advertising, especially at the congressional and Senate level.
 
And you're right, Brianna, that non-answer their explains everything you need to understand about this, which is that the 50-year quest that Republicans had to overturn Roe v Wade, they we're successful with that.
 
Then what was not planned for was how to deal with the political fallout of taking away a national abortion right for women in this country after 50 years of it being there.
 
SANCHEZ: David, you had mentioned a moment ago that Democrats have limited opportunities to pick up seats, whereas Republicans -- I think you pointed to the map and see several more, including in West Virginia where Joe Manchin is stepping down. 
 
How close is the race for the Senate going to be? 
 
CHALIAN: Yes, the race for control of the Senate is not as close as the race for the White House and the race for control of the House of Representatives. And that is because of the map. 
 
Now, let's remind folks, what do Republicans need to gain control? So if, indeed, Kamala Harris were to win the presidency, and therefore, Tim Walz would have a tie-breaking vote, the Republicans would need two seats, a net gain of two seats to have control if Harris were to win the presidency.
 
If Trump were to win the presidency, they just need one net gain seat, you know? 
 
And by the way, West Virginia, as you pointed out, that might be the seat that they need, right? Never mind the fact that Jon Tester in Montana, if you look, is running far behind Tim Sheehy right now, his Republican opponent there. 
 
So that right there may be the majority. Again, the map favors Republicans in this cycle. And that is why I would say the edge is for Republicans to gain control of the Senate.
 
SANCHEZ: Tester, we should note, who has not endorsed a presidential candidate this cycle - 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 <br>[14:40:01]
 
CHALIAN: It has nothing to do with the presidential race there in Montana.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes. That tells you everything you need to know.
 
David Chalian, thank you so much. 
 
CHALIAN: Sure.
 
SANCHEZ: Still to come, a death row inmate has just 24 hours to live unless the Supreme Court intervenes. CNN traveled to Texas to speak with him in his final days. Next, hear why so many doubt Robert Roberson's story, including the former lead detective in the case against him.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SANCHEZ: There is just one day left before the scheduled execution of Texas death row inmate, Robert Roberson. And today calls to spare his life are growing. His team is now taking their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
 
KEILAR: Roberson was convicted of murdering his 2-year-old daughter back in 2002. That conviction relied on what's called Shaken Baby Syndrome. 
 <br>[14:45:06]
 
But his attorneys and a bipartisan group of lawmakers argue that new evidence shows his daughter died from different causes that did not involve abuse. 
 
CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Dallas for us. 
 
Ed, you actually visited with Roberson on death row last week. Tell us about it. ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we spoke with
 
 him for nearly an hour inside the prison unit where he has been held since 2003 after he was sentenced to die in the death of his two-year- old daughter, Nikki. 
 
He maintains his innocence as he long had. His lawyers say that essentially what happened back in 2002, when Nikki died, that the medical experts at the time misdiagnosed what was happening with the young girl.
 
Medical experts said that there were multiple traumas at the time to her head that were indicative of abuse. 
 
But since then, defense attorneys for Roberson say that essentially what was happening is that young girl had a long history of medical issues that included double pneumonia, that eventually progressed into sepsis, and that that was the cause of her death, not abuse. 
 
Robert Roberson told us he is innocent and should not be executed.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAVANDERA: Well, why should people believe that you didn't kill your daughters? 
 
ROBERT ROBERSON, DEATH ROW INMATE CONVICTED OF MURDERING HIS 2-YEAR- OLD DAUGHTER: Because I didn't, you know. We can't make a person believers, you know, stuff, you know. But I came to the hospital and stuff, you know? I didn't have nothing to hide. 
 
LAVANDERA: Why do you think you were convicted? 
 
ROBERSON: Just because I couldn't explain what happened to her. They said you're guilty. And the way I was acting funny, because of my autism. I didn't even know I had autism until I was here. 
 
LAVANDERA: Did you love your daughter? 
 
ROBERSON: Yes, sir. I loved her. And I see right now, you said, was I prepared? I might not prepared like I should have been, you know. 
 
LAVANDERA: Right. 
 
ROBERSON: But, yes, I did love her.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAVANDERA: And Boris and Brianna, Roberson's case has garnered intense scrutiny and wide-ranging support. As you mentioned, a bipartisan group of 86 Republican and Democratic lawmakers here in the state essentially urging the governor and state courts to spare this man's life. 
 
And that also includes the very police detective that sent him to death row. Brian Wharton also tells us that he no longer believes that Robert Roberson is guilty and that he should be freed as well -- Boris and Brianna?
 
SANCHEZ: Wow, significant there. 
 
Ed Lavandera, thank you so much. 
 
Stay with CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We're taking a quick break. We'll be back in a few minutes. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:51:55]
 
KEILAR: The story you've all been waiting for. Check it out here. A brand-new look at the Smithsonian's new giant pandas. Bao Li and Qing Bao settling into their new home here in D.C. 
 
The pair arrived yesterday from China and they're going to actually spend the next 30 days in quarantine before they get a big public debut in January.
 
SANCHEZ: A big public debut that we are eagerly anticipating. And we should petition CNN to send us, too, we should note.
 
CNN's David Culver traveled to China for an exclusive look at their sendoff and he filed this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CROWD: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They're saying Bao Li, Qing Bao, have a safe trip.
 
You are getting a very rare look at the panda sendoff here in China. I've never been this close to a panda, but there she is. 
 
CULVER (voice-over): A few hours earlier, a private farewell for the three-year-old panda pair and the ceremonial transfer of care from China to the U.S. 
 
We got here a few days ahead of the sendoff.
 
(on camera): We made it. It's a long journey.
 
(voice-over): Traveling to Chengdu and meeting up with the panda keepers from the Smithsonian's National Zoo. 
 
(on camera): Thanks for making time. I know you guys are busy, Marrio, Trish.
 
(voice-over): We catch them just outside the panda quarantine zone. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This was what I worked for. And it feels so surreal. 
 
CULVER: The majestic mountains of Sichuan Province are the natural habitat for these beloved creatures. 
 
(on camera): Chances of us actually seeing one out here we're told are quite slim.
 
(voice-over): We're granted access to a reserve that tourists aren't allowed, joining researchers from the Smithsonian who specialize in panda rewilding, or efforts to reintroduce them to their natural habitat. 
 
MELISSA SONGER, CONSERVATION BIOLOGIST, SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL ZOO: Part of the reason for putting them in an area like this, in keeping them away from people, is so that they're not acclimatized to people. 
 
You wouldn't want to release a panda and have them approach a village, for example.
 
CULVER: We're told we can meet some of the forest panda trackers. But first, we need to suit up. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you should fit these.
 
CULVER (on camera): All right, let's try it.
 
(voice-over): A panda suit, just in case we stumble across a panda cub. 
 
(on camera): They don't want humans to become part of their everyday routine. So, it's for that reason that we're suiting up to look like them.
 
Does it look like a panda.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're not only putting on just the suit by itself. You're also going to put panda's urine and pooh-pooh on so you have the scent.
 
CULVER: Has that been on this suit before? 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CULVER: This is for --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is clean. It's been cleaned.
 
CULVER: Oh.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, if -- if they sense that a signal that a cub is nearby, they're going to put on a hood and just -- and go into hiding.
 
CULVER (voice-over): Conservation efforts like these are funded in part by the Panda Exchange Program.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our two guys that came over 20 years ago and --
 
CULVER: Zoos, like the Smithsonian's, pay $1 million a year to host a pair of giant pandas, adding to the pressure. 
 
BRANDIE SMITH, DIRECTOR, SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL ZOO: We just imagine everything we do, the entire world is watching and there's no margin for error.
 <br>[14:55:01]
 
CULVER: Especially given how beloved pandas are in places like Chengdu. The creatures are larger than life here. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
CULVER: And their most loyal fans stand hours in line to catch a glimpse of their favorite ones.
 
(on camera): You could see, looks like everybody gets super excited. They've already got their positions.
 
(voice-over): And there are even panda influencers, like A'Qiu, who posts content from his bedroom.
 
(on camera): So, you're into pandas?
 
A'QIU, PANDA INFLUENCER: I should, sorry, before we start, can we just move one big panda to that one there?
 
CULVER (voice-over): Which doubles as his studio.
 
(on camera): Why do you love them so much? 
 
A'QIU: Cute. So cute.
 
CULVER: The pandas that go part of the exchange program from here in China to the U.S., what do you make of that?
 
A'QIU (through translation): This is an agreement between China and the U.S. And because I love my country, and I love pandas, I support it.
 
CULVER (voice-over): The panda exchange, or panda diplomacy, dates back to 1972. President Nixon's historic visit sparking China to send pandas to the U.S. and now to many other countries.
 
Months of planning to pull off this transfer. And in Washington, renovations to make sure Bao Li and Qing Bao's new home is just right.
 
LAURIE THOMPSON, ASSISTANT CURATOR OF GIANT PANDAS: We've done some tree trimming here also because we know they're going to climb. They love to climb.
 
CULVER: The zoo's been advertising pandas are coming. And now, they've arrived.
 
David Culver, CNN, Chengdu, China.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SANCHEZ: Wow.
 
KEILAR: He gets the good assignments.
 
SANCHEZ: Talk about immersive journalism. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SANCHEZ: I want a screenshot of David in a suit.
 
KEILAR: Panda man.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SANCHEZ: I love the panda outfit. That was awesome. 
 
David Culver, thank you so much for that. 
 
So in the next hour, Vice President Kamala Harris is going to be joined by more than 100 Republicans backing her candidacy at a major campaign event in battleground, Pennsylvania. We'll take you there.
