ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world, I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
Just ahead, from a virtual unknown to sudden national prominence, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is tapped to join the Democratic ticket as Kamala Harris' running mate. We will have the reaction to her pick from both Democrats and Republicans.
 
Uncertainty and fear grip the Middle East as Israel prepares for a retaliatory strike from Iran and the U.S. and its allies race to avert an all-out war. 
 
Plus, thousands of police are deployed across the U.K. following a week of violent far-right riots and the protests are only expected to continue as the country grapples with the worst disorder in more than a decade. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from Atlanta, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Well, in just two short weeks, the two-term governor of Minnesota has gone from relative obscurity to national prominence. And now Tim Walz is officially U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. His meteoric rise thanks in part to his description of Donald Trump as weird, a criticism which seems to have stuck. 
 
The pair took to the stage in Philadelphia for their first rally since the election. Today, they will attend a rally in Wisconsin and Michigan as part of a campaign swing through several battleground states. Walz is a former teacher and football coach who spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard. He served 12 years in Congress before he was elected governor. 
 
Well, more now on the Democratic ticket's big debut from CNN's MJ Lee in Philadelphia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: This was an incredibly raucous and energized political rally, the first formal introduction of the Harris-Walz ticket. 
 
And we saw from this evening how much the Harris campaign is going to be leaning into that contrast between Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, both of them as they took the stage, really talking about the biography of Tim Walz, as they were trying to introduce him to so many people around the country that don't have a great sense of who he even is, his Midwestern roots, the fact that he was born in Nebraska, the fact that he was a football coach and a teacher and served in the Army National Guard. These are all factors that the Harris campaign is hoping will make him an appealing person on the Democratic ticket, particularly in the critical blue wall states.
 
Here's a little bit of how the vice president introduced her new running mate in Philadelphia. Take a listen. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: To the people -- to the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was congressman.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And to his former high school football players, he was coach
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
LEE: And of course, one of the biggest reasons that the Harris campaign decided to choose Tim Walz as the vice president's running mate is because they also think that he is successful at sort of prosecuting the argument against the Trump-Vance ticket on the other side of the political aisle.
 
And in fact, in this room, in this arena, some of the biggest applause lines that Tim Walz got tonight was when he specifically went after Donald Trump, including his recent conviction. Take a listen to that. 
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division. And that's to say nothing of his record as president. And make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump.
 
(APPLAUSE) WALZ: That's not even counting the crimes he committed.
 
LEE: And Harris-Walz will be traveling more together, traveling to a number of battleground states, trying to introduce themselves together as that joint ticket. And to that end, as they are trying to capitalize on the momentum, the campaign did announce Tuesday evening that they had raised at least $20 million since the moment that Harris announced her new running mate pick.
 
MJ Lee, CNN, in Philadelphia.

 <br>[03:05:01]
 
CHURCH: To Los Angeles now and political analyst Michael Genovese, who is the president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University. Good to have you with us.
 
MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST AND PRESIDENT, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY-GLOBAL POLICY INSTITUTE: Great to be here. 
 
CHURCH: So Kamala Harris announces Tim Walz as her new running mate, saying she has found a leader, a fighter and a patriot. And he says he could not be prouder to be on the ticket. How did he go introducing himself to the nation and how will he help Harris win over those battleground states? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, you know, Walz is the quintessentially American character. It's almost as if he were taken out of a Frank Capra movie, a little black-and-white "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." You talked about his past, about being a teacher, a coach, National Guard. 
 
He comes off as a regular guy, very likable, has a lot of curb appeal. And one of the things that people said about him is that he's very authentic.
 
He is supposed to bring back some of the working class Democrats who voted for Reagan in the '80s and then voted for Trump in 2016 and '20. If he can bring some of those people back into the fold, he'll have done a great job for the Democrats. But he's got a very buoyant personality and he was introduced at a rally that just was wonderfully successful.
 
I don't know if you can keep up this for the whole campaign, but it was a great day for the Democrats today. 
 
CHURCH: Yeah, I mean, the whole mood of this race has changed, hasn't it? And many Americans, it has to be said, have never heard of Tim Walz. So now the race is on to define him. And Republicans tried to get in first with that, painting him as dangerously liberal, radical and a liberal extremist. But what does he actually bring to the table? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, he's a person of Midwestern values, liberal policies. If you look at his record in the House of Representatives, where he served for 10 years or 12 years, he's center-left. If you look at his time as governor, more left. And so he's a legitimate liberal, I think. 
 
In that sense, Kamala Harris doubled down, bringing a liberal onto a liberal ticket.
 
The same way that Donald Trump doubled down by bringing a hard-right conservative vice president onto the hard-right Republican ticket. And so a lot of times people say, oh, there's no contrast. There's no reason to vote. There is a contrast this time around. There's going to be major differences between these two parties and voters will have a choice. 
 
CHURCH: And Walz has already shown very clearly that he knows how to go after Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, and isn't afraid to attack them hard. How critical will that be in these remaining 90 days before the election and is Trump struggling with his responses here, do you think? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, you know, quite often presidential candidates elect a vice president who will be an attack dog. Vance has tried to do that for the Republicans already, and we probably will see Governor Walz do that for the Democrats. But I think it really does shake up the Trump approach.
 
Donald Trump is accustomed to being the center of attention, to dominating the public space. Joe Biden could never get him off center stage. Harris and Walz have gotten Trump off center stage. They've shown that they have this kind of pizzazz, kind of appeal to voters. 
 
And so for years, Donald Trump benefited from an enthusiasm gap. His supporters were very enthusiastic about him. Biden's lukewarm. I think this may be the closing of the enthusiasm gap, maybe even the reversal of it. And so Trump is going to have to do some scrambling.
 
CHURCH: And Harris and Walz will now set out on this multi-state tour. The Harris team seeing this VP pick as the key to blue walls across the country. A nice play on his name there. What's it going to take, though, for this new Democratic ticket to win and what are their paths to victory? What do you see? 
 
GENOVESE: Well, the road to the White House goes to the Midwest. That's why two of the three finalists for the vice presidential spot, Governor Cohen of Pennsylvania and Walz, were right in the thick of it. The Democrats need to win that series of states in the Midwest because that's where they -- they lost it in 2016. Biden won it back in 2020. And that's where the race will be won or lost for the Democrats. 
 
And what you'll see is that both the Democrats and Republicans will spend an inordinate amount of time in six or seven states, four of which will be in the Midwest. That's the strategy to win for both parties. 
 
CHURCH: Michael Genovese, always a pleasure to get your perspective and analysis. Many thanks. GENOVESE: Thank you so much. 
 
CHURCH: Tropical Storm Debby has moved away from the U.S. coast for now, with its center near the Georgia-South Carolina border. 
 <br>[03:10:04]
 
The storm is expected to get stronger before making another landfall later this week as it continues to dump torrential rain on the region.
 
Fire officials in South Carolina report a local dam is holding after concerns it had the potential to fail. The state has received more than a foot or 30 centimeters of rain in multiple areas, and some could see more than two feet or 60 centimeters of rainfall in the coming days. CNN's Brian Abel shows us the damage Debby has caused so far.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN ABEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tropical Storm Debby is once again churning in the warm ocean water of the Atlantic, expected to re-strengthen just a few dozen miles off the coast. 
 
First hitting Florida, Debby is forecast to strengthen, turn and make a second landfall in South Carolina later this week. 
 
GOV. HENRY MCMASTER (R-SC): We were preparing for that kind of heavy rainfall and the danger that comes with that kind of flooding.
 
ABEL (voice-over): Officials already report at least five deaths across two states due to Debby. 
 
JUSTIN POWELL, SOUTH CAROLINA DEPT. OF TRANSPORTATION SECURITY: We strongly advise residents to stay off the roads if at all possible. 
 
ABEL (voice-over): Even communities that escaped a direct hit earlier this week are reeling from torrential rain and immense flooding, including in Sarasota, Florida.
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS )R-FL): We definitely saw very high water rise very quickly there, and we are bracing for more. 
 
ABEL (voice-over): More than 17 inches of rain fell, causing the city's wettest three day period on record with water all the way up to rooftops in some places. The storm is expected to head back toward land come Thursday and then sweep up the East Coast.
 
KARINE JEAN PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This storm isn't over yet, so we urge everyone in its path to remain vigilant. 
 
ABEL (voice-over): While all eyes are on Debby, that tropical storm could be just an appetizer of what's to come. Colorado State University forecasters are calling for an abnormally active August in the Atlantic, with an 85 percent chance of above normal hurricane activity through the 19th.
 
In South Carolina, I'm Brian Abel.

CHURCH: Markets across the globe appear to be steadily recovering after Monday's meltdown. Today, Asia markets continued the rebound with Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea all in positive territory. On Wall Street, stocks bounced back Tuesday after widespread losses a day earlier.
 
The stock sell-off was triggered by a combination of investors' fears about a slowing U.S. economy, rising Japanese interest rates and crumbling tech stocks. And here's a look at U.S. futures hours before the opening bell. Very encouraging. The Nasdaq up 0.72 percent and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 more than half a percent there. 
 
Well, still ahead, the Middle East on edge. Hamas elevates the alleged mastermind of the October 7th attacks, while Israel braces for expected attacks from Iran and Hezbollah. Those details in a live report. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[03:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Hamas has named the alleged mastermind of the October 7th terror attack on Israel as the new head of its political bureau. Yahya Sinwar was already the militant group's leader in Gaza and one of the main targets in Israel's war against Hamas.
 
It's believed Sinwar has often been consulted in the ceasefire and hostage release talks, even while he's been hiding in the vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza. Sinwar takes over from Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week. Both Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two of the main allies of Hamas, have welcomed the news of Sinwar's new role. 
 
Well meanwhile, Israel and Hezbollah intensified their cross-border fighting on Tuesday. Israeli officials say Hezbollah drones injured several people in northern Israel and a Hezbollah rocket barrage caused several fires. The IDF says it struck a building in southern Lebanon used by Hezbollah, killing five people. 
 
Israel has been bracing for further retaliation from both Hezbollah and Iran for the assassinations of key militant figures last week. The leader of Hezbollah on Tuesday promised a response is coming and Tehran has made similar threats. In the hours ahead, foreign ministers from several Islamic countries are set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss tensions in the region. 
 
And CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me now live from London. Good morning to you, Paula. So what is likely to come out of today's meeting in Saudi Arabia of these foreign ministers from Islamic nations? 
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, this is a meeting that Tehran itself had called for, wanting to -- to really shore up support for its retaliation against the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. So certainly what Tehran is wanting from this meeting is to have the vocal support, potentially other support from -- from those foreign ministers.
 
We have seen diplomatic activity over the weekend as well. We saw Jordan's foreign minister making a very rare visit to Tehran to talk about this assassination as well. So what Tehran is looking for is to have the support of the region, as it says it is going to respond to that assassination, which Israel has yet to claim responsibility for. 
 
Now, what we've seen from the other side, we know that the U.S. has been rallying its allies in the region, trying to put pressure on Iran to not respond or at least to contain its response, because, of course, the concern is and has been for months that this could become an expanded conflict in the region. 
 <br>[03:19:52]
 
Now, we've also heard from -- from U.S. officials that they believe that Iran and its proxies are making some preparations for some kind of retaliation. And that is, of course, the concern by Iran and by Israel that there will be an attack not just from Iran, but by many of the proxies surrounding Israel in the region.
 
Now, we have heard from one of those. We've heard from Hassan Nasrallah, the chief of Hezbollah. He had a speech where he said once again that there will be a response, because remember, just the day before the Hamas political leader was assassinated, there was a top Hamas military commander killed in Beirut as well. And that's one that Israel did claim responsibility for. Let's listen to Nasrallah. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HASSAN NASRALLAH, LEADER OF HEZBOLLAH (through translator): The weeklong wait for Israel is part of the punishment, part of the response, part of the battle, because the battle is a psychological and moral one that requires nerves.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: And also that announcement that Ismail Haniyeh has been replaced. Yahya Sinwar, the leader in Gaza, has taken his place. Now, it is not a name that had been considered before, but it's certainly one that Israel will not welcome.
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Paula Hancocks joining us live from London. 
 
Well, let's bring in Jasmine El-Gamal. She is a political analyst, CEO of Mind Work Strategies and former Middle East adviser at the Pentagon. And she joins me now live from London. Thanks for being with us.
 
JASMINE EL-GAMAL, POLITICAL ANALYST, CEO OF MIND WORKS STRATEGIES, AND FORMER PENTAGON MIDDLE EAST ADVISER: Good morning, Rosemary. Thanks for having me. 
 
CHURCH: So Yahya Sinwar has just been named as the new political head of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated last week in Tehran. Sinwar is also the military head of Hamas. So this makes him even more of a target for Israel than he was before. But he'll also take a more central role in efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Where do you see those efforts going since they were recently derailed and what's Sinwar's likely next move, do you think? 
 
EL-GAMAL: Right. Well, this -- this was a really fascinating move. It was an unexpected move to have Sinwar, you know, suddenly be vaulted to this position of both the head of the military and the political arms of Hamas, which have traditionally been separate.
 
Sinwar's history is quite different from the previous leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who he just replaced. You know, he's someone who has lived his entire life in Gaza. He was not like Sinwar or Khaled Mishal, who had been exiled and sort of living the good life in a lot of ways in exile. He, his parents and grandparents were -- were living in what is now Ashkelon in Israel before 1948. 
 
He was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp and he had been imprisoned since the age of 25, spent 11 years in military in prison in Israel. So someone who is hardened, someone who has been on the ground for all of it.
 
And so one thing that his ascension does to this leadership position, to this total leadership position, it kind of brings it closer to people in Gaza who have been suffering, you know, in over the last 10 months, unable to leave Gaza. 
 
It -- it sort of removes that criticism that Ismail Haniyeh and others liked him faced of being too removed, too comfortable from the suffering going on in Gaza. So that's just one point I wanted to -- to bring out in terms of the negotiations. Now, he has always been involved in the negotiations way back from when he was in prison.
 
He had always been involved in what was happening negotiations wise, prisoner exchange wise between Israel and Hamas. He was involved notably in the negotiations that -- that released the then-captive soldier Gilad Shalit back to Israel and that resulted in his own release from Israeli prison. So that just gives you a sense of how much he's been involved in these kinds of negotiations for years and will continue to be moving forward. 
 
CHURCH: And meantime, Israel is bracing for retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah for the killing of Haniyeh. Hezbollah is making Israel wait for that response. How do you expect it will retaliate and how careful will it be not to trigger an all out regional war? Because that's the risk here, isn't it? 
 
EL-GAMAL: Absolutely, and it's the risk that's been on the table for so many months now, every time, every time one of these sort of tit- for-tat attacks happen.
 
We saw it back in April, of course, between Israel and Iran as well. So here's the thing. Iran, you know, will have to do something. This is what we were saying also back in April. It was the assassination of Haniyeh on Iranian soil as he was a guest in Iran. It was a huge embarrassment for Iran internationally.
 <br>[03:25:10]
 
They're going to have to do something to retaliate. As we heard yesterday from Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, they will be involved in the response -- in a response as well, given that their senior commander was also assassinated just, you know, in these back- to-back assassinations. 
 
And so -- so Nasrallah has said that there will be some kind of response, that it will be multifaceted. It will include several different actors in the region amongst Iran and its proxies and that they are going to take their time. He mentioned that waiting, that making the Israelis wait and sort of be on edge for a few days, wondering what the response will be, is part of the punishment, quote unquote. 
 
Now, that said, Rosemary, there is that meeting of foreign ministers that you mentioned in Saudi Arabia, the diplomacy happening both on, you know, in public and behind the scenes between Arab leaders and Iran, between the U.S. and Arab leaders has been nonstop.
 
Everybody in the region and both in the region and outside the region is trying really hard to ensure that the response from Iran will be limited. The message to Iran is that escalating this conflict is not in your interest, certainly not in any Arab country's interest in the region. That's the message Arab ministers are going to be bringing to Iran.
 
At the same time, they're going to have to form some sort of united front, at least publicly, against what they saw as a vast and significant Israeli aggression against Ismail Hanaya in Iran. So there's that really delicate balance that we're going to have to see in the next few days. But as you said, of course, the risk is not in the deliberate action that is taken.
 
The risk is always in that miscalculation. What is going to be that action that breaks the camel's back, the straw that breaks the camel's back, that causes a regional war that no one really deliberately wants at this time? So it's very -- very tense times for the region. 
 
CHURCH: Yeah, absolutely. That is the big question, of course. Jasmine El-Gamal, many thanks for joining us and sharing your perspective and analysis. 
 
Still to come, Britain braces for another day of far-right protests as the new prime minister struggles to control more than a week of angry clashes. Back in just a moment.

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back everyone. Kamala Harris' pick for Vice President is a hit with Democratic donors. The campaign says it has raised more than $20 million since she announced Tim Walz would be her running mate on Tuesday.
 
Walz is a two-term governor of Minnesota, a former teacher who served more than two decades in the Army National Guard. Harris and Walz are scheduled to visit several crucial swing states including Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada over the next few days. 
 
Well Donald Trump, in a fundraising email, claims Tim Walz would be the worst vice president in history, unleashing hell on earth. More now on the Republican attacks from CNN's Kristen Holmes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump's team wasted no time trying to define Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. They are looking at his progressive record as governor and really trying to double down on it, to say that he is a radical liberal. Remember, that has been a main talking point about Vice President Kamala Harris, that she is far-left of President Joe Biden. And take a listen to this ad that they released just after Tim Walz was announced. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Tim Walz will be a rubber stamp for Kamala's dangerously liberal agenda like allowing convicted felons to walk free, embracing anti-American Green New Deal policies, and giving up control of our southern border to criminal aliens and violent drug cartels. 
 
HOLMES: So clearly they are doubling down on this narrative. We saw Donald Trump himself posting that the two of them were the most radical duo in American history. You are going to continue hearing that narrative. But one thing that cannot be denied is what we saw in Philadelphia, which was a lot of energy, a lot of crowd cheering, a big crowd for the two of them, Harris and Walz, as they took the stage. That is going to be something that Donald Trump has to contend with. Remember, they had been planning on a race against President Joe Biden, even though they said they were prepared for anything to happen. 
 
Obviously, this has changed the dynamics moving forward. They are looking at new talking points, new rhetoric as they move forward and head towards November.

CHURCH: Top U.S. transportation officials will get another chance to question Boeing over the door plug blowout on a 737 Max. When a hearing resumes in the hours ahead, the National Transportation Safety Board began a two-day hearing on Tuesday to better understand what led up to the mid-flight blowout earlier this year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: This was quite traumatic for the crew and the passengers. And injuries we can't see, which we often don't talk about, can have profound, lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Testimony released from Boeing employees painted a picture of chaos and dysfunction at the aerospace company. They reported feeling pressure to do their jobs too fast. Boeing officials say changes are already being made, but the chair of the NTSB says the agency is considering major industry-wide safety recommendations. 
 
NASA has delayed the next SpaceX launch due to safety concerns over Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Issues were discovered with Starliner's propulsion system back in June. It's now been docked at the International Space Station seven weeks longer than planned, leaving its two crew members in limbo. The now-delayed SpaceX mission would have carried four astronauts to the station and could eventually serve as a backup vehicle for the Starliner's crew. NASA says mission managers will use the extra time figuring out how to get the ship and its crew back to Earth.
 
Still to come, Team USA celebrates more gold medal wins. We will have the latest highlights from Paris and what sprinter Gabby Thomas has to say about her first Olympic gold. Back in just a moment.
 <br>[03:35:09]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: A new Olympic event is underway right now in Paris. The Mixed Marathon Race Walk Relay made its debut today with teams of one man and one woman competing in a 50-kilometer race. 
 
Checking in on the medal count, 24 of the American's 86 medals are gold, putting them in first place. They're followed by China with 22 gold and almost 60 medals in all. And Australia is in third place, having struck gold 14 times. Well done to all.
 
Well CNN's Amanda Davis is keeping track of all of this and she joins us now So, Amanda, take us through the highlights of Tuesday's events. 
 
AMANDA DAVIS, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, good morning, Rosemary. It was a great day 11 for Team USA and it has been a project six years in the making for Gabby Thomas, the 27-year-old from Atlanta who now lives in Austin, saying it is an unbelievable, indescribable feeling to claim Olympic gold, beating St. Lucia's 100m champion Julian Alfred in the final, to claim victory not only for Team USA, but to become the first, the only Harvard University graduate to win track and field gold at an Olympic Games.
 
It was watching Alison Felix in London in 2012 that inspired her. She won seven Olympic golds in her career, so still some way to go for Gabby, but she'll be hoping for more in the 4x100 relay, which is still to come. But if Gabby Thomas went into her final as the favorite, well, Cole Hawker's victory in the men's 1,500 was an entirely different story. 
 
This one had been billed as a race for the ages. The Olympic champion up against the world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, against Josh Kerr. But 23-year-old Hawker, who finished sixth in Tokyo, had very different ideas. It was an epic run from him. He stormed from fifth place to first over the last 300m to set a new Olympic record on the way to taking gold.
 <br>[03:40:06]
 
Ahead of Kerr in silver, with Team USA's Yared Ngozi in bronze, it's the first time in 112 years that two American men have medaled in this middle distance event. 
 
Elsewhere, the Emma Hayes era is well and truly in full swing with the U.S. women's national football team. She's only been in charge since the end of May, but has led the team to what is said to be an epic Olympic football final against Brazil. They produced a really hard- fought, extra-time victory over Germany. Sophia Smith, 95th-minute winner, making the difference to book their place in the gold medal match as they look for their first Olympic title since 2012.
 
But it is also set to be the legendary Marta's last-ever game for Brazil. This, her sixth Olympic Games, and she will be desperate to lead her country to what would be a first international crown. That final, taking place on Saturday. 
 
In terms of what else is going on here on day 12 of the Games, it's another brilliant day on the agenda. The USA's Katie Moon, the defending champion, heading into the women's pole vault. We're expecting a great battle between the USA's Quincy Hall and Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith, the former roommate of Noah Lyles, in the men's 400 meters. And the women's golf is underway at Le Golf National. Nelly Kvorder, the defending Olympic champion, but France's Celine Boutier carrying the hopes of the hosts. Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Amanda Davis joining us live from Paris. 
 
And thank you for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church. For our international viewers, "Marketplace Middle East" is coming up next. And for those of you here in the United States and in Canada, I'll be back with more "CNN Newsroom" in just a moment. Do stay with us.

CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Democrat Kamala Harris will be introducing her new running mate to voters across several battleground states in the coming days. He is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a former congressman, national guardsman, high school teacher and football coach. They appeared together for the first time as a team at a raucous rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. 
 
Walz is known for coining the attack against Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, as weird. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: J.D. Vance literally, literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, J.D. studied at Yale -- 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WALZ: -- had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That's not what middle America is.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: The Republican ticket is painting Walz as a radical liberal who Trump says will unleash hell on earth. Here's J.D. Vance on the Democratic ticket. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On issue after issue from opening the border to supporting higher grocery prices on American, she has bent the knee to the far left of the party and this decision, selecting Tim Walz, is another sign that she doesn't care what the American people think, she is only in this to obey the far-left radicals within her own party. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Walz has produced results in two terms as governor, but his time in office has not been without some controversy. CNN's Whitney Wild has this profile. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The national spotlight is shining on humble roots as Minnesota Governor Tim Walz becomes Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate. 
 
WALZ: I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket.
 
WILD (voice-over): Before running for office, Walz was a geography teacher in public schools and a football coach from rural Mankato. 
 
WALZ: High school geography teachers don't usually think that. Look, it is humbling, it's a privilege, it's surreal.
 
WILD (voice-over): His resume also includes more than two decades in the Army National Guard, including a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks. 
 
The two-term governor previously served in Congress for 12 years, representing a rural district that voted for Trump twice.
 
In 2006, he won his first congressional race, ousting a six-term Republican incumbent. 
 
WALZ: They liked me, they trusted me. They said, Tim, I think you're trying to do it right.
 
WILD (voice-over): His first term as governor saw some of the state's most turbulent times when riots broke out after the murder of George Floyd. 
 
As parts of the city burned, Republicans blasted Democratic leaders' response. 
 
DONALD TRUMP (R), THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT: In recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. 
 
WILD (voice-over): After days of riots, Walz called in the entire Minnesota National Guard. 
 
WALZ: Let's be very clear. The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear, and disrupting our great cities. 
 
WILD (voice-over): His record of progressive policies, such as codifying abortion rights, adding protections for transgender people, passing paid sick and family leave, and implementing free breakfast and lunch programs in schools, makes him appealing to some on the left. And a target for Republican criticism, which he has begun to push back on. 
 
WALZ: What a monster kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn, and women are making their own health care decisions. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Earlier this year, Harris visited a Minnesota abortion clinic with Walz, the visit marking a big impact on her decision. A source close to the governor told CNN. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: You've been a great friend and advisor to the president and me, and thank you for all of that. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Walz joins the ticket, having already made his mark on the race, coining a new line of attack against GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Republican allies with a single word, weird.
 
WALZ: We're not afraid of weird people. We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid. 
 <br>[03:50:06]
 
WILD: We spoke with several voters out here who came to enjoy the moment that their governor was named as part of this ticket. And what they told us is that they're looking forward to sharing with the rest of America what they already know about Governor Walz. And they say that he is authentic, that he is steady, and that he's a fighter.

CHURCH: The U.S. Justice Department has charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in an alleged murder-for-hire plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, as well as other current and former U.S. officials. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: There is disturbing new information of a murder-for-hire plot that could have included former President Donald Trump. A Pakistani man is accused of having ties to the Iranian government. He was charged on Tuesday by the Justice Department for looking to carry out political assassinations here in the United States. 
 
According to an American official, FBI investigators believe that Trump and other current as well as former U.S. government officials were the intended targets of the plot, and security by the U.S. government was increased around them.
 
The man's name is Asif Merchant. He's 46 years old and was arrested on July 12, trying to leave the United States. There's no evidence that this Pakistani man had any connection to the shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, who did try to assassinate Trump on July 13. He was then killed by Secret Service. 
 
Merchant was allegedly looking to carry out killings in late August and in September. That's according to the court documents that just came out on Tuesday. After arriving in the U.S. in April, he met with people he believed were hit men but were actually undercover law enforcement. According to the court documents, Merchant wanted to target people who, quote, "hurt Pakistan and the world, the Muslim world." 
 
Now, this adds to a list of Iranian plots, a growing list, to kill Trump and some of those around him in his administration in retribution for the killing of the head of the Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, in early 2020.

CHURCH: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is promising to keep communities safe as the country braces for more potentially violent protests in the coming hours. He held another emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the response to the unrest. It comes as far-right protesters reportedly plan to target immigration centers and law firms today. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, here in Rotherham in Northern England, there is still a feeling of unease following Sunday's unrest, which saw violent, racist far-right rioters targeting this hotel behind me, a hotel which was reportedly housing asylum seekers. And we've been speaking to members of the community on Tuesday, many of whom told us that they were feeling afraid. Some told us they were too afraid to leave their homes on Sunday. 
 
Others say they are fearful for further riots that could take place here in Rotherham. And, of course, there have been warnings of further riots planned across the United Kingdom. And we have seen those riots taking place in various cities across the country. 
 
On Monday, Plymouth was targeted by yet more violent riots. And, of course, in Belfast, we have seen serious unrest, petrol bombs, bricks being thrown towards police officers, family homes being vandalized and targeted. One man in his 50s was also attacked by rioters. Police say that rioters had stamped on his head and described him as being in a serious condition. And there is a huge amount of concern, but also a huge amount of pressure now on the British government to take tougher action against these rioters. 
 
Take a listen to this message from the U.K. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. 
 
KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: We've seen Muslim communities targeted, attacks on mosques, other minority communities singled out, Nazi salutes in the street, attacks on the police, wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric. So, no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is, far-right thuggery. 
 
BASHIR: The Prime Minister himself has vowed to use the full force of the law against rioters. At least 370 people involved in these riots have been arrested so far. The Crown Prosecution Service has said that it has already charged around 100 people. But again, there are huge concerns around the potential for more riots to take place across the country. The government has said it is stepping up police presence across the country and preparing additional security measures as a precaution.

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back everyone. Kamala Harris' pick for Vice President is a hit with Democratic donors. The campaign says it has raised more than $20 million since she announced Tim Walz would be her running mate on Tuesday.
 
Walz is a two-term governor of Minnesota, a former teacher who served more than two decades in the Army National Guard. Harris and Walz are scheduled to visit several crucial swing states including Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada over the next few days. Well Donald Trump, in a fundraising email, claims Tim Walz would be
 
 the worst vice president in history, unleashing hell on earth. More now on the Republican attacks from CNN's Kristen Holmes. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump's team wasted no time trying to define Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. They are looking at his progressive record as governor and really trying to double down on it, to say that he is a radical liberal. Remember, that has been a main talking point about Vice President Kamala Harris, that she is far-left of President Joe Biden. And take a listen to this ad that they released just after Tim Walz was announced. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): Tim Walz will be a rubber stamp for Kamala's dangerously liberal agenda like allowing convicted felons to walk free, embracing anti-American Green New Deal policies, and giving up control of our southern border to criminal aliens and violent drug cartels. 
 
HOLMES: So clearly they are doubling down on this narrative. We saw Donald Trump himself posting that the two of them were the most radical duo in American history. You are going to continue hearing that narrative. But one thing that cannot be denied is what we saw in Philadelphia, which was a lot of energy, a lot of crowd cheering, a big crowd for the two of them, Harris and Walz, as they took the stage. That is going to be something that Donald Trump has to contend with. Remember, they had been planning on a race against President Joe Biden, even though they said they were prepared for anything to happen. 
 
Obviously, this has changed the dynamics moving forward. They are looking at new talking points, new rhetoric as they move forward and head towards November.

NASA has delayed the next SpaceX launch due to safety concerns over Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Issues were discovered with Starliner's propulsion system back in June. It's now been docked at the International Space Station seven weeks longer than planned, leaving its two crew members in limbo. The now-delayed SpaceX mission would have carried four astronauts to the station and could eventually serve as a backup vehicle for the Starliner's crew. NASA says mission managers will use the extra time figuring out how to get the ship and its crew back to Earth.
 
Still to come, Team USA celebrates more gold medal wins. We will have the latest highlights from Paris and what sprinter Gabby Thomas has to say about her first Olympic gold. Back in just a moment.

CHURCH: A new Olympic event is underway right now in Paris. The Mixed Marathon Race Walk Relay made its debut today with teams of one man and one woman competing in a 50-kilometer race. 
 
Checking in on the medal count, 24 of the American's 86 medals are gold, putting them in first place. They're followed by China with 22 gold and almost 60 medals in all. And Australia is in third place, having struck gold 14 times. Well done to all.
 
Well CNN's Amanda Davis is keeping track of all of this and she joins us now So, Amanda, take us through the highlights of Tuesday's events. 
 
AMANDA DAVIS, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, good morning, Rosemary. It was a great day 11 for Team USA and it has been a project six years in the making for Gabby Thomas, the 27-year-old from Atlanta who now lives in Austin, saying it is an unbelievable, indescribable feeling to claim Olympic gold, beating St. Lucia's 100m champion Julian Alfred in the final, to claim victory not only for Team USA, but to become the first, the only Harvard University graduate to win track and field gold at an Olympic Games.
 
It was watching Alison Felix in London in 2012 that inspired her. She won seven Olympic golds in her career, so still some way to go for Gabby, but she'll be hoping for more in the 4x100 relay, which is still to come. But if Gabby Thomas went into her final as the favorite, well, Cole Hawker's victory in the men's 1,500 was an entirely different story. 
 
This one had been billed as a race for the ages. The Olympic champion up against the world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, against Josh Kerr. But 23-year-old Hawker, who finished sixth in Tokyo, had very different ideas. It was an epic run from him. He stormed from fifth place to first over the last 300m to set a new Olympic record on the way to taking gold.
 <br>[03:40:06]
 
Ahead of Kerr in silver, with Team USA's Yared Ngozi in bronze, it's the first time in 112 years that two American men have medaled in this middle distance event. 
 
Elsewhere, the Emma Hayes era is well and truly in full swing with the U.S. women's national football team. She's only been in charge since the end of May, but has led the team to what is said to be an epic Olympic football final against Brazil. They produced a really hard- fought, extra-time victory over Germany. Sophia Smith, 95th-minute winner, making the difference to book their place in the gold medal match as they look for their first Olympic title since 2012.
 
But it is also set to be the legendary Marta's last-ever game for Brazil. This, her sixth Olympic Games, and she will be desperate to lead her country to what would be a first international crown. That final, taking place on Saturday. 
 
In terms of what else is going on here on day 12 of the Games, it's another brilliant day on the agenda. The USA's Katie Moon, the defending champion, heading into the women's pole vault. We're expecting a great battle between the USA's Quincy Hall and Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith, the former roommate of Noah Lyles, in the men's 400 meters. And the women's golf is underway at Le Golf National. Nelly Kvorder, the defending Olympic champion, but France's Celine Boutier carrying the hopes of the hosts. Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Amanda Davis joining us live from Paris.

Walz is known for coining the attack against Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, as weird.

GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: J.D. Vance literally, literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda. (BOOING)
 
WALZ: Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, J.D. studied at Yale -- 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WALZ: -- had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That's not what middle America is.

SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On issue after issue from opening the border to supporting higher grocery prices on American, she has bent the knee to the far left of the party and this decision, selecting Tim Walz, is another sign that she doesn't care what the American people think, she is only in this to obey the far-left radicals within her own party.
