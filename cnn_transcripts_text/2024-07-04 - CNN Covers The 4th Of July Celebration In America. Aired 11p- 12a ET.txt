SARA SIDNER, CNN HOST: And we have to remember, people love the 4th of July here. You've got Naval Base San Diego. You've got 48,000 sailors and personnel.
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: Yes.
 
SIDNER: And so, when they do this, they put on a great parade. All of the houses --
 
BLACKWELL: Oh, I was out this morning --
 
SIDNER: They decorate --
 
BLACKWELL: -- 7 a.m. I rented a bike here at the hotel, rode down --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
I know. You know, got up early, took a look and the chairs were out there ready for the parade. There was a road race today. I mean, they really -- there was bunting.
 
SIDNER: Bunting.
 
BLACKWELL: Bunting on houses for 4th of July. 
 
SIDNER: A lot of them. They really do it up here in San Diego.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
SIDNER: And we can't wait for you to see some of the performances. They're getting ready to launch this huge firework show.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
SIDNER: It took them four days to create this show, the Big Bay Boom. As you heard from Victor, it's another must-see moment on Independence Day.
 
BLACKWELL: We're also going to take you to the Las Vegas Strip. Things are going to light up really soon. We're bringing you a spectacular firework show, one after another, after another, right here on CNN. So, relax and enjoy. 
 
SIDNER: The Sphere. Grateful Dead, baby.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SIDNER: All right, six-time Grammy Award winner T-Pain performing for us now from Kansas City, Kansas presented by Social House Entertainment.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(T-PAIN PERFORMING "HEY BABY, DROP IT ON THE FLOOR," "SHOTS," "BUY U A DRANK")
 <br>[23:05:00]
 
(T-PAIN PERFORMING "GOT MONEY," "BLACK AND YELLOW," "CYCLONE")
 <br>[23:10:00]
 
(T-PAIN PERFORMING "CYCLONE")
 
SIDNER: Listen to that crowd. That was T-Pain, the one and only from Tallahassee, Florida. He was performing there at the Tacos and Tequila Festival in Kansas City. Do you know he was the first ever winner of the Masked Singer?
 
BLACKWELL: I'm not surprised. He has this amazing range.
 
SIDNER: He does.
 
BLACKWELL: People thought that he needed autotunes.
 
SIDNER: Nope.
 
BLACKWELL: He absolutely does not. And I know you all caught us dancing during that performance. I don't know how anybody stands still when he's performing in those songs, especially "Buy U a Drank." I mean, that just --
 
SIDNER: You can't -- you can't --
 
BLACKWELL: -- lends itself to a double.
 
SIDNER: Ah, ah, ah --
 
BLACKWELL: So, I mean this is the fun we're having.
 
SIDNER: What do you double up on?
 
BLACKWELL: I mean, I was talking about the move --
 
SIDNER: Oh.
 
BLACKWELL: -- but also, we could take a double shot of something as well. (LAUGHTER)
 
BLACKWELL: We still got the Chicago fireworks show that's going on. We have so many shows coming up. T-Pain just starting off the move toward the West. We are taking you to some places that we've not taken you before on this show, including 6,000 miles away to the fireworks show in Guam. It is going to be an amazing night.
 
SIDNER: Spectacular.
 
BLACKWELL: Getting closer to our big fireworks show here on the San Diego Bay, too. And we are counting down to an indie pop performance by Bleachers. Plus, Goo Goo Dolls will be on stage soon playing their hits, including "Iris." Do not go far. The party continues. It's all ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:15:50]
 
SIDNER: Howdy, Houston. It is the next stop on our Independence Day tour of fireworks. It's starting, you all. All right, we are watching the 4th in America on CNN. We're a part of it and you get to see it. And we have more terrific music for you as the skies are lighting up over Houston, Texas.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah, performing now is Bleachers, a band fronted by Jack Antonoff, who you may know from his work with Taylor Swift. They're performing at this beautiful outdoor Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado. Let's go there now.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(BLEACHERS PERFORMING "I WANNA GET BETTER")
 <br>[23:20:00]
 
(BLEACHERS PERFORMING "TINY MOVES," "ROLLERCOASTER")
 <br>[23:25:00]
 
(BLEACHERS PERFORMING "ROLLERCOASTER")
 
BLACKWELL: Look at that. I mean, it is, one, great music --
 
SIDNER: Yeah.
 
BLACKWELL: -- from Bleachers. But the amphitheatre there at Red Rock, beautiful, the lights on the sandstone, you've got 10,000 people, and those are the best concerts. When you go there, everybody is up on their feet singing along.
 
SIDNER: They know all the words.
 
BLACKWELL: They know all the words. It's fantastic. And Houston still has their show going on. SIDNER: Houston has got their show going on. You know, Red Rocks for me, it's almost a spiritual experience.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
SIDNER: It is so old and so beautiful and just -- it makes you, like, think. But I got to tell you, there was a story the other day, I think a couple days ago.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah.
 
SIDNER: People are claiming they saw UFOs.
 
BLACKWELL: Oh, come on.
 
SIDNER: I'm just saying.
 
BLACKWELL: Come on.
 
SIDNER: Over the stage, like, up above. People are, like, we saw something during a concert.
 
BLACKWELL: Well, there are fireworks tonight. So, you can't claim UFOs.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
If you see some lights in the sky, they're fireworks.
 
SIDNER: It's just fireworks. Don't call anybody. Don't call the FBI.
 
BLACKWELL: Houston has one of the biggest shows in the country. More than 1,200 pounds of fireworks that they're exploding tonight. And the show dedicated to the first responders who have taken care of the people in Houston. They've had some crazy weather recently, dangerous weather, and they are celebrating and honoring the people who've served them over the last year.
 
SIDNER: It's a beautiful thing. We need our first responders like nobody else. We do want to remind you, what you saw just a moment ago. You're looking at these gorgeous fireworks. You're going to see more fireworks from around the country and --
 
BLACKWELL: And --
 
SIDNER: -- in Guam.
 
BLACKWELL: In Guam, 6,000 miles away.
 
SIDNER: Never seen that before.
 
BLACKWELL: Alaska as well.
 
SIDNER: Love that.
 
BLACKWELL: And so, we're here under the canopy of what will be the biggest fireworks show on the West Coast. Now, as I said, the seawall is filling in, families are coming in here, but we're starting to see some of the tour boats, the larger boats come out on the water to be able to view it here from the bay as well. They're going to get a great show.
 
SIDNER: Gorgeous.
 
BLACKWELL: We should also mention Bleachers. Their album, "Bleachers," is out now and the band is currently on a world tour. So --
 
SIDNER: Catch it.
 
BLACKWELL: -- catch them when you can.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SIDNER: All right. Check out one of the newest landmarks in Las Vegas. This is so cool, the Sphere, as we get ready for fireworks to shine over that city. And Victor and I are ready to rock out, dance out, we've already started, when two legendary groups perform for us, REO Speedwagon and Goo Goo Dolls.
 <br>[23:30:04]
 
They're coming up on the 4th in America.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BLACKWELL: A gorgeous view here in San Diego. The West Coast's biggest fireworks show will start soon. It will be launched from four barges on the bay. It is going to be fantastic. It is one of the most technically-advanced fireworks shows in the country. Our big holiday celebration continues here on CNN with fireworks from St. Louis and some classic rock and roll.
 
SIDNER: All right, here is REO Speedwagon from Summerfest Festival in Milwaukee. Enjoy.

(REO SPEEDWAGON PLAYING "KEEP ON LOVING YOU")
 
SIDNER: I love to see these guys still rocking out. It gives me utter joy to see folks just going and going and going.
 
BLACKWELL: That song is almost 45 years old.
 
SIDNER: Shut your mouth. (LAUGHTER)
 
BLACKWELL: I mean --
 
SIDNER: That hurts my heart.
 
BLACKWELL: -- it's classic and beautiful.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
It still holds up.
 
SIDNER: It does. It holds the test of time.
 
BLACKWELL: It holds up.
 
SIDNER: And you can catch REO Speedwagon, they're co-headlining with Train this summer, and they're going to be back at their Las Vegas residency in October.
 
BLACKWELL: So, soon, we'll take you to Vegas, and you know how they do it.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
They do it big. They do it flashy. We'll bring you a spectacular firework show from the Strip, straight ahead of performance by singer and actor Ben Platt and Goo Goo Dolls. They perform their big hits. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[23:46:09]
 
SIDNER: All right, our director, Reza, is showing you this gorgeous skyline here in San Diego.
 
BLACKWELL: Wow.
 
SIDNER: Look at that fabulousness. You can't get that everywhere.
 
BLACKWELL: And we can hear the music that's coming out of that band shell there. There's a concert going over there. They were just singing "Night Shift." Listen, the stage is set.
 
SIDNER: It is set and it is going to be absolutely fabulous. The sky is drenched in red, white, and blue.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes.
 
SIDNER: All the sparkles because you know I love some sparkles.
 
BLACKWELL: I know you do.
 
(LAUGHTER) SIDNER: We're going to be bringing you 4th of July celebrations across the nation. Of course, the largest celebration here in the West Coast, right here in San Diego. It's big.
 
BLACKWELL: Now, before we get here, we've got something for you from New Orleans. The fireworks there up next, and singer and actor Ben Platt performs for us while on "The Honeymind Tour." He's appearing at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Virginia.

BEN PLATT, SINGER: How you doing, Wolf Trap?
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
It's great to see you.

(BEN PLATT PERFORMING "ALL AMERICAN QUEEN," "CHERRY ON TOP")
 <br>[23:55:00]
 
SIDNER: That is Ben Platt you're hearing there and you're seeing these gorgeous pictures from Fort Lauderdale as people are celebrating. Look at all those folks out there on the beach enjoying their lives. I love it. Look at America.
 
BLACKWELL: You know what? Last year, when I was doing this show, I was trying to describe the firework I love the most. I had to go look up the style. It's called a willow.
 
SIDNER: It -- so --
 
BLACKWELL: The one that pours over like that or brocade if you're going into the deep details.
 
SIDNER: Can't see.
 
BLACKWELL: Yeah. I just --
 
SIDNER: I'm good with the sparkly, right?
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
You want the willow.
 
BLACKWELL: I was -- I was looking at the fireworks and I was, like, I need to find out what the name of that is, so I sound like I actually prepared this year.
 
SIDNER: And you always do.
 
BLACKWELL: Thank you. Thank you. SIDNER: You always prepare. And you're looking nice --
 
BLACKWELL: Thank you.
 
SIDNER: -- very 4th of July, very Independence Day.
 
BLACKWELL: There's no such thing as two on the nose for the 4th.
 
SIDNER: Agree.
 
BLACKWELL: You wear the red, white, and the blue.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
SIDNER: We've got all of it. You've got all of it. All right, we're just minutes away from the main event here in San Diego, like literally minutes away. A big bay boom. You're about to see it all. We're saving some of the best fireworks for last and bringing you some epic music from the Goo Goo Dolls and the pop punk rock band Yellowcard. First, a very quick break. Don't go away.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SIDNER: We are live here in San Diego on this 4th in America. A magnificent night of fireworks and music.
 <br>[00:00:01]
 
It's time for the West Coast, though, to shine. I'm Sara Sidner alongside Victor Blackwell standing right here. It's going to happen right behind us.
