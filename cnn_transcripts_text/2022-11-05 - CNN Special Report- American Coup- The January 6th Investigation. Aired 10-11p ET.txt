UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The following is a CNN Special Report.
 
(VIDEO PLAYING)
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: What's the bottom line you want the American people to know?
 
REP. LIZ CHENEY (R) WYOMING: There was a very sophisticated multi-part plan overseen by Donald Trump.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob.
 
CHENEY: --to attempt to stay in power.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: As the longest, largest investigation into Donald Trump's attempt to stay president barrels toward conclusion, we put it all together.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, three man walking down a street were seen - were carrying AR15.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The explosive testimony.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CASSIDY HUTCHINSON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE: I never heard the president say something to the effect of I don't - I think that they have weapons, let my people in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: New insight from witnesses.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RUSTY BOWERS, SPEAKER, ARIZONA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I said you want me to take my state, 3.2 million voters, and just throw them out the window?
 
TAPPER: Was he asking you to commit a crime?
 
RICHARD DONOGHUE, FORMER ACTING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY: It gets back to the criminal intent issue. I don't know what he believed.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The unanswered questions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: I feel like we don't know the full story on the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: And, what might lie ahead.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL LUTTIG, RETIRED U.S. FEDERAL JUDGE: The former president and his allies represent a clear and present danger to American democracy, not because of what they did on January 6, is because of what they pledged to do in 2024.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: A CNN Special Report, "American Coup, the January 6 Investigation".
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I'm a very textural artist. I love a lot of texture.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: In Arizona, the Republican Speaker of the House, Rusty Bowers, is an artist by trade. But last February, Bowers was thrown into a real-life drama.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: The bill number was 2596.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: 2596, one of more than 100 bills submitted in Arizona to tighten access to the ballot box. The measure would have scrapped early voting. All voting would be on Election Day only. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: 90 percent of my district votes early.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: And, it would have mandated paper ballots. But, most egregious to Rusty Bowers was this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: With no guidance criteria, the legislature, after the election, could dismiss the election. And, I said welcome to fascism.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: HB2596 elections.
 
BOWERS: And so, I said, I will give this the respect it deserves.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Education.
 
BOWERS: So, I sent it to 12 Committees so we would have a long vetting process.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Military affairs.
 
BOWERS: Typical is one or two. If it was a controversial bill, you might send it to three. If it goes to four Committees, then you're getting the message.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Judiciary.
 
BOWERS: I assigned it to 12 Committees.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Transportation.
 
BOWERS: It was theatrical, and I admit it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: It's not an overstatement to say that because Bowers stood up for democracy he will not be in his state legislature next year.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I'm Rusty Bowers.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Term limited in the state House, he ran in the Republican primary for a state Senate seat.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I have stood up to the radicals and kept my conservative campaign promises. My opponent was David Farnsworth.
 
TRUMP: David Farnsworth is going to do the job.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Their positions on the major issues nearly identical, except for one.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I believe the election was stolen.
 
TAPPER: Farnsworth bought into Trump's election lies. Bowers did not.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Arizona voters have picked David Farnsworth over State House Speaker Rusty Bowers.
 
BOWERS: I lost big. It is very possible that the bill that I assigned liberally to my Committees will be back. The Possibility of that getting a governor signature would just be a disaster. I call it the possibility of going back into the dark ages in Arizona.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The United States is headed into the 2022 midterm elections with more at stake regarding American democracy perhaps than ever before. From Arizona to Pennsylvania to Georgia and all the so-called swing states, the former President, Donald Trump, is backing loyalists like David Farnsworth who not only support Trump's lies about election fraud in 2020, but often have expressed a willingness to undo any future results they don't like under the pretense of trumped-up fraud.
 
The House Select Committee on January 6 has been holding hearings and giving the world extended details on what the Committee says was a plot designed to keep Trump as president in 2020.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: What's the bottom line you want the American people to know from these hearings?
 <br>[22:05:00]
 
CHENEY: There are several things, but one is that there was a very sophisticated multi-part plan overseen by Donald Trump to attempt to overturn the election. No president in our history has ever done anything even close to that before.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Vice Chair Liz Cheney, one of just two Republicans on the Committee, has spent the last year bucking her party and helping investigate Donald Trump's sophisticated multi-part plan. The first piece the Committee focused on were the lies.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: In the lead up to the election, Donald Trump had been talking about the possibility of widespread voter fraud for months.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Voting by mail is wrought with fraud. People steal them out of mailboxes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Looking back, it's clear he was laying the groundwork for this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Trump may have been crying widespread fraud, but he had no proof. What the former president did have proof of, based on his own team's assessment of votes, was that he lost, a fact made clear by the January 6 Committee which exposed to the world that so many Trump aides, despite towing the Trump line in public,--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Are you expecting the president to concede?
 
MATT OCZKOWSKI, CAMPAIGN DATA EXPERT: Maria, that word is not even in our vocabulary right now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: --knew Trump was going to lose legitimately and that he did lose legitimately, admissions they were forced to make under oath.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JASON MILLER, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR: I was in the Oval Office, and at some point in the conversation, Matt Oczkowski, who was the lead data person, was brought on, and I remember he delivered to the president pretty blunt terms now that he was going to lose.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Trump campaign attorneys followed up on all of the fraud claims, and they quickly concluded that fraud did not take the election from Donald Trump, voters did. The news was told to Trump's Chief of Staff at the White House, Mark Meadows, in mid-to-late November.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX CANNON, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAWYER: I remember a call with Mr. Meadows, and I remember sharing with him that we weren't finding anything that would be sufficient to change the results in any of the key states.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: During a meeting several weeks later, the president got the same message from his White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, and another White House lawyer, Eric Herschmann.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEREK LYONS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE STAFF SECRETARY FOR TRUMP: Eric and Pat told the group, the president included, that none of those allegations had been substantiated to the point where they can be the basis for any litigation challenge to the election.
 
TRUMP: It is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge, lost.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: But, Donald Trump continued to refuse to publicly accept defeat.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: The evidence of the fraud is monumental and more is coming out.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Audacious claims of widespread fraud became a daily occurrence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Numerous times, we found glitches, and every single time, the glitch went 100 percent to Biden, and no percent to Trump.
 
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAWYER: The only thing left is the vote. That could have been Mickey Mouse. That could have been a dead person.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Standing near Giuliani is an Attorney named Sidney Powell, who became the face of one of the most notorious, and frankly, most deranged allies, that Dominion voting machines were flipping votes for Trump to Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNEY POWELL, U.S. ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: The Dominion voting systems were created in Venezuela, at the direction of Hugo Chavez, to make sure he never lost an election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: After she was sued by Dominion, Powell's attorney eventually conceded that Powell lied, saying that, "no reasonable person would conclude that her statements were truly statements of fact".
 
But, long before that happened, the president's Attorney General, Bill Barr, was investigating all of Trump's fraud claims.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILLIAM BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It was getting awkward because, obviously, he had lost the election, and -
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Barr said he made it clear to Donald Trump at a November 23 meeting that he had lost,--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARR: Our role is to investigate fraud and it's just not meritorious. They're not panning out.
 
MIKE LINDELL, CEO, MY PILLOW INC.: He was going to win in spite of all the fraud.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: --but spurred on by the most ardent election liars, including many in MAGA media.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PETER NAVARRO, ASST TO PRES FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: Clearly, the president won this election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Donald Trump would not listen to reason or fact.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARTIROMO: Where is the DoJ and the FBI and all of this, Mr. President?
 
TRUMP: Missing in action.
 
BARR: This got under my skin, but I also felt it was time for me to say something. So, I set up a lunch with the AP reporter, Mike Balsamo, and I told him that, to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[22:10:00]
 
TAPPER: A heated Trump-Barr meeting followed, and Barr got another opportunity to debunk the lies. Among the claims he focused on were the ones about Dominion voting machines.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: With the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden.
 
BARR: I told him that the stuff that his people were shoveling out to the public was bullshit. I specifically raised the Dominion voting machines. I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations, but they were made in such a sensational way that they obviously were influencing a lot of people.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Before the end of December, Barr had quit, his replacement, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who came with a blunt yet low key acting Deputy Attorney General named Richard Donoghue. Like Barr, Rosen and Donohue took seriously and thoroughly investigated each of the fraud claims coming from then President Trump. In late December, Donohue spoke with the president and told him the truth about numerous false claims, including one involving Dominion machines in northern Michigan.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONOGHUE: There you had supposedly a cyber-expert group issued a report that said there was a 68 percent error rate. It was not a 68 percent error rate. In fact, it was a, I think, a point 0.006 percent error rate.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Donoghue also debunked fraud claims Trump made about the vote counting down at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: I don't run to see if people are walking in with suitcases and putting them under a table with a black robe around it.
 
DONOGHUE: There were allegations about suitcases of fraudulent ballots being smuggled into the facility,--
 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now, they're going to start pulling these ballots out from under this table.
 
DONOGHUE: --ballots being run through multiple times. The U.S. Attorney there looked at it, found that none of those allegations were true.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Donoghue's boss, Jeff Rosen, then forwarded an email from the White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, asking the Department of Justice to look into the possibility that Italian satellites were changing votes from Trump to Biden.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRADLEY JOHNSON, CIA CHIEF OF STATION (RET.): They sent these new numbers back up through this Military satellite, a tiny Military satellite.
 
DONOGHUE: I was skeptical, to say the least. We very quickly determined that that was not a well-founded allegation, and we told the Chief of Staff and others as well.
 
JOHNSON: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, I mean, what's going on over there? What were these--
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The nation's top law enforcement officials were investigating and finding nothing substantive. And then, the courts, the usual venue for claims about voting misconduct, the president's team lost over and over again.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Courts again shutting down more desperate attempts to overturn an election.
 
TAPPER: You were on George W. Bush's shortlist for the Supreme Court. You're not some raging liberal. Is that fair?
 
BARR: Totally fair.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Michael Luttig is a highly respected conservative retired Federal Court Judge. Luttig did not hear any of the Trump fraud cases. But, he and his colleagues did analyze more than 60 of them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LUTTIG: We reviewed each individual claim and decided that there was nothing that would have changed the result in a single precinct, let alone a single state, let alone nationally.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Ahead--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: You're asking me to do something that's against my oath, and I'm not going to do that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Donald Trump puts the squeeze on State House leaders across the country.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: It's going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[22:15:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BOWERS: We're in my office. This the Speaker's office.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: It's not every day a State House politician gets a call from a U.S. President. But, that's what happened to Arizona Speaker, Republican Rusty Bowers, after the 2020 election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I came home from church. My wife and I were sitting in the driveway.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The White House popped up on his screen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: So, I take the call, and Donetta steps out and goes in the house. I sat there in my little Prius and had a chat with the president with bad phone reception, and backed out in front of the house where I get better reception.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Rudy Giuliani was on the line too, and Bower says it was Giuliani who began making crazy claims about voter fraud in Arizona.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I can't give you those exact numbers, but I'll throw out numbers, but they're kind of the audacious numbers, like, 200,000 illegal aliens voted, 6,000 Military ballots were stolen and used.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Bower says Giuliani wanted him to hold an official Arizona House hearing to air these claims publicly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: And then, I said, - but what's the whole purpose of this? What are you trying to achieve? And, they said, well, we've heard that there is an arcane law in Arizona that if you have sufficient cause that you can throw out the Biden electors and put in Trump electors, and I said, that's a new one to me. I have never, ever heard of that. And so, now, you're asking me to do something that's against my oath, and I'm not going to do that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: But, Bower says he told Giuliani he had good lawyers and would be happy to put the former mayor in touch with them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: I don't do anything of this magnitude without having strong legal counsel and proof. And, the president said, Rudy, you got the proof, and he said, yes, I got the proof. I said, I want the proof. I didn't get it when he said he'd do it. He never called my attorneys.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: But, the asks did not stop with Giuliani. Bowers would later get a call from another Trump Attorney, John Eastman,--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN EASTMAN, TRUMP ATTORNEY: We know there was fraud.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: --whom the January 6 Committee sees as a key player in this grand plan to undo the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: The ask was kind of that we would throw out the electors, and I said, has it ever been done? He said no. I said, you want me to take my state, 3.2 million voters, and just throw them out the window, because I want to and that's responsible on my part? I said, OK, thank you. We're not doing that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Bowers kept his caucus on the sidelines. But, in the Arizona Senate, Republicans there yielded to pressure from Team Trump and voted to conduct an audit of the results in Arizona's largest county.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: When they got the Cyber Ninjas, I thought I'll watch. This will be interesting. I don't want to be close to that.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: You might remember the Ninjas, the company was run by a Trump supporter. They employed ultraviolet lights which could supposedly identify ballots from China.
 <br>[22:20:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOWERS: That came out that Mr. Biden won by a larger margin than previously and Mr. Trump lost a number of votes.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Bowers and his colleagues in Arizona were not the only state officials to feel the heat from Trump and/or Giuliani. Material discovered by the January 6 Committee showed it happened over and over across the swing states that Biden won.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIULIANI: Mr. Speaker, this is Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: In Pennsylvania, Bower's counterpart, Republican House Speaker Bryan Cutler, got the calls.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENNA ELLIS, TRUMP LAWYER: Hello, Mr. Speaker. This is Jenna Ellis, and I'm here with Mayor Giuliani.
 
GIULIANI: Hey, Bryan. It's Rudy. I really have something important to call your attention that I think really changes things.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The January 6 Committee says Cutler thought the calls were inappropriate and had his lawyers tell Giuliani to stop them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIULIANI: I understand that you don't want to talk to me now. I just want to bring some facts to your attention.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: And then, there was Georgia where the Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, got an hour-long call from President Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election and it's not fair to take it away from us like this.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING: Trump probably put more pressure on Brad Raffensperger than anyone else. It was immense.
 
TRUMP: All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 loads.
 
COLLINS: And, I think it's the phone call that everyone remembers, that was later leaked, where he in turn braided Brad Raffensperger.
 
TRUMP: They're going around, playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad.
 
COLLINS: He praised him. He seemed to try to charm him, at times, and even indicated that if he did not act that there could be criminal liability for those actions.
 
TRUMP: You're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: And, it was not just pressure. There were threats, usually from Trump supporters who felt empowered or incited by him. Take for instance the two men in this Hummer with a QAnon decal. Prosecutors say they drove the vehicle filled with automatic weapons and ammunition from Virginia to the Philadelphia Convention Center in early November 2020 where votes were still being counted. At the time, Al Schmidt was the Republican responsible for overseeing the vote count in Philadelphia. He received threats aimed at his family.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AL SCHMIDT, FORMER REPUBLICAN COMMISSIONER FOR THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA: Tell the truth or your three kids will be fatally shot - included our address, included my children's names, included a picture of our home.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: And, the Republican House Speaker in that state had protesters show up at his home.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRYAN CUTLER (R), PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE SPEAKER: There were multiple protests, at least three, outside either my district office or my home. My then 15-year-old son was home by himself for the first one.
 
BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: We have now counted -
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger's wife received disturbing messages.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAFFENSPERGER: People started threatening her, sending her sexualized text, those kinds of intimidations. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you swear--
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Georgia election worker Shaye Moss testified before the House Select Committee about threats she received via Facebook Messenger.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHAYE MOSS, GEORGIA ELECTION WORKER: A lot of threats, wishing death upon me, telling me that I'll be in jail with my mother.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: These threats happened after Rudy Giuliani spread lies about her and her mother Ruby Freeman, who was counting votes with Moss at State Farm Arena in Atlanta on election night.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GIULIANI: A tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shaye Freeman Moss, and one of the gentlemen quite obviously surreptitiously passing around USB ports as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine. I mean, it's obvious to anyone who is a criminal investigator or prosecutor they are engaged in surreptitious illegal activity.
 
REP. ADAN SCHIFF, MEMBER, JAN. 6 SELECT COMMITTEE: What was your mom Mactually handed you on that video?
 
MOSS: A ginger mint. It has turned my life upside down. I don't want anyone knowing my name. I don't want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. I haven't been anywhere at all. I've gained about 60 pounds. It's affected my life in a major way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the only Republican on the January 6 Committee other than Liz Cheney, says all the threats are part of Trump's plan.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. ADAM KINZINGER, MEMBER, JAN. 6 SELECT COMMITTEE: I don't think you can look at the words and actions of Donald Trump and think that he wanted anything except the explosion of these threats to people. He could stop that in a second, if he wanted to, but he likes it.
 <br>[22:25:00]
 
There are a lot of members of Congress that I think voted against impeachment, because they were scared for their family and for themselves. What does that mean? It means threats of violence worked.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Up next,--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They suggested that he use the apparatus of government to seize voting machines.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
TAPPER: After six weeks of lies and pressure from the President of the United States,--
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take a moment to mark your ballots.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: --on December 14, 2020, all 50 U.S. States formally certified their results as their citizens had voted,--
 <br>[22:30:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAGGIE HABERMAN, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES: The resolution is unanimously adopted.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: --and that, according to the January 6 Committee, is what led to a boisterous White House meeting where the former president considered horrifying action.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HABERMAN: On December 18, three people, one of them, Trump's former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, his lawyer, Sidney Powell, and Patrick Byrne, the Founder of Overstock.com, were let into the White House by an aide to Peter Navarro, another Trump advisor, Trump saw them, called them into the Oval Office, and they start arguing the case where everyone else is failing Trump and that Trump can take aggressive actions to keep himself in power and to try to impact the results of an election that he had already lost. They suggested that he use the apparatus of government to seize voting machines.
 
Now, as this meeting is taking place, another lawyer in the White House, Eric Herschmann, figures out what's happening, calls in the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Mark Meadows ends up joining at some point, Derek Lyons, then the Staff Secretary, on his last day at work, joins, Rudy Giuliani gets called in, and this goes on four hours.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How much time did you have alone with the president? And, I say alone, you had other people with you, but before the crowds came running?
 
SIDNEY POWELL, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ATTORNEY: Probably no more than 10 or 15 minutes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was in that--
 
POWELL: I bet Pat Cipollone set a new land speed record.
 
PAT CIPOLLONE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: I opened the door and I walked in, I saw General Flynn. I saw Sidney Powell sitting there. I was not happy to see the people who were in the Oval Office.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Explain why.
 
CIPOLLONE: I don't think any of these people were providing the president with good advice.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The team had arrived with a draft executive order, that hat it been signed by Donald Trump, would have immediately ordered the Secretary of Defense to seize, collect, retain and analyze ballot boxes, and it would have created "a special counsel to oversee the operation and institute all criminal and civil proceedings as appropriate".
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: This is a draft of the executive order that would have allowed Trump to cease voting machines. What was your reaction when you heard about this?
 
CHENEY: I think most Americans could never imagine those things would happen here. And, that order and many of the other things that we've learned through our hearings, have been really stunning to me, because repeatedly I found myself in a situation thinking, oh, my gosh, how could this happen here? And, we really thought it couldn't. But, it's just continued to emphasize for all of us that our institutions are fragile.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The appointment of the special counsel was not hypothetical. Trump wanted Sidney Powell, a prominent peddler of election lies, in the spot.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POWELL: He asked Pat Cipollone if he had the authority to name me special counsel, and he said yes. And then he asked him if he had the authority to give me whatever security clearance I needed, and Pat Cipollone said yes, and then the president said, OK, you know, I'm naming her that and I'm giving her a security clearance. And then, shortly before we left, he said to Cipollone and/or Herschmann, and whoever the other young man was, he said, you can name her whatever you want to name her and no one is going to pay any attention to it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How did he respond? How did the president respond to that?
 
POWELL: Something like, "You see what I deal with. I deal with this all the time".
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The meeting was extremely heated, but Cipollone arguing against the special counsel idea and against seizure of voting machines.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CIPOLLONE: To have the federal government seize voting machines, that's a terrible idea for the country. That's not how we do things in the United States. There is no legal authority to do that. I remember the three of them were really sort of forcefully attacking me it verbally. Eric, Derek, and we were pushing back and we were asking one simple question. As a general matter, where is the evidence?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What response did you get?
 
CIPOLLONE: A variety of responses, like, what do you mean where is the evidence? You should know.
 
LYONS: There was a discussion of, well, we don't have it now but we will have it or whatever.
 
ERIC HERSCHMANN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: Derek and I both challenged what she was saying. And, she says, well, the judges are corrupt. And, I was like, every one? Every single case that you've done in the country you guys lost, every one of them is corrupt? Even the ones we appointed? And,--
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's--
 
HERSCHMANN: I am being nice. I was much more harsh to her.

TAPPER: The meeting very nearly devolved into a physical fight.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
HERSCHMANN: Flynn screamed at me that I was a quitter and everything, kept on standing up and turning around and screaming at me. And, at a certain point I had it with him. So, I yelled back, either come over or sit your f'ing ass back down.
 
GIULIANI: I'm going to categorically describe it as you guys are not tough enough. Or, maybe I put it another way, you're a bunch of pluses (ph). Excuse the expression, but that I - I am almost certain the word was used. POWELL: I mean, if it had been me sitting in his chair, I would have fired all of them that night and have them escorted out of the building.

TAPPER: The January 6 Committee discovered text messages sent during and following the meeting by Cassidy Hutchinson, the assistant to Mark Meadows, who testified live before the Committee hearing in June, describing the meeting as unhinged. She also snapped this photograph of Mark Meadows escorting Rudy Giuliani from the White House to make sure he did not get back into the mansion.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: You tweeted, "somehow the Committee testimony featured live "underplayed". How crazy that December 18 meeting was? How was it underplayed?
 
HABERMAN: Because Donald Trump faded into the background, as this was all being described. One of the ways in which Donald Trump has escaped a lot of accountability over time is he gets people fighting with each other, and that's what people focus on. He considered extreme really unprecedented actions. No, he didn't take them, but he was unwilling to foreclose options until the last possible second, no matter how extreme and potentially dangerous they were.
 
TAPPER: I remember talking to you after that meeting, and you were shaking.
 
HABERMAN: I was. And, it was - frankly, it took a little bit to process exactly what had happened. But, I remember getting a text from a senior Republican Senate advisor asking me if there was going to be an issue in terms of a peaceful transfer of power after this. And, I said, yes, there is a legitimate issue here. And, I think that was a real neon warning sign.
 
TAPPER: It was floated, this idea, by retired General Michael Flynn, in the Oval Office, that Donald Trump should cease voting machines and ballot boxes from these states that Joe Biden won. What was your reaction when you heard that?
 
LUTTIG: I said to my wife, this is beyond all comprehension. I never utter a word like this. But, that, in particular, sounded in a banana republic to me. Had that happened, we would have been in a situation where literally we're in a constitutional crisis, because nothing in our Constitution gives you the answer.

TAPPER: At the end of the evening, no seizure orders were issued. The president decided to go in a different direction. He would take it in a tweet.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: What he wanted was to show everyone who was telling him he lost the election and the people agreed with him.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The tweet and the violence that followed, ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
TAPPER: Hours before sunrise, on December 19, 2020, after a long, loud, disturbing White House meeting about seizing voting machines, President Trump sent a tweet that would change history. "Big protest in D.C. on January 6", it read, "Be there, will be wild".
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: What he wanted was to show these lawmakers, not just in Washington but everyone who is telling him he lost the election, he wanted to show them that people agreed with him and people backed his lies about the election.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Donald Trump was summoning his true believers to Washington, D.C., and evidence pieced together by the January 6 Committee shows they heard that call and began planning immediately.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D) MARYLAND: "Women for America First", a pro-Trump organizing group, had previously applied for rally permit for January 22 and 23 in Washington, D.C. But, in the hours after the tweet, they moved their permit to January 6.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The next day, Ali Alexander, a Trump supporter and leader of the group "Stop the Steal", created a website to share and promote logistics about the rally.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: It included event times, places, speakers, and details on transportation to Washington, D.C.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Far-right personalities, such as Conspiracy Theorist Alex Jones, almost immediately began spreading the word on their platforms.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALEX JONES, CONSPIRACY THEORIST: One of the most historic events in American history has just taken place. President Trump wants the American people to march on Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021. The time for games is over. The time for action is now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: As word spread, it became clear that Trump faithful who planned to attend were also planning for the possibility of violence.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MATT BRACKEN, RIGHT-WING COMMENTATOR: We know the rules of engagement. If you have enough people, you can push down any kind of offense or a wall.
 <br>[22:45:00]
 
SALTY CRACKER, PRO-TRUMP YOUTIBER: You better understand some sun, you better understand something. Red wave, bitch. This is going to be a Red Wedding going down January 6.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The term Red Wedding comes from the Game of Thrones TV series. It means a massacre.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CRACKER: January 6, kick that fucking door open, look down the street. There is going to be a million plus geeked up armed Americans.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Some of Trump's Twitter followers did consider his tweets to be orders. That's according to a former Twitter employee whose identity was hidden while testifying to the Committee.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It felt as if a mob was being organized, and they were gathering together their weaponry and their logic and their reasoning behind why they were prepared to fight.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Members of the Committee say they were finding similar types of chatter across social media platforms.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: Well, calling all patriots, be in Washington, D.C. January 6, this wasn't organized by any group. DJT has invited us, and it's going to be wild. Some of the online rhetoric turned to openly homicidal and white nationalist, such as, "Why don't we just kill them every last Democrat, down to the last man, woman, and child? And, it's time for the day of the rope. White revolution is the only solution."
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: The Donald.win, an openly racist and anti-semitic site, became a venue for those considering violence to exchange ideas.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: On that site, many shared plans and violent threats. "Bring handcuffs and wait near the tunnels", wrote one user, a commenter replied suggesting zip ties instead. One post encouraged others to come with body armor, knuckles, shields, bats, pepper spray, whatever it takes. All of those were used on the sixth. The post concluded, "Join your local Proud Boys chapter as well."
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: According to the Committee, the Proud Boys, a far right militia, was active during this time, preparing for January 6.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: The Proud Boys launched an encrypted chat called the "Ministry Of Self Defense". The Committee obtained hundreds of these messages which show strategic and tactical planning about January 6, including maps of Washington, D.C., that pinpoint the location of Police.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Even more alarming, some of the people making plans in the Proud Boys and in the Oath Keepers, another right way militia, had direct ties to people close to Donald Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: One such ally was Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Trump's former National Security Advisor. This photo from December 12 shows Flynn and Patrick Byrne, another Trump ally, guarded by indicted Oath Keeper Roberto Minuta. Another view of the scene shows Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes in the picture as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Both Minuta and Rhodes had been charged with seditious conspiracy, conspiring to use force against the federal government. They have pleaded not guilty. Rhodes' trial got underway in early October. He is being tried with four associates. More than a dozen Oath Keepers and Proud Boys had been charged with seditious conspiracy. According to the Committee, longtime Trump ally, Roger Stone, had ties to these groups.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: In the same timeframe, Stone communicated with both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers regularly. The Committee obtained encrypted content from a group chat called "Friends Of Stone" (FOS), which included Stone, Rhodes, Tarrio, and Ali Alexander.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Tarrio is Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RASKIN: The chat focused on various pro-Trump events in November and December of 2020, as well as January 6. On January 6, Stone was guarded by two Oath Keepers who have since been criminally indicted for seditious conspiracy. One of them later pleaded guilty, and according to the Department of Justice, admitted that the Oath Keepers were ready to use "lethal force, if necessary, against anyone who tried to remove President Trump from the White House, including the National Guard".
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Members of the Committee say Roger Stones' connection to the Proud Boys goes back years and showed him taking the oath required for the first level of initiation into the group.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROGER STONE, LONGTIME TRUMP ALLY: Hi. I am Roger Stone. I'm a Western chauvinist, and I refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: There are some missing pieces in the public record, such as, what if anything did Donald Trump or anyone inside the White House know about the organizing by the far-right militias?
 <br>[22:50:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHENEY: The night before January 6, President Trump instructed his Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, to contact both Roger Stone and Michael Flynn regarding what would play out the next day.
 
Ms. Hutchinson, is it your understanding that Mr. Meadows called Mr. Stone on the fifth?
 
HUTCHINSON: I'm under the impression that Mr. Meadows did complete both the call to Mr. Stone and General Flynn the evening of the fifth.
 
CHENEY: And, do you know what they talked about that evening, Ms. Hutchinson?
 
HUTCHINSON: I'm not sure.
 
TAPPER: I feel like we don't know the full story on the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.
 
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: I think that the Committee is trying to get to the bottom of what White House officials might have coordinated with or spoken to Proud Boys. So, what did those relationships look like? What were the lines of communication? And, why were they talking? KINZINGER: There is stuff we know. We've put some of it out. There is more depth that we'll be putting out probably within the report or maybe in the next hearings. And, I think what's important is that he was going through the process of selling that the election was stolen. And then, in convincing folks that, look, if you believe that election was stolen from you, violence is the only answer, quite honestly. I mean, that's kind of the American tradition. If you truly believe that the Constitution is being disobeyed, every American would actually be on the Capitol.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Up next, Donald Trump puts the squeeze on justice.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONOGHUE: Him telling us that we should say publicly that it was corrupt, that concern me.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: You're obviously well aware of what Donald Trump was doing in terms of his election fraud claims. Did you have any apprehension of becoming Deputy Attorney General?
 
DONOGHUE: No. I didn't have any concerns about that. I had a great deal of confidence in the team. I want to be part of the team. You want to be there when it matters.
 
TRUMP: You can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob, can't accept.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: After Attorney General Bill Barr resigned, Richard Donoghue was appointed to the number two position in the Department of Justice, the deputy to Jeffrey Rosen, the new acting Attorney General. The two men inherited a department under constant and public attack by the sitting President of the United States, fighting to hold on to an election he falsely claimed had been stolen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: Trump thought the Justice Department was an arm of his presidency and a way for him to tell them what to do and they should do his bidding and what he wanted.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: As the new targets of Trump's ire, Rosen and Donoghue fielded near daily complaints from Donald Trump.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEFFREY ROSEN, FORMER U.S. ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: Between December 23 and January 3, the president either called me or met with me virtually every day. The common element of all of this was the president expressing his dissatisfaction that the Justice Department, in his view, had not done enough to investigate election fraud.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: But, they were investigating. The Department of Justice has been debunking Trump's wild election fraud lies one by one, but President Trump chose to not listen. On a December 27 phone call with Rosen and Donoghue, President Trump said the department had an obligation to "tell people that this was an illegal corrupt election", despite no evidence of widespread fraud.
 
Trump also pressed them to publicly, "just say the election was corrupt, and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressman".
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONOGHUE: That was an exact quote from the President. He indicated that he had some political avenue he want to pursue with the Congress. But, by him telling us that we should say publicly that it was corrupt, that concerned me.
 
KINZINGER: What he intended was for the Department of Justice to say we have indications that there was corruption, because from there, you can take that seed of doubt, and Donald Trump and Republican members of Congress can water it. They can grow that doubt. And then, through there, you could do things like get people to vote against certification on January 6.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: As long as Rosen and Donoghue were in charge, they told the president they would not publicly back his false election fraud claims. So, Trump had to find someone who would help him do what he wanted to steal the election.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONOGHUE: Jeff Clark's name had come up on December 27 in the phone call with the president. He brought it up and said, look, people are telling me I should change the leadership. People are telling me that you too were not doing your job. I hear Jeff Clark is great. People tell me he could get in there and do something. And, it was surprising to me.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Surprising because the president would have no reason to even know who Jeffrey Clark was.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR KUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Even within the department, very few people had really heard of Jeffrey Clark.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: But, Donald Trump had. Unbeknownst to Rosen and Donoghue, Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Scott Perry had brought Clark to the Oval Office to meet with President Trump on December 22, the day after Perry had been amongst Republican members of Congress who joined Trump at the White House to discuss overturning the 2020 election. Trump also mentioned Jeff Clark on a separate call with Rosen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONOGHUE: He made, what I regarded as a peculiar reference, I don't remember the exact quote, but it was something about did I know Jeff Clark or did I know who he was or something like that. I was quizzical as to how does the president even know Mr. Clark?
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TAPPER: Rosen confronted Clark, who admitted he had broken the long- standing policy governing communication between the Justice Department and the White House. White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin also intervened and warned Clark to not communicate with the White House. Clark agreed, but just two days later escalated the situation with an email that set off a series of events that would rock the Justice Department.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONOGHUE: We came in on Monday, December 28, hectic day, as they all were, and then in the afternoon, we got that email, which I had to sit down and read more than once to make sure I understood what he was proposing.
 
TAPPER: What was he proposing?
 
DONOGHUE: He was proposing sending out a letter signed by the three of us, the acting Attorney General, myself, and Jeff Clark, to Georgia.
