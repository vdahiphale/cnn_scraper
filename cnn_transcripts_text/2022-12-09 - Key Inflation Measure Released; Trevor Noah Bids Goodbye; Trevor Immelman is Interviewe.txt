SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Look, we have these checks and balances for a reason throughout our system. Sonia Sotomayor said the same thing. You saw Justice Roberts asking questions, well, at an extreme, what would this mean? You know, and here's me talking now, could any state legislature do whatever they want when it comes to elections and there would be no review by the state supreme court? That's why this is so important. 
 
We await their decision. I'm pretty good at predicting things. I predict people may be surprised in a good way by the outcome of this. 
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Yes. We've got to wait a few months to find out. 
 
KLOBUCHAR: Yes.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Yes. 
 
But can you just distill the implication, if it's not the surprising decision, if it is where the state legislatures can do this?
 
KLOBUCHAR: Yes. If it goes their way, if it goes the way of the North Carolina state legislature, it would mean that perhaps electors could be appointed that aren't even consistent with where the - with where the people are. It would mean that election laws of any kind could be passed. This is a gerrymandered map that's at stake here but that the state supreme court said was unconstitutional under their laws. It could mean other election laws that the state legislature could just do what they want. It might mean if - an extreme where you don't even have to respect the governor's veto. That's why this is so crazy. 
 
We have a system of checks and balances in this country. 
 
HARLOW: For now. 
 
KLOBUCHAR: Right now my view is, for the most part, the Supreme Court has been making decisions that I don't agree with. And the whole idea is the check is supposed to be the Congress and the president. And so the point of this is, this one, though, given what I was watching of their questions, this one might surprise you. 
 
HARLOW: OK. Come back in June, OK? KLOBUCHAR: I promise.
 
HARLOW: We'll see what they -
 
KLOBUCHAR: If I am wrong, I will come back and say I'm wrong. If I'm right you'll say, you protected - you -- I predicted the Affordable Care Act being upheld, the only one in our caucus.
 
HARLOW: There you go.
 
KLOBUCHAR: And I'm predicting an interesting outcome on this. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, if you change your party affiliation, let us know. 
 
KLOBUCHAR: OK, I -- I know where to go, but that is not happening. But I - again, I think it's really important for people to understand, Senator Sinema has been an independent for all intents and purposes, and I think in a very good interview with Jake Tapper on your network she explained it. 
 
COLLINS: Does it give Manchin more sway, though? 
 
KLOBUCHAR: I think that every senator has sway when you have 50, 51, right? We all need to be a team on some votes. And then some, where people are different, you make an agreement, you change a piece of legislation, that's still going to be going on. Senator Manchin will still have power but so does every single senator. And you would be surprised at things that go back and forth based on other people. They're just maybe not as public. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, some wield it differently than others.
 
HARLOW: Yes, for sure.
 
COLLINS: Senator, thank you so much for joining us on set. 
 
HARLOW: Thank you, Senator.
 
KLOBUCHAR: OK. Thank you. 
 
HARLOW: Have a good weekend. 
 
COLLINS: All right, just in this morning, a key inflation report on the state of the economy. We'll tell you what it shows and what it means for you. That's next. 
 
HARLOW: And, you'll want to see this, Trevor Noah's emotional goodbye as he ends his run on "The Daily Show." 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:37:01]
 
COLLINS: All right, we are live in Washington this morning. And just in, the Labor Department has released a key measure of inflation. So here to break down the numbers is CNN's chief business correspondent Christine Romans. 
 
Christine, what are you seeing in these numbers and what should people know about them?
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
 
This is factory level inflation. So, before it gets to the store, this is what producers are paying, the prices they're paying. Still stubbornly high. What I see here, Kaitlan and Poppy, is why the Fed has been raising interest rates so aggressively for so long. And 7.4 percent is the annual growth in prices for producer level prices and month to month up 0.3 percent. That second number there is hotter than many economists had hoped to see. 
 
When you look at a chart, you can see that peeking that we've been talking about for inflation. This is off of the 8 percent that you saw - last reading we had on this. But still, guys, it's too high. I'm watching futures tumble here right now. Stock index futures. That's because Wall Street is saying, wow, all this medicine from the Fed and these prices are still stubbornly high, you guys. 
 
HARLOW: But what else can they do? 
 
ROMANS: Keep raising interest rates. Next week the Fed is going to raise interest rates we think again by 50 basis points. Not quite as much as it had in the prior four meetings. But the Fed is still in the midst of its inflation fighting mission here. So, more interest rates are coming. That raises borrowing costs for all of you as the Fed tries to slow demand and choke off this inflation. 
 
COLLINS:  Yes, talk about a challenge for Jay Powell. 
 
ROMANS: Yes.
 
COLLINS: Christine Romans, thanks so much for that update. 
 
ROMANS: Yes.
 
COLLINS: Trevor Noah - you -- this video is amazing. He made a tearful good-bye to "The Daily Show." And he talked the most important women in his life, and he talked about why their perspective was so important and the difference that it made in his show. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREVOR NOAH, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW WITH TREVOR NOAH": If you truly want to learn about America, talk to black women. Yes. Because, unlike everybody else, black women can't afford to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) around and find out.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:43:03]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREVOR NOAH, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW WITH TREVOR NOAH": Honestly, most importantly, I'm grateful to you. (INAUDIBLE). 
 
I don't take it for granted ever. Every seat that has ever been filled to watch something that I'm doing, I always appreciate, because I know the empty seat that sits behind it. So, thank you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: Wow. After seven years hosting "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central, Trevor Noah bid an emotional farewell last night, thanking his fans for making it all possible and then this, honoring the black women in his life who shaped who he is today. 
 
Watch.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREVOR NOAH, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW WITH TREVOR NOAH": I've often been credit with, you know, having these grand ideas. And people are like, oh, Trevor, you're so smart. And so I look at them and I'm like, who do you think teaches me, you know, who do you think has shaped me, nourished me and formed me, you know, from my mom, my grand, all my aunts, all these black women in my life. But then, in America as well, if you -- I always tell people, if you truly want to learn about America, talk to black women. Yes. Because unlike everybody else, black women can't afford to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) around and find out. Black people understand how hard it is when things go bad, especially in America. But anyplace where black people exist, whether it's Brazil, whether it's South Africa, wherever it is, when things go bad, black people know that it gets worse for them. But black women in particular, they know what shit is. Genuinely. People always be shocked. They'd be like, why do black women turn out the way they do in America, why do they vote the way - yes, because they know what happens if things do not go the way it should. They can't afford to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) around and find out. 
 
Do yourself a favor, if you truly want to know what to do or how to do it or maybe the best way or the most - the most equitable way, talk to black women. They are - they're a lot of the reason that I'm here. 
 <br>[08:45:00]
 
And so I'm grateful to them. I'm grateful to every single one of you. This has been an honor. Thank you.

HARLOW: How beautiful, how real was that. 
 
Joining us now, CNN senior entertainment reporter, our friend, Lisa France. 
 
Lisa, wow.
 
LISA FRANCE, CNN SENIOR ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Good morning.
 
Speaking for black women.
 
HARLOW: Good morning.
 
FRANCE: Thank you, Trevor Noah. I mean it was peak Trevor Noah last night. He called it a wild ride, but it was poignant, it was cheeky, it was funny and it was just what we needed. I thought it was one of the best endings for a late-night show host I've ever seen before. He really spoke from the heart. And people responded to it. All over Twitter there's just been tons of praise for Trevor Noah, and already people are missing him. 
 
COLLINS: Yes, it's hard to replace him, I feel like. He's been this iconic voice for so long. And it's hard to stand out. You know, there are so many voices like that. So, you know, talking about real issues but with such a sense of wit and humor. And it's kind of hard to think about what it's going to be like in the evenings without his voice. 
 
FRANCE: Absolutely. And you know what's funny is that when he first got the job seven years ago, he was barely known. He had only been a correspondent on the show for a couple months. So people who - kind of felt like, ooh, how is this even going to work? And now we can't imagine the show without him. 
 
I interviewed some of the correspondents a couple weeks ago when the show was here in Atlanta, and Roy Wood Jr. said one of the things that he loved about Trevor was after Trevor announced that he was going to be leaving, he said, let's focus on the work. He's always been about making the best show possible. And he's really, really going to be missed. 
 
COLLINS: Yes. I can't wait to see Wanda Sykes guest host, though. She's -
 
HARLOW: Oh, is that right, she is? 
 
COLLINS: She's one of them.
 
HARLOW: Oh, great.
 
I think Lisa France should, you know, come on. Get in there. Guest host.
 
FRANCE: I mean from your lips to the - to the big guy's ears. 
 
HARLOW: All right. They're watching. 
 
Lisa, thank you.
 
FRANCE: Thank you so much. 
 
HARLOW: Four of the best golfers on the planet, including Tiger Woods, facing off tomorrow in "The Match," that's what it's called, on TNT. Who will take home this year's bragging rights? That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[08:51:12]
 
HARLOW: Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING. We are live in Washington. We're glad you're with us. 
 
Four of the biggest names in golf will be competing under the lights in the Capital One "The Match" this weekend. Tiger Woods will be teaming up with the world's number one player, Rory McIlroy. They will be up against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas in the 12-hole match tomorrow night. This will be Woods' first competition since July. 
 
Let's bring in TNT golf analyst Trevor Immelman. He is the 2008 master champion and will be a commentator for "The Match." 
 
This is like a big deal, right, because it's called "The Match." 
 
TREVOR IMMELMAN, TNT GOLF ANALYST: Yes, it's a -- 
 
HARLOW: Kind of cool they're pairing up the greats. 
 
IMMELMAN: Yes, it's a huge deal and fantastic to see these four guys come together. Like you just touched on there, we haven't seen Tiger Woods compete since the open in July. He is the biggest name in our sport by far still. So, lots of anticipation to see just how he's going to get on and how he's going to team up with the world's number one, McIlroy. 
 
COLLINS: What is your sense of who has the advantage here? Because, I mean, these are all amazing golfers. Everyone loves to watch them. But what's your sense of how the pairings look and how different this is from the PGA and what these matchings, these pairings, actually look like? 
 
IMMELMAN: Well, I -- the betting favorites right now, for me, the guys who look the best are Thomas and Spieth. They've paired up so extremely well at the President's Cup just a few months ago and were actually unbeaten in team competition against the internationals. So, they are the favorites going in. They're great buddies. They've known each other extremely well since they were junior golfers competing together. 
 
The one thing I've learned through my career being around golf and competing is, never count out Tiger Woods. Even though we haven't seen him play for a little while -
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
IMMELMAN: He has been working on his (INAUDIBLE). He's been struggling with the walking because of the various injuries. He's going to be able to use a cart at "The Match." So, don't count him out. And it doesn't hurt to have the world's number one golfer, Rory McIlroy, as your partner. 
 
So, this is going to be a lot of fun. Twelve holes. Best ball match play under the lights in Bel-Air, Florida. This is going to be a great one to watch. 
 
HARLOW: Even though I'm totally an expert on all things golf, as Kaitlan can tell you -- not -- I heard something about a different kind of golf ball that Tiger Woods is going to use. Is that right? I didn't even know those exist, by the way, but apparently there are harder ones and softer ones. I mean what's up with that? 
 
IMMELMAN: Well, you've just given me some insight, I'm heading down there later today. I'll be catching up with all the players. And I'll find out exactly what's going on there. 
 
HARLOW: OK. 
 
IMMELMAN: When I was with him last week in the Bahamas, he did not mention testing a new golf ball. So, I'm going to have to keep my eyes peeled on that and have to report back. 
 
HARLOW: I hope I'm not wrong. This is what our smart producers tell me. 
 
All right, Trevor, thank you. 
 
IMMELMAN: Thanks so much.
 
HARLOW: And for all of you watching, you can - you can catch "The Match," Saturday, 6:00 p.m. Eastern, on TNT. 
 
COLLINS: All right, for many, this time of year, it's about giving back. You know, the holidays are here. CNN Heroes is this all-star tribute, it salutes ten extraordinary people who put others first all year long, not just around the holidays. It's a star-studded gala. It airs live this Sunday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. It's really something you don't want to miss. The stories are so incredible.
