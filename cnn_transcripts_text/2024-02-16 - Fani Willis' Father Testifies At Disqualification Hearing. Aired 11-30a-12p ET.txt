(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN FLOYD, FANI WILLIS' FATHER: The South Fulton police. First, they put a car in front of the house. That was there permanently. A police car. That was thing one.
 
Thing two. They brought a person with a dog, sometimes more than once a day, twice a day, and they would circle the house to look for bombs. I knew that that was a house that my daughter had worked for. It was a brand-new house. She's the only one who had ever lived there.
 
It's a four-bedroom, brand-new house. And I wanted somebody needed to protect the house. And I stayed there to basically take care of the house, to take care of the yard, to take care -- that also somebody sprayed again, the B-word and N-word on the house.
 
And I don't think my daughter even knew that. I cleaned it off and called the police and South Fulton police. They have, I'm sure, all the records of all the things that happened.
 
And all of the neighbors -- I notified all the neighbors to look out and to watch out. And it was just -- it was so crazy. I mean, it was just so crazy.
 
We'd have people would show up and park cars. There was a guy parked for probably eight hours out in front of the house. You know, it's just -- and we call the police. And, you know -- 
 
ADAM ABBATE, ATTORNEY FOR FULTON COUNTY D.A.'S OFFICE: Now, at the time that you live there with Miss Willis, I guess even when you remain. So, during the time period of 2019 to the end of 2020, are you aware if Miss Willis was dating someone?
 
FLOYD: Yes. She did. She had -- she had a boyfriend when I first got there.
 
ABBATE: And did you meet her boyfriend?
 
FLOYD: Yes. Many -- often.
 
ABBATE: OK. And can -- did you know him by any specific nickname?
 
FLOYD: Yes. Deuce. ABBATE: OK. And -- 
 
FLOYD: Who can't -- 
 
ABBATE: Can you tell the court why you were living there? How often would you see him?
 
FLOYD: Sometimes every day. Sometimes, you know, every other day. He was a disc jockey or something. And he had all this paraphernalia that I'd have to move out.
 
It was a -- you know, a thing with the key -- covering up. Things that play music and so forth, so -- 
 
ABBATE: Now, when you moved in, in 2019 and then throughout the years, and you're 2020 or 21, had you ever met someone named Nathan Wade?
 
FLOYD: I did not meet Nathan Wade until 2023, about a year ago when I -- reporter by the name of Isikoff (PH) interviewed me. I may have -- that's the first time I met him.
 
ABBATE: You said that was in 2023?
 
FLOYD: 2023. Right.
 
ABBATE: And I know you said you hadn't met him until 2023. But when you were living at Miss Willis's house in Fulton County, did you ever meet Mr. Wade in the year 2019?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely, not.
 
ABBATE: How about in the year 2020?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely, not.
 
ABBATE: Do you ever see Mr. Wade at Miss Willis's Fulton County house in the year 2021?
 
FLOYD: Never.
 
ABBATE: And is it your testimony that the only time or the first time that you met Mr. Wade was in 2023?
 
FLOYD: Let me say something. Mr. Wade said that he remembers seeing me. And I do remember some banter.
 
I'm a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. And there's kind of this thing that goes on between 30s. And Mr. Wade as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, and they -- you know, so that -- I do remember there was some kind of banter when my daughter was sworn in to be District Attorney between me and a couple of guys. And he said he remembers me. I don't remember him.
 
ABBATE: And prior to that experience that you're talking about, as well as I guess your official meeting in 2023, have you ever even heard his name? FLOYD: No. Never.
 
ABBATE: I don't think I have further questions, Your Honor.
 
SCOTT MCAFEE, JUDGE, FULTON COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT: Ms. Merchant.
 
ASHLEIGH MERCHANT, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR MIKE ROMAN: Yes. thank you, Judge. Good morning. How are you today?
 
FLOYD: Fine. How are you, counsel?
 
MERCHANT: Good. Thank you. I just got a couple of questions. On Monday, we heard you were in California. Do you have a place in California?
 
FLOYD: People always ask me about where do I live. I guess I live right here, sitting in this seat right now. But yes, the answer is I have a place in Los Angeles.
 
MERCHANT: All right, you do. All right. And so, do you share time -- split time between Los Angeles and Georgia?
 
FLOYD: Actually, I'm working on a documentary film. And I'm supposed to be being filmed not for this trial, but I'm supposed to be being filmed right now. It was planned and then we had to stop it because they asked me to come here.
 <br>[11:35:04]
 
But the answer is I'm working on a documentary. And I'll be in California until I finish the documentary if we don't have another actor strike, and we don't have another writer strike.
 
MERCHANT: So, do you own property in California?
 
FLOYD: No. I don't. I live with a friend of mine.
 
MERCHANT: Live with a friend of yours. OK.
 
FLOYD: Yes.
 
MERCHANT: And when did you first move -- let me -- let me qualify with the dates. Did you spend any time in 2019 in California?
 
FLOYD: No. And the reason I didn't is that when I first came here -- the answer is no. I did not.
 
What happened was COVID. Once COVID hit, that -- I mean, I was just paralyzed. I couldn't go any place. I couldn't do anything.
 
I mean, I'm a theater buff. I used to go to the theater, at least once a week. But when COVID hit, I just couldn't. I couldn't go to the dentist, which I need to do. Well, you know, I just -- it was just a thing. So, I was just stuck. I was just stuck there.
 
MERCHANT: I may be wrong, but I believe COVID hit and 2020. So, I was asking about 2019. In 2019, did you spend any time in California?
 
FLOYD: Before COVID was even here in the United States.
 
MERCHANT: OK.
 
FLOYD: Remember, I lived in South Africa, and I've traveled the world. I knew COVID was coming before. I knew COVID was around before.
 
They may have announced it in '20. But in fact, I knew about it. And I knew what was happening in '19.
 
FLOYD: OK. So, let's walk through 2019 then. You said you moved here in September? So -- 
 
FLOYD: No, I didn't say that. I moved here probably prior to September. In September, is when I got the driver's license. I probably moved in the springtime.
 
FLOYD: I'm sorry. You didn't. You said spring or summer. I see that in my notes.
 
So, spring or summer 2019 is when you moved here. So, up until spring or summer of 2019, where did you live?
 
FLOYD: I live in Johannesburg -- well, I lived in Washington, D.C. 2018. I plan to retire for the rest of my life in South Africa. I had worked for Nelson Mandela and the Free Mandela and got that. And someone I'd gone to law school, he had relocated there after Mandela was freed from prison and became president.
 
I was going to live there for the rest of my life. But unfortunately, because of political reasons, I could not stay in South Africa. And I was forced, in a sense, to come back to the United States.
 
MERCHANT: OK. So, let's just focus in on the period from -- let's see -- let's just start with October 2019. OK. We'll call that the relevant period.
 
October 2019 until the end of 2019, were you in Georgia every single day of that year?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely.
 
MERCHANT: OK. So, now let's move to 2020, OK? And every single day -- before I move on, every single day in 2019, you slept at your daughter's house, correct?
 
FLOYD: That's correct.
 
MERCHANT: OK. So, let's start in 2020, all right? So, 2020 the entire year, did you travel anywhere?
 
FLOYD: No.
 
MERCHANT: OK. You didn't travel at all that year?
 
FLOYD: Not -- no.
 
MERCHANT: OK.
 
FLOYD: And I didn't go to the movies which upset me also.
 
MERCHANT: So, that entire year 2020, you remained here in Georgia.
 
FLOYD: Right.
 
MERCHANT: OK. In 2021, did you do any traveling?
 
FLOYD: No.
 
MERCHANT: OK. So, when did you move back or when did you start this documentary film in Los Angeles?
 
FLOYD: What I had been doing to occupy my time as I was writing my own memoir. As I delved into my family background, I discovered something and that's what got me to working on the documentary. So, I want you to understand what was going on in my life.
 
I pitched my -- I have a movie script called "Bad Blood." I have a movie script which I'm trying to sell. So, I tried to sell that -- I just happened to mention something that happened during the Civil Rights Movement. Snake -- it's called "The Snake Five." The legendary Peter FitzSimons was interested. And so, with Peter FitzSimons and Noya Smith (PH) were now doing the documentaries.
 
MERCHANT: I don't -- I don't want to interrupt you, but what I was asking was when you moved to Los Angeles, not what you moved there for.
 
FLOYD: You keep saying moved. I haven't moved to Los Angeles. I spent more time in California, in Oakland, if you really want to just be because Peter is basically San Francisco-based. So, we're working on a documentary.
 
MERCHANT: OK.
 
FLOYD: I was in Los Angeles because I was going to the Pan African Film Festival. And that's why we were there. And the way Hollywood works is, you know, when you make the connections, and film festivals are placed to try to sell ideas and meet people and organize things.
 <br>[11:40:08]
 
MERCHANT: You still own property in Washington, D.C., correct?
 
FLOYD: No, I don't.
 
MERCHANT: You don't own property at 1467 Roxanna Road Northwest?
 
FLOYD: That's where I used to live.
 
MERCHANT: That's where you used to live.
 
FLOYD: Right.
 
MERCHANT: Did you own that property?
 
FLOYD: Yes.
 
MERCHANT: OK. And you owned that property when you moved here in 2019?
 
FLOYD: Yes.
 
MERCHANT: And you owned it in 2020, correct?
 
FLOYD: Well, that -- well, you -- now, you talk about a very complicated issue. I left the property. There was a dispute between me and -- I had gotten a reverse mortgage company. And there was a dispute between me, and they diverted that. And I just walked away from it.
 
MERCHANT: OK. You walked away from it with almost $300,000?
 
ABBATE: Yes. What is the relevance of that?
 
MERCHANT: Where he live and register to vote? That's what they brought in. So, that's -- 
 
ABBATE: It was the money you got. That's not relevant at all.
 
MERCHANT: It's the only proof I have of that he owned that address. So, I can move on now.
 
ABBATE: All right.
 
MERCHANT: OK. When did you sell that property?
 
FLOYD: I didn't. The reverse mortgage company took it.
 
MERCHANT: Oh, OK.
 
FLOYD: Yes.
 
MERCHANT: So, in 2019, when you -- when you got your driver's license here -- 
 
FLOYD: Yes.
 
MERCHANT: The next day, you registered to vote, correct?
 
FLOYD: I think it may have been the same day but maybe it was the next day. I don't remember.
 
MERCHANT: But you didn't own property here in Georgia that day?
 
FLOYD: No, I was living with my daughter.
 
MERCHANT: OK. You said that you met Mr. Wade -- that you remember you met in 2023, right? That was the first time you remember.
 
FLOYD: Correct.
 
MERCHANT: OK. And I wasn't really clear. You said something about meeting him. Was it with Mr. Isikoff or did Mr. Isikoff tell you?
 
FLOYD: No. I was being interviewed by Mr. Isikoff.
 
MERCHANT: OK.
 
FLOYD: And he walked in. And I met him. It was the first time. He walked into the office. And -- 
 
MERCHANT: Where were you being interviewed?
 
FLOYD: At the district attorney's office.
 
MERCHANT: And Mr. Wade walked into that interview?
 
FLOYD: Yes.
 
MERCHANT: And so, you're -- so, Miss Willis had not told you about Mr. Wade prior to that?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely not.
 
MERCHANT: So, she didn't tell you anything about their relationship before you met him that day?
 
FLOYD: No.
 
MERCHANT: But Mr. Wade remembers meeting you in 2020?
 
FLOYD: He said that at my daughter's swearing, he had. I do remember that we haven't some banter about fraternities. But other than that -- 
 
MERCHANT: Oh, at your daughter's swearing in? OK.
 
FLOYD: Right.
 
MERCHANT: That's all I have. Just one moment, Judge. I think I -- (INAUDIBLE)
 
STEVE SADOW, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: Morning, sir.
 
FLOYD: Good morning. How are you, Counsel?
 
SADOW: I'm fine. I'll try to ask you some specific questions if we can. OK?
 
FLOYD: And I'll give specific answers if I can.
 
SADOW: Perfect.
 
FLOYD: OK.
 
SADOW: The driver's license address, I'm not going to publish, that is State's Exhibit number two. But is the address on that driver's license the home that you're referring to as your daughter's in South Fulton?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely.
 
SADOW: OK. It was unclear to me, maybe no one else, but it's unclear to me. When did you stop living at what I would call your daughter's home in South Fulton?
 
FLOYD: Things got so bad. And threats got so many even against me that the house became basically uninhabitable. You know, I got tired of sleeping in one room one day and not one that, I would say December of 2022, something like that.
 
SADOW: December of 2022?
 
FLOYD: Right. That's about right. Yes.
 
SADOW: Not only change and go back for another date. You had indicated and I didn't hear it. When was your daughter, Miss Willis, when was she sworn in as district attorney?
 
FLOYD: On January 1, 2021.
 
SADOW: OK. And did you indicate that there was an incident -- and I know you've described it. Was that incident on February 3, 2021?
 
FLOYD: That's my best recollection.
 
SADOW: OK. So, my question then is after February 3, 2021, how much longer did Miss Willis stay at the house before she moved somewhere else?
 
FLOYD: A very short period of time. And I cannot be precise, but I would bet all the money I ever made, it wouldn't work in more than a month and a half with that home.
 
SADOW: OK. So, we're talking about best of your recollection, end of February into the beginning of March, give or take, of 2021 when Miss Willis would have moved to a different location?
 
FLOYD: Exactly.
 
SADOW: OK. And did Miss Willis return to the house, that this house that you were in, at any point in time that you can remember?
 <br>[11:45:05]
 
FLOYD: From time to time, she and her security might show up for her to pick something up or take something on -- something. But she always would be come with her security.
 
SADOW: OK. My question was poorly worded. I apologize. Did she come back permanently to her house?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely not.
 
SADOW: OK. FLOYD: Absolutely not.
 
SADOW: So, as far as you're aware that once Miss Willis left the house -- her house, her Fulton house, so the record's clear, in either late February or into March of 2021, best of your recollection, she's not returned to that home to live?
 
FLOYD: No, she -- no. It became uninhabitable. I mean, it just -- you know, I mean -- 
 
SADOW: That's OK.
 
FLOYD: I would have to walk around that house looking out of every window. I had -- I had -- I made a habit of having to walk around the whole house. I got lights so that if somebody would come at night in the back, so that -- those kinds of reflecting lights. I had those put up, you know. you're not -- 
 
SADOW: I don't really in -- all I was interested in is whether she had ever returned?
 
FLOYD: No. The answer is no.
 
SADOW: OK. Now, when Miss Willis -- when your daughter left the home, the time period ended February beginning of March, give or take 2021, do you know where she moved to?
 
FLOYD: No. And I didn't want to know. I intentionally did not want to know. Because I was not -- you know, if somebody stuck a gun to my head, and I could tell him I wasn't going to tell them anyway. I have to made up something. But I didn't want to know.
 
SADOW: OK. So, would it be fair to say that if you didn't want to know, you never visited her at the place that she moved to?
 
FLOYD: Oh, I never did.
 
SADOW: Never did?
 
FLOYD: I never did.
 
SADOW: OK. Do you know how long she stayed at the first place that she went to after she left her house before she moved to a second place?
 
FLOYD: What I know -- and this is hearsay, Counsel, is that my daughter has had to move something like four times.
 
SADOW: But do you know any potential -- 
 
FLOYD: No, I don't know any place. I was taken one time for Christmas day. I've only seen my daughter -- and this is very hard for me to say. But during the period, my daughter left, I've only seen my daughter 13 times because I can't. And we've never seen each other more than maybe three hours because of, you know, the nightmare threats against her and me. SADOW: And I understand that. And from the perspective of being a father myself, I understand what that means. So, I'm going to move away from that. I was just trying to get an idea of date-wise. OK?
 
So, let me try to get one more date. In 2023 when you were being interviewed by one of the gentlemen that wrote the book, at the D.A.'s office, and Mr. Wade came in, can you give us other than 2023 what the date would be?
 
FLOYD: I'm sorry, I can't, Counsel.
 
SADOW: How about spring or summer? Any idea?
 
FLOYD: I would guess spring or summer, but I can't. I don't -- I'm sorry.
 
SADOW: And you've already indicated, at least to your recollection, that was the first time that you've met Mr. Wade, right?
 
FLOYD: Absolutely.
 
SADOW: OK. Not arguing with you about that. I want to go to Miss Willis's boyfriend that you referenced. OK? You met Miss Willis's boyfriend as you've characterized it, when you came here in 2019?
 
FLOYD: Correct.
 
SADOW: And you met him on one occasion -- several occasions?
 
FLOYD: Oh, no. I saw him often.
 
SADOW: Oh, so you mean, there was no secret that she was dating this man?
 
FLOYD: Not from me.
 
SADOW: Not from you?
 
FLOYD: And that's -- he was -- again, he was a disc jockey of some kind. I think he had a government job during the day. I don't know what it was.
 
But apparently, he would do weddings and so forth and so on. He was a disc jockey. He played music. So, all of his -- all of his stuff was always in the way. And I was always having to try to push it aside, you know. Anyway.
 
SADOW: But Miss Willis, your daughter, didn't keep him from you, correct?
 
FLOYD: No.
 
SADOW: No? I mean, there was no doubt he -- 
 
FLOYD: I mean, that we lived in my daughter, and I lived in the same house. I mean, you know, he came and went. You know. SADOW: Right. Now, when did you learn that your daughter had a romantic personal relationship with Mr. Wade?
 
FLOYD: About seven weeks ago when it -- as a matter of fact, I just found out when other folks found out. OK?
 
SADOW: That is your daughter, as I understand it, never told you one time in the year of 2022 that she was dating Mr. Wade, correct?
 
FLOYD: That's correct.
 
SADOW: And until recently, you didn't know from anyone, including your daughter that she dated Mr. Wade, correct?
 <br>[11:50:04]
 
FLOYD: That's correct.
 
SADOW: That is whatever the relationship is between father and daughter, she kept that a secret from you, correct?
 
FLOYD: Correct.
 
SADOW: That's all I need to know.
 
MCAFEE: Mr. Stockton.
 
ALLYN STOCKTON, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR RUDY GIULIANI: Good morning, Mr. Floyd.
 
FLOYD: Good morning, Counsel.
 
STOCKTON: When your daughter moved or left the house that she owned, did she say anything to you about having a large savings of cash?
 
FLOYD: Oh, no. She -- oh, no. That -- see? Maybe -- excuse me. And I -- Your Honor, I'm not trying to be racist, OK? But it's a black thing, OK?
 
You know, I was trained. And most black folks, they hide cash, or they keep cash. And I was -- no, I train. You always keep some cash because I've been places. And just because of the color of my skin, for example, I took a fellowship at Harvard, when my daughter was just -- if I might, Your Honor, or my -- when I was just -- she was just, you know, maybe three years old.
 
And I remember going to a restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And I had a American Express credit card and maybe a visa or whatever. And I had a lot of what they call traveler's checks. I don't even know if they still have traveler's checks, but traveler's checks.
 
And there was a sign that said, you know -- with a credit card, for whatever reasons, the man would not take my American Express credit card. So, I pulled up my Visa card, and he wouldn't take my Visa card. So, then I pulled out my traveler's checks. He said we don't take checks. Now, this was -- (INAUDIBLE) traveler's checks. This was money. I had a $10 bill. I'll never forget this as long as I live.
 
And he said, the bill for my wife at the time, Fani's mother, Fani, and myself was like $9.95, and I had a $10 bill. It was all that -- I always remember that. But even before that, I've always kept cash, you know. And I've told my daughter, you keep six months' worth of cash always.
 
For example, I had three safes in my house. I put some of my clients' stuff there too, things I didn't want other lawyers to be. I mean -- because you're always in a firm, and I knew that there were special conditions. So, some of my clients' things I would bring home, put them in the safe.
 
But I've always kept saves. And as a matter of fact, I gave my daughter her first cash box and told her to always keep some cash.
 
STOCKTON: So, is that a yes?
 
FLOYD: Yes. Absolutely.
 
STOCKTON: That's all I got, Judge.
 
MCAFEE: Mr. Durham.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No more questions.
 
MCAFEE: Mr. MacDougald?
 
HARRY MCDOUGALD, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR JEFFREY CLARK: No more questions, Your Honor.
 
MCAFEE: Thank you. Mr. Rice?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No questions, Your Honor.
 
MCAFEE: Mr. Gillen?
 
CRAIG GILLEN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOOR DAVID SHAFER: It's still morning. Good morning, sir.
 
FLOYD: Good morning, Counsel. How are you?
 
GILLEN: Just fine. Just a few questions following up. When -- you were talking about when you learned about Mr. Wade and your daughter, correct?
 
FLOYD: Correct.
 
GILLEN: Now, did your daughter tell you in around October of 2022 that she had gone on a Caribbean cruise with Mr. Wade to the Bahamas?
 
FLOYD: The answer is I knew that my daughter had gone but I did not know who she went with or what the circumstances were. So, I knew that she had gone out of town, but I didn't know with whom. GILLEN: I see. And did she tell you in November of 2022 that she had gone to Aruba and stayed at a Hyatt Regency Resort there in Aruba for three days with Mr. Wade? Did she tell you that?
 
FLOYD: The answer was -- again, I knew she went on a tour. I didn't know where she went. I knew she was going out of town. She told me she was going out of town. I think she might have said she was going out of the country as to whom she'd be gone. But other than that, that was all.
 
GILLEN: OK. And did she tell you in March of 2023, that she was going to Belize for several days with Mr. Wade?
 
FLOYD: The answer -- that's the same answer that I knew she would tell me she was going out of town. And she may or may not have told me where she was going. But she'd be gone for a couple of days.
 
GILLEN: OK. Now, in 2023, you are -- you are -- in many days, you would be out in California, correct?
 
FLOYD: Some days I'd be in California, correct?
 
GILLEN: OK. Well, did she tell you in May of 2023 that she was traveling to the -- to Napa Valley with Mr. Wade so maybe you all could see each other when she visited California with Mr. Wade?
 <br>[11:55:10]
 
FLOYD: The answer is no.
 
GILLEN: And so, the first time that you ever met Mr. Wade or learned about Mr. Wade, to your recollection was in 2023?
 
FLOYD: That's correct.
 
GILLEN: That's all I have, Your Honor. Thank you.
 
MCAFEE: Mr. Kucherov (PH) on the Zoom.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Your Honor. Just a couple of quick questions. Good morning, sir. I know I can't see you.
 
FLOYD: I can't see you either. But -- 
 
MCAFEE: But we could take a moment. We can -- 
 
FLOYD: Good morning. Counsel.
 
MCAFEE: We take a moment. Let's just pause and see if we can change the screens to show Mr. Kucherov.
 
MCAFEE: OK. We need you -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. I'm on a -- I'm on a phone so it's kind of difficult.
 
MCAFEE: Can you turn your screen on now?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. You're watching John Floyd, who is the father of Fani Willis on the witness stand here. And one of the things he has testified to is that during the time he lived with his daughter prior to the case against Donald Trump and others being taken up, that he had never met Nathan Wade. Nathan Wade had never been to the home where he lived.
 
And he also testified to the fact that he taught his daughter to keep large amounts of cash at her home. And that's become an issue because both Fani Willis and Nathan Wade has said they exchanged cash to basically both pay for the various things that they did together. Let's listen to the testimony again.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FLOYD: No.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you speak with your daughter about your testimony?
 
FLOYD: She may have been present when the lawyers were. I just -- I really don't remember.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If Mr. Wade and your daughter were dating, you wouldn't have known that unless your daughter told you.
 
FLOYD: What are you -- maybe I'm not understanding your question, Counsel. So, maybe you want to restate. What is it that you're asking me?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. If it wasn't clear, I can re-ask the question. I'll rephrase it.
 
FLOYD: Yes. Right -- yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If Mr. Wade -- if Mr. Wade and your daughter were dating, you wouldn't have known that unless your daughter told you.
 
FLOYD: I did not know that they were dating.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
FLOYD: And when we were talking about the case, I didn't know that -- I don't know what you're -- what you're asking me. What I told my child from the time she was a child is always to have some money. Always have some money. If you go on a date so that people don't try to stick you and you want to leave whoever, always keep some cash. OK?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Floyd, I -- you answer the question that the attorneys prepped you for that. So, that's all I wanted to know.
 
MCAFEE: Is that all Mr. Kucherov?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's it, Your Honor.
 
MCAFEE: All right. Mr. Cromwell?
 
BILL CROMWELL, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: No questions, Your Honor.
 
MCAFEE: Mr. Abbate?
 
ABBATE: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Floyd, now, it wasn't common for your daughter to confide in you about her romantic life at all.
 
FLOYD: No. And I didn't -- I haven't confided in her about mine before when I had one, OK?
 
ABBATE: And you wouldn't have known about her boyfriend that this time -- 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
MCAFEE: Do we have an objection?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think there might have just been still off mute.
 
MCAFEE: OK, let's keep going.
 
ABBATE: Now, you wouldn't have known about her boyfriend, the disc jockey had you not been living with her, correct?
 
FLOYD: That's correct.
 
MCAFEE: Overruled.
 
ABBATE: I had nothing further.
 
MCAFEE: Do you -- do you answer the question?
 
ABBATE: (INAUDIBLE)
 
MCAFEE: All right, by show of hands, any redirect on those points only. Ms. Merchant.
 
MERCHANT: Yes. I just wanted to when you were prepped by the lawyers. When this prep session was?
 
FLOYD: I just got off the plane on a Tuesday night. I think I was probably drooling at the mouth. I was so tired. So, it must have been -- I got it on Wednesday -- it must be Wednesday.
 
MERCHANT: OK. And did you talk about any of the testimony from yesterday or watching the news reports or anything like that?
 
FLOYD: Oh, absolutely -- you can't cut the T.V. on without seeing this. The first thing. And I listened to conservative radio a lot -- and, you know, last night for five hours, and all they talked about was this case. MERCHANT: So, you are aware of what the testimony your daughter gave yesterday was?
 
FLOYD: Yes. How -- I mean, how could -- I mean, unless you don't cut the radio on unless you don't cut the television on unless you don't read the AJC or any other -- New York Times or whatever, which I do every day, yes, of course.
 
MERCHANT: So, is it fair to say nobody instructed you that you were under the rule of sequestration?
 
FLOYD: Right. And I'm not under subpoena either.
 
MERCHANT: Thank you.
 
MCAFEE: All right. Anything else? Seeing and hearing none. Thank you, Mr. Floyd.
 
FLOYD: Thank you very much, Your Honor. It's a pleasure to appear in front --
