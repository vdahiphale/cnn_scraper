THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[18:00:06]
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: That's the harshest terms. All right. Evan Perez with that breaking news. Thank you so much.
 
You can follow me on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, and on the TikTok, @jaketapper. You can follow the show on X, @TheLeadCNN. The news continues 
 
 on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in "The Situation Room." I'll see you tomorrow.
 
JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: It's 1:00 a.m. in Beirut, 6:00 a.m. in Shanghai, and 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And 
 
 wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a warm welcome to "First Move," and here's today's need to know. Israel says it's carried out another round of extensive strikes in Lebanon as the 
 
 death toll rises above 500. Action needed. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky telling the U.N. Russia can only be forced into peace. And designer dupes 
 
 as China's economy slows, shoppers look for savings with copies of luxury brands. And a private pioneer, Jared Isaacman, the first civilian to 
 
 spacewalk, joins the show later. That conversation and plenty more coming up.
 
But first, we begin with the latest wave of airstrikes on Lebanon. Israel says it struck dozens of targets belonging to Hezbollah, including this 
 
 apartment building in Southern Beirut. The Israeli military says the strike killed the commander in charge of the militant group's missile unit.
 
Well, over 500 people have now been killed since the bombardment began on Monday. Tehran is warning that Israeli strikes on Hezbollah will have, 
 
 quote, "dangerous consequences." Israeli President Isaac Herzog told CNN that Iran's supreme leader could help stop the conflict if he really wanted 
 
 to.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT: It's very clear the onus is on him. And mostly the onus is on his regime. Because the one who calls the shots in 
 
 Iran is the supreme leader. And because the Revolutionary Guards don't ask the president the word and they don't adhere to his authority, and they 
 
 spread terror cells all over the world.
 
If he wants to change the course in the region, he is got to get these guys, these proxies, these terror organizations out of the way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Ben Wedeman is in Beirut for us. Ben, good to have you with us. One Israeli official telling CNN earlier that the plan is to step up the 
 
 military engagements by day, that they're not ruling out the possibility of a ground invasion. The Israelis have made clear that they want to return 
 
 displaced families to the north when it's safe for them. The question is, what does that take, and how much can Hezbollah take, and Iran perhaps, 
 
 without reacting?
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, of course, what we're seeing is that despite almost two days of intense Israeli airstrikes 
 
 and a huge death toll here in Lebanon Hezbollah continues to fire into Israel. By my count, there have been 19 Hezbollah strikes today, and 
 
 according to the Israelis, more than 300 projectiles being fired into Israel.
 
So, clearly, Hezbollah isn't backing down, and Israel seems to be set further on its course to try to degrade Hezbollah as much as possible, 
 
 regardless of the death toll. Now, one piece of news that's just come in is that the British Defense Ministry is once more urging all British nationals 
 
 to leave Lebanon, but has also announced that it's that 700 British troops will shortly be deployed to Cyprus as part of what it calls contingency 
 
 plans as worries grow that this conflict is quickly escalating.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): Chaos and dust moments after an Israeli airstrike on South Beirut. Israel claimed the target was an important Hezbollah 
 
 operative. Hezbollah said nothing. At least six were killed, 15 injured. Hezbollah continues to fire unabated rockets over the border. After 
 
 Monday's punishing Israeli bombing, Lebanon suffered its highest daily death toll since the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre, a fourth of the dead, 
 
 women and children.
 
South of Beirut, the funerals have begun. The coffins draped with Hezbollah's banner. What was a border war is looking like a full on war. 
 
 And like the last war, tens of thousands again are fleeing for their lives. No easy task for the elderly and infirm.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
To dozens of schools in the capitol turned into shelters for the displaced, shades of Gaza. Most left everything behind, some including their dead.
 
It's true we left, but material things can be replaced, says Zainab (ph). Lives cannot. Losing someone is incredibly hard. You can't change fate, but 
 
 it's heartbreaking to lose a loved one.
 
Home for Abu Ali (ph) and his family of six, now a bare classroom. I asked him if, as Israel says, it was only striking Hezbollah targets.
 
Liars, they're liars, he shoots back. Entire families are gone. They're not Hezbollah targets. We live in the south. We don't know where Hezbollah is. 
 
 And I don't know where the Hezbollah fighters are.
 
Dr. Jihad Saadeh treated the injured in the 2006 war and here at this hospital in Beirut, he's doing it all over again.
 
DR. JIHAD SAADEH: All of them are civilians. They are families where their houses -- they're buried in their houses. Yes, in the south. Three of them 
 
 had head traumas and the rest had different traumas of the body, like we see in every war.
 
WEDEMAN (voice-over): It's happening again all too familiar.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEDEMAN (on camera): And within the last hour, we have heard a large explosion that echoed all over Beirut. It appears to have been a targeted 
 
 assassination just 16 -- rather 18 km south of the city. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: And we'll continue to watch it. Ben Wedeman, thank you so much for that report. Hezbollah has vowed to keep fighting Israel until the war 
 
 in Gaza is over. The Israeli military says 215 rockets were fired on Tuesday from Lebanon at Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, as we were 
 
 discussing there. Most were intercepted. Three people were reported hurt by falling shrapnel. Jeremy Diamond has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Israeli jets continue to pummel Lebanon, Hezbollah fired volley after volley of rockets 
 
 at Northern Israel. Most of the more than 215 rockets and drones intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome system. 
 
But in some Israeli communities, terrifying explosions. Firefighters dispatched to extinguish fires caused by Hezbollah rockets. And on this 
 
 highway, cars pulling over amid air raid sirens, nearly struck by rocket fire.
 
A casualty from one of those attacks soon arrives at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. The man, a soldier in his 20s, is rushed into the emergency room 
 
 with shrapnel injuries. He will soon join the hundreds of patients now being cared for in the hospital's secure underground facility, a dual use 
 
 parking lot built with war in mind.
 
MICHAEL HALBERTHAL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, RAMBAM HEALTH CARE CAMPUS: We started to mobilize patients at 12:00 at noon, and by 8:00, 600 to 700 patients 
 
 were in the underground and we're fully operational in the underground.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Dr. Michael Halberthal, the hospital's director, has been preparing for this wartime scenario for years. For the first time, he 
 
 is now putting that plan into action.
 
HALBERTHAL: We can be first self-sustained without any help from the outside for three days, right? If something happens, you know, electricity 
 
 wise, water, oxygen, food, three days. We can stay here as much as we need, according to the scenario.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Walking through the facility, it is hard to imagine this was an empty parking lot just two days ago.
 
HALBERTHAL: What we are seeing over here is operating rooms.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Surgical operations are already underway. Outpatients needing dialysis are getting care underground. All of the hospital's 
 
 departments now fully functional, capable of treating as many as 2,000 patients.
 
Nine premature babies in protective incubators now also transferred to Rambam Hospital. Among several groups of vulnerable patients from other 
 
 hospitals now being treated at this wartime facility.
 
Above ground, the busy streets of Israel's third largest city have gone quiet, a day after Hezbollah targeted Haifa directly for the first time 
 
 since 2006.
 
MARIAM RASHAD, HAIFA RESIDENT: In this hour, also, many people come to eat breakfast, to drink coffee, but now, no one, you can see. We hope to end 
 
 this war.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Other restaurants and shops deciding to stay closed, awaiting Hezbollah's next move.

CHATTERLEY: Iran's newly elected president criticizing Israel at the U.N. General Assembly for what he calls its barbarism in Gaza and Lebanon. He 
 
 called on the international community to stop.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
Iran's newly elected president criticizing Israel at the U.N. General Assembly for what he calls its barbarism in Gaza and Lebanon. He called on 
 
 the International Community to act before violence engulfs the region.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MASOUD PEZESHKIAN, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The responsibility for all consequences will be borne by those governments who 
 
 have thwarted all global efforts to end this horrific catastrophe and have the audacity to call themselves champions of human rights.
 
The only path forward to end the 70 years old nightmare in West Asia and the world is to restore the right of all Palestinians to self-
 
 determination. We propose that all people of Palestine, both those who live in their motherland as well as those who have been forced into its diaspora 
 
 determine their future in a referendum.
 
We are confident that through this mechanism, we can achieve a lasting peace with Muslims, Christians, and Jews living alongside one another in 
 
 one land in tranquility and peace and away from racism and apartheid.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: The Middle East conflict was just one of the urgent geopolitical crises discussed at the U.N. Tuesday. Ukrainian President 
 
 Zelenskyy said in a speech before the U.N. Security Council that Ukraine's right to self-defense must prevail in its war with Russia. And he says the 
 
 only way peace can be achieved in the conflict is through Ukrainian strength on the battlefield.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Some in the world want to talk to Putin. We know it, to meet, to talk, to speak. But what could they possibly 
 
 hear from him? Russia can only be forced into peace. And that is exactly what's needed, forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHATTERLEY: Zelenskyy is set to disclose his long-awaited victory plan to end the conflict to U.S. President Biden later this week. He's also set to 
 
 hold talks with U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
 
And in that vein, a new CNN poll showing the presidential race remains neck and neck. A key issue for many voters, as we well know, the economy. 
 
 Meanwhile, over 400 economists and policymakers endorsed Harris' economic plans. However, CNN's new poll showing voters still favor Donald Trump when 
 
 it comes to the handling of the economy.
 
And on Tuesday, Trump painted a stark picture of what manufacturers could expect. Kristen Holmes reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former President Donald Trump making an economic pitch to voters in Savannah, Georgia today.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but 
 
 under my leadership, we are going to take other countries' jobs.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): As polls continue to show, the economy is a top issue for voters. A trip to the critical battleground state coming as the former 
 
 president seeks to make gains with women voters.
 
TRUMP: I always thought women liked me. I never thought I had a problem. But the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. I don't believe it.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): A new CNN national poll today finding a significant gender gap among likely voters. Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 
 
 53 to 43 percent among female voters. While Trump holds a nine-point lead over Harris among male voters. The poll also finding among independent 
 
 women, Harris with 51 percent support compared to 36 percent for Trump.
 
In campaign stops, Trump reaching out directly to women.
 
TRUMP: So, let's talk about our great women, all right? Because women have gone through a lot. They've gone through a lot.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Monday in Pennsylvania, casting himself as a, quote, "protector of women," while claiming they would forget about reproductive 
 
 rights under a Trump presidency.
 
TRUMP: As president, I have to be your protector. You will no longer be abandoned, lonely, or scared. Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and 
 
 free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): The comments come as Trump has grappled with how to handle abortion this election cycle, both wanting to take credit for the 
 
 overturning of Roe v. Wade while casting all responsibility onto states.
 
TRUMP: We did a great thing when we got Roe v. Wade out of the federal government, got it back to the states.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Trump's allies have also received backlash for recent comments about women.
 
GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-AR): Thank you, Mr. President.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): In Michigan, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders swiping at Harris, a stepmother, for not having biological children.
 
SANDERS: My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn't have anything keeping her humble.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): And Ohio Senate candidate, Bernie Moreno, quipping that women over 50 didn't need to care about reproductive rights, in a 
 
 recording first obtained by WCMH from a viewer.
 
BERNIE MORENO (R), OHIO SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: There's a lot of suburban women. A lot of suburban women that are like, listen, abortion is it. If I 
 
 can't have an abortion in this country whenever I want, I will vote for anybody else.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
OK. A little crazy by the way. But -- especially for women that are like past 50 -- I thinking of myself. I don't think that's an issue for you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: All right. Coming up for hours, duped by the dupe economy, cash strapped. Chinese consumers are turning to high quality fashion fakes, like 
 
 the leggings you can see on the right. So, good even, well, I was duped. We'll discuss.
 
Plus, he boldly went where no civilian has gone before. Jared Isaacman, the first private U.S. citizen to go on a spacewalk, joins us to discuss his 
 
 incredible adventure and his investment in space travel. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move," a Beijing stimulus blast as new Wall Street records amass, topping today's money move. U.S. stocks higher 
 
 across the board Tuesday with the Dow and the S&amp;P climbing to fresh record highs. NVIDIA in the winner's circle, rising over 4 percent during the 
 
 session. Visa, on the other hand, underperforming, it shares tumbling more than 5 percent. The U.S. filing an antitrust suit against the payment's 
 
 processor, claiming it has a monopoly on the debit card market.
 
But perhaps the biggest story on global markets Tuesday took place in China. The Chinese Central Bank announcing its most aggressive stimulus 
 
 since the pandemic to help boost its slowing economy. The Central Bank cutting rates and announcing new steps to help boost bank lending.
 
Plus, new aid too for the country's property sector. The move sparking a 4 percent rally for the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng.
 
Meanwhile, stocks in Japan and South Korea were higher too. We'll see if investors can keep the rally going when trading gets underway once again a 
 
 few hours' time.
 
Now, China's economic downturn has led people there to pull back on spending, and luxury brands are feeling the pinch, with many younger 
 
 shoppers turning to so-called dupes, high quality knockoffs of items like expensive handbags and clothing without company logos on them. 
 
And this is one example. The yoga pants on the left are from Lululemon and sell for more than a hundred dollars. The pair on the right is from Tmall, 
 
 and they go for just $12. A recent marketing study shows social media searches for dupes tripling in China over the past few years.
 
Bob Barchiesi is the president of the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition and he joins us now. Bob, fantastic to have you with us. Do you 
 
 distinguish between --
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
BOB BARCHIESI, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL ANTICOUNTERFEITING COALITION: Thank you, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Hi. Do you distinguish between counterfeits and dupes, or I think what they're also being called is ping tea in China, sort of high-
 
 quality replicas of these famous brands?
 
BARCHIESI: Well, counterfeits actually have the trademark of the brand on them. And in a lot of cases, they'll ship these products without labels and 
 
 then they'll put the labels on and manufacture them together in different countries, including the United States. And quite frankly, either one is 
 
 pretty much garbage.
 
CHATTERLEY: OK. So, just to be clear, even if the product that they're making is a dupe, and obviously selling for a lot less, doesn't have the 
 
 official sort of fake logo on, I'll use Louis Vuitton as an example, you still, in your organization consider that counterfeit?
 
BARCHIESI: Well, because there's also -- beside the trademark patents, copyrights that the brands have on designs. So, it's just -- it's not only 
 
 the label. If you take a product like Burberry, their product is very distinct with the markings that it has on without the label.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. How big is this market, Bob?
 
BARCHIESI: It's about $1.2 trillion globally. It's a tremendous problem.
 
CHATTERLEY: I mean, a lot of the products are manufactured in China too. So, it's sort of a big market for the counterfeits. It also helps that 
 
 actually a lot of these manufacturers manufacture in China themselves. So, a lot of it's there already.
 
BARCHIESI: Yes. And that is a problem. That's a tremendous problem. U.S. customs, basically the seizures are about 80 percent of the counterfeits 
 
 that they see is come from China or from Hong Kong.
 
CHATTERLEY: Do people have to be careful about safety standards, Bob? Because I understand that sort of Chinese consumers are perhaps being more 
 
 price conscious. They're thinking to themselves, look, if I can get something that's not real, but it looks pretty close, then perhaps I'm 
 
 saving myself money. 
 
But from what I've read, particularly for young people in China, they're buying face products and skincare products and things that perhaps won't 
 
 have the same kind of standards of care and safety that other products might have. They need to be a bit careful here. Surely.
 
BARCHIESI: Oh, absolutely. And I think, you know, globally post pandemic jobs are tight and while wallets are even tighter and they don't realize 
 
 this health and safety risks, as you mentioned. I mean, I've seen counterfeit eyeliner where it causes infections, fragrances that were made 
 
 with urine. And it's a big problem. People end up in the emergency room with some of these products.
 
CHATTERLEY: What do young people need to understand, Bob? And is there a way to get a better handle on this. Because, certainly, what we're seeing, 
 
 at least in the data is that this is going only one way, and it's growing as an organization and an organized business rather than shrinking, simply 
 
 because people are short of cash in China at the moment, and we can see that in the economic data.
 
BARCHIESI: Yes, and I think we need to do a better job of advertising the harms of counterfeits, they kill jobs. They kill people. They kill 
 
 innovation. And it's a tremendous health and safety issue. They employ forced child labor. Some of these locations and factories in China, these 
 
 children work on the squalor conditions 12, 14 hours a day. I've been to some of these places.
 
Some of the products, even to the extent of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, luxury goods that are made with (INAUDIBLE) that break and it's -- these 
 
 products are basically almost like a Hollywood facade. You know, if you're a prop, if you kick it over, there's no substance behind them, it's all in 
 
 the packaging to attract people. And the counterfeiters don't care about you. They don't care about your health or safety. They only care about the 
 
 bottom line.
 
CHATTERLEY: Very quickly, Bob, you're working with Alibaba, which many of our audience will recognize as an enormous online marketplace and player 
 
 across Asia, but particularly obviously in China and they play into the United States as well. How much success are you having with them trying to 
 
 knock out the counterfeit products and identifying what's real and what's not?
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
BARCHIESI: We're having tremendous success with Alibaba and also with Amazon. We work with both of those companies and we also work with the -- 
 
 with Visa, with MasterCard, with PayPal, American Express, Western Union, MoneyGram, and they shut down the merchant accounts worldwide, regardless 
 
 of where the products being sold and where the consumer is. So, we've had a tremendous success.
 
I think the only way to solve the problem is to get all the stakeholders to collaborate, cooperate, and the ICC takes an approach that we don't see 
 
 these platforms like Amazon, Alibaba and others as being adversaries. We see them as an integral part of the solution. They have to be involved. 
 
 They invest a lot of money, so do the brands.
 
And ultimately, we need their help and they need -- the brands need their help. Alibaba and Amazon and other platforms like that need our help. 
 
 They're not experts in detecting counterfeit goods, and we're not experts in their systems. So, working together, we've had great success.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. And of course, consumers need to be aware of the risks too, even if they are short of cash and want fashionable products. Bob, 
 
 fantastic to have you with us. Thank you, sir. Bob Barchiesi there.
 
BARCHIESI: Thank you, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Thank you. All right. Now, to some breaking news. Ryan Routh has been charged with trying to assassinate Donald Trump. Routh was 
 
 originally charged with two firearm related offenses after he was discovered near one of Trump's golf courses. Prosecutors say Routh camped 
 
 outside the course with a rifle while the former president was playing.
 
For more on this now, we're joined by Evan Perez. Evan, what more do we know at this hour?
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN U.S. SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we now have these charges. There are six counts that Ryan Routh is now facing, and one of 
 
 them is attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, that of course being Donald Trump. That is a charge that brings with it a potential 
 
 life in prison, if he is convicted.
 
And so, now, these charges, if you remember, initially were just on these gun related charges. And prosecutors made clear, and the FBI and the 
 
 Justice Department made clear that they were all along pursuing attempted assassination charges, and that's what they finally have done.
 
And so, one of the things that we learned from prosecutors in the last couple of days is that Routh spent roughly weeks essentially stalking the 
 
 former president, beginning in August, where he was keeping track of Donald Trump's movements, wanting to make sure when he would be at the at the golf 
 
 course there in West Palm Beach. And so, he was spending a lot of time there based on his cell phone track.
 
We also know, that before he traveled down from North Carolina, where he lived, to the Florida -- South Florida area, one of the things he did is he 
 
 left a handwritten letter, I can show you a part of it right here, that they filed in court. And one of the things that you learned in there is 
 
 that he allegedly said that this was an attempted assassination, essentially, previewing the fact that he was going to try to kill the 
 
 former president and perhaps not succeed.
 
So, now, we have this case is going to go forward. One of the interesting parts of this Julia, is that the judge who is going to be presiding over 
 
 this case is Judge Aileen Cannon. Of course, she was the judge who is overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case. She dismissed that, 
 
 and that is a case that is now going up on appeal in the 11th Circuit. But certainly, what a coincidence for that to happen. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Certainly, a strong coincidence, and that evidence tough to escape. A written letter there. Evan Perez, thank you so much for that.
 
All right. Coming up, Cuba takes cover as Storm Helene. How it's expected to become a major hurricane as it heads to Florida, next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more of the international headlines this hour. Children begin returning to Georgia's 
 
 Apalachee High School on Tuesday after a deadly shooting, saw four people murdered there earlier this month. Two students and two teachers were 
 
 killed in the attack on September 4th.
 
TikTok is the latest social media company to remove Russian state media accounts like Sputnik News and RT. U.S. officials say RT is involved in 
 
 covert activities and spreads Kremlin propaganda. TikTok says the accounts engage in covert influence against its guidelines. Meta announced a similar 
 
 move last week.
 
A federal judge sentenced the former girlfriend of FTX founder Sam Bankman- Fried to two years in prison for her role in what prosecutors called one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history. The judge credited Caroline 
 
 Ellison's extensive cooperation with prosecutors that led to Bankman Fried's conviction for stealing some $8 billion in customer funds from the 
 
 crypto exchange he founded.
 
And at least two people are dead after Category 3 Hurricane John struck Mexico's southern coast on Monday. The storm has now weakened, but it still 
 
 remains and poses a flooding threat.
 
Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Helene is gathering strength in the Caribbean. Cuba is currently bracing for impact, and it's forecast to hit Florida as a 
 
 major hurricane in just days.
 
Patrick Oppmann joins us now from Cuba. Patrick, good to have you with us. How are people there preparing?
 
PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the government has told them to keep a very close eye on this storm as it travels north and as it gains 
 
 power. And right now, it is expected to travel between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico. 
 
And that might seem like good news, but not necessarily because as it travels over those very warm waters, that is essentially the gasoline that 
 
 will make the storm stronger and stronger. And it is expected to explode into potentially a major Category 3 hurricane.
 
And even if it doesn't make a direct landfall here in Cuba as a hurricane, this size travels past Cuba, it displaces a lot of water and that water 
 
 will come sloshing back. The storm surge will come sloshing back onto coastal city like Havana with so much aging infrastructure that really can 
 
 cause a lot of problems. So, people here who do live on the coast are very wary because they've had their homes flooded so often over the years, as we 
 
 continue to grapple more and more with the impacts of climate change in a coastal city like this one.
 
Really, though, it is the people living on the west coast of Florida that have to keep a very close eye on the storm because it is expected just to 
 
 gain a tremendous amount of power in a short amount of time. And we talk about a major category storm like Helene is expected to become that really 
 
 changes where people can hunker down. 
 
You're not talking about just power being out, tree limbs being downed, it becomes a question of where you can ride out a storm. And for many people 
 
 who live close to the coast being in their homes will no longer be an option. They will have to get away from the coast.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
They say that you hide from the wind and you run from the water. And the kind of storm surge that is expected to be generated by Helene, you know, 
 
 is very, very scary and it will cause structural damage. It becomes a matter where people need to get away from the coast, get to shelters or 
 
 authorities. Both in Cuba and in the United States are warning people to take -- to keep a close eye on this and get prepared -- be prepared to 
 
 evacuate if need be.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. And we want everybody to stay safe. Patrick Oppmann, great to have you with us. Thank you. We'll keep watching it.
 
Let's get to Chad Myers now. Because I know, Chad, you're watching this obviously too. What can we expect at this stage?
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, we'll start with John, because John really is still a catastrophic event for here in Southwestern Mexico, from 
 
 Puerto Escondido all the way over now to Acapulco. And I will show you how Acapulco was now in the mix from this.
 
It is now only a 35-mile per hour event, the remnant of what was a Category 3 that made landfall yesterday. But it's hours, in fact, days of heavy 
 
 rainfall that's going to stay in the same place. And talk about Acapulco, this is why I'm talking about it because the white area, here still to 
 
 come, 20 inches. That's 500 millimeters of rainfall still to come from this.
 
And if you put that much water uphill from Acapulco, all of that water has to run downhill. Now, sure, it's kind of sparsely populated through here. 
 
 But there's 850,000 people in Acapulco. And obviously, some tourists as well.
 
Now, getting back to what Patrick was talking, about Pinal del Rio, right there where a lot of Cuban tobacco was grown, they're going to get an awful 
 
 lot of rainfall in a time of the year where they don't really want it. And then the storm is going to run at Cancun. So, yes, likely a hurricane by 
 
 the time it does get to Cancun tomorrow and then into significantly warm and not only warm water, Julia, but deep warm water for hundreds of feet.
 
This water is still above 80 degrees, 85 degrees, you know, 32 degrees, 33 degrees Celsius. So, this is an awful lot of energy that Patrick was 
 
 talking about that this storm is going to have. Could it get stronger than Category 3? Sure. Could it be still only a Category 2? Absolutely. We're 
 
 still talking more than 48 hours before this actually makes landfall, but hurricane warnings are obviously already posted for Mexico Beach almost all 
 
 the way down to Tampa.
 
And yes, there's going to be surge. So, three to five meters worth of surge. Ten to 15 feet of surge here in this -- well, almost like a 
 
 catcher's mitt. The water's not going to have anywhere to go. When the storm is going to push up into this angular area, all that water is going 
 
 to get trapped there and go up the rivers. And even on the east coast, I think we're going to see some surge for places like Savannah, Jacksonville, 
 
 maybe all the way up toward Hilton Head as maybe three feet of surge there.
 
Now, yesterday, we showed you this where the GFS model, the American model, was so far stronger than the European model. And we were saying, man, let's 
 
 just hope the European model is right because the GFS is Cat-4, Cat-5 edge. So, now, look, the GFS has calmed down. It is not Cat-4 or Cat-5 anymore, 
 
 but still, 110 to 115 miles per hour. So, upwards of 180 kilometers per hour coming on shore.
 
The next big thing with this, Julia, is the rainfall. There will be between 250 and 350 millimeters of rain that comes down into places like Georgia, 
 
 North Carolina, the mountains even of South Carolina. We don't need that kind of rainfall. And here's the area here from North of Atlanta, 
 
 everywhere that you see pink is 10 inches of rain, 12 inches of rain, and in some spots more.
 
And this is all going to -- again, in this hilly area, going to run down and possibly make flash flooding. That could be a huge concern for us. Yes, 
 
 there'll be waves in the Gulf of Mexico, 30 feet, you know, I mean, OK, eight meters, nine meters. But this isn't the first storm to hit this area. 
 
 In fact, just in August, Debby ran right through the same area.
 
So, a lot of infrastructure is already fragile. Trees are already very wet. And if you put that kind of wind into a soil that is soggy mud, I'm afraid 
 
 we're going to have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of customers without power. Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Wow. OK. We'll continue to watch it. And I have to say, there's always unhealthy competition between the Americans and the Europeans, but 
 
 in this case, we hope that the Europeans win.
 
MYERS: We love both of the models. You just can't add them together and divide by two. It just doesn't work that way.
 
CHATTERLEY: No, it's somewhere in the middle. Chad, thank you, as always. Chad Myers there. We'll back up to this. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." Earlier this month, four civilians embarked on a dangerous mission. The crew of SpaceX's Polaris 
 
 Dawn flying further into space than anyone else in half a century. Commander Jared Isaacman actually left the mission capsule completing the 
 
 first ever commercial spacewalk. Only an experimental suit between him and the vacuum of space, the mission offers an exciting glimpse into the future 
 
 of space travel.
 
And CEO Elon Musk is promising more. Just this week, Musk said he plans to send starships to Mars in two years' time. It's certainly a lofty goal. 
 
 SpaceX client NASA is still working on returning to the moon.
 
Well, anyway, I'm pleased to say we're joined now by Jared Isaacman. He's the Polaris Storm mission commander and the CEO of Shift4. Jared, welcome 
 
 to the show. It's incredibly exciting to have you with us and to have you back down on Earth.
 
You told my colleague this weekend, which stood out to me that effectively four people went on this trip, but you took, I think, 14,000 people with 
 
 you. Such was the sheer effort that it took to get you there. I mean, this was an enormous team effort.
 
JARED ISAACMAN, CEO, SHIFT4 AND MISSION COMMANDER, SPACEX POLARIS DAWN MISSION: Yes, there's no question. I mean, there is a reason why it's been 
 
 more than a half century since we went that far into space. I mean, it's a very hostile environment up there. There's lots of radiation. There's 
 
 debris and micro meteoroids, which is dangerous. No one is built a new space suit that you can do a spacewalk in in more than 40 years.
 
So, there were a lot of big firsts here on this mission, which is great, because this is all in the direction of getting back to the moon and Mars 
 
 and really, you know, kind of opening up this last great frontier. But it takes an army. There's 14,000 of some of the brightest minds in the world 
 
 here at SpaceX that show up to work every day, believing there's no greater contribution they can make then kind of embarking on this amazing adventure 
 
 to make life multiplanetary. And we may stand to learn an awful lot along the way.
 
CHATTERLEY: I mean, it takes an army, it also takes a lot of money as well. And we'll come back to that. But I want to ask if you were frightened. As 
 
 you said, I mean, this was a lot of experimental aspects to this. You had a short window. You needed perfect weather to get back home. You were wearing 
 
 suits that we haven't really updated in, what, almost four decades. So, that was a huge part of the science and the experiment here. Were you 
 
 afraid? Were your family afraid?
 
ISAACMAN: You know, we trained for two and a half years for this mission. We had an incredible crew, you know, with me, including two very bright 
 
 SpaceX engineers that actually became the women who have journeyed farthest from this planet, which is pretty awesome.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
But we have a lot of confidence in SpaceX. This was my second mission. I mean, this is the company that, you know, brings science fiction to reality 
 
 that lands rockets on ships. So, you know, for sure there's risks when you kind of venture outside your comfort zone, but we understood those risks 
 
 and we planned for them really well and everybody delivered just as expected.
 
CHATTERLEY: I feel like you're being very diplomatic and the people around you were probably very scared, but we'll leave it there. How did you feel 
 
 physically? Because, you know, I've read that around half of the people that actually make trips like this feel pretty terrible because there's 
 
 nothing natural about a zero-gravity environment, even though the human body is pretty incredible at adapting. How did you feel physically?
 
ISAACMAN: You know, that's spot on. That's kind of one of the exciting things now about actually, you know, having space open up to commercial 
 
 astronauts and not just kind of, you know, government missions is for a longest time, 60 years, you know, your main -- you're kind of maintaining 
 
 this hero image of astronauts. The reality is throughout 60 years of human space flight, you know, 50 percent of astronauts who get on orbit feel 
 
 terrible. I mean, really horrible. And they have to be treated with medication.
 
I mean, it's all because of the fluid shifts in your body. And this kind of goes to the heart of so much of the science and research that we were 
 
 undertaking on this mission, because we do believe in a world where space and this last frontier is open for everyone, but we want people to be 
 
 healthy and happy when they're up there and actually able to construct and repair and build this kind of exciting future for tomorrow.
 
So, I've been up twice, and both times, the odds played out exactly right, where 50 percent didn't feel so well. But you know, we trained for those 
 
 medical contingencies, got everyone feeling great and got on with the mission.
 
CHATTERLEY: We have to get on with, as you said, working out how we improve much of this, whether it's the physical aspect and how it impacts, but also 
 
 the science of simply getting there. Do you think Mars in two years is possible? I mean, I'd love to think it is, but surely, we've got a lot more 
 
 science to work on until we're in a position where we can healthily take people to Mars. Let's get to the moon first.
 
ISAACMAN: Yes. You know what, I mean, SpaceX is a brilliant organization. Again, they bring things from science fiction movies into reality. And when 
 
 -- I've seen them now, you know, for more than four years and when they concentrate all their energies and resources to solving major engineering 
 
 problems, they get it done.
 
So, I think Elon sets out some aggressive timelines always to motivate people. Do I think some uncrewed, you know, test missions could be flown to 
 
 Mars in the next couple of years? Sure. But SpaceX can't solve all those problems. To your point, I mean, there's medical things, there's suits, 
 
 there's psychological implications. We haven't done surgery in space. You know, you -- there are a lot of major problems. We don't even know what 
 
 kind of really our space economy is that necessitates lots of people, you know, in space or on Mars other than it's probably the right thing to do 
 
 for humankind.
 
So, SpaceX is solving some big problems, but it's going to take like literally contributions from dreamers all over the world to get us there.
 
CHATTERLEY: Something you said when you were up there, you know, we have a lot of work to do back on the ground, but it looks pretty perfect from 
 
 here. And it goes to the money because it wouldn't be possible to be anywhere near where we are today without the private investment like yours 
 
 that is really, I think, pushing the standard and pushing us forward.
 
But there are a lot of people that would look at what you said and say, you know, your right in many ways, there are so many things that we need to fix 
 
 on Earth. Why are we spending so much money pushing this? What do you say to those people, Jared? Because I'm sure there are people watching this 
 
 that do wonder as exciting as it is.
 
ISAACMAN: It's such a great point. I mean, I totally agree. I mean, it's why we wear the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital patch on our flight 
 
 suit. It's why we spend time connecting, you know, schools and hospitals all around the world with Starlink technology. I mean, we absolutely have 
 
 to take care of a lot of the real problems we have here on Earth.
 
Like, there's real hardships and suffering everywhere, but we also have to build a brighter future for our children tomorrow. Look, there are -- there 
 
 would have been multiple extinction level events here on Earth had humans existed at a different time period. The dinosaurs aren't around anymore. I 
 
 mean, we have the technical means, you know, to make life a multiplanetary civilization. It's kind of an obligation to do so.
 
And the best part is it is being privately and commercially funded right now. I mean, during the space race of the '60s, that was four and a half 
 
 percent of U.S. GDP was being funded by taxpayers. And we accomplished some amazing things. I think it's OK for private industry to shoulder some of 
 
 the burden and for the benefit of all humankind.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I love it. And I love your point there, actually, about this is not all public money anymore, and the private sector can do as it 
 
 will and do it actually far more economically sound than the public sector can do too.
 
Very quickly, you said the first thing you wanted to eat when you came back down was a cheeseburger. How did that cheeseburger taste? And how many more 
 
 have you eaten since you got back?
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
ISAACMAN: Well, I've had more than one. I can tell you that. And, you know, we spent five days there not a lot of sleep, just trying to get through all 
 
 the science and research. And you don't need a whole lot in that tiny spaceship. But when we came back to Earth, I think we all had something on 
 
 our mind that we wanted to take down. And for me, it was a great cheeseburger. So -- 
 
CHATTERLEY: Jared, look forward to talking to you more and seeing what comes next. Congratulations once again. Jared Isaacman, there, Polaris Dawn 
 
 mission commander. Thank you, sir. We're back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move." Now, you won't find Macau International Airport on the list of the world's top 20 airports. In fact, 
 
 it doesn't even crack the top 50. However, 25 years after its handover from Portugal back to China, Macau has its sights set on growth. Marc Stewart 
 
 takes us to our next stop, Macau.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Welcome to Macau International Airport.
 
SIMON CHAN, CHAIRMAN, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, MACAU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT: Basically, to Macau, more than aviation. It's brand-new. We'll do it from 
 
 ground up.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Built on reclaimed land on the eastern side of the Macau Peninsula, the airport began operating in 1995 with one terminal, 10 
 
 gates and a single runway. Macau International Airport is one of the smallest major airports in Southern China. Still, its conception was a huge 
 
 source of pride for the small region.
 
Flag carrier, Air Macau, is based here, mainly serving Mainland China. Since the disruption of the pandemic in 2019, the airport has only 
 
 recovered nearly 80 percent of pre-pandemic passenger traffic, observers say.
 
BRENDAN SOBIE, FOUNDER, SOBIE AVIATION: What they're missing is those after markets, particularly Korea, but also Taiwan, you know, Philippines, 
 
 Malaysia, all these other markets are down, Thailand. And these were kind of their main markets pre-COVID in terms of after China, and which is 
 
 obviously their -- by far, their largest markets.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Overshadowed by nearby cities in both size and capacity, Simon says Macau and its airport need a unique strategy to grow.
 
CHAN: Macau is a small city, but connectivity is very important. So, besides expanding the airports, the. interconnectivity between Macau 
 
 Airports and the city around are very important.
 
STEWART (voice-over): Macau is linked to nearby Hong Kong and Zhuhai through a 55-kilometer sea crossing bridge.
 
SOBIE: What that does is it opens up a lot of opportunities to kind of attract passengers or tourists or visitors from visiting multiple 
 
 destinations in the region. But it also makes it easier for somebody heading from -- to one destination to use an airport in another 
 
 destination.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
STEWART (voice-over): New routes are being added and the airport has announced plans for expansion, which is due for completion in 2030. 
 
 Although, it's unlikely it will outgrow its neighbors, operators at this little airport say it still has a big role to play in the region.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: And finally, on "First Move," a new study has revealed something we didn't know about octopuses, apart from the fact the plural of 
 
 octopus is not necessarily octopi. Normally, a solitary creature, they actually work with fish to hunt, according to animal behavior experts. And 
 
 what's even more surprising is that they'll punch the other fish if they don't cooperate.
 
Let's just take a closer look at some of the punching incidents. Wow. Pow. Yes. The German researchers revealed how the octopus is the brains of the 
 
 operation when it comes to those hunting decisions. It's a case of get out of my way. But don't get on their bad side, of course, because clearly, 
 
 they're well-armed. See what I did there? Unwilling to get physical. Wow.
 
Now, that just about wraps up the show. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.
