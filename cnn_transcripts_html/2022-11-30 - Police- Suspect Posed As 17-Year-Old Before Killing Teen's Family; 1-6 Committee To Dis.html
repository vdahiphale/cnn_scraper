ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Hello everyone, I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Victor Blackwell.
 
We begin with an urgent warning to parents from the family of three people murdered in their California home after their teenager was apparently catfished by an online predator. Police say 28-year-old Austin Lee Edwards killed a teen girl's mother and grandparents. They say he set their home on fire after he posed as a 17-year-old boy online and developed a relationship with the 15-year-old.
 
CAMEROTA: The investigation is ongoing, but we do know this man was recently hired by a Virginia sheriff's office after working as a state trooper there. He was caught after driving to the girl's home in California when a neighbor called in to report his license plate number. Hours later, he died in a shootout with police. Today, family members pleaded with other parents to monitor their children's online activity.

MICHELLE BLANDIN, SISTER AND DAUGHTER OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS: This horrific event started with an inappropriate online romance between a predator and a child. Please parents, guardians, when you are talking to your children about the dangers of their online actions, please use us as a reference. Tell our story to help your parenting.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMEROTA: CNN's Josh Campbell is following this story for us. Josh, what do we know about the 15-year-old girl who survived?
 
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alisyn, we're told that she didn't suffer physical harm in this horrific incident but she's suffered significant emotional and mental trauma. She remains in Child Protective Services custody at this hour. Police told us just a short time ago that they haven't yet done a full interview with her because she's obviously been through so much. They're only able to sit down with her for short periods of time. But they're trying to piece together how this incident actually transpired.
 
We're told by authorities that they believe this 28-year-old former Virginia police officer engaged in this scheme that's called catfishing. That's when someone is communicating with someone else online pretending to be another person. Authorities tell us that this former officer was trying to convey that he was a 17-year-old, a teenager. He makes a drive from Virginia here to Southern California, and Friday is when tragedy strikes.
 
Police say that a neighbor called 911 after they saw this 15-year-old minor being led to a vehicle in a suspicious manner. Authorities were later able to locate that vehicle. They engage in an altercation with the suspect. He is shot and killed. Again, the 15-year-old was not physically harmed, but they're still trying to piece together how this relationship began, and the exact nature of this relationship. Authorities spoke just a short time ago. Take a listen.

RYAN RAILSBACK, RIVERSIDE POLICE OFFICER: We don't know yet if she was threatened or coerced. We're not describing it as a kidnapping at this point. But we also don't have any reason to believe that she was complicit in any of these murders or the fire as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CAMPBELL: I was just talking with detectives inside the Riverside police department here and they tell us that it's that online trove of evidence that they hope will help them answer so many of these questions. They're describing this as the digital crime scene. There was obviously the physical crime scene were after this suspect fled, authorities later found the dead bodies of this 15-year-old's grandparents as well as her mother in the incident. That's the physical crime scene. But they're trying to look at the digital evidence as well to determine how did this relationship begin. And also, they're trying to figure out whether this suspect had other potential targets out there -- other potential victims, Victor, Alisyn.
 
BLACKWELL: Clearly, a lot of work to do there. Josh Campbell for us. Thank you, Josh.
 
CAMEROTA: So, Congress is one step closer to stopping a nationwide rail strike. In the last hour, the House approved a tentative agreement for rail unions, averting the strike.
 
BLACKWELL: One analysis forecast to strike would cost the U.S. economy a billion dollars in the first week alone. Let's go now to CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju. So, we're going to begin with the breaking details though that the House has just made some changes to this bill. They're adding some provisions. Tell us about them.
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. That is paid sick leave. That is something that this agreement that was reached in September. A tentative agreement was silent on for railway workers. But it's something that folks had -- the unions have been demanding that a lot of Democrats have been demanding.
 
But this bill was approved in two steps. The first step in the Senate, 290 -- in the House, 290-137 was the vote in the House. 79 Republicans voted for it. Eight Democrats voted against it. Now, that is just the real agreement without that paid sick leave.
 
Then, the House approved in the second step and amendment that would allow -- require paid sick leave for those workers -- those railway workers. But here's the catch. And it now goes to the United States Senate and the process they loot -- use essentially allows us to ignore the paid sick leave provisions and allowing it to pass the tentative agreement said -- absent those issues -- of controversial issues because it would almost certainly not have enough support to pass the United States Senate.
 <br>[14:05:06]
 
So, that's what we expect on the Senate side. They still need to reach an agreement to schedule a vote. Democratic leaders want to have a vote this week. They're concerned about the next week's deadline that could cause a strike if they don't act soon enough. Perhaps we can see some impacts in the economy as soon as this weekend. So, they want to get something passed by Thursday.
 
But that requires an agreement of all 100 senators to set a vote. One senator, Bernie Sanders, along with some others, like Senator John Hickenlooper, want an amendment that would require paid sick leave for those workers. But that amendment almost certainly will fail, meaning that the bill that will ultimately pass would implement that tentative agreement, the bill that Joe Biden has been calling for, but after a bumpy ride, and after both sides have raised concerns about this process, but ultimately it looks on a path to clear Congress as soon as this week.
 
CAMEROTA: OK, Manu. And now, tell us about the Democrats' new leadership team.
 
RAJU: Yes. We have a new slate of leaders, a new generation of leaders after Nancy Pelosi announced that she would no longer lead the caucus that she has dominated for the past two decades. Today, Hakeem Jeffries, the Brooklyn Democrat, someone who is currently a member of the Democratic caucus -- leadership was elected by unanimous -- unanimously by his caucus to lead the Democratic minority next year. He will be -- he will be the first black leader of any caucus in Congress ever in American history, a historic pick.
 
He will also be followed by Katherine Clark as the number two. She's a new person to this position. She's replacing Steny Hoyer, who is the current number two. The number three will be Pete Aguilar of California, who will also replace Jim Clyburn, who is the current number three. Now, this all comes as the -- as the Democrats preparing for their new chapter, not just a new generation, but also their new role in the minority.
 
And one thing that Hakeem Jeffries said to reporters just moments ago is that this will be a temporary majority for the Republicans. He contended. The Democrats -- he said they're preparing to relinquish control temporarily, which shows you what the focus will be on the next two years. Democrats believe they can get back into the House majority in 2024. And undoubtedly, that will be gold number one of the new Democratic leadership team just elected today, guys.
 
CAMEROTA: OK. Manu Raju, thank you.
 
BLACKWELL: There were more than 25 reports of tornadoes in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi last night. Officials report at least two people were killed in Alabama as the tornadoes packed winds as high as 110 miles per hour.
 
CAMEROTA: CNN's Ryan Young is live in Lowndes County, Mississippi, where several people lost their homes. So, Ryan, what are you seeing?
 
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the damage is pretty extensive. We found one of the tracks with a storm. If you look behind me, you can see what's left of the Volunteer fire department. They set up their emergency operation just on the edge of where we're standing. That's because the path of the tornado came through this area.
 
And we're going to kind of walk as fast as possible so you guys can see just the layout here. This was the fire department. The tornado sirens were going. It got blown off its actual perch, and you can see it down there. But all the damage, if you just look here to the left is unbelievable.
 
We talked to a woman who was inside one of these homes, and she said she was terrified by the sounds, her family members, some of them crying. Rescue operations had to happen in this area. You can see the massive cleanup here. Power lines knocked down throughout this entire area.
 
But if you look at the middle of that trailer right there, the woman who was in -- who was inside before leaving to go to her son's house says she doesn't know she's going to be able to rebuild. This is a property that she's lived in for the last 10 years. And you can see the amount of damage just left behind. In fact, take a listen to her talking about just how terrifying last night was.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: What was that sound like last night?
 
MARY PERKINS, LOWNDES COUNTY RESIDENT WHO LOST HOME: Like a train coming through. I've always heard that and it really was like that. We heard it coming. It was real scary. I hope I can afford a trailer to get back in. I mean, that's my choice. As old as I am, I don't like about building a house for nothing so I hope for a trailer.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOUNG: Yes. And when I tell you the debris around this area is just immense. And you can look at this truck that was crushed by the weight of one of those large pine trees. This truck still drives amazingly. I guess it's a Chevy, still moves. But if you come back in this direction, you can just see what these neighbors are dealing with. They've been coming out to help their friends and have conversations about how terrifying last night was.
 
We actually talked to the Fire administrator. He said they did have several rescues in this area. Luckily, no deaths here. You talked about, of course, those deaths in Alabama.
 
But this cleanup effort is still ongoing. Look at these massive power lines that are down throughout this area. They're really trying to make sure people stay saved. This one obviously has been cut off. And the power crews are working as we speak on these high-tension lines. But as you think about this, the idea that late last night, people were dealing with this and terrified inside their homes with nowhere to go, those storms popping over and over again. It's a night that a lot of people here said they won't forget.
 <br>[14:10:08]
 
And on top of all that, guys, the folks here, they offered us something to eat and drink today, despite all that they lost.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, I'm often surprised. You know, I worked down in the southeast region for so many years, the hospitality of these communities after they go through something like this. Ryan Young, they got a lot of work to do there. Thank you so much for the report.
 
CAMEROTA: So, after more than one thousand interviews, the January 6 committee is wrapping up witness testimony today. Members will meet this week to discuss potential criminal referrals. We have new details for you next.
 
BLACKWELL: And a jury convicts members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group for their role in the insurrection. Attorney General Merrick Garland will speak about it a short time from now.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:15:10]
 
BLACKWELL: Sources tell CNN that the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss potential criminal referrals.
 
CAMEROTA: After more than a thousand interviews, Chairman Bennie Thompson says the panel will sit down with its final witness today. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now. So, Katelyn, is their work done?
 
KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: They're getting to the end. They're not totally done yet. But this is indeed the final interview today with the Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. That's what the committee chairman confirmed. And on Friday is going to be a very crucial meeting, the one that has been hotly debated what the committee will do, what will emerge out of it.
 
What is happening on Friday is a subcommittee of the House Select Committee will meet and they will discuss options for criminal referrals. So, this is reporting that comes from Annie Grayer, Jamie Gangel, and Zac Cohen on the Hill for CNN. And what those subcommittee members are going to be discussing at that meeting is how they could present evidence of possible crimes, including obstruction, perjury, witness tampering, the sort of things that may have arisen during their investigation that the Justice Department doesn't know about already and that they're going to want to let the Justice Department know in case there could be a prosecution that arises out of it.
 
Now, of course, some of these things may be symbolic in nature, specifically, if the House committee recommends a criminal investigation or prosecution of Donald Trump. That is something that the Justice Department already would be potentially weighing. But there are things that this committee may want the Justice Department to be looking at as they wind down head into the sunset, the Congress ends, and the Justice Department committee -- the Justice Department investigation continues on.
 
BLACKWELL: All right, Katelyn, CNN was first to report. This is your scoop that former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller testified to a grand jury investigating January 6 Capitol riot. What do we know?
 
POLANTZ: Right. Well, Stephen Miller did testify yesterday to a grand jury in Washington, a federal grand jury looking at criminal the criminal case -- potential criminal cases around January 6. So, this is the team of prosecutors that are going to be working with special counsel Jack Smith. And Miller is the first person, that we know of, that would have gone before this grand jury after Smith's appointment. So, it really shows us that investigators continue to pace along, trying to get witnesses, trying to get documents, trying to get testimony at a steady clip, along with Smith coming into the team as the leader of this investigation, potentially making charging decisions.
 
And Miller is really a key person around Donald Trump who could give insight into Trump's thinking, his intent, and everything he wanted to do and say especially on January 6. He was the speech writer working with Trump preparing that speech on the Ellipse that Trump gave to all of his supporters who then went to the Capitol and tried to stop Congress from certifying the election, Victor and Alisyn.
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, a crucial witness. Katelyn Polantz, thank you.
 
Next hour, Attorney General Merrick Garland will speak about the verdict in the trial of several members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group. Yesterday, a jury convicted the group's leader and an associate on charges of sedition -- seditious conspiracy for their roles in the January 6 Capitol riot.
 
CAMEROTA: Garland will also discuss the latest on efforts to get safe drinking water in Jackson, Mississippi. CNN's Evan Perez is at the Justice Department for us. So, do we know exactly what he plans to say?
 
EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alisyn, this is going to be a big day for the Attorney General. He had to -- he personally signed off on bringing these seditious conspiracy charges. There was a bit of a debate inside this building as to whether to do this as a rarely brought charge. And obviously, the fact that the prosecutors were able to pull that off yesterday with a jury is a big thing for the department going forward with other investigations, with other prosecutions, including of the Proud Boys, other members of the Oath Keepers. We're going to hear from the Attorney General thanking their prosecution team on that.
 
The other thing, as you mentioned, in Jackson, Mississippi situation, the Justice Department is going to appoint a third party to help manage the water system in that municipality, which has obviously been a huge problem in Mississippi with people not having safe drinking water. That's something that the Justice Department believes is a civil rights issue for the African American community in that city. So, those are two things that the attorney general has on his mind. We, of course, expect that he's going to take questions, Alisyn and Victor, and we're going to be sure to ask a bunch of them.
 
CAMEROTA: OK, we'll take that live as well. Evan Perez, thank you very much.
 
BLACKWELL: Several major cities in China are looking to lift some of the strict lockdown measures after days of demonstrations. So, are the protests working?
 
CAMEROTA: And it sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. San Francisco officials approved a controversial policy to let police use robots to kill suspects. We'll tell you more.
 <br>[14:20:10]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CAMEROTA: American Paul Whelan has reportedly been moved to a Russian prison hospital and has not contacted his family for a week. His brother, David Whelan, says an e-mail from the penal colony where he was held claimed that he had been moved to the hospital almost two weeks ago.
 <br>[14:25:06]
 
Whelan's family says he had not been complaining of any health conditions. His brother says Paul had called family members or the U.S. Embassy daily but missed a scheduled call on Thanksgiving. A State Department spokesperson says the embassy is pressing for updates on his location and condition.
 
BLACKWELL: Secretary of State Antony Blinken today condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin for targeting Ukraine's power grid.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: And what we're seeing, to put it in one word, is barbaric. And precisely because Putin is not able to succeed on the battlefield, he's taking the war to Ukraine civilians. And he's doing it in a very deliberate way, going after the entire energy and electric infrastructure to turn off the lights, to turn off the water, to turn off the heat. And that at a time when, of course, Ukraine is heading into winter.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACKWELL: Blinken also vowed that U.S. support for Ukraine will not change. But some House Republicans have said there will be more scrutiny over any additional funding proposals once they take control in January. CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger is with us now. Good to see you, David.
 
Let's start here with the conversation over funding. And I want to begin with the incoming Republican Chair of House Foreign Affairs. This is Representative Michael McCaul on Sunday on the future of funding the support for Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, (R-TX): The fact is we are going to provide more oversight transparency, and accountability. We're not going to write a blank check. Does that diminish our will to help the Ukrainian people fight? No. That -- we're going to do it in a responsible way.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BLACKWELL: So, that's what we're hearing from McCaul. We've heard something similar from McCarthy. But there are some Republicans who say not another dime -- another penny for Ukraine. What do you expect from this intra-party fight on support for Ukraine?
 
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, first, good to see you, Victor, and thanks for having me on. This is a fascinating turn for the Republican Party because in the Republican Party that we knew in the Cold War, and even the post-Cold War period, they would have been the first and most vociferous of pushing back at Vladimir Putin. And in fact, during the Obama administration, argued that Obama wasn't doing enough after the takeover of Crimea.
 
But the party is now gone through four years of Donald Trump's America Firstism. And I think there are some led by speaker -- future speaker McCarthy, who basically take the view that we've spent enough. And so, the Democrats suddenly are going to become the hawkish party on Russia, and the Republicans, I think are going to be split.
 
Does that mean that there's going to be greater scrutiny? I'm sure there is in a place like Ukraine where there's been a lot of corruption historically. I'm sure there's a need for a lot more oversight. I think the Biden administration's fear is that those efforts will be translated as a lack of enthusiasm for backing the Ukrainians in a moment that they're really making some inroads.
 
BLACKWELL: The sausage-making might be ugly, but when we talk about what actually reaches Ukraine, do you expect there will be a difference noticed there?
 
SANGER: There may be some and it may have less to do with arms, Victor, than it does for our general support for their government which burns through about $5 billion a month. And there's been a lot of concern that other Western allies aren't contributing quite as much as the U.S. had expected that they would. I think that will be one category.
 
I think the other big decisions actually belong to the Biden administration about whether or not they're going to give longer-range weaponry to the Ukrainians. President Biden has been very cautious about getting anything that could reach deep inside Russia. But the fact of the matter is that many of these attacks are standoff attacks from inside Russia.
 
BLACKWELL: Let's turn to China now and the protests. Shanghai is lifting lockdowns in 11 districts. Is this evidence that the protests are working?
 
SANGER: Well, it depends on what you think the protests are about. I think they were obviously immediately prompted by the lockdown requirements. And I think that there are many in Shanghai and other parts of the country who are eager to begin to lift them not only because of the protests but because it's bad for business. And because other countries in their neighborhood, including Japan and South Korea, have really come to a strategy more like what we've seen in the United States and the West.
 
But I think the second question is how much of this protest is really about censorship.</pre>
