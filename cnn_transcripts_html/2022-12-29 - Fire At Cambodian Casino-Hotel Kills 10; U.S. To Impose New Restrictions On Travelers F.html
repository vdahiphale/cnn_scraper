KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world, live from Hong Kong, I'm Kristie Lee Stout, and this is CNN Newsroom.
 
A blast from the past. Nations around the world are reinstating COVID restrictions on China. Will it be enough to halt the spread?
 
International extreme weather, the hottest year on record for the UK as the death toll in the U.S. climbs. And an exclusive conversation with the King of Jordan what he thinks it will take to bring peace to the region.
 
Those stories in just a moment. But first, a huge fire has killed at least eleven people at a casino in Cambodia. With some people, they're so desperate to get out, they leapt to their deaths. This is according to a rescue worker who spoke to CNN after flames engulfed the structure on Wednesday night. He says that he saw two people die when they jumped from the building, while other people suffered broken legs. 
 
The casino, which contains a hotel, is located near the Thai border, so emergency crews from both countries rushed into help. The rescue worker also says that crews are still searching hotel rooms for more victims. We will continue to follow this story and bring you more updates when we have them.
 
Now, with as COVID cases surge in China, the United States will soon require all travelers from that country, including Hong Kong and Macau, to test negative for COVID-19 before flying to the US. They are the latest officials to announce such a restriction, joining the likes of Japan, India, Taiwan and more who have similar measures in place.
 
European Union officials are set to discuss their own possible action on the matter in the coming hours, starting January 5 travelers to the U.S. must be tested no sooner than two days before flying, and they'll have to show proof of that negative test before they can board and the supplies, not just to Chinese citizens, but anyone who's been to China within ten days of their flight. 
 
Here in Hong Kong, officials have dropped the need for incoming travelers to take a COVID test along with other prevention measures. Now, this means no more limits on public gatherings or proof of vaccination to enter public spaces. Hong Kong's top leader, Chief Executive John Lee, says he is confident in the city's vaccination rate and level of immunity against the virus.
 
But one thing that has not changed here is the mask mandate. Face masks are still required outdoors and in all public venues. CNN's Selina Wang is in Beijing with more on the new travel restrictions imposed by the US. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): As China finally abandoned zero COVID and starts to open up, other countries are putting in place restrictions on travelers from the country. The U.S. will require all travelers from China to show a negative COVID test result before flying to the US. Before we got this official announcement, Beijing responded to potential travel restrictions from the U.S. by defending its COVID policy, accusing Western media for hyping up China's COVID policy change, and by urging countries to work together.
 
This is what else the Ministry of affairs spokesperson had to say. Quote, China has always believed that the measures taken by countries to prevent the epidemic should be scientific and moderate and should not affect normal people to people exchanges.
 
Now, the irony here is that since the start of a pandemic, China has had some of the strictest border controls in the world. But now that the country is finally easing up and cases are surging, other countries are getting nervous. 
 
In addition to the U.S., Japan, India, Taiwan have put COVID testing requirements in place. In fact, Taiwan and Japan say if the traveler from China tests positive for COVID upon arrival, they'll have to quarantine for several days. Now, China has stopped reporting daily COVID cases on a national level. It's severely narrowed its definition of COVID deaths, only reporting a handful of COVID deaths for the entire month.
 
But Beijing says, look, everything is under control. Yet we know that hospitals are overflowing with elderly patients, and crematoriums across the country are overwhelmed. Fever and cold medicine are scarce. The big concern from some countries like the U.S. is the lack of data from China that could help detect new variants.
 <br>[01:05:00]
 
GISAID, the global consortium that maintains a database of COVID sequences, has said, however, that China has ramped up the amount of data it's submitting, and that all the genome sequences shared so far closely resemble the variants already circulating in other parts of the world since July. But the U.S. says the data shared from China isn't enough. And look, it's not as if China has totally thrown open its own borders. China border still remains largely close to foreigners, apart from a limited number of business or family visits. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.

LU STOUT: We will have much more on this story later this hour, including my conversation with a public health expert on whether restrictions against travelers from China are really necessary.
 
Now, Catholic leaders, including Pope Francis, are urging the faithful to pray former Pope Benedict, who is reportedly very sick. He became Pope in 2005 and resigned only eight years later with a decision that shocked the world.
 
The Vatican has not shared any specific details about his current condition.
 
In 2020, the Vatican said that he had suffered from a, quote, painful but not serious condition. CNN's Delia Gallagher has further details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Prayers for a Pope in failing health. In his globally broadcast general audience, pope Francis called on the faithful to pray for his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict, as his health deteriorates. 
 
POPE FRANCIS, LEADER OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): I want to ask you all for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who sustains the church in his silence. He is very sick. We ask the Lord to console and sustain him in this witness of love for the Church to the very end. 
 
GALLAGHER: The Vatican says the 95 year old's health has deteriorated due to the advancement of his age and that he's being continually monitored by his doctors.
 
Once the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI has been living alongside his successor, Pope Francis, at the Vatican after making the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his role as Pope in 2013. Announcing that decision, Benedict said his choice to step down was made due to his lack of strength of body and mind. 
 
POPE BENEDICT XVI, FORMER HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH: The decision I have made after much prayer is the fruit of a serene trust in God's will, the deep love of Christ Church. I will continue to accompany the Church with my prayers, and I ask each of you to pray for me and for the new Pope. 
 
GALLAGHER: With that resignation, Pope Benedict became the first pope to step down in nearly 600 years, but retained his title and continued to dress in the papal white and make occasional public appearances.
 
Born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany and a childhood spent under the shadow of Hitler's Nazi regime, Pope Benedict XVI has sometimes been a divisive figure, unflatteringly referred to as God's Rottweiler in his conservative defense of the faith.
 
He was cardinal and Pope during the years when the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals came to light, and he spearheaded the Vatican's efforts towards a zero tolerance policy. However, after his retirement, he suffered a reputational blow when the church commissioned report found he knew and failed to act against a pedophile priest while he was archbishop in Munich 40 years ago. Benedict denied the allegations.
 
Even after his resignation, he continues to be a towering figure in the Catholic Church. And as his health declines, there'll be many sending him their thoughts and prayers. Delia Gallagher, CNN, Rome. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LU STOUT: I want to bring in CNN's Barbie Nadeau, who joins us live from Rome. Barbie is Pope Francis calls for prayers. What is known about the condition of the former pope? 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, we do know that he is still in his home where he's living inside the Vatican City walls. He lives in a monastery there. He's not in the hospital as far as we know. You know, this is really without precedent in terms of what we're going to get in terms of information.
 
Now, if this were Pope Francis, the active acting pope, we would probably be getting regular updates. It's not known how many updates we'll be getting on his health. We expect some news this morning, but it's by no means guaranteed.
 
We do know, though, that Pope Francis did visit him yesterday. It's unclear if he's got people around him. It's unclear really, what beyond his aging health, age -- age in general is inflicting him at this moment. But, you know, he's a 95-year-old frail man. When he retired 10 years ago, it was because he felt he was too frail to do the job. 
 
Ten years later, you know, a 95-year-old man in his condition, you know, this isn't entirely unexpected that he could be failing right now, as it were. 
 
LU STOUT: Barbie, we appreciate the update. Barbie Nadeau reporting live from Rome. Thank you.

Ukraine's president delivered a powerful speech in his annual address to parliament on Wednesday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked members of the country's armed forces calling them heroes for their fight against Russia's invasion. He honored a Ukrainian commander presenting him with a command coin from U.S. president Joe Biden. And President Zelenskyy told lawmakers that Russia's war in Ukraine has strengthened Europe's unity saying, quote no one in the west is afraid and will ever be afraid of Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Ukraine became one of the global leaders, our national colors are an international symbol of courage and invincibility of the whole world in any country, on any continent. When you see the blue and yellow, they know it is about freedom, about the people who did not surrender, who was stood, who united the world and who will win. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LU STOUT: Officials in Ukraine are urging residents to evacuate the southern city of Kherson as Russia continues to launch attacks. And residents tell CNN that many of the people who remain are taking care of elderly patients. Those who have fled the fighting say that Russia's constant shelling became unbearable. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more now from Keeve. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTENRATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Fighting grinds on in Ukraine along a largely unchanged front line. Russia's failures on the battlefield have pushed the Kremlin toward escalating strikes on civilian infrastructure. The latest target, maternity hospital in Kherson.
 
This is where we put women and children, says head obstetrician Ina Filofiva (ph). When the bombs fell, women fled to the basement with their newborn babies. 
 
We helped those who just gave birth, she says. They're the type of women who will go where they have to go with their children. Everyone was here and worked together very quickly. Somehow no one was hurt but the attack spreads fear among the few who remain.
 
I was thinking about that baby that was lying there, says Olena Yatsik (ph), another obstetrician, about our women, about the children we are welcoming to this world. It's all scary. We are giving birth here and someone is taking it away for what?
 
Whether from mortars, tanks, rockets or artillery, Kherson has felt the full force of Russian shelling in recent days. The southern Ukrainian city was liberated in November from occupying forces still eager to make their presence felt.
 
In Kyiv, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu met Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov (ph). The pair laid a wreath at the capital's Wall of Remembrance. 
 
According to the UN, as of December 26, 6,884 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the war began plus nearly 11,000 injured. And the UN says the actual number of dead is probably much higher. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Kyiv. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: The White House says it will not give up on American Paul Whelan who is behind bars in Russia. The statement was released on the fourth anniversary of his arrest in Moscow. The former U. S. Marine was sentenced to 16 years in prison for alleged espionage which he denies. Whelan was not included in two prisoner swaps in the U.S. conducted with Russia this year. 
 
In a message on Wednesday, his brother said, it's hard to mark the anniversary without any resolution in sight. U. S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also released a statement saying that he and President Joe Biden told Whelan's family that the U.S. will not stop until all Americans can celebrate Paul's return.
 
A Bolivian town is hit by a rare tornado. Just ahead, the damage it caused and how fast the wind's got. Plus, conditions are improving in Buffalo, New York, after the deadly blizzard, and stories of heroism and kindness are emerging.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:16:46]
 
LU STOUT: Welcome back. Now, at least five homes are damaged after a rare tornado hit western Bolivia. The storm formed on Tuesday in just a matter of minutes, lifting rooftops and knocking down walls. A video from witnesses showed the tornadoes circling above the nearby mountains.
 
And according to the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology, winds reached about 40 kilometers per hour. And we want you to check out this surreal scene in Canada, a town in Ontario's Niagara region, where streets of homes became encased in ice.
 
A state of emergency was declared in the area. And that blizzard hit parts of Canada and the U.S. over Christmas weekend with very strong winds, rain, and heavy snowfall.
 
Nearly a week after that, deadly blizzard began blasting Buffalo, New York, the city's ban on nonessential driving has finally been lifted. Major state highways in western New York have also reopened, but Buffalo remains under a travel advisory, with many roads still smothered by snow. 
 
Crews have been trying to clear at least one lane in every city street for emergency responders, but they have been hampered by hundreds of abandoned vehicles trapped in the snowbanks. Meanwhile, the death toll has grown to 37 in Erie County, and it could still rise. City leaders in charge of the emergency response are coming under fire. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BYRON BROWN, BUFFALO, NEW YORK MAYOR: People worked around the clock in this storm. People went without sleep in this storm. And the only thing I can make of that is that some people are breaking down. Some people are feeling the heat of the pressure of working this relentless storm.

LU STOUT: CNN Miguel Marquez brings us the latest from Buffalo. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Buffalo digging out. Officials here responding to criticism they should have done more. 
 
MARK POLONCARZ, ERIE COUNTY EXECUTIVE: 35 miles per hour wind gusts for 3 hours straight with less than a quarter mile visibility. This was an extreme blizzard, maybe the category five of blizzards. 
 
MARQUEZ: Casey Maccarone, mother Monique Alexander died in the storm on Christmas Eve. The Buffalo native, who had been through many snowstorms here, thought this one was the same. 
 
CASEY MACCARONE, MOTHER DIED IN STORM: We were waiting for her to come home. I knew something was wrong right away, though. 
 
MARQUEZ: A simple decision on any other day. Life threatening in this storm. 
 
MACCARONE: My kids, they lost their grandmother and that was her most important role in her life, was being a good grandmother. And now they just have memories. 
 
MARQUEZ: In Erie County alone, at least 37 killed in extreme weather in an area accustomed to major snowstorms.
 
For every person who died, dozens of stories of those who stepped up and saved friends, neighbors, even strangers. 
 
CRAIG ELSTON, OWNER, C and C CUTZ BARBERSHOP: This is something I always do. I help everybody. It's people out there dying. These people freezing it up in a car. 
 <br>[01:20:00]
 
MARQUEZ: Craig Elson was open for business when the extreme conditions started up. 
 
ELSTON: Well, if you need shelter, come to 707 at Phil Moore (ph). You get warm heat and electricity. 
 
MARQUEZ: He ended up hosting up to 40 people over two days at his C and C Cutz Barbershop. ELSTON: We got to come together, and a lot of times people are
 
 selfish. So at that moment, I was just thinking about clearly none of all this stuff, right? I was just thinking about just keeping people warm. It was really that simple. 
 
MARQUEZ: There was Sha'kyra Aughtry, who heard a man she didn't know screaming for help. 
 
SHA'KYRA AUGHTRY, HELPED SAVE FROSTBITTEN MAN IN BUFFALO: His hands had big ice balls on it. And with him having those ice balls on his hand, we brought him in my house. 
 
MARQUEZ: Joe White, who is developmentally disabled, lost in whiteout conditions. Aughtry didn't know him, but she saved him. 
 
AUGHTRY: We got to get some help. He has gang green on his hands. He's going to lose his ink. 
 
MARQUEZ: The airport is now reopened as Buffalo comes to grips with a brutal year. 
 
POLONCARZ: The tragic story is the losses of individuals in our community and it is heartbreaking. It's a gut punch. 2022 has been a horrible year for our community in so many different ways. I can't wait till 2023 starts. 
 
MARQUEZ (on camera): What is incredible in talking to these families of victims who died in this storm and people who survived the storm and wrote it out is just how quickly the conditions changed, just how bad it was, and just how rapidly their loved ones were lost in the storm and how quickly people could have died if they were out in it for any period of time.
 
Two concerns for authorities right now. Moving snow as quickly as possible now out of the drains, especially throughout the city, because they're concerned about higher temperatures in the days ahead and tons of melt water possibly creating some flooding, and then going house to house and figuring out if anyone else is in need or anyone else has expired. Back to you. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
LU STOUT: And that was Miguel Marquez reporting. Now, 2022 is set to become the UK's hottest year on record. And data from the Meteorological Office show that the average temperature is on track to beat the previous record of 9.88 degrees Celsius set in 2014.
 
Experts warn extreme weather will bring more death and destruction in the years ahead without a stronger climate response from the government.
 
Joining me now is Bob Ward. He is the policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Sir, thank you very much indeed for joining us here on CNN. As you've seen, the headline just on the papers across the UK today, 2022 is set to be the hottest year yet for the UK. Is this a result of human induced climate change? 
 
BOB WARD, GRANTHAM RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT: Undoubtedly, this is a pattern with all of our warmest years now piling up over the recent past and the reason this year has been the warmest is because we had an exceptionally hot summer with an extended period, heat waves, and our temperature reached 40 degrees one day in July for the first time ever.
 
It shocked scientists here because they knew that was due to come because of the impacts of climate change, but they didn't expect it to arrive so quickly. And it's part of a pattern across Europe. Europe had its hottest summer as well. Again, extended periods. These are not just warm days that people enjoyed. More than 20,000 people died across Europe as a result of the heat. More than 3,000 in the UK. It's having real impacts on lives and livelihoods. 
 
LU STOUT: Yes. And 2022 shaping up to be a year of weather extremes in the UK, Europe, elsewhere, and not just record heat, but record droughts and storms as well. 
 
WARD: That's correct. Parts of Western Europe had an extended drought during the summer that made things much worse. Dams, reservoirs were at low levels, making it difficult to generate hydro power, and some ships were having difficulty getting across rivers. And we've seen heat waves in China, but we also see heavy rainfall increasing. It might seem counterintuitive, but what happens is, as the atmosphere gets warmer, it can hold more moisture.
 
So you saw record downpours, particularly in Pakistan, where they had terrible flooding, which killed many people and left many parts of the country underwater and all that part of a pattern, as you said, of increased frequency and intensity of many extreme weather events across the world. 
 
LU STOUT: Yes, happening across Asia as well, as you point out, Pakistan and China. And what impact is all this having on our crops and habitats and biodiversity? You know, what is the overall impact on our planet? 
 <br>[01:25:04]
 
WARD: Well, it's having a devastating impact on wildlife as well. The problem is that crops, quite often, if they don't have enough water or if it's too hot, that you don't get the same yields. Europe had very much reduced crop yields this summer because it was so dry and so hot. That, of course, is causes problems not just in developed countries, but particularly in developing countries where it can lead to famine. In the Horn of Africa, they've been dealing with below average rainfall now for four years in a row. That's causing increased stress on their food supplies and raising the risks of famine greatly.
 
So, this is all due to climate change. Unless we cut our emissions of greenhouse gases rapidly and strongly, it's going to get worse. It's going to get worse until we get all of our emissions of greenhouse gases around the world essentially to zero. 
 
So we're going to have to start adapting to these impacts, but we have to cut our emissions very, very strongly, otherwise it will get so bad, it's just not going to be possible to cope.
 
LU STOUT: Action is needed. As climate change drives up global temperatures, governments around the world have promised to cut emissions to keep temperature rises below 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where do we stand right now in the ongoing global battle against the climate crisis? 
 
WARD: Well, there was a United Nations Climate Change Summit in Egypt in November where countries were supposed to come forward with more ambitious plans for cutting emissions. They didn't at the moment. Our emissions continue to go up every year, and we are on track at the moment where temperatures could exceed two Celsius degrees of warming by the end of this century. That would have devastating impacts around the world.
 
The countries have got to start moving much more quickly, otherwise we're going to be left with increasing damage to lives and livelihoods around the world, which are just going to be too difficult for us to deal with. Many lives and livelihoods destroyed and damaged and are just simply not going to be acceptable, I think. So, the public should contact their political representative and said, time for you to take this much more seriously than you are at the moment. 
 
LU STOUT: Absolutely. There's just simply too much at stake in the record that's apparently being broken this year could be easily broken next year. Looking at global trends. Bob Ward, we'll leave that. Sir, thank you very much indeed for joining us. 
 
WARD: Thank you. 
 
LU STOUT: You're watching CNN Newsroom, coming to you live from Hong Kong. And still to come, the U.S. joins a growing list of countries requiring incoming travelers from China to test for COVID-19. And I'll speak with a global health expert about the new restrictions. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:30:17] 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back. 
 
We want to return now to our top story. 
 
A huge fire has killed at least 11 people at a casino in Cambodia with some people, so desperate to get out that they leapt to their deaths. 
 
This is according to a rescue worker, who spoke to CNN, after flames engulfed the structure on Wednesday night. He says he saw two people die when they jumped from the building, while other people suffered broken legs. 
 
The casino, which contains a hotel, is located near the Thai border so emergency crews in both countries rushed in to help. The rescue worker, also tells CNN that crews are still searching hotel rooms for more victims. 
 
We will continue to follow this story and bring you more updates when we have them.  
 
And more now on the changing COVID restrictions around the world. And here in Hong Kong, lawmakers have scrapped most prevention measures, including proof of vaccination to enter public spaces and mandatory COVID tests for incoming travelers. Face masks still mandatory throughout the city. 
 
And meanwhile starting next week, the United States will require anyone who has been to China, Hong Kong or Macau within ten days to show proof of a negative COVID test before they can board a flight to the U.S. A rise in new infections in China has left U.S. officials concerned over exactly how many people there are sick. But Chinese officials say, nothing is out of the ordinary. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WANG WENBIN, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Countries adjusting the COVID policy would invariably go through a period of adaptation. China is no exception as we shift here in our COVID policy. 
 
China's COVID situation on the whole remains predictable and under control. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: Now CNN's Arlette Saenz has more on the new travel restrictions imposed by the U.S.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. will soon require negative tests for individuals traveling from China to the U.S. as health officials here are concerned about the rise in COVID-19 cases in China, as well as the lack of transparency in data regarding the situation. 
 
Now, these new travel rules are set to go into effect on January 5th. It would require the travelers get a negative COVID-19 test, no more than two days prior to their departure.
 
This must be a PCR test, or an antigen self test that's been administered by a tele-health service and one that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration here in the U.S. 
 
Now, this doesn't just apply to those traveling directly from China to the U.S. It would include those travelers who are, possibly, going through a third country. And so it would apply in airports like Seoul, Vancouver and Toronto as well.
 
Health officials say that they set this January 5th timeline, in order to give the airlines more time to set their operations in place, so they can implement this plan. Now this all comes as there has been a surge in COVID-19 cases in China. Since the elimination of its zero COVID policy -- a very strict policy, that has been in place since the start of the pandemic. 
 
But additionally, health officials say, they are concerned about the lack of transparency in the data that China is providing. And that includes data relating to the number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and also deaths. 
 
But officials are also specifically concerned with the lack of information coming from China regarding genome sequencing which is critical in identifying new variants. Officials are hoping that these new measures that are put in place, would help prevent the spread of new variants as they are trying to gather more information. And this plan is set to take place in just about a week.

STOUT: For more, we're joined by Yanzhong Huang. He's a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. And Yanzhong, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. 
 
The U.S. will require a negative COVID tests for travelers from China, including Hong Kong and Macau. This is going to start from January the 5th. We know that other countries are taking or considering similar action but, is this really necessary? 
 
YANZHONG HUANG, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Well, I don't see any convincing reasons to justify, you know, this move. We know that one of the reasons there is, you know, this concern about emerging variants or subvariants from China, but so far we don't have any evidence supporting if there is, indeed, such you know, variance emerging in mainland China. 
 <br>[01:34:54]
 
HUANG: And secondary, also I don't see why China should be treated differently from other countries like Australia, for example, all swimming (ph) in COVID. 
 
And third, you know, I can't understand why the people from Hong Kong for example would be treated any differently from people from Singapore, right. so this is -- something I just don't get it. 
 
STOUT: Yes. And there is a lot of people here in Hong Kong that would agree with that. But there is the fact that there is little transparency from China and no reliable COVID-19 data from China. 
 
So should countries take at least some COVID prevention measures for travelers coming in from China? 
 
HUANG: You know, I can understand this concern, because of the lack of transparency. Because of the lack of sharing in the genomic sequencing, but even their emergence -- the emergence of the subvariant, you know, I can't understand the reasons to institute this measures. But even with this ban, we cannot prevent the spread of the virus. 
 
And assuming it is, indeed, a new variant emerging in mainland China which is just is delaying the spread. We're not going to prevent the speed of the virus from spreading to other parts of the world. 
 
STOUT: Yanzhong, you are mentioning the concern over COVID variants, and the concern was this. There's so many people infected, in a short period of time in China, you know, could a new variant their.
 
So how can authorities work with China right now, to screen for it? 
 
HUANG: You know, I think this is why the national cooperation is so important, right. China certainly, I think should be more forthcoming in sharing its data, and sharing the genomic sequence of the virus, and the variants.
 
In the meantime, I do believe that the dialogue of cooperation, diplomacy remain more constructive approach addressing the concerns that we now have. 
 
STOUT: Also want to ask you about asking about Hong Kong. You know, the city has scrapped some of its remaining COVID curbs. The city's leaders cited a relatively high vaccination rate and sufficient medication against COVID as reason behind that. Your thoughts here? 
 
HUANG: I think this is a welcome move. But it is a decision long overdue. We know most cities, most countries have scrapped such requirements like mandatory PCR testing upon arrival. So it has been like months that Hong Kong was swimming against the tide.
 
But I think the other side of the vaccination is the main reason for scrapping those measures. Also I don't find it quite that convincing. 
 
STOUT: And a quick question. Mask wearing rules remain in place here, much to the annoyance of people in Hong Kong, but it is peak season for infection. Should there be a mask mandate right now? 
 
HUANG: Well, I think from a public health perspective, it makes sense. In other Asian countries, they adopted similar measures. It's just that like here, in the western countries, they don't feel like a mask mandate is necessary. 
 
STOUT: Got it. Yanzhong Huang, thank you. 
 
HUANG: Thanks for having me. 
 
STOUT: Now, the daughter of Brazilian football legend, Pele, shared a photo on Instagram of her family at the Sao Paulo hospital where Pele is receiving treatment. And along with the photo, she wrote this quote, "These moments are hard to explain. Sometimes, there is a lot of sadness, and hopelessness. And others, we laugh and talk of funny memories.

STOUT: The U.S., bracing for more migrants coming across the Mexican border despite a court ruling that makes it easier to turn them away. On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to temporarily keep a Trump era policy called Title 42 under which many of them could be expelled without an immigration hearing.
 
But officials are now putting up ten temporary processing centers along the border in anticipation of more migrants coming in.
 
CNN has also learned that the U.S. is concerned about possible extremist attacks on migrants if Title 42 is revoked. 
 
Benjamin Netanyahu's stunning political comeback in Israel culminated on Thursday when he will be formally sworn in as prime minister for a record sixth time. 
 
But before that happens, parliament will vote on his new cabinet that's set to begin in just a few hours. It's expected to be the most far-right government in Israeli history. 
 
Israel's new hardline government comes at one of the most volatile periods in years and many of the flash points have been the holy places that are sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians. 
 
CNN's Becky Anderson recently sat down with Jordan's King Abdullah, at one of those sites along the Jordan River. 
 
And in this exclusive interview, he shares his thoughts about Israel's new government and offers his vision for improving long term stability in the region.
 
Take a listen.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We know it as Bethany (ph) beyond the Jordan. On the east bank of the Jordan River, this is the exact location where Christians believe Jesus was baptized. 
 
I have come here to meet with the custodian and regional political leader, King Abdullah II of Jordan. 
 
KING ABDULLAH II, JORDAN LEADER: Great to have you back. How's everything.
 
ANDERSON: Very well. How are you?
 
KING ABDULLAH II: All is well.
 
ANDERSON: Nice to see you. Please.
 
As we close out 2022, we are here to discuss the challenges facing this region, not least, his concerns about the region shrinking Christian population, and why he believes plans to develop and protect this holy site are critical to the community's future in the Middle East. 
 
An absolute pleasure to have you. I want to talk about why we are here and the significance of this site. But I do want to start with your speech at the UNGA this year. I think it is very pertinent to what we are going to discuss. 
 
You began your address by saying, there are alarm bells. 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: Numerous crises batter our world. Crises that are increasingly interlocked. Regional conflicts with international impact today. The future of Jerusalem is an urgent concern. 
 
The city is holy to billions of Muslims, Christians, and Jews, around the world. 
 <br>[01:44:51]
 
KING ABDULLAH II: Undermining Jerusalem's legal and historical status quo triggers global tensions, and deepens religious divides. The holy city must not to be a place for hatred, and division. 
 
ANDERSON: Can you just reflect on 2022? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: Jerusalem, we've always believed, is a city that should bring us all together. But unfortunately it's used by extremists on all sides to create conflict and violence.  
 
The violence really did pick up in the spring. We are the custodians of both Christian and Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. My concern is that there are challenges that the church is outpacing from policies on the ground. If we continue to use Jerusalem as a soapbox for politics, things can get out of control really, really very quickly. 
 
ANDERSON: You described Christianity in Jerusalem, as under fire. Can you explain that a little further? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: We are fortunate, in this country and in Jerusalem, to have the oldest Christian community in the world. They have been here for 2,000 years.
 
Over the past several years, we're seeing that they have came under pressure as a community. So the numbers are dropping, which is, I think, an alarm bell, to all of us. 
 
ANDERSON: 2022 has turned out to be the deadliest year for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in two decades. And Jerusalem is a major flash point. 
 
There are fears of a third intifada, possibly, on the horizon. How concerned are you about that prospect? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: We have to concerned about a next intifada. And if that happens, that's a complete breakdown of law and order. And one that neither the Israeli nor Palestinians will benefit from. 
 
And I think there is a lot of concern from all of us in the region, including those in Israel, that are on our side on this issue, to make sure that doesn't happen. 
 
So that is a flash or tinderbox that if it's lashes, It's something that I don't think we'll be able to walk away from in the near future. 
 
ANDERSON: Benjamin Netanyahu is back in power. Jordanian commentators described that result as Jordan's worst nightmare. Is it? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: At the end of the day, the Israeli people have the right to pick whoever they want to lead them. And I think we are all big boys here and looking at the larger picture, we are all prepared to move on. So we will work with anybody and everybody as so long as we can bring them together. 
 
ANDERSON: The new Israeli government will likely, be the most right- wing in Israeli history. Including incoming national security adviser, Ben-Gvir. 
 
He has a long history of inciting violence against Arabs and Palestinians. Pending new legislation, he could assume authority over the police force, including law enforcement chat Jersualem's holy sites. 
 
ANDERSON: As custodian of those sites, do you believe the status quo, and your role is threatened? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: You are always going to get those people that we're trying to push out. And that is the concern but I don't think those individuals are under the Jordanian microscope. They are under an international microscope. 
 
So, we have learned, as we've said, living between a rock, and a hard place. This is just another Tuesday for us. 
 
If people want to get into a conflict, we are quite prepared. I always like to believe that -- let's look at the glass half full. But, we have certain red lines. If people want to push those red lines, then we will deal with that, but I have to believe that there is a lot of people, also, that I am concerned, as much as we are. 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: And as a Muslim leader, let me say, clearly, we are committed to defending the rights, the precious heritage, and the historic identity of the Christian people of our region. 
 
ANDERSON: Can you just expand on Jordan's role in promoting stability? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: Jordan has been a refuge to early Christians and to Jesus Christ himself, who came here escaping persecution. This is I think something that we have always inherited. My great-great- grandfather (INAUDIBLE) saved and gave sanctity to Armenian Christians, that were looking for safety and security. Recently, over the past few years, as you have watched, the actions of Dash in Syria and Iraq, looking after Iraqi Christians and Syrian Christians here. 
 
If we don't any Christians in the region, I think that's a disaster for all of us, they're part of our past, they're part of our present, and they must be part of our future. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This park is where Jesus Christ was baptized and Christianity started. 
 
ANDERSON: They come from all over the world. Every year up to 200,000 pilgrims and tourists floc to this site where Jesus is believed to have been baptized.
 <br>[01:49:47]
 
ANDERSON: Now, a master plan has been launched, to build a pilgrim village with a museum, amphitheater, and accommodation, which, according to the Baptism Site Commission, will allow it to cater for up to 1.5 million visitors per year.
 
Rustom (INAUDIBLE) is the director general of the Baptism Site Commission. 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: And it's aid with stability. Such as The basic aim is to build back facilities. And to me intention is to receive.
 
Millions of pilgrims and provide better services to enjoy this. This is a pretty site.
 
ANDERSON: You had plans to develop, and protect this site, or a site adjacent to where we are, as we speak. In line with your role, towards holy sites under the (INAUDIBLE) custodianship. Talk to me about each path.
 
KING ABDULLAH II: So this is a UNESCO heritage site and needs to be protected. We want to make sure that this is preserved for centuries site and niece We want to make sure that this is preserved for centuries to come. What would happen adjacent to it is what is the support to this wonderful, historical, magical place. 
 
So you know, a museum to talk about the history of Christianity and to look at creating the botanical gardens that grow the ancient flowers and herbs of the region and clubs, training centers that allow different churches to come in and teach.
 
Something that we can all be proud of 100 years from now. and I think one of the things that people misunderstand about this place is how inclusive it is. Almost 15 percent of the visitors that come here are Muslim because we revere Jesus Christ as the messiah, and the Holy Mary is the holiest and most important of all women in our history. 
 
And so this is an opportunity to break down those barriers. And to show how proud we are of not only our historical Christian heritage here in Jordan but the relationship between Christianity and Islam.
 
ANDERSON: How important is the site to Jordan? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: From a historical religious point of view, you know, this is Christianity's third holiest site. So, of extreme importance to Jordan, and, because of the history it tells, not only have one of the first refugees being Jesus, peace and blessings to be upon him, but you know, the wave of refugees that at least might in my time we have seen I think it started here. 
 
And it's a story that tells the story of Jordan, all throughout the ages. 
 
ANDERSON: For decades, Jordan has been a safe haven for Christians, and Muslims, alike. Representing a model of coexistence, amid, for the better part of history, a turbulent region. Nowhere is that more evident than downtown Oman, during Christmas celebrations. 
 
ANDERSON: Your majesty, this project is one that will begin one hopes in 2023. 
 
What are your hopes that this closest are the one. Let's close on a positive note. What are your hopes, and aspirations for 2023? 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: At the end of the day, people just want to move on with their lives, and feel an opportunity. So it's hard to rewrite the narrative. 
 
So as challenging as 2022 was, and as difficult the dangers of 2023 are, there's an opportunity for us to move beyond.
 
And I've gotten away from the feeling that politics are not going to solve our problem. It is economic dependence here.
 
easy to depict and see. so these are issues that we have to deal with -- the Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanians. And I believe regional integration stored aliens, and I believe regional integration. That is I think the circuit of us being able to break down barriers. When I am invested in your success because your success is my success at the of the day means that we can move forward.
 
Whatever people think about integration of Israel into the region which is extremely important.
 
That's not going to happen unless there's a future for the public video. And you've seen that recently through the Moroccan football team. That is just a slight insight that, at the end of the day, whatever the leaders to, if we can solve this problem, the street are naturally going to be situated RSS naturally going be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. So we need to build us as opposed as a supposed to destroy. 
 
ANDERSON: Thank you very much. 
 
KING ABDULLAH II: Thank you.  
 
ANDERSON: Wonderful.
 
KING ABDULLAH II: Thank you Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you very much.
