JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  -- blessing, our deepest condolences go to all of the Kennedy family and her friends and admirers.
 
You can follow me on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, formerly known as Twitter, and on TikTok, @jaketapper. You can follow the show on X, 
 
 @TheLeadCNN. You can also listen to the show whence you get your podcasts. The news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer right next door in a place we'd 
 
 like to call The Situation Room. See you tomorrow.
 
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Happening now, breaking news. The death toll is rising -- 
 
ZAIN ASHER, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. It is 1:00 a.m. in Tel Aviv, 7:00 a.m. if you're watching from Seoul, and 6:00 in the evening here in New York. 
 
 I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
A warm welcome to "First Move." And here is today's need to know. Recovery operations are underway in Florida as Hurricane Milton leaves death and 
 
 destruction in its wake. At least 22 people are killed and more than 100 injured in Beirut after more Israeli airstrikes. And Tesla taxis. Elon Musk 
 
 promises a game changing moment for the EV maker with self-driving cabs and private jets. And Rafa retires. One of the greatest tennis players of all 
 
 time says that he'll play his final tournament this November. All that and a lot more coming up.
 
But first, Florida begins the recovery from deadly Hurricane Milton, with officials warning that the danger is not over yet. Storm surge, riptides, 
 
 even flesh-eating bacteria are just some of the threats. Residents are being told to stay put and let help come to them. U.S. President Joe Biden 
 
 among those urging caution.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  There's still very dangerous conditions in the state and people should wait to be given all clear by their leaders before 
 
 they go out. We know from previous hurricanes that it's often the case that more lives are lost the days following the storm than actually during the 
 
 storm itself.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  On the ground, first responders are still saving lives. Residents at one assisted living facility in Tampa were discovered in water up to 
 
 their waists. More than 130 residents were rescued, including people relying on wheelchairs and walkers.
 
Meantime, many cities are beginning the long and difficult work of cleaning up. St. Petersburg is contending with hundreds of fallen trees and power 
 
 lines. The city's Tropicana Field was supposed to be a gathering spot for first responders, instead, Milton tore the roof off.
 
Bill Weir joins us live now from St. Petersburg. So, Bill, just talk to us about the extent of the damage where you are right now.
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we are in Pinellas County. It's really devastated, Zain. From downtown here. I'm going to show 
 
 you all the greatest hits of the storm that it really took a toll on this community. But the folks along the beaches who took the brunt of Helene 
 
 just 10 days prior, you know, this -- covering climate these days, it's sort of the intersection of nature and human nature. And as humans, we try 
 
 to use the past to figure out what's going to come.
 
Hurricane Helene seemed too far offshore to bring a storm surge. People were wrong. They got devastated. So, everyone was focused on storm surge 
 
 for Milton. But what instead came were massive tornadoes and relentless floods, almost a half a meter in 24 hours here in St. Petersburg, just 
 
 flooding every river and creek. You can imagine flooding so many homes.
 
So, right now, people are sort of grateful that they dodged the worst-case bullets, but they're trying to make sense of these back-to-back hits. and 
 
 what comes next.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEIR (voice-over):  As Earth overheats, these are the kinds of storms that take lives and livelihoods. But as families reel in private grief, it's the 
 
 material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County. From the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to 
 
 Tropicana Field, peeled like an orange by Milton's winds. The Tampa Bay Rays already have plans in the works to build a new stadium, with taxpayers 
 
 kicking in hundreds of millions of dollars. But what happens now is anyone's guess, especially after the loss of entire neighborhoods, retirees 
 
 and working-class American dreamers.
 
SANDY DAUGHTRY, PINELLAS COUNTY RESIDENT:  I'm just really concerned for all these people. It's just devastating. It's like World War III or 
 
 something, you know.
 
WEIR (voice-over):  Sandy Daughtry hid in a closet during landfall and the day after rides her bike through the mingled wreckage of back-to-back 
 
 hurricanes, praying for neighbors she knows now have nothing.
 
WEIR:  Long after all of these pieces of people's lives have been picked up, what will remain in Florida is a massive insurance crisis. In just the 
 
 last couple of years, dozens of different carriers have gone insolvent or stopped accepting new customers or have been placed on state watch lists. 
 
 So, as a result, flood insurance for a home like this can be over $20,000 a year, way more than the mortgage. So, most of these families had no 
 
 coverage at all.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
So, many folks are uninsured, right?
 
DAUGHTRY:  Yes. Yes. I know. That's why I just like it breaks my heart. I'm riding through here just like my heart is just shattered. I just can't even 
 
 -- it's just unbelievable. Really.
 
WEIR:  What do you think becomes of communities like this?
 
DAUGHTRY:  I don't know. I really don't. I'm hearing a lot of people saying they're going to leave the state and head back up north, but I don't know 
 
 if that'll happen. You know, maybe a mass exodus or something.
 
WEIR:  Do you connect any, all of this to a changing climate, a warmer planet?
 
DAUGHTRY:  You know, I don't -- I'm not sure. I couldn't answer. I can't really answer that.
 
WEIR:  Really?
 
DAUGHTRY:  I just -- maybe it's just a hundred-year cycle or, you know, some kind of a cycle that we go through.
 
WEIR:  Even though all the scientists are telling you this is what climate change looks like?
 
DAUGHTRY:  Well, yes. Well, that's the point. I'm not sure all the scientists are in agreement.
 
WEIR:  They are. I can tell you they are.
 
DAUGHTRY:  That's why I'm kind of like -- 
 
WEIR:  I'm here to tell you, they are.
 
DAUGHTRY:  Yes.
 
WEIR:  99 percent of them absolutely agree. You can ask anybody.
 
DAUGHTRY:  Well, I can definitely tell you our beaches are eroding in my lifetime, all the beaches have -- I've seen the water come up a lot higher 
 
 than it ever has before. So -- 
 
WEIR:  Thank you so much.
 
DAUGHTRY:  -- thank you all for talking.
 
WEIR:  Yes, thank you for talking with us. Really, you're a great neighbor. If there's a heaven, you're getting in.
 
DAUGHTRY:  And that's -- honestly, that's what I do. I ride around and just pray for people and just pray, you know. I just -- it's just -- 
 
WEIR:  You're a first prayer responder. That's -- 
 
DAUGHTRY:  Yes. Amen.
 
WEIR:  That's very sweet. All right. Good luck to you.
 
DAUGHTRY:  Thanks, you all.
 
WEIR:  Thank you.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WEIR (on camera):  All people can really do is pray at this point, Zain. 13 fatalities so far, but we know from history that more fatalities generally 
 
 come after the storm, as people, you know, have accidents or their generator poisonings and all kinds of things that can go wrong, when 
 
 infrastructure is down, when there's so much dangerous things in the water, when there's power lines everywhere.
 
So, they're figuring this out in real-time, and this is a -- Sandy there, lifelong Floridian, you know, who has been through so many hurricanes, she 
 
 couldn't remember, but the conversation has to shift, otherwise, the next one, people won't be as prepared.
 
ASHER:  Yes, and I thought you asked her, Bill, a really important question about climate change, just in terms of your conversation with Sandy at the 
 
 end. I mean, we know that because of climate change, the air is warmer, it can hold more moisture, and that means that when you have hurricanes like 
 
 this, there's a lot more rainfall. The rainfall totals are much higher because of climate change.
 
Just explain to us, when you look at Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene, how much of the rainfall from these storms are a direct result of manmade 
 
 climate change?
 
WEIR:  Well, there's weather attribution science that they look at, you know, pre-industrial times and do comparisons, and they'll say this 
 
 particular storm, Helene, I believe was many times -- hundreds of times more likely as a result of manmade global warming. This particular storm, 
 
 Milton, maybe 10 to 20 percent more rain.
 
But there's also this other phenomenon, like supercell tornadoes, 135 tornado warnings in Florida. That almost doubled the previous record, which 
 
 was set just a few years ago. These are the kinds of tornadoes you see in the Kansas or Texas not coming, you know, hundreds of miles in front of a 
 
 hurricane or 100 miles away from the eye.
 
The people who got hit by those tornadoes, Zain, they were ready for a hurricane, but they had never imagined that it would be, you know, "Wizard 
 
 of Oz" time where they happen to be there. But again, we lack the capacity to imagine the physics of this hotter planet because we're only working 
 
 with the information we had from before.
 
ASHER:  Bill Weir, live for us there in St. Petersburg. Thank you so much. Right. The Tampa area has been particularly hit hard by this storm. CNN 
 
 traveled through the floodwaters alongside a county sheriff who is trying to save lives. Isabel Rosales has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I'm on an airboat right now with Sheriff Chad Chronister. And we're seeing people like right there, if we 
 
 can push in, you know, up on the second floor of these apartment complexes. We've been seeing people wading through the waters. Let's switch the camera 
 
 over here to my other side.
 
Do you see right there? Cars underwater. This is all from torrential rainfall. This is not storm surge. This is not an evacuation area. This is 
 
 something completely unexpected for this area. Let me introduce you to Sheriff Chad Chronister.
 
Sheriff, 33 years ago, you were a rookie. This was your district, known as University Area, now it's Uptown. Have you ever seen anything like this?
 
SHERIFF CHAD CHRONISTER, HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, FLORIDA SHERIFF'S OFFICE:  This is where I started. This is where I fell in love with this community. 
 
 I've never seen flooding like this. We had people that evacuated here to make sure they were safe. They listened. They came here. 135 elderly 
 
 disabled individuals that we rescued earlier. They came here. They were evacuated from Bradenton to stay safe.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
This is a neighborhood that doesn't have a lot. They have very little. And the very little they had, they've lost everything. They're -- we have water 
 
 four feet up into their first floor here. This is a heavily Latino community. Their church is gone. Their cars are gone. Again, they don't 
 
 live paycheck-to-paycheck. These are people that live day-to-day and they have nothing.
 
ROSALES:  I can tell because I've known you for many years. You're getting choked up right now. What are you going through?
 
CHRONISTER:  Just your heart shatters for these people. We did a bunch of rescues. We took them to a shelter. The female that you saw that we passed, 
 
 she was waving me down. I made her promise me if it got too deeper, she got tired, we'd come back and get her. She broke down and hugged me for five 
 
 minutes. She goes, I don't have a lot. I take care of my grandmother. I evacuated my grandmother. And I'm left with nothing. We've lost everything. 
 
 We have no furniture. There was five feet of water in there. I mean, how does this not shatter your heart?
 
ROSALES:  The assisted living facility, I saw those residents out. A lot of them evacuating with no shoes. Their feet on the concrete. They were cold. 
 
 They went through so much, hours of waiting in the water. What are the stories that you're hearing?
 
CHRONISTER:  Yes, you're exactly right. They were literally living in four to five feet of water. And these are individuals that can't walk. They're 
 
 sitting in chairs in four feet. The panic started to sink in and they're like, hey, we got to get out of here. They thought the water would subside. 
 
 And it didn't. It's not like storm surge where it got worse. But these floodwaters, 16 inches of water and this is the results and heavily 
 
 saturated area. The floodwaters that we were talking about that we were so worried about. This water has nowhere to go. Their homes are flooded. They 
 
 have nowhere to go.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER:  As you just saw, rescue teams are fighting dangerous conditions to reach people trapped in flooded areas. You're looking at drone footage from 
 
 Hillsborough County in Florida showing rescuers loading people onto rafts outside their homes. A local sheriff says he's never seen flooding in the 
 
 area on this scale.
 
While in the city of St. Petersburg, the amount of rain that fell was more than 18 inches or 45 centimeters. That's considered a once in a millennium 
 
 rainfall event. Florida's governor says at least 340 people have been rescued in the state, as well as almost 50 pets.
 
Let's speak with the head of a humanitarian group that is on the ground in Florida right now. Thomas Tighe is the president and CEO of Direct Relief 
 
 and joins us now live. Thomas, when you think about oftentimes the greatest need after storms like this, I mean, obviously, you see people's entire 
 
 have been swept away. Their homes are gone.
 
Obviously, there is a loss of life, but it is important to note that, you know, a lot of people might need access to medication, access to medicines 
 
 that they might not ordinarily have. Just walk us through what is the greatest need at this point in time in terms of medical supplies, which is 
 
 what your organization focuses on.
 
THOMAS TIGHE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, DIRECT RELIEF:  Right. I think the sheriff said it very well. You know, everyone's vulnerable to some degree from 
 
 these events, but some of us much more so than others. And with regard to health and medical, people who we've seen this over the years, beginning 
 
 with Hurricane Katrina, people who are managing a chronic condition, whether it's asthma or diabetes or hypertension, who have to flee and 
 
 without their medications, they can cease managing their condition, they can become an acute health crisis in a few days.
 
So, that's kind of what we have seen repeatedly. That's why Direct Relief works with really hundreds of community health centers and free and 
 
 charitable clinics. In Florida, providing charitable access to medications for people who don't -- who need them, can't afford them on a normal day.
 
So, when the storm was coming, we were doing everything we can before the storm, today, and obviously, as the water recedes, to make sure that these 
 
 community health centers, free and charitable clinics that play such a heroic role every day, and have the trust of the people, that they're 
 
 supported, that the resources that come to Direct Relief get to them in a clear, transparent, efficient way.
 
And I mean, two of them I spoke to this morning, one in Fort Myers, you know, Deanie Singh who runs Premier Mobile Health Services and serves a 
 
 mobile home community. They were devastated by Ian a couple years ago. They're still cleaning up from Helene and this is just another slam, and 
 
 they were hit by a tornado.
 
Another free and charitable clinic in Fort Pierce run by Dr. Yusuf Modi (ph), I spoke to today too. He was just going back. He said, you know, it 
 
 was -- overall, it was a much better than feared, but where the tornado said, it was much worse than expected. So, they were dealing with this 
 
 unanticipated -- kind of good news bad news, we dodged the bullet to some degree.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
But in these communities, where these free clinics are operating, they're saying, I think the sheriff did it very well. These people have a tough 
 
 time on a good day. And anything that was tough the day before an emergency is still tough. And now, you have a whole lot of bad piled on top of that.
 
So, I think the support that Floridians are showing for each other and groups like Direct Relief are trying to do within the lane we operate is 
 
 important as the waters recede.
 
ASHER:  Yes, just explain to us, you know, the sorts of work, just in detail, how your organization operates before and in the lead up to the 
 
 storm actually hitting, and then in the days afterwards.
 
TIGHE:  Yes, we have -- you know, we're handling prescription drugs in all 50 states on a charitable basis. So, we have to be very careful and certify 
 
 the people on the receiving end, all of whom are nonprofit organizations. So, we work with them. We understand what their patients' needs are. People 
 
 who need but can't afford their medications, they order, we deliver online and then we track it.
 
When -- in certain places throughout the Gulf states and places along the eastern seaboard, we preposition packs, hurricane preparedness packs that 
 
 contain about 150 different medications, including mainly chronic disease medications. We preposition those in durable, ruggedized, waterproof tubs 
 
 so they have sort of a pharmacy in a box for situations like this.
 
Some of those facilities have -- that received them before hurricane season have already opened them, and that's supposed to tide them over in an event 
 
 like this until we can get the current information, they can make a proper order. And we -- you know, we don't want to send stuff that they don't need 
 
 or won't use. So, we wanted to give them some tidying over time.
 
And then, what we're doing now is trying to establish, you know, what specifically we can deliver. And FedEx has always been wonderful in 
 
 arranging rapid delivery for these types of medications. But it's on an order first basis to pre-approve health professionals.
 
So, we're working with the safety net that exists that isn't often seen as a first response agency, but they're definitely a first receiver agency, 
 
 including Premier Health, mobile health services and Oceana Community Health in Fort Pierce.
 
ASHER:  So, as these hurricanes, unfortunately, become more frequent. I mean, Florida this year was in the unfortunate position of being on the 
 
 receiving end of two major hurricanes back-to-back within a two-week period, both with Helene and also Milton. Because of climate change, we 
 
 know that this is going to become more frequent. What is your greatest concern then?
 
TIGHE:  Well, you know, I think that we won't keep up. I mean, the pace of change is -- seems to exceed our ability to adapt to the change, right? You 
 
 know, we're always a bit looking in the rearview mirror for guidance. And I think as circumstances change, we have to acknowledge the old playbooks 
 
 might not work.
 
I mean, the basics are always going to be there, but I think the new circumstances, they're not only more frequent, they're more intense and 
 
 they last longer, these events. I live in California where it's wildfires that are concerned, and it's the same thing. There used to be a season. 
 
 Now, it's all year.
 
So, I think the adaptation of us as a species and recognition of what works and really concerned for the people who are least fortunate, they have the 
 
 least cushion, they have the fewest options, they get hit harder by these events, and they have a really hard time bouncing back. So, I think that's, 
 
 I think, the recognition that as these things change, everyone's at risk, but some of us much more so at others and to look out for your neighbors as 
 
 best you can.
 
We can't rely on the government to do every single thing. Although, I'll tell you, Florida has done a very good job on their emergency officials. We 
 
 met with the sheriff up here who was on it and it's an impressive group of people. Floridians are tough and experienced with this sort of thing.
 
ASHER:  All right. Thomas Tighe, thank you so much. We appreciate the work that you've been doing on the ground.
 
TIGHE:  Thanks so much.
 
ASHER:  All right. Let's get more on the ongoing risks from the flooding and other dangerous conditions left in the wake of Hurricane Milton. Chad 
 
 Myers is at the World Weather Center for us. So, Chad, it made landfall as a hurricane -- as a Category 3 hurricane. It then moved east. It was 
 
 reduced to a Category 1. But the East Coast of Florida also received a lot of rainfall. Walk us through that.
 
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Right. And they saw the tornadoes. It was the East Coast that actually had those tornadoes, not even really near the 
 
 center of the eye. That's why when you see the cone and you know, we show it all the time that there are going to be hazards outside of that cone 
 
 because those tornadoes were not in the cone because the tornadoes were not part -- even part of the eye.
 
Let me back you up to Saturday. OK. Let me show you what happened to the forecast, how it kind of, you know, you're trying to hit a cheap shot and 
 
 you skull it and it kind of rolls out of the green anyway. And they say you don't take pictures. Well, this is what happened. This storm was way out 
 
 here in the Bay of Campeche, Mexico, and then it moved to the south just to the north of Yucatan Peninsula and then on up toward Tampa and then, 
 
 finally, out to sea. This is right now. So, it's gone, completely gone.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
Let me show you four days ago what was forecast to kind of be 120, 130-mile per hour storm, but it went from 50 miles per hour to 180 miles per hour in 
 
 just 36 hours.
 
Here's the forecast track back on Saturday, this black line, way back here, and it comes up here and it makes landfall in Tampa. That's a 96-hour 
 
 forecast. OK. That's pretty darn good. But here's what happened down here. Where did it end up? 20 kilometers away from where it was supposed to be 
 
 four days ago. So, what an amazing landfall forecast from the guys down there in Miami doing the hurricane center forecast.
 
It was a bigger storm out in the ocean, but it kind of lost a lot of intensity, it was only a Category 3 only, a Category 3 at landfall. All the 
 
 surge went to the south, not up into Tampa, where the water was poor, pushed out, it was pushed out of Tampa Bay, didn't even have a surge. We 
 
 had what's called an inverse surge.
 
But getting back to those East Coast of Florida tornadoes, they've surveyed them. They kind of look at them. They look for how much damage occurred. 
 
 This is an EF-3 tornado that should belong in the plains of Texas or Oklahoma, but 140 mile per hour, 225-mile per hour winds spinning around in 
 
 the bottom of there. And that's why we lost so many people in some of those places.
 
126 tornado warnings. More than two dozen tornadoes were on the ground, and they were hundreds of miles from where the I made landfall. In fact, that 
 
 126 warnings for tornadoes, more than the two other storms, hurricanes combined on number two and number three on the list. But we still have 3 
 
 million customers without power.
 
We put that into perspective. There's probably three to four people that live as every customer. So, you're talking somewhere between 9 and 12 
 
 million people that don't have electricity, their food is going bad. If they are on oxygen or CPAP or whatever, they don't even have that ability 
 
 with that. And this is going to take a very long time to put 3 million customers back online.
 
What a significant storm when it came to rainfall as well. Right here, everywhere you see across this purple area, that's about 350 millimeters of 
 
 rain or more, and that's OK if you get it in one neighborhood, but we're talking hundreds of square kilometers with two inches, three inches, 10 
 
 inches of rain or more. And then, right at almost a half a meter, St. Petersburg, in one day, picked up 18 inches of rainfall just yesterday 
 
 alone.
 
And there was a tweet by Las Vegas, and Las Vegas doesn't get a lot of rainfall. Of course, it's in the desert. But the tweet this morning, Zain, 
 
 said, 18 inches just in perspective, the last time you add up all of our rainfall, you have to go back to February or January of 2010, add up all 
 
 the days and then we get to 18 inches. It took five years. It would take five years for Las Vegas to get what St. Petersburg picked up in just one 
 
 day. Zain.
 
ASHER:  Those statistics, unbelievable.
 
MYERS:  It really is.
 
ASHER:  Chad Myers, live for us there, thank you so much.
 
MYERS:  You're welcome.
 
ASHER:  All right. Straight ahead, Elon Musk is set to unveil his firm's new push into driverless vehicles. It's being called a potential game 
 
 changer for the company.
 
Plus, using artificial intelligence to uncover science's deepest secrets. We'll hear from the CEO of Google's DeepMind, a co-winner of this year's 
 
 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
ASHER:  All right. Welcome back in today's Money Move. Red hours across Wall Street after the latest U.S. inflation report. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 
 
 pulling back from record highs after a mixed read on U.S. prices. Consumer inflation inching down to 2.4 percent year over year, the lowest level in 
 
 more than three years. Investors, however, we're expecting a bigger drop. Inflation month over month came in slightly higher than expected as well.
 
Stocks in the news include TD Bank, it shares falling more than 5 percent. The company has pleaded guilty to money laundering and will pay a $3 
 
 billion fine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  TD Bank created an environment that allowed financial crime to flourish, by making its services convenient 
 
 for criminals, it became one. Today, TD Bank became the largest bank in U.S. history to plead guilty to Bank Secrecy Act program failures, and the 
 
 first bank in history to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER:  In Asia, strong gains for Chinese stocks after the Central Bank bear kicked off a new monetary stimulus program. Investors, however, still 
 
 looking for more fiscal stimulus. The Nikkei also closing in the green.
 
Now, in other business news, Elon Musk is gearing up for what could be one of Tesla's biggest announcements ever. Just a few hours from now, Musk is 
 
 set to take the stage in Los Angeles to unveil details of his driverless Robotaxi initiative. We could see what a so-called Tesla Cybercab will 
 
 actualy look like, along with details of the company's planned ride hailing service that would let people rent out their Teslas.
 
All this as Chinese firms ramp up on their own Robotaxi plans. Ride hailing giant Uber has also partnered with Alphabet's Waymo on driverless vehicles. 
 
 It might not all be about Robotaxis today. One big question, will the Tesla Optimus robot make an appearance?
 
Dan Ives joins us live now from L.A. He's Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst at Wedbush Securities. Dan, thank you so much for 
 
 being with us. So, Elon Musk has talked about the fact that he believes the Robotaxi is actually going to add trillions of dollars of value to its 
 
 stock and also dramatically fuel the company's growth. Give us your thoughts on that.
 
DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Yes, I think this is going to be a historic event. I think for 
 
 Tesla, when you look at autonomous, I think represents a trillion-dollar opportunity. And I think when you look at the value, that could even be 
 
 more than the stock's worth today. And this has been years in the making, but when it comes to Tesla, it's robotic A.I., and this is going to be 
 
 really a historic event for Tesla, I think, and overall for the tech.
 
ASHER:  Just in terms of Musk's vision, right, for Robotaxi in the next 10 years, the next 15 years, I mean, you know, what are your thoughts on that? 
 
 The sort of how much of an impact or how much change this particular endeavor will have for society?
 
IVES:  I think, end of the decade, 15, 20 percent of ride shares don't have a driver. So, where this is all heading in an autonomous future, especially 
 
 when it comes to ride shares and some other areas you might have, I think once it gets past regulatory and we get to level five autonomous, that's 
 
 the future.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
So, for Tesla, that's margin. I mean, that's a huge incremental opportunity. Of course, Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, Google. But this 
 
 is -- when you talk about A.I. as a used case, this is probably one of the best used case that we're going to see, I think, on display tonight.
 
ASHER:  Yes. So, just in terms of competition, I mean, obviously, you talk about Alphabet's Waymo. There's obviously also Uber, who is sort of 
 
 dabbling in this arena as well. How much of an advantage does Tesla have, especially with Robotaxi, do you think?
 
IVES:  They have a huge event because they have 6 million vehicles in the road. And you get miles driven, 1.5 billion miles driven. So, that data 
 
 feeds the machine. And I think what Tesla is going to unveil tonight, it shows the autonomous framework.
 
I think by the end of next year, 2025, we could start to see some form of Robotaxis with their cyber tech in different cities, especially throughout 
 
 the U.S.
 
ASHER:  So, that's how you think it's going to be deployed slowly, city by city, that's how it's going to spread?
 
IVES:  Yes. Regulatory is the biggest issue, right? So, framework, I mean, just like we see Waymo's in L.A. and, you know, you see in Austin and other 
 
 cities. But Tesla has a huge advantage because of the Teslas on the road, a lot of those, you start to convert those more and more to fleets. I might 
 
 think you could be looking at 15, 20 percent of profits for Tesla over the next three, four, five years essentially coming from this.
 
That's why this is not a shoulder to shoulders event. I think this is really in a -- you know, a really a seminal event.
 
ASHER:  Well, we've got the countdown clock on our screen. We just had it there a moment ago, 10:00 p.m. Eastern time, 7:00 in the evening, if you 
 
 are in L.A. As Dan Ives just said, I mean, this is going to be a seminal event for Tesla. Similar, I understand that you believe as the iPhone 
 
 unveiling for Apple is what I understand that you said. All right. Dan Ives, live for us there. Thank you so much.
 
All right. Speaking of cutting-edge technology, there was plenty of excitement in the biotech community this week when the Nobel Prize for 
 
 Chemistry was announced. The prize went to a group of scientists who are using A.I. to help unlock the secrets of proteins.
 
Two of the award winners work at Google's DeepMind in London. CNN's Anna Stewart caught up with Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. She asked 
 
 him if the news of his win had actually sunk in yet.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DEMIS HASSABIS, NOBEL PRIZE WINNER AND CEO, GOOGLE DEEPMIND:  To be honest, it hasn't at all. It still seems like a dream really. And it's very 
 
 surreal. And it's still -- it still is today.
 
ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I always think it's interesting with this application because this is one of those applications of A.I. that people 
 
 may not even know about. They may not know that a drug or a treatment they have in the future is the result of AlphaFold. Do you wish that there was 
 
 less conversation, less focus on A.I. chatbots and more focus here?
 
HASSABIS:  Well, I think it's -- I mean, I think that's what's great about this recognition as well from the Nobel committee is it does shine a 
 
 spotlight on other types of A.I. that are happening. They're not chatbots, like you said, that are still making a massive impact in the world, but 
 
 maybe in more specialized areas like science or biology or medicine. And I hope it inspires many other people to work on those types of A.I. systems 
 
 that can help the world, you know, be a huge benefit to the world in these other ways.
 
STEWART:  You know, it's interesting. You're so positive when you talk about A.I. despite the risks, but there are some A.I. pioneers like Yoshua 
 
 Bengio or Geoffrey Hinton who are much gloomier about the outlook. Is your sense that overall A.I. will be a force for good?
 
HASSABIS:  Yes, of course. So, I'm in the middle ground. There are people on both extremes, I would say, that are very worried about the risks and 
 
 focus mostly on those. And then there are others that are, you know, saying there's nothing to worry about. You know, I'm not in either of those camps, 
 
 really. I think that there's a lot of unknowns is what I would say.
 
So, I'm not actually -- I'm actually very optimistic we're going to solve the problems given enough time and enough smart people working on it.
 
STEWART:  A.I. is taking the prize for physics and chemistry in terms of the Nobel Prize. Do you think you'll ever get the Peace Prize?
 
HASSABIS:  I don't -- I can't see how that could be possible anytime soon, but, you know, you never say never.

ASHER:  All right. So, still to come after the break, the latest on the Middle East crisis and a deadly Israeli airstrike in Beirut. That's next 
 
 for you.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
ASHER:  All right. Welcome back to "First Move" with a look at more international headlines this hour. The Prince and Princess of Wales have 
 
 made a surprise visit to Southport in North West England. They met with families of three girls killed in a knife attack this summer. The visit 
 
 marks their joint engagement -- or rather their first joint engagement, since Princess Catherine completed her chemotherapy treatment for cancer. 
 
 They also met with the met with emergency services at the Southport Community Center to show their support as well.
 
And it is a historic day for South Korea. Writer Han Kang has won the Nobel Peace -- Nobel Prize, rather, for Literature. She's the first South Korean 
 
 to win the prize. She's also the first female Nobel laureate so far this year. Han is best known for her novel, "The Vegetarian," which came out in 
 
 2007.
 
And to the Middle East now where Lebanese officials say that at least 22 people were killed following Israeli airstrikes in Central Beirut. 
 
 Witnesses say one of the strikes leveled a residential building. More than 100 people were injured according to the ministry of health from Lebanon. 
 
 Ben Wedeman reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Israel struck twice Thursday evening in Central Beirut, hitting the third floor of an eight-
 
 story building. The other strike flattened a four-story residential building in a densely populated area in what one security source told CNN 
 
 was a mass casualty event. Neighbors say many of the people in that building had fled there from other areas assuming they would be safe.
 
The Lebanese ministry of health updated its casualty figures multiple times during the evening, the death toll rising steadily. Over the past two 
 
 weeks, Israel has daily and nightly pounded Beirut's southern suburbs where Hezbollah has a strong presence, but Central Beirut has been bombed only a 
 
 few times.
 
Reports in Israeli media speculated that the target of the strikes in Central Beirut is was Wafiq Safa, a senior Hezbollah official responsible 
 
 for external affairs, basically the group's top diplomat. A Hezbollah source tells CNN, however, that Safa survived the strikes.
 
I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN reporting from Tyre, South Lebanon.

ASHER:  All right. Still to come off the break, as Milton melts away into the Atlantic Ocean, Floridians are left to pick up the pieces. After the 
 
 break, finding ways to keep the lights on with more Americans turning to backup power generators.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER:  All right. Welcome back to "First Move." You're looking at Tampa transformed. Road pretty much turned into lakes, cars stranded, the 
 
 vulnerable left in need of help. In Punta Gorda, Florida, a tennis court became the unconventional resting place for a yacht, as you can see, these 
 
 images here.
 
Now, a post-tropical storm Milton has moved offshore, but the danger itself has, of course, not passed. Flooding remains a threat as rivers continue to 
 
 swell. Nearly 3 million people are without power. And many airports at this point in time still remain closed. Randi Kaye has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's really hard to see. It's kind of spooky to see all the damage.
 
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hours after Hurricane Milton moved off the Coast of Florida, Floridians are surveying the extensive damage across the 
 
 state. There were a number of confirmed dead in St. Lucie County, over 100 miles from where the storm made landfall following tornadoes.
 
MICHAEL BRENNAN, DIRECTOR, U.S. NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER:  The tornadoes we saw develop yesterday in Milton were really kind of supercharged 
 
 compared to the typical tornadoes you see in a hurricane environment.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  New drone footage shows Milton's destruction on the West Coast of Florida, where the hurricane made landfall as a Category 3 
 
 storm.
 
The storm's monstrous winds ripping the roof of Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to shreds. And downing several cranes in downtown St. 
 
 Petersburg.
 
AMADOU DIOP, LIVES IN ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA:  Things can be replaceable, but life cannot.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  In Fort Myers, Robert Haight says he got his pregnant wife and kids to a safe spot just moments before a tornado bore down on 
 
 them.
 
ROBERT HAIGHT, TORNADO VICTIM IN FORT MYERS, FLORIDA:  I saw the tornado coming. I yell for my wife to look at it, it's cool. Kid and wife come look 
 
 at it. Started to close, hit the trees. And we all started going for the hallway. Didn't even make it there in time, started, toot, toot. And I 
 
 heard a piece of glass crack, and it sucked the whole roof off, and I felt the thing sucking me up, and I grabbed my kid and my wife, and hunkered 
 
 down.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  Another Fort Myers homeowner says the storm ripped his matter of minutes.
 
CONNOR RERIN, HOME DESTROYED IN FORT MYERS, FLORIDA:  All this, this happened like instantaneously. Like these windows blew out, I was about 
 
 probably right here when it happened.
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
KAYE (voice-over):  One Tampa business owner braved floodwaters to assess the damage to his commercial property Thursday.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't know what to say. It's a lot. Born and raised, I've never seen anything like this.
 
BILL FORQUER, LIVES IN VENICE, FLORIDA:  With Helene, for the first time, we had storm surge and took on water in the 20 bottom units. Now, with 
 
 Milton here we've lost brand-new carports. Our dock is destroyed.
 
KAYE (voice-over):  While many evacuees are hoping to soon return home, hard-hit Sarasota's chief of emergency management is urging people to hold 
 
 on a little longer.
 
SANDRA TAPFUMANEYI, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CHIEF, SARASOTA COUNTY, FLORIDA:  Still dangerous out there. So, we're asking for residents just to stay put. 
 
 You know, we know a lot of people evacuated, which we appreciate, but we just need some time to clear everything so that it's safe for them to 
 
 return.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER:  Nearly 3 million people are without power across Florida. For those running their own standby generators, the lights are staying on. According 
 
 to Generac Power Systems, demand is growing for these generators as consumers take control of their energy needs. Generac says more frequent 
 
 extreme weather events, along with rising demand for electricity from technologies such as A.I. and electric vehicles are taking a toll on an 
 
 aging power grid.
 
Aaron Jagdfeld is the company's chairman, president, and CEO. Aaron, thank you so much for being with us. Just, first of all, let's start with what 
 
 sort of impact does multiple hurricanes back-to-back have on grid reliability?
 
AARON JAGDFELD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, GENERAC POWER SYSTEMS:  Yes, thanks for having me on. You know, and obviously, the images are horrible and we -- 
 
 our hearts go out to the people that are actually going through this tragedy. You know, both Helene and now here with Milton.
 
And this has become the new norm. You know, I think when you look at the severe weather patterns we have, the extremities of weather that have been 
 
 taking place here is over 100 days this year in total in Phoenix that are over 100 degrees. You've got rapid intensifications of storms like Milton. 
 
 In 24 hours, it went from a tropical storm to a Cat 5 hurricane.
 
And, you know, this is putting just tremendous pressure on the grids. Almost 70 percent of all outages are caused by some kind of weather event 
 
 and the greater extremities that we go through with weather, the more we're going to see these types of outages.
 
ASHER:  Right. So, you have more outages. You -- you know, we now have, obviously, more hurricanes because of climate change, and that obviously 
 
 means there's a lot more interest in generators. What does that mean for you guys in terms of making sure there's enough with the supply?
 
JAGDFELD:  Yes, I think it's -- so, the supply side of it, you know, we can -- we'll figure out how to build more products as people continue to find 
 
 interest in these categories. I think it is interesting, though, you know, the power outages themselves are -- you know, if you think back at 20, 30 
 
 years ago, you have an outage in your home and, you know, it's certainly an inconvenience. But today, so much of our lives is centered around having a 
 
 continuous source of power.
 
And in particular now, you know, after coming out of the pandemic and the kind of the new way that we work today and more of a hybrid type of format 
 
 where we're spending at least some time in our homes doing some amount of work, you know, it's impacting livelihoods as well as -- you know, as well 
 
 as just being an inconvenience.
 
And you put together with that, also, you know, the need to refrigerate medications. You've got home medical devices. You know, it's a pretty 
 
 serious situation when you don't have power. So, we just have seen a marked interest in these types of products over the last couple of decades.
 
ASHER:  Yes. I mean, I think you bring up a great point about working from home, meaning that people depend on generators in place like Florida more 
 
 than they ever did before. So, in terms of preparing for the storm, I mean, obviously, you know, a lot of people, I'm sure, would go out prior to the 
 
 storm, trying to get their hands on a portable generator because they have no idea what's going to happen. How were you guys able to get enough 
 
 portable generators on the shelves in anticipation of the storm?
 
JAGDFELD:  Yes, it really does start with those portable generators. You're right. I mean, we try to position product in markets, you know, ahead of 
 
 storms, which we successfully were able to do with Helene and Milton.
 
Beryl was a little bit tougher. We didn't have a lot of lead time that was going to hit the city of Houston. It kind of took a track that wasn't 
 
 forecasted. But when we have a decent forecast, we have several days, we work with our retail partners and others to try and preposition that 
 
 product. And then, of course, once an event hits, it's very difficult for us to get more product into a market until it's safe, until it's safe for, 
 
 you know, drivers and people to return to retail outlets on.
 
And now, you know, we've got over 3 million homeowners in Florida, they were without power and likely are going to be without power for the next 
 
 several days. So, we're working to get more product down there as conditions improve.
 
But then they'll switch to home standby generators. You know, people who want a more permanent solution, something that turns on automatically, 
 
 works off of the home's fuel system. You know, those are products that have become quite popular as kind of a home improvement project and they just 
 
 have a lot more utility and value than a portable.
 
ASHER:  All right. Aaron Jagdfeld of Generac Power Systems, thank you so much for being with us. Appreciate it.
 
JAGDFELD:  Thank you.
 <br>[18:50:00]
 
ASHER:  All right. Still to come, the King of Clay calls it a day. Rafa Nadal announces his retirement from tennis. We'll look back at his 
 
 illustrious career.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER:  All right. The biggest names in tennis are all paying tribute to Rafael Nadal, who has announced his upcoming retirement at the age of 38, 
 
 known as the King of Clay, Nadal has won 22 Grand Slam titles and a lasting place in tennis history. Patrick Snell has more on Nadal's incredible 
 
 career.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Rafael Nadal sealed his first Grand Slam title at just 19, winning the French Open on his favorite clay court 
 
 surface in 2005. The first of a record 14 men's singles crowns at Roland Garros, where even his greatest rivals had the utmost respect for him.
 
ROGER FEDERER, PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER:  It was not clay my problem. I think it was Rafa my problem.
 
SNELL (voice-over):  His last Grand Slam triumph came in 2022, fittingly, again at Roland Garros. Nadal overcoming debilitating pain in his foot to 
 
 beat Norway's Casper Ruud and bite into the famed Coupe des Mousquetaires one last time.
 
RAFAEL NADAL, 22-TIME GRAND SLAM CHAMPION:  In some way, I know I am in an important part of the history of the sport, you know, and that makes me 
 
 feel proud, happy.
 
SNELL (voice-over):  Throughout his career, Nadal battled a series of foot, knee, and wrist injuries. Setbacks that helped shape perspectives when he 
 
 was fit and healthy.
 
NADAL:  It's true that when you are coming back after the low moments, victories are more special, more emotional. But I always know that that's 
 
 not forever.
 
SNELL (voice-over):  Nadal, Djokovic, and Swiss legend Roger Federer thrilled fans during an unprecedented golden era of dominance for the 
 
 sport's big three.
 
NADAL:  We did beautiful things together and important things for our sport. And in terms of professional tennis career, I think we push each 
 
 other to be better.
 
SNELL (voice-over):  And nobody who saw Nadal's classic 2008 Wimbledon final victory against Federer will ever forget it. An epic five-set 
 
 marathon regarded as one of the greatest matches ever played.
 
There were the emotional moments too, as Nadal shared with CNN in 2010, after injury problems and the end of his parents' marriage a year earlier 
 
 forced him to take a break from the sport.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Did you ever doubt that you were going to make that comeback? How hard did you work?
 
NADAL:  Sure, I had doubts, like everybody, no? And in that moment, I didn't know if I was going to be another time at my best.
 
SNELL (voice-over):  Nadal, who also won two Australian Open and two Wimbledon crowns, along with four U.S. Open titles, would movingly wear his 
 
 heart on his sleeve in 2022 when Federer announced his retirement from the sport at the Lever Cup. Once rivals, now close friends, both men 
 
 emotionally holding hands as they fought back tears.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
Nadal won a total of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, at the time a men's record. Sixteen of those triumphs were overseen by his coach and uncle, 
 
 Tony Nadal, who'd introduced a then three-year-old Rafa to the sport.
 
Rafa Nadal won over 90 times on the ATP Tour. He was also twice an Olympic gold medalist, always the class act on and off the court. Nadal is rightly 
 
 regarded as the greatest clay court player of all time.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER:  All right. And finally on "First Move," Paris is famous for a lot of things. The Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and more recently the hit Netflix 
 
 romcom "Emily in Paris."
 
Studies show the series has actually given the French tourism industry a boost over the years. So, imagine French President Emmanuel Macron's shock 
 
 and surprise when he learned that the latest season, Emily has actually decamped to Rome after meeting an Italian love interest. President Macron 
 
 says his country will fight -- relax. After all, no matter what happens, Emily will always have Paris.
 
All right. That just about wraps up the show. Thank you so much for watching. I'm Zain Asher. You're watching CNN.
