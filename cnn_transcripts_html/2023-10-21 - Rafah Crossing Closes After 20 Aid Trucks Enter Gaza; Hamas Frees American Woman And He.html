ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and a warm welcome to all of you watching in the United States and all around the world. I'm Isa Soares in London with our ongoing coverage of Israel at War. It is 10 a.m. here in London, noon, in Gaza, with a Rafah Border Crossing into Egypt open about two hours ago for the first time in weeks, and then close just minutes later. You're looking, I believe at live pictures. It was just enough time for 20 trucks with much needed humanitarian aid to cross from Egypt into Gaza. 
 
Hamas says the trucks were loaded with medicines, medical supplies, and limited quantity of canned foods. So 20 trucks crossing over into Gaza. Of course what we know, what we've been hearing from officials, NGOs is that many, many more needed and more than 400 or so we're making this trip on a daily basis prior to this conflict. There is this is just a trickle. But we are starting to see the start of that aid going in.
 
Meanwhile, Hamas took the unexpected step of releasing two American hostages on Friday, a mother and daughter from Illinois. Natalie Raanan and her mother Judith were visiting family at a Kibbutz close to Gaza when they were taken hostage by Hamas two weeks ago. 
 
Back home in Illinois, Natalie's father said he couldn't wait to see his daughter again. Have listened to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
URI RAANAN, DAUGHTER, EX-WIFE RELEASED BY HAMAS: I've been waiting for this moment for a long time for two weeks. I haven't been sleeping for two weeks. Tonight, I'm going to sleep good. I spoke with my daughter earlier today. She sounds very good. She looks very good. She was very happy. And she's waiting to come home. I'm going to hug her and kiss her and it's going to be the best day of my life.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: While Israel says the hostage release was a result of military pressure on Hamas. But a statement from the group claimed it was done for humanitarian reasons. Hamas is believed to be holding about 200 hostages. CNN's Katie Polglase joins us with the very latest. 
 
Katie, let's start really about the -- talking about the Rafah Crossing, because so much desperation I think, for so many trying to get their aid into Gaza, should give us a sense of how many trucks -- the trucks have gotten, when there will be distributed and any hope for those wanting to get out of Gaza as well. Those waiting?
 
KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER: Yeah, that's a really important, that last point there, Isa, we're seeing pictures just this morning from our journalists on the ground of people waiting, sitting at this crossing waiting to get out. They think that this crossing is going to let them out soon. But as so far, that hasn't happened. It's just aid getting in. 
 
Nonetheless, that aid is very welcome. We've mentioned already 20 trucks. Of course, that is not enough, there needs to be more. But 20 trucks is the agreed amount. That is the amount that the U.S. President Biden, along with the president of Egypt and with Israel all agreed would be the amount we waited for days. It was meant to be Friday, then it was Saturday it is finally opening. 
 
But, again, this is just a very short amount of time. And clearly the situation is very tense. We can see on the other side of the border, there have been people on the Egyptian side very jubilant, very happy about it opening in this aid. Finally getting in. We understand it was the Egyptian Red Crescent that was enabling this along with the United Nations, of course on the ground, then handing it over to the Palestinian Red Crescent, another form of the U.N. again, accompanying them and distributing it now to civilians. 
 
And we have now as well, a comment from the U.N. themselves on this aid and how welcome it is they've posted on Twitter talking about it. And there are some notable wording that I think we should look at here. They say that this is the start of a sustainable effort, that is what they are confident it will be, the start of a sustainable effort to provide essential supplies. 
 
Now, the meaning behind that is that there needs to continue to happen. This can't just be one convoy of 20 trucks. It needs to continue and that is very clearly reflected on the humanitarian situation on the ground, the dire need for food, water medical supplies. This entire area has not received any aid for 14 days since this conflict first started. So really we have to wait and see to see if more aid gets in.
 
SOARES: Sustainable. Yeah, it needs -- that's exactly the key line. That's what we've been hearing, Katie, from any NGOs. We know from the U.N. about 219 trucks are waiting on the Rafah Crossing. But, of course, like you said, the deal, the agreement was with these 20 trucks. 
 <br>[05:05:07]
 
The Egyptian Red Crescent part of this, we know that Egypt's al-Sisi is holding a peace summit today in Cairo. Just talk us through what we can expect to come from this meeting, given the fact that as you and I have been discussing the last hour, you know, Iran's not part of these discussions, United States is not part of this discussion, what are we hoping to get out of this? POLGLASE: Yeah, that's right, Isa. There are some notable absentees, there are 34 countries that are there, that are turning up. We're seeing them in the last few moments really arriving for this summit. And clearly this is a sign that diplomacy needs to start happening and needs to start de-escalating the situation. That is what everyone on the ground is saying. 
 
And we're hearing as well, just this morning from Ursula von der Leyen, She's the Chief of the E.U. Commission saying that just this summit is an important first step, just getting people around the table with various different reasons, allegiances, reasons for being there, getting them around the same table and talking about this is really important. We know the Palestinian President Abbas is also going to be there. 
 
But of course, the United States is not, Israel is not. And so the amount of agreement that comes out will, really it depends. But I think it is notable how many people have decided to turn up various European leaders as well in the -- in the room. Clearly, there is a sense of urgency about this, there is a sense that diplomacy needs to happen. And if you look at the hostage situation, the release of just those two, Qatar was the mediator. Qatar is also at the summit today, clearly mediation various different state actors talking to each other, getting to some kind of negotiation can, in some cases, create some positive results.
 
SOARES: You see a positive results for glimmer of hope for those two families, of course, much more is needed but critically diplomatic in diplomacy, a chance on the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza. And also like you said, Katie, making sure that this doesn't -- this conflict doesn't escalate. Katie Polglase, thank you very much, Katie. 
 
Well, as we've been reporting, Hamas freed two American hostages on Friday and mother and daughter from Illinois. Earlier, my colleague Lynda Kinkade spoke with the IDF spokesperson about. This is what he had to say, have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: There are 201 other families that are torn to pieces by this huge tragedy. And of course, we have to do everything we can in order to bring them home. And this is -- we're relieved by these -- by who did and -- 
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR: And I do want to ask you, Lieutenant Colonel about those other hostages, 201 hostages still being held captive by Hamas from dozens of countries. Do you have any indication about the condition of those still in captivity and any other developments on negotiations for their release?
 
LERNER: So we've been being very cautious about saying anything that you can understand, it's a very delicate issue, and the safety and well-being. It out roles and is much more important than us reporting to it at this time. Hamas' responsibility for the well-being of all of them. And we're happy to see that the International Committee of the Red Cross did have access and yesterday were involved in the release. And -- and indeed, we will -- we will continue to be cautious in our actions in order to bring them home as soon as possible and get them released. Hopefully in safe and sound. 
 
Unfortunately, you know, we don't trust Hamas. How can you trust a terrorist organization that butchers babies, abduct, kills, murders, massacres, the unfathomable -- unfathomable barbarism of this organization, and everything they're doing currently is, I would say psychological terrorism. So let's try and keep that in the context of this conflict. And that is why Hamas at the end of this cannot come -- can never ever be in a pot, in a position of power to conduct terrorism from the Gaza Strip using the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for that terrorism against our people.

SOARES: Well, as you can imagine, the news of the women's release was enormous relief to their family battling annoying one get more now from CNN's Whitney Wild.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The walk to freedom in a snapshot, 59-year-old Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie are finally safe after two weeks as Hamas hostages.
 
They're headed home after many prayers and tears.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because they're innocent -- 
 
WILD: A community's fear now replaced by joy.
 
RABBI MEIR HECHT, CO-DIRECTOR, CHABAD OF EVANSTON: Our prayers have been heard for Judith and Natalie and we are so overjoyed. 
 
WILD (voice-over): Judith and Natalie traveled to Israel from Evanston, Illinois, and have been missing since the Hamas attacks on October 7th. They were visiting a Kibbutz in Israel for Judith's mother's 85th birthday. Judith's sister told CNN she had no idea if they'd ever return. 
 
SARAY COHEN, SISTER OF JUDITH RAANAN: I'm very worried about my sister and my niece. My niece is -- she's not even 18. She's supposed to be celebrating her birthday on the 24th of this month. We know that young women are being raped and injured. And Judith is -- she's not very, very healthy.
 <br>[05:10:20]
 
WILD (voice-over): She says Hamas kidnapped 11 other family members from another Kibbutz and they are still missing, though CNN cannot independently verify that information.
 
COHEN: As you can imagine, we are devastated, and we are having quite a hard time.
 
WILD (voice-over): Natalie's brother told CNN, he's looking forward to hugging his sister again and helping however he can as she recovers from the trauma.
 
BEN RAANAN, NATALIE RAANAN'S BROTHER: At least from my father, Natalie is doing well, is composed. We are ready to start this incredible journey of healing and trauma relief for her.
 
HECHT: Both Judith and Natalie are artists; kind, giving, generous souls.
 
WILD (voice-over): The office of the Israeli Prime Minister says the Israel Defense Forces met Judith and Natalie at the border Friday, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross, transferring them to a military base in the center of Israel to meet family members. As one family readies to embrace their loved ones, the families and friends of hundreds more are left to wait and wonder.
 
HECHT: They've gone through the most evil period of their life and by people that inflicted just terror and horror to them and to so many others, and our job is to be there for them.
 
WILD: According to the White House, President Biden spoke with both Judith and Natalie Friday by phone. U.S. officials are racing to try to bring home the 10 other Americans still in Hamas hands. Whitney Wild, CNN, Evanston, Illinois.

SOARES: And while one family celebrates the return of their loved ones, for other families in Israel, a simple trip to the supermarket is tempting fate. The city of Ashkelon is believed to be the most heavily bombarded in the Jewish State. It is located -- you can see there in your map, south of Tel Aviv but just north of Gaza as we hear from Jeremy Diamond, living your life under rocket fire can leave your nerves roll, even when running just mundane errands.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go inside, go inside, go inside.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is life in Ashkelon, the most fired-upon city in Israel since Hamas launched its first rockets 12 days ago.
 
Here, fear still grips some. Others carry on, ignoring the sirens' wails.
 
SHLOMO COHEN, ASHKELON RESIDENT (through translator): When we are outside, we are very careful. When we are inside, God is protecting us. Every missile has an address. You don't need to be afraid.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): In a city where 90% of businesses have closed, this supermarket is a lifeline.
 
(On camera): There's a lot of businesses that are closed.
 
ADINA MORDECHAI, SUPERMARKET CASHIER: They're closed.
 
DIAMOND: But the supermarket -- 
 
MORDECHAI: It's working because people have to eat. They have to drink.
 
DIAMOND: You come once a week or --
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once a week. Now we're very afraid. If they're saying now, rocket, I was lying on the road and to put my hand -- my hands on my head.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Getting to a bomb shelter isn't an option for everyone here, prompting the city to help evacuate thousands.
 
HEZI HALEVI, ASHKELON CEO: We still have around 35,000 people that actually live without shelters. So each and every rocket, it means a direct risk for them. So we are trying to find solution for them.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): More than 1,200 rockets have targeted Ashkelon and while most are intercepted by the Iron Dome, about 200 have made direct hits, displacing families from their homes, causing casualties and shuttering businesses, like this bakery.
 
DOR MACHLUF, BAKERY OWNER (through translator): When we got here, everything was in pieces. The door was out of place. There was the smell of gunpowder. A lot of nails and shrapnel was put out. Everything was destroyed. We are starting to put things right.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): In the basement of an unassuming building, Ashkelon's CEO takes us inside the city's operation center, where officials are trying to shorten response times, tracking rockets headed for the city.
 
HALEVI: Our rescue teams, police, ambulances and everything is going from here.
 
DIAMOND: So before the rocket even lands, you can see where it would land?
 
HALEVI: Yes. We have some estimation where it's going to land.
 
DIAMOND (voice-over): Until then, the first responders wait and pray. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Ashkelon.

SOARES: All Israeli forces are standing by, ready to move into Gaza at any moment. We'll give you an inside look as preparations for ground invasion ramp up. That's just ahead. 
 <br>[05:15:04]
 
And could Israel face new threats or more than one front? We look at concerns around Hezbollah and what that could mean in terms of the wider military strategy. Both those angles after this very short break. You are watching CNN.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SOARES: The IDF says it's preparing for the next stages of the war against Hamas. You are looking at tanks lined up near the border with Gaza right there where the prospect of a ground incursion is looming. In a news conference, the IDF spokesperson said the current priority is the return of all hostages.
 
In Gaza itself, the hospital says Israel has demanded the immediate evacuation of the building. Ahead of an airstrike at some point overnight, asked for comment the IDF said it requested residents in the northern area guards to evacuate to "in order to mitigate civilian harm." 
 
The World Health Organization says such a demand would be impossible to carry out given the hospital currently houses around 12,000 displaced people, plus hundreds of patients. 
 
Well, as Israel prepares for the potential ground incursion into Gaza, the U.S. and its allies are urging the country to be strategic and clear about its goals. U.S. and Western officials have told CNN there should be a particular emphasis on avoiding civilian casualties. 
 <br>[05:20:12]
 
CNN's Brian Todd takes a closer look now at how hundreds of thousands of Israeli forces are getting ready to move into Gaza. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Meeting with soldiers in recent days, Israel's defense minister said, "Gaza will never return to what it was," an ominous signal of what's to come when Israel launches its expected ground invasion of Gaza.
 
MAJOR JOHN SPENCER, (RET.) AUTHOR, "UNDERSTANDING URBAN WARFARE": One of the biggest forces in the world who is prepared for entering a contested environment like this is the IDF. But of course there is no bloodless war. They'll take a lot of casualties. And I think they know that.
 
TODD: With more than 300,000 soldiers and reservists getting ready for combat, military analysts expect the Israelis to launch the invasion on multiple fronts.
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: This is Gaza City. And what we can expect is for the Israeli forces to most likely go in this way. And this way, probably the preponderance of force will be in this direction into Gaza City.
 
TODD: Inside Gaza, experts say this will be urban combat, possibly even tougher than what was seen in this footage from Israel's 2014 invasion of Gaza. Block to block, building to building and vicious, the Israelis facing an enemy that knows every corner.
 
SPENCER: Major challenges that the defenders had time to prepare and that no matter what you have to move forward, and -- and basically wait until the defender shoots you.
 
LEIGHTON: Look how narrow this alleyway is. Look how this soldier has to point up to see if there are any fighters above him in these areas. This is a perfect place for these fighters to be situated for them to rain down fire.
 
TODD: Often caught in the crossfire, Palestinian civilians. Experts say Hamas does not shy away from using civilians as human shields in a combat environment.
 
GEN. WESLEY CLARK, (RET.) CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Hamas wanted all those people to stay. It's blown up, put in barricades, it's destroyed transit areas and other things in an effort to fix them in place. 
 
TODD: To ambush the Israelis, analysts say Hamas will use sophisticated IEDs, snipers, hidden on upper floors of buildings. Another Hamas asset the Israelis will have to navigate hundreds of miles of tunnels known as the Gaza Metro.
 
HAREL CHOREV, TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY: With command controls and communication rooms and supply rooms and peers for launching rockets.
 
TODD: And there's the added complication of the hostages Hamas is holding. While two hostages have just been released, there are likely up to 200 more still inside Gaza, many of whom analysts say could be held in the tunnels. 
 
(On camera): Does that mean that they'll go into the tunnels, the Israelis to try to get them? Or is it just too dangerous?
 
LEIGHTON: It's very dangerous. But in certain circumstances, the Israelis will probably feel the need to go into these tunnels.
 
TODD: And the dangerous don't end even in the areas that the Israelis will have secured. Former CIA Director David Petraeus told CNN that in the areas they capture, the Israelis will then have to conduct counterinsurgency operations, because Hamas and its allies will try to come back. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
SOARES: Let's get more then on the wider threats Israel could be facing. I want to bring in Yoel Guzansky, a Senior Fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and a former National Security Council official in Israel. Yoel, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. We have seen, we have been seen in the last few days increased strikes from Lebanon into Israel. We've also seen Israeli towns evacuated because of this growing concern and threat. How do you read its actions and intentions here on the Hezbollah side?
 
YOEL GUZANSKY, SENIOR FELLOW, INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES: Good afternoon from Tel Aviv, Israel. This is a good question. I think Hezbollah is trying to operate beneath the threshold of war or what Hezbollah believes is Israel threshold. I think this is -- this possesses a risk for both sides because neither side knows exactly what the other side's threshold is. When we talk about Hizballah one needs to understand this is not
 
 Hamas. This is something else. Even back in 2010, I think then U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said and I quote, "Hezbollah possesses the danger and as more missile than most countries in the world." Since then Hizballah numbers of rockets and missiles and the precision guided missiles, those numbers have just grown. So this is something else that we are witnessing in the north.
 
SOARES: And Yoel, what we are seeing today, the New York Times is reporting today that U.S. officials learned that the Israeli Defense Minister and other more hawkish military officials supported a kind of preemptive strike on Hezbollah after those brutal attack against Israelis on October 7, President Biden has been urging against it. This is according to The New York Times. How do you see the U.S. role here and who is anyone can help rein in Hezbollah?
 <br>[05:25:06]
 
GUZANSKY: Well, I don't think there is an agreement inside Israeli cabinet, the word cabinet now even -- even the Israeli public on what should be the best policy vis-a-vis, Hezbollah, one of those alternatives. One of those options, as you mentioned, is a preemptive strike on -- on Hizballah. But I don't think there's an agreement on that. And I also think that the fact that the U.S. is here, with the Navy assets and other assets in the region, not just the terror Hezbollah, but also the terror Israel from moving forward, perhaps with -- with this option. 
 
I think U.S. publicly even said that he doesn't want to open another front, they want to contain and that Israel focus on the South. Southern Israel actually think we should do that, focus on the south, but something we should take an advantage of the U.S. presence here and do something else, something wider because Hezbollah possesses a much bigger threat than Hamas.
 
SOARES: That is very -- that is very interesting context. That's important -- important that you brought that up. Let me give the perspective view with the perspective of Lebanon, the Foreign Minister Bouhabib told CNN this. Let's have a listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDALLAH BOU HABIB, LEBANESE FOREIGN MINISTER: We have been very afraid and very worried that the war could spread to Lebanon. This -- the last thing we want, we've had wars, it's enough for us. And we're trying to have peace now in North and Southern Lebanon.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: So I mean, Lebanon doesn't want war. So help us make sense of this for our viewers around the world, because they're a part of it, but they're not really in it. So is this just a signal solidarity with Hamas? Or is this to divert resources from Israel's efforts in Gaza?
 
GUZANSKY: Absolutely, I think Hezbollah, first of all, is encouraged by Hamas success. I think both Hamas and Hezbollah don't believe how much success they gained on September -- on October 7. I think -- it thinks -- Hezbollah think that Israel is weak now in a weak position, and it might take advantage of that. 
 
Also, it wants to show solidarity with Hamas and try to deter any IDF thinking from a ground entry into Gaza. But I think also that Hizballah is restrained by several factors. And I named some of those factors. First of all, as you mentioned, the damage that the IDF response to Hezbollah aggression might cause Lebanon, not just Hezbollah, but the country of Lebanon. 
 
Also, I think Iran, perhaps desire to preserve Hezbollah power because Hezbollah represents some kind of a deterrent vis-a-vis Israel, might Iran nuclear installations attack. And also, I think Hezbollah is in a different stage now the last two weeks first because Israel military preparedness and also the U.S. factor.
 
SOARES: Yeah.
 
GUZANSKY: I think if not -- if it does not affect Hezbollah calculation it affects Iran calculations and Iran control Hezbollah to an extent.
 
SOARES: Yeah. I also do wonder how much appetite there is domestically for another war. I mean, the country is facing grave domestic crisis at home and I'm getting -- I'm getting any sort of military engagement would only worsen that. Yoel, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. Yoel Guzansky there from the Tel Aviv. We're going to take a short break. We'll back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:32:00]
 
SOARES: Welcome back, everyone. You are looking at the Rafah Crossing at the Egypt Gaza border. About two hours ago, it opened just long enough for 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid much needed, I must say, humanitarian aid to pass into the Palestinian enclave.
 
And volunteers on the Egyptian side celebrated that moment, you seen their chanting, we opened the road. It is the first humanitarian aid to reach Gaza since that Israel-Hamas war broke out two weeks -- two weeks ago. And this comes of course on the heels of the release of an American mother and her daughter who had been held captive by Hamas in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden's spoke with them on the phone shortly after they were freed to offer support. Here's how America's top diplomat is reacting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We welcome the release. We share in the relief that their families, friends and loved ones are feeling. But there are still 10 additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict. We know that some of them are being held hostage by Hamas, along with an estimated 200 other hostages held in Gaza.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOARES: Meantime, the IDF says it is preparing for the next stages of its war against Hamas. And you are looking at tanks lined up near the border with Gaza, where they have been now for days, where the prospect of course of a ground incursion is looming. Salma Abdelaziz is covering all these angles for us and joins me now with the latest. 
 
Salma, let's get to the breaking news that we've had in the last two hours. Those 20 trucks making their way into Gaza, is just a trickle. But just talk us through what we know about the distribution when that's going to happen. And just clarify for our viewers around the world where civilians do your nationals or other civilians were able to cross the border.
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER: Right. So first of all, nobody's been able to cross. All that we've seen come today is those 20 truck -- trucks, rather, going into Gaza. That's after very intensive diplomatic efforts. And as you mentioned, that is a trickle in the ocean of need on the ground. 
 
Let's just take a pause and think about how much effort it required to get just 20 trucks into Gaza, you're talking about President Biden had to negotiate. There was these intensive diplomatic efforts that span from Egypt to Israel to the United States, again, just to get 20 trucks across. And when you look at the need on the ground, this isn't even going to fill the deficit. 
 
We understand that seven out of 21 of the primary care facilities, the hospitals in Gaza have already shut down because they're unable to run power. They don't have the medical supplies required. When you talk about the distribution of this aid. It's going to be extremely complicated by the fact that airstrikes continue to rain down on Gaza. So this is going to be very difficult and you have to remember, there are more than 200 trucks according to the United Nations waiting on the Egyptian side. And that waiting game means more lives lost. Isa.
 <br>[05:35:04]
 
SOARES: Yeah, you we saw, showed our viewers some of those tanks waiting, of course, on the Israeli side, as these strikes continue. Israel's Defense Minister told on Nic Robertson at one point this week that troops will soon see Gaza from the inside. What are you hearing here about if or when a possible incursion will take place? Because we have seen now, you know, troops amass for days on the border?
 
ABDELAZIZ: I think what's most concerning is to see that spiraling out of control humanitarian crisis rights groups, stay on the ground in Gaza, and to understand that that could only get much, much worse. According to the United Nations if tens of thousands of Israeli troops enter Gaza, I want to just start by playing a soundbite. So we have a current context of how this could play out from the former Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANNY DANON, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: We will try to minimize the civilian casualties. But we are determined to eliminate Hamas. It will not be easy. We encourage the population to move out of Northern Gaza because we intend to come in and when we come in, we're going to hunt down Hamas, we will eradicate them. So the population must move south. They can ignore our warning, but then they shouldn't come in and blame anyone else by themselves.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ: I want to first just pick apart that move to the south portion of that sound bite. Look, some 1 million people that's half the residents of Gaza have been displaced, already forced out of their homes in this conflict. They are desperate to find refuge. They are desperate to find safe haven. Some of them have fled south but the United Nation says there is no safe place. 
 
There have been heavy airstrikes on the south on areas like Khan Yunis and Rafah. We have heard and spoken to families who left their homes in the north only to find themselves caught up in bombardment in the south of the country, the whole of the Strip is being besieged. So no matter where a family goes, they're going to be looking at food shortages, water shortages, no power, no medical care. And then of course, you have to remember that the entire Strip is sealed off.
 
Israel announced, of course, a complete siege of the Gaza Strip. That means 2 million people are trapped in a war zone, Isa. half of them, half of the population of Gaza is children. The United Nations saying look, this is simply not how a humanitarian evacuation works. You have to provide corridors, you have to provide ways for people who are incapable of moving, and pregnant women, handicapped, children, doctors, people who are wounded, you have to provide a way for them to move and you have to provide some sort of safe haven which simply doesn't exist right now in the enclave.
 
SOARES: And there's just no infrastructure and that's something that I've been hearing as well, Salma, from doctors, some of them, these leading hospitals in Gaza city in the north of Gaza, where they say we can't move patients because it is a life sentence. Salma Abdelaziz -- death sentence, pardon me. Abdelaziz, thank you very much Selma. We'll take a short break. We'll be back after this.

In the Middle East and beyond, thousands in the streets raising their voices to protest Israel's actions in its war on Hamas. All this, while the anger toward Israel and its Western allies reaches fever pitch. Our Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman reports now from Beirut.

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Death to America, death to Israel, shouts the master of ceremonies at a rally in Beirut, southern suburbs. To a crowd of a few 100 supporters of Hezbollah and its Shia ally, the Amal Movement who don't want to be passive bystanders to the bloodshed in Gaza. 
 
We want the resistance to liberate Palestine, Randa Mohammed tells me.
 
Words in slogans like these are not new, again as the death toll in Gaza soars, passions are reaching the boiling point. Earlier this week, twice protesters north of Beirut tried to reach the American Embassy stopped only by riot police firing tear gas and water cannon. 
 
In Egypt, a rare unauthorized demonstration demands Arab regimes act to stop Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza. In Jordan, country where many trace their roots back to Historic Palestine. They call on the government to shut the American and Israeli embassies. 
 
But in Lebanon, it's not only protests on the border with Israel, it's just a notch below war. In South Lebanon every day Hezbollah is striking Israeli targets for five, six times today. Here in Beirut, they're holding rallies and talking about doing more, but so far it's just talks.
 
Hezbollah's main backer, Iran, has threatened to open a new front. Notably silent is Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah who hasn't uttered a word since the war began. I asked Hezbollah parliament member Ali Ahmad if his group is ready to go to war with Israel. The answer to that will come later. The daily Hezbollah attacks on the border are a hint of what that answer could be. Ben Wedeman CNN, Beirut.

SOARES: Well, as the war against Hamas enters its third week it seems children often suffer the most, and the stories are really heartbreaking. And we have to warn you, this next story contains graphic images some viewers may find disturbing. Our Jomana Karadsheh reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Why? Why have you gone my son, he wails. He wanted to be a pilot. You're only sleeping, he says, kissing his boy's lifeless body.
 
Every day of this war has brought pain, pain no parent wants to ever live through.
 
Every 15 minutes in Gaza, a child is killed, aid groups say. More than 1,500 children killed so far in a war that's only just beginning. A war they didn't choose. One for which they are paying the heaviest price.
 
Those who live haunted by what they've survived. The lucky ones still have parents to hold their hands. 10-year-old Abdulrahman (ph) still doesn't know the strike that left him injured took away his mom, dad, and three sisters. His aunt, the only one left to try and comfort him. He wakes up, he cries, they give him painkillers, and he goes back to sleep, she says.
 
I'm worried about him, the shock when he wakes up and finds out that his mother and father are gone, his aunt says. He is the youngest, he was so attached to his parents. He used to play football with his dad. He would go with him everywhere.
 
Families here say they all heeded the Israeli military's warning and moved south, thinking it would be safe. But it wasn't.
 
Malek (ph) is injured in the hips and legs. She lost her mother and siblings in an air strike.
 
A girl in the third grade, what did she do? Her aunt asks. Did she shoot Israelis? She didn't. We're peaceful people in our home, she says. We didn't launch any rockets or shoot. We didn't do anything.
 
9-year-old Mahmoud (ph) was out playing when his family home was hit. He is in hospital with head and leg injuries.
 <br>[05:50:00]
 
We were playing in the garden and suddenly a missile landed on us, he says. Trees fell on me. My mother, my father, my brother, and grandfather are injured. My uncle brought me unconscious to the hospital.
 
Most of the injured in Gaza, doctors say, are children and women. With no power, no water and medical supplies running out. The health care they need is on the verge of collapse.
 
Around half of Gaza's population are children. Most have only ever known life under a blockade and war. Now in this kill box, no place safe from Israel's relentless bombardment.
 
Desperate for any promise of safety, many have flooded at Shifa hospital grounds. The constant buzz of military drones overhead has become part of existence in Gaza.
 
Some find a little escape from this living nightmare no child should ever endure. Though Jane (ph) and Julia (ph) say their neighborhood was flattened by airstrikes. We've been living in so much fear, panic and anxiety, she says. Whenever I hear airstrikes, I don't know what to do. I hug my mom.
 
7-year-old Julia (ph), says she holds her mom to and hides. They are now living under the stairs.
 
I get upset when I see injured here in the hospital, Julia says. When I grow up, I want to become a doctor so I can treat them so they can get better.
 
It's a war on Hamas, they say, but it is the youngest who bear the brunt. Ensnared in violence they can't control, trapped in this race against death.

SOARES: Just heartbreaking images and stories right there from Jomana. Cindy McCain joins us now. She's the Executive Director of the World Food Program. Cindy, really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. I know how busy you are. We showed our viewers in the last two hours, the Rafah Crossing Border opening momentarily for a to get here. And of course, following all that waiting and desperation. Can you just confirm on your end, Cindy, the trucks making it through the negotiations and what happens now?
 
CINDY MCCAIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME: Well, thank you for covering us. Yes, 20 trucks went through today. It's obviously trips we negotiated, and we'll do so. But we're thrilled to have 20 trucks. The problem is we need more and we need safe and sustained access. So we're hoping that as the days go by, we can get more and more of our trucks in. Because as you know, starvation is rampant now within Gaza. And we need to get in there and make sure that we can see people who are going to need us the most.
 
SOARES: And on these 20 trucks, Cindy, I mean, what -- how will this be distributed with no ceasefire? Because like you said, the needs is huge, and people are desperate. And of course, this is just a trickle.
 
MCCAIN: Well, as you know, deputy was already on the ground prior to the war beginning. And so we have a network that's already set up to not only distribute food, but make sure that the food is secure and employing the people that it's supposed to go to. So we -- as you -- as you know, we are a large logistics operation. And this is what we do best. So we're thrilled, but we just want more of our trucks to be able to feed more people than what we're able to feed right now.
 
SOARES: And how soon will it be distributed, Cindy? I wonder if you -- I mean, does it need to be checked on the Gaza side or has already been done?
 
MCCAIN: Well, my understanding is that it's already been done. But again, I don't have that accurate information that from what I could see on TV that the trucks are rolling smoothly and thing transfers being made to the other trucks very, very smoothly, very evenly. So that's good. The problem is with this is that we want to make sure that we continue to give you more tracks, as I've said, it also makes sure that we get to the millions of people that are literally going to start to them. We need to make sure that by the end of this year, we that we have $100 million just to sustain what we're doing there. It's a tough place to be right now.
 
SOARES: Yeah. And like Jomana said, this is a matter of life and death. And I understand there was something like 219 trucks waiting on the other side. So I'm guessing the hope here, Cindy, is that this is -- isn't a one off. So talk to the next stage then making sure that this is a sustainable effort to keep the supplies going. What are you hearing?
 
MCCAIN: Well, I'm hearing just that, it's that -- it's going to continue. This cannot be the last convoy, it simply can't. They're truly wide to stay here. And so I've also been watching the peace conference. So I'm hoping to take all of the people in their leadership positions because they will remember the most important thing is that we get in there no food and medicine on life-sustaining items, so we don't lose any more people than we already have.
 <br>[05:55:07]
 
SOARES: And just before we came to you, we showed our viewers a report from our Jomana Karadsheh, really heartbreaking report that shows just the spiraling humanitarian situation on the ground. What are your team's been telling you, Cindy, just paint us a picture?
 
MCCAIN: Oh, it's -- it's catastrophic. It really is. I mean, not just the lack of food, but now water, electricity, fuel. It's -- it's like a perfect storm of a humanitarian disaster. We cannot let this continue on. There's too many lives at stake, children at stake. And once again, as we know women and children and on is next.
 
SOARES: Yeah.
 
MCCAIN: So we're hoping that we're getting (inaudible) emergency food that we do. That's fine nutrition, high energy, but also with our other sustaining food of victims, it needs from a longer-term standpoint. We also -- the attack is transferred (inaudible) storage very limited right now as to what's available for people to actually buy.
 
SOARES: Cindy, really appreciate you taking the time of your busy schedule, to bring us this context, of course, and the latest on the ground, Cindy McCain there, appreciate it, thank you. 
 
And before we go, if you'd like to help the humanitarian relief efforts for Gaza and Israel, head to cnn.com/impact. There you will find a list of vetted organizations answering the call on the ground. That's at cnn.com/impact.
 
And that does wrap up this hour of CNN Newsroom. I'm Isa Soares in London. CNN This Morning is next with more of our ongoing coverage of Israel at War. Thank you for your company. Have a good day.
