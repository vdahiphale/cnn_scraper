KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN HOST: Hello, and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber with the latest in our continuing coverage of the Israel- Hamas war. It's 5 a.m. here in Atlanta, noon in Gaza, day three of a fragile planned four-day truce between Israel and Hamas. 
 
So far, the pause in the fighting has held. Israel is now preparing to receive another group of hostages today. The government has their names and has informed their families. Further details about today's exchange haven't yet been announced. 13 Israelis and four Thai nationals released on Saturday, but only after an hour's long delay threatened to up end the exchange. 
 
The freed Israelis range from 67 to three years of age, following preliminary medical checks. They were taken to Israeli hospitals for care and to be reunited with their families. One doctor said, none of the people examined so far are in need of urgent medical attention, but they do show signs of extended captivity. Qatar has been at the forefront in mediating this truce and said difficulties like Saturday's unexpected delay are to be expected and work through. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: I can tell you that even before the pause began, we were anticipating that this would not be an easy process. We are in a warzone. Emotions are high on both sides and the level of death and destruction that we are seeing is unprecedented and therefore we shouldn't expect for the pause to be easily conducted and for the agreements to be easily conducted and monitored. And we were ready for this and the operation is going here in Doha immediately came into effect. As we saw the disagreements taking place. We know that we still have the two days and our negotiation team here in Doha led by His Excellency, the Prime Minister and the efforts taken by all the officials here in Doha to make sure that whenever we have an issue like this, we immediately jump in. We talk to all sides and get everybody on board and we are able to understand the concerns from both sides address them. And before the end of the day, before the, you know, that there'll be any breach to the past. We have it all settled and back on track like we did today.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Manisha Tank is standing by in Singapore. But let's begin with Elliott Gotkine in London. So Elliott, complications and delays on the hostage release. Take us through exactly what happened and how things were ultimately resolved?
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kim, the hostages were expected to be freed around 4 p.m. local time. But there were several hours and about seven hours until it actually happened. And the reason for the delay, at least according to Hamas, which of course, abducted these hostages as part of its murderous rampage of October the seventh, was that Israel wasn't sticking to its side of the deal to allow sufficient aid into the northern part of the Gaza Strip. 
 
And it was also not happy, it seems, with the seniority, the kind of number of years served by the Palestinian prisoners, who Israel was going to be releasing from Israeli prisons. Now, Israel denied that. And Israel I think was also concerned that on the names of those do to be freed or who were ultimately freed by Hamas did include a Hila Rotem, a 13-year-old girl, but didn't include her mother. Israel, saying that as part of the agreement, it was agreed that mothers would not be separated from their children. Israel saying that Hamas has now breached that.
 
Now, it's worth noting, we don't have the full text of this agreement that was painstakingly mediated by the Qataris. But according to Israel, part of that agreement does include the proviso that parents shouldn't be separated from children. 
 
In the end, it did happened. Those 13 Israeli hostages were freed and the 39 Palestinian prisoners were released as planned. And there is the hope and expectation that something similar will happen today. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, well, let's build on that, Elliott. What are we expecting exactly assuming the truce holds? 
 
GOTKINE: Right. So this is day three now of what is meant to be a four-day truce. So there are still according to this deal, a total of 50 Israeli captives due to be released by Hamas and a total of 150 prisoners due to be freed by Israel. So that is the plan that means that there are another, what, something like 24 Israelis due to be freed today and tomorrow. And an additional -- an additional 70 -- 72 Palestinians are due to be freed from Israeli jail. 
 <br>[05:05:22]
 
So the expectation is that this will happen again. The timing is supposed to be similar 4 p.m. local time. So that is what 9 a.m. Eastern time. That is when these things are supposed to happen. We don't know the identities yet of the hostage due to be free. We should really get them, Kim, around the same time as they are actually being released. 
 
BRUNHUBER: All right, appreciate the update. Elliott Gotkine in London, thanks so much. 
 
Now, I want to go to journalist Manisha Tank Manisha Tank in Singapore. And Manisha, in addition to the Israelis that were released today, more happy families in Thailand. Take us through who were released and how they're doing?
 
MANISHA TANK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so there have been another four hostages released. The hostages, the Thai hostages are mostly migrant workers. Many of them go from this part of the world, seeking better incomes. And they come from poor farming communities, namely in Thailand. There are tens of thousands of Thai migrants in Israel, many of them working in an agricultural belt, close to that southern border with Gaza and have been swept up in all of this. 
 
So yes, some very pleased families. In fact, the Foreign Minister, the Thai Foreign Minister, put out a tweet earlier in which he said, sent out as congratulations to those who have recently been released as well as to their families. And also said that they are preparing to return to Thailand, those 14 Thai nationals. So there were 10 that were released on Friday, and then another four on Saturday. And he also expressed his elation at the fact that they had been released as additional hostages. 
 
Now, I do need to point out that this is a separate agreement. This is not the same as the one that Elliot was talking about. This is something that the Thais have been working on. And again, the Qatari Government has been involved in this as well. Previously, the Thai government expressing its thanks to all of the parties involved in negotiating this particular aspect of the agreement. But as for their condition, it is described as stable. They are mostly healthy. The Thai Prime Minister earlier on social media saying that they were in good health and none of them needed emergency care, which is definitely good news, Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER: Absolutely. All right, Manisha Tank in Singapore, thanks so much. 
 
Families of those who are believed to be still in Hamas custody are holding out hope for their loved ones. Or Levy was kidnapped on October 7, and his wife was killed by Hamas. 
 
Well, joining me now from Ganei Tikva near Tel Aviv is Michael Levy. He's the brother of hostage Or Levy. Thank you so much for being here with us. First, Israel has received a list of hostages who are due to be released today. Have you heard whether hope against hope your brother might be on that list?
 
MICHAEL LEVY, BROTHER OF HOSTAGE OR LEVY: Yeah, unfortunately, Or isn't on that list. As a man is not included in this deal, unfortunately.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, that's the problem exactly. We've seen, you know, women and children released so far. No men, does it give you any hope that, you know, maybe in the next day, there's still one more day of the truce that they might start releasing people like your brother? Or do you sort of, you know, think it still will be women and children that will be released?
 
LEVY: As far as far as I understand, you know, the belief is always there. Obviously, we all want to get our loved ones as soon as possible. But my understanding is that this deal includes only women and children, and is not going to be on it. At least on those four days, maybe after.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. We can only hope. Two groups of hostages have been released. It must be sort of a jumble of different emotions, seeing them free, seeing the joy it brings to their families, but knowing that your brother still isn't coming home at least not yet.
 
LEVY: I think you're exactly right, some of those families became my family. Thomas and the (inaudible) and their loved ones, actually some of them were released yesterday became my family. So I was so happy and thrilled to see family and the Ella (ph) getting released. But on the other hand, of course until we all and the other hostages won't be released the feeling won't be complete.
 <br>[05:10:09]
 
BRUNHUBER: It's still very early, obviously. But have you heard anything from the hostages who were released about your brother's condition possibly?
 
LEVY: Not yet.
 
BRUNHUBER: And the problem is as well, the Red Cross still hasn't been given access to check on the hostages that haven't been released to give them, you know, medical checks, give them medication that they might need and so forth. How vital is this?
 
LEVY: For us, it's crucial. We don't know anything about my brother's condition. We are assuming he is injured, but we don't know anything for sure. And we want to know what his condition whether he's getting treatment or not. And any kind of information about him is crucial for us.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. This tragedy is all the deeper for your family because your brother's wife was killed, a two-year-olds, their son, you know, calling for his mom and dad and they're not there. What have you been telling the little one? How's he coping with this unimaginable loss?
 
LEVY: As you can probably imagine, there is -- there are no right words to say there is no way to tell a two-year-old son that he wants his mother anymore, and that his father is somewhere held in the tunnels of Gaza is looking for them all the time, he's calling for his mother, he's calling for his father. He wants to go home. You can tell he is not himself. So we are trying to do our best to show him love and support. But obviously it won't be the same as mom and dad. 
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, it's just unimaginably sad for him and for so many people. This truce, it's almost over. What's your message to the people who are negotiating to your Prime Minister to the Israeli government?
 
LEVY: It's very simple. Do whatever you need to do in order to get all of them back. That's as simple as that whatever needed, we are behind you, just bring them back.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah, let's hope that happens. And we wish you and your family all the best in this difficult time. Michael Levy, thank you so much for speaking with us. Appreciate it.
 
LEVY: Thank you so much.
 
BRUNHUBER: People living in northern Gaza just received the largest aid convoy since the war began. But is it enough? That's just, stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:17:16]
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NAHED SHUHALBER, CONTRACTED DRIVER (through translator): We're working in these conditions. It's like a Mission Impossible. We're working 12 hours or maybe more. But we're facing difficulties with the road conditions. We want to deliver the aid to Gaza City, but all the roads there are closed and filled with rubble. That's our main problem right now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Well despite those conditions, humanitarian officials say they have delivered the largest aid convoy to Gaza City and northern Gaza since the war began. The U.N. and the Red Crescent confirmed that 187 eight trucks made it into Gaza Saturday with food, water, fuel and medical supplies. 61 of those trucks reached northern Gaza, but Hamas says that's less than half of what they were promised, which is why they delayed releasing hostages for hours on Saturday. Hamas also accused Israel of quote manipulating the names and criteria of releasing women and child prisoners endangering the agreement. 
 
Nebal Farsakh, Spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society joins us live from Ramallah. Thank you so much for being here with us. So as I said, it's the largest aid convoy to Gaza City in the northern parts of the strip. First, what difference concretely will that make to the Palestinians who are getting that aid?
 
NEBAL FARSAKH, SPOKESPERSON, PALESTINIAN RED CRESCENT: Good morning. Thanks for having me. Yesterday, the Palestine Red Crescent was able to deliver the largest convoy to Gaza City and the north which has been under complete siege and completely prevented access of humanitarian aid. 
 
Yesterday, we were able to deliver around 53 trucks from the Palestine Red Crescent, along with six food trucks from UNRWA. Our trucks had a food, water, formula -- baby formulas as well as relief items. This was a great opportunity to deliver aid to those who are in critical needs of the humanitarian situation in Gaza City and the North is more than dire. And people there, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people who are still trapped there after over 51 days of this continuous escalation with complete percentage of the area without any aids getting to thrive. So obviously the aid is still doesn't fulfill the needs of all people there. But just a glimpse of hope. We hope we will be able to deliver more aids to all Gaza and particularly to the area of Gaza City and the North. Today, also we are expecting to deliver around 50 trucks of the humanitarian aid to Gaza City and the North.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yeah. I want to ask you about that because we heard that clip there from the person who was saying that, you know, there are so many so many challenges, getting it to the north. How important is that aid to get through there as well?
 <br>[05:20:05]
 
FARSAKH: Obviously, so since the beginning of the escalation our teams were completely prevented access to transport any aids, from south of Gaza to the north of Gaza. This as was the case since the beginning of the escalation. Unfortunately, none of the humanitarian agencies was able to deliver aid to Gaza City and the north. And with this continuous bombardment, and with the great challenges as well as the dire situation and the area, people were going to hunger. 
 
So now, I know the aid is just a little and it doesn't fulfill the needs of hundreds of thousands of civilians who are still in Gaza City and the North. This is the beginning. We hope we will be able to deliver more aid. It was also a great opportunity for the Palestine Red Cresent teams to supply our ambulances there with some basic first aid supplies because at the beginning of escalation, we had 18 ambulances that work in Gaza City and the north. And then because of the continuous bombardments, many of our ambulances went out of service, other stopped because they run out of fuel, as well as medical supplies. So we managed to support our ambulances. We now have only four ambulances. We manage also to support -- 
 
BRUNHUBER: And still some of those -- sorry to interrupt but still some of those ambulances and paramedics as I understand it, still can't get access to many areas despite the truce, is that right?
 
FARSAKH: Yes, so that was one of the extreme challenges for us. Because our hope was, during those four days, we will be able to arrive at the areas we were which where we prevented access to it. Unfortunately, this is the case, we are still denied access to many areas where there's dozens of people and dead bodies in the streets, and we are even unable to reach out to them, to transport it, to transport them to be buried or even to reach those who were injured, if they are still alive to try to save their lives. 
 
This is one of the major challenges our Palestine Red Cresent teams face in the ground. Our teams work tirelessly around the clock, although they are facing the great challenges, although they are facing degree losses as well. Yesterday, I was spoken to one of our colleagues, Osama (ph) who will
 
 who was working 24 hours at the operation at the emergency operation room in Gaza. I asked him why don't you go just have a little rest in your room. And he chat with me to send me a photo of his home which was a pile of rubble. And then seconds later he sent a beautiful photo of his beautiful home he was lost. The case of Osama just the case of every humanitarian and paramedic and our volunteers who are -- have to continue only due to trying to work as much as they can 24 hours to save other people's life. Although they are hearing constant losses for their family members, for brothers, sisters and even children.
 
BRUNHUBER: And you've been hearing from people, you know, calling you personally for help as well when the ambulances and so on can't get through, is that right?
 
FARSAKH: Yes, you know, even me I'm a spokesperson, you can't imagine how people are in desperate need. They start calling anyone who works for the Palestine Red Crescent. A woman called me, she was in a great fear and panic about the situation of her brother's family. She had lost connection with them for over two weeks. Her brother along with his wife and he has two children. And up to this moment she's -- she doesn't even know if they are still alive or not. They are living in an area which is close to our hospital, which has shut down because of the escalation in the area of Tel al-Hawa area in Gaza City. And unfortunately, up to this moment, even our teams are completely denied access to the area of Tel al-Hawa where there's dozens of people who are either killed or even injured. And even their family -- 
 
BRUNHUBER: And sorry, I want to jump in denied access by -- denied access by the IDF, is that right? By who?
 
FARSAKH: Yes, it's that right. That's why many people are still missing and their families don't know if they are still alive or not. So those four days they were a hope for people. They want to just to come back to check on their relatives, family members or even their rules. But unfortunately, as you know, even at those four days, people are completely denied access to the area from Gaza City and the north and even us as an emergency medical service provider, we are still denied access to many areas in Gaza City and the North that's why we can't even the check on those who have been trapped to know their situation if they are still alive or not.
 <br>[05:25:16]
 
BRUNHUBER: We'll have to leave it there but wish the best for all the emergency responders who are helping out there. Nebal Farsakh thank you so much for speaking with us. And if you would like information on how you can help with humanitarian relief efforts for Gaza in Israel, please go to cnn.com/impact and you can find a list of vetted organizations that are providing assistance. That's at cnn.com/impact. 
 
The director of Gaza Al-Shifa Hospital remains in Israeli custody. The Israeli military tells CNN, the IDF says it detained Muhammad Abu Salmiya last Thursday and turned him over to the Israeli security services for questioning. An IDF spokesperson says Hamas was using the hospital as a quote, "bed of terrorism," which Hamas and the hospital have denied. He says Israel will make a decision regarding Abu Salmiya's in due course. 
 
The number of journalists killed in Gaza, Israel and Lebanon since the October 7 Hamas attack has increased to at least 57. That's after the Committee to Protect Journalists confirmed the death of four Palestinian journalists on Saturday. The journalism advocacy group says 50 Palestinian for Israeli and three Lebanese journalists lost their lives since the Israel-Hamas war began last month. 
 
I'm Kim Brunhuber. For viewers here in North America we have more news in just a moment. For international viewers, Tech for Good Origami is next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[05:30:39]
 
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all you watching us here in the United States and Canada, I'm Kim Brunhuber. I want to get back to our continuing coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. 13 Israelis are back with their families today following their release late Saturday after seven weeks of captivity in Gaza. 
 
Thomas Hand had believed his daughter Emily had been killed on October 7. But you can just imagine what this moment was like for them. Emily turned nine while she was in Gaza. Israel is now preparing to receive another group of hostages later today. The government has their names and has notified their families. Further details about today's exchange haven't yet been announced. 
 
And beside the Israelis four Thai nationals were also released on Saturday, but only after an hour's long delay threatened to up end the exchange. When Doctor said, none of the people examined so far are in need of urgent medical attention, but they do show signs of extended captivity. 
 
A spokesperson for the Israeli military told CNN the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas appear to be in trouble on Saturday and was on the rocks for a while. The dispute caused a delay in the release of Israeli hostages, and was over aid to Gaza and which Palestinians the Israelis were willing to release. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAJOR DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESPERSON: The deal was definitely on the rocks for a while. And I have to say we were not surprised with the delay. If you remember yesterday, there was also a significant delay. This is really probably part of Hamas' strategy. They are a cruel terrorist organization that never misses an opportunity to inflict emotional pain. You know, everybody was sitting on pins and needles, everyone in Israel, certainly those families waited nine hours for their children and their mothers to come out of captivity after 50 days. And this was just more and more delaying tactics. 
 
I wouldn't be surprised if it happened again. And this is what we're up against. This is Hamas and who else leaves a family in such a lurch along with an entire nation. They know our weakness, our weaknesses, how much we want these people to come home. And they simply exploited it. We are dedicated to this framework. On our side, we've upheld all of the commitments that we -- that we committed to. The IDF has not fired on Hamas positions. Even though we know that Hamas positions we had the noose around the neck of many of the Hamas, the Hamas terrorists and we've held down, we've taken a defensive position in order to enable our hostages in, to be freed. Again, this is a drop in the bucket. But I wouldn't put anything by Hamas. Again, these are the type of tactics. It's psychological warfare. They know that they can basically take the Israeli people hostage by dangling over our heads, our hostages in the most cruel and pathetic way and I wouldn't be surprised.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER: Meanwhile, families of Israelis who are still in Hamas custody are pushing for their release as well. They say they have also submitted proof that their loved ones are still alive.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOAM PERI, FATHER IN HAMAS CUSTODY: We have a sign of life from my father, we know he's alive. From other people, from the community who were released yesterday, it brings a lot of hope. And yet together it's -- it's -- we feel very urgent to let them all out. We don't know how much time they're going to be able to hold on there. 
 
NADAV RUDAEFF, FAMILY MEMBER STILL IN HAMAS CUSTODY: I was very happy to hear from Noam that they do have some sort of sign that her dad is still alive. Unfortunately, I don't have that privilege. And the fact that we're still here 50 days later, trying to convince and demand the communities in Israel and around the world to come forth and help us bringing the pressure for everyone to be released is very important.

BRUNHUBER: President Biden spoke with Qatar's Emir on Saturday trying to resolve the delay that happened early on the second day of the hostage release. That's according to the National Security Council. 
 <br>[05:35:04]
 
So far no word on when any American hostages held by Hamas will be released. CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz is with the President in Massachusetts.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The White House is closely watching the coming hours waiting to hear whether any American citizens will be part of the next group of hostages that are expected to be released on Sunday. No American citizens were included in the first releases that occurred on Friday and Saturday, but the White House says they are hopeful that at least three Americans will be coming out in the coming days. It's expected that they will be part of this larger group that had been negotiated to release 50 women and children. And the American citizens who are officials are focusing in on our two women and also that young four-year-old girl, Abigail Adan, whose parents were killed in the October 7 attack by Hamas. But it also comes as President Biden has been working the phones, trying to ensure that this deal and the implementation of the deal remains on track.
 
On Saturday, he spent some time on the phone speaking with the Emir of Qatar, as well as the Qatari Prime Minister, as there were some delays in the hostage release concerns that the release might fall apart for Saturday. The President spoke with them to talk about the potential hurdles and also ways to overcome it and ultimately, around 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, the White House got word that the deal was moving forward. The release was moving forward. And the Red Cross would soon retrieve those hostages. Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to this out in California. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: There were some issues and challenges around implementation. President Biden spoke with the Emir to resolve those issues and we do believe they are being resolved. We're going to continue to be diligent and vigilant in doing all that we can in that regard to ensure that there is humanitarian aid going in, that hostages are going out. And our highest priority, of course, are the American citizens who are being held.
 
SAENZ: Now, the White House has been unable to pinpoint an exact day that the Americans will be released, but they are hopeful that they will be released in the coming days. And then there's also concerned about the other Americans believed to be held hostage by Hamas. There are about 10 Americans who are unaccounted for. The President told reporters on Friday that he did not know all of their conditions. Arlette Saenz, CNN traveling with the President in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

BRUNHUBER: Former President and current Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump attended the Palmetto Bowl Saturday in South Carolina. He also fired off some criticism of the hostage deal between Israel and Hamas on social media. 
 
On Truth Social, Trump commented on the fact that no Americans have been released so far saying the reason is, quote, "no respect for our country or our leadership." Trump's post came after U.S. officials said Americans weren't expected to be part of the second wave of hostages released Saturday. Emotions were pouring out as Palestinian prisoners arrived home after being released by Israel.

BRUNHUBER: Street celebrations got underway in the West Bank on Saturday to welcome home 39 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel. They were freed on the second day of the truce between Israel and Hamas. The prisoners included 33 male teenagers and six women. Among them was Israa Jaabis who was serving a 13-year sentence in Israel. She suffered burns across much of her body after her car exploded at a checkpoint eight years ago, which Israel said was an attempted murder. She denies that charge. Jaabis said she'd been away from home for so long that she could barely recognize her son. Here she is.

NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, for yet another night, the crowds have gathered to show their support and welcome the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees who have been released as part of that truce agreement between Israel and Hamas. Today we have seen some 39 prisoners and detainees released among them 33 minors, children under the age of 18.
 
Many of them held under administrative detention meaning no clear charges were laid against them. No ongoing legal process. And throughout the day, we've seen families waiting anxiously to find out whether or not their loved ones would be listed in the 39 released on Saturday.
 
We've managed to catch up with the Tamimi family who are waiting to find out whether or not 17-year-old Wissam would be released. And of course, we have now seen that otter relief to find out their son has now been released after being held under administrative detention.

WISSAM TAMIMI, RELEASED PALESTINIAN PRISONER (through translator): It's an indescribable feeling. We thank God he brought us out of the place we were in. It's a relief, praise be to God.
 
HUNAIDA TAMIMI, WISAM'S MOTHER (through translator): I can't describe how I feel. I seriously can't believe that. I'm in a dream. My son is with me. Praise, be to God and God willing, every mother will find my joy, God willing. I can't say anymore. May, God spread joy to all the Palestinian people. May, God grant them happiness. That is if we want to smile and laugh, thank God.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR: Now, over the course of this four-day truce, we are expecting to see a total of 150 prisoners and detainees at least released as part of that exchange agreement between Israel and Hamas. And there are many families still hopeful that they will see their loved ones released as part of this agreement.
 
But we've been speaking to many families, many locals here who said that while they are happy and have welcomed the release of their loved ones have many of their friends and neighbors, their happiness is subdued. They tell us that they have paid a heavy price for the release of these detainees and prisoners referencing the war in Gaza and the mounting civilian death toll that we have seen in the Gaza Strip.
 
But of course, this is a very delicate, very fluid situation. And it remains to be seen whether or not the terms of that truce are upheld over the next few days whether we will continue to see these Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. And of course, whether we continue to see the safe return of Israeli hostages currently held captive by Hamas in Gaza, Nada Bashir, CNN Al-Birah, near Ramallah.

Dozens of demonstrators gathered in Columbus Circle in New York chanting slogans and waving Palestinian flags. Tens of thousands also descended in London calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. They peacefully marched toward the House of Parliament. And the scenes were similar in Germany where hundreds of protesters gathered in Frankfurt. 
 
Meanwhile, tens of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv. They held up signs and chanted calling for those still being held captive to be brought home. One woman says her son, Omar Wenkert, was kidnapped at the Nova Music Festival. She says it's important to keep pushing. Here she is.
