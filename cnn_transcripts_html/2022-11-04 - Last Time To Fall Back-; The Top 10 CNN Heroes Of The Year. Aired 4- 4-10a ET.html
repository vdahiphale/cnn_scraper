COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday`s rock. I`m Coy. This is CNN 10.
 
And we`ve got an awesome show for you today. Let`s finish this week strong.
 
I have some good news to start your weekend. Many of you get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday, Daylight Saving Time. But could this be the last year 
 
 of it? Every year on the first Sunday of November at 2:00 a.m., many of us turn our clocks back an hour. On the second Sunday in March, they spring 
 
 back forward an hour.
 
But where did this idea of shifting time come from and why is it so polarizing?
 
Let`s take 10 to break it all down.
 
While Benjamin Franklin gets credit for the first mention of the idea, Daylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. with the Standard 
 
 Time Act of 1918. A wartime measure with the purpose of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources
 
Currently, not all states participate in daylight saving, including most of Arizona and Hawaii. Over 70 countries around the world use daylight saving 
 
 time with notable exceptions of China and Japan.
 
But earlier this year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent year round, 
 
 beginning in the fall of 2023. That bill is currently sitting in the House of Representatives. If passed there and then signed by the president, it 
 
 would mean no more changing clocks in the U.S.
 
There are, of course, arguments for and against the practice. We`ll travel to the United Kingdom now to meet a small group of clockmakers who have a 
 
 big job of making sure everything is working on time, especially when it comes to the time change.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX JEFFREY, CLOCKMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINSTER:  I love talking about clocks. I could talk about clocks all day. Not everyone wants to hear about 
 
 them, but everyone wants to hear about the clocks at the Palace of Westminster. Whether it`s Big Ben, whether it`s just being interested in 
 
 such a busy building, working on clocks, doing the time change, maintaining, it`s something I take a lot of pride in.
 
REPORTER:  Ian Westworth and Alex Jeffrey are part of a small team of clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster in London. Twice a year, when the 
 
 clocks spring forward or fall back across the United Kingdom, they have the responsibility of adjusting 2,000 timepieces before lawmakers return to 
 
 work.
 
JEFFREY:  There`s two thousand clocks on the parliamentary estate. There`s 500 heritage clocks, there`s two days and it`s our task to perform the GMT 
 
 time change.
 
IAN WESTWORTH, CLOCMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINISTER:  And overnight, we changed Big Ben. The great clock of Westminster and we put that back an 
 
 hour just to make sure everybody who can now see the dials can actually tell at the right time when they wake up on Sunday morning.
 
JEFFREY:  So, this is one of our heritage clocks. There`s around four or five hundred of them, and they`re just going to bring the minute hand back 
 
 to do the time change being careful not to graze the dial, and it`s -- in one of the committee rooms along committee corridor where a lot of 
 
 important meetings happen.
 
WESTWORTH:  We have clocks here that pre-date this palace and some that were designed specifically for this palace.
 
We do actually come across clocks that we`ve never found before. It only happened the other week. An MP contacted us saying, I`ve got a clock in my 
 
 office, it hasn`t run for some time. And I`m thinking, I`ve been here 18 years and I`ve never been into your office. He said that`s probably why it 
 
 hasn`t worked.
 
JEFFREY:  The time changes were put in initially as a mechanism, a practical mechanism to take advantage of daylight hours in the summer. So, 
 
 it`s important I think to keep that tradition.
 
REPORTER:  In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill championed the concept of daylight saving during the First World War before he became prime 
 
 minister, believing that the country could save energy by stretching the hours of evening sunlight. The practice has spread across the world.
 
In the U.S. most states observe daylight saving moving clocks forward in the spring. Only Hawaii and most of Arizona don`t. In 2022, the Senate 
 
 passed the Sunshine Protection Act, a law which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States from November 5th, 2023. If passed 
 
 by the House, the clocks would not fall back again.
 
In the U.K., a 2019 poll showed that a small majority of Britons want to keep changing the clocks. At the Palace of Westminster, its resident 
 
 clockmakers are responsible for maintaining this tradition.
 
WESTWORTH:  Even with this digital world, you know, everybody`s got a computer with a clock at the bottom or they`ve got a digital watch on. But 
 
 the MPS and the lords or the staff, who`ve actually got a ticking clock in their office. One of the first things they look at is the ticking clock and 
 
 not the one on the wrist. Our job is to make sure that every day, these clocks are working for them. The last clock of the day before doing great 
 
 clock tonight.
 
JEFFREY:  You know, there`s a lot of ground to cover. I left my step count on last year and it was 55,000 steps. It`s very time consuming but it`s 
 
 very rewarding. You know, we can say to each other, well done, guys. It`s a job well done and when people turn up for work on Monday, they`re right on 
 
 time.

 upcycling old computers to open new worlds for young people in our home country of Kenya. We met a teacher in New Jersey on a mission to hand out 
 
 free books by the thousands. This week, CNN announced the top heroes of the year. Let`s meet them and hear how they are making this world a better 
 
 place.

American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe are features that combine to make what natural wonder?
 
Great Barrier Reef, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, or Galapagos Islands.

Niagara Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world, on the New York and Canadian border, draws visitors from every corner of the planet who come to 
 
 see its majestic cascading water. Well, there`s a tunnel buried deep beneath the falls. It`s been off limits until now. It`s about seven 
 
 football fields long it was built more than a century ago on the Canadian side as part of the former Niagara Parks Power Station. And visitors can 
 
 now venture through the plant down the corridor and onto a waterside platform for some of the most breathtaking views in the world.
