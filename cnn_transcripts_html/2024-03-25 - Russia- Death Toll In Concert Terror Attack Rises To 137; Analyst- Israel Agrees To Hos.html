MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company.
 
Coming up here on CNN Newsroom, four men appear in court to face charges in the deadly terror attack on a Russian concert hall.
 
With gang violence raging in Haiti's capitol, we'll look at the dangerous journey. Some Americans, they're taking to get back to the U.S.
 
And we'll look at the environmental impact of electronic waste with old phones computers and other gadgets piling up in record amounts and much faster than they can be recycled.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with Michael Holmes.
 
HOLMES: Welcome everyone. The four man accused of killing more than 130 people at a concert hall outside of Moscow have gone before a judge. Each had a number of visible injuries. One was in a wheelchair and appeared non responsive. Three of the men entered plea, guilty pleas all are being held in pretrial detention.
 
They're accused of committing a terrorist act and could be sentenced to life in prison. Investigators say the man from Tajikistan and have been in Russia on either temporary or expired visas. Sunday was a day of mourning across Russia, a group of students are setting up a candlelight tribute to the victims of the attack. The death toll now stands at 137. More than 100 others are injured.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin also lighting a candle to remember those killed. He was at the church at his presidential residence. CNN chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance was at Sunday's makeshift memorial at the site of the attack and has more now on how Russians are reacting.
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you join me outside the Crocus City Hall near Moscow where on Friday night gunman killed at least 130 people inside that prominent concert hall. You can see thousands of people have now turned out from around Russia to pay their respects, to lay flowers, cuddly toys as well as respect for the children who are affected. It really is a major event that has affected this country. And it has fed feelings of instability amongst ordinary people.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEKSANDRA RUDENKO, MOURNER: I feel terrible about all the violence that exists in our world.
 
CHANCE: Yes, in our world, and in Russia as well. Do you feel safe in Russia, do you think?
 
RUDENKO: Yes, I think so.
 
CHANCE: OK.
 
RUDENKO: Not today because of this --
 
CHANCE: Attack.
 
RUDENKO: -- attack can be in every country. And I think that it is a problem of all world.
 
CHANCE: Do you feel safe in Russia now? You still feel safe? Or is the so many things happening, you feel a bit more insecure?
 
MAXIM TKACHEV, MOURNER: You know, I don't know how to answer that question properly. But I all I can say is that terrorist attacks there will -- they're a worldwide problem. So this topic, well, it's not safe to feel when there are terrorists in the whole world, so I should say, well, yes, this is --
 
CHANCE: This is part of a broader, broader problems.
 
TKACHEV: Yes, yes, yes.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHANCE: You can see orthodox priests have come out to deliver prayers at this memorial as well. This as investigators inside the burned out rubble of the concert hall are still going through the debris and are still saying that they're finding bodies and so the death toll could rise. In terms of the investigations, well, the authorities say at least 11 people have been taken into custody, including the four suspects who they believe carried out the actual shootings inside the Crocus City Hall.
 
Of course, ISIS said they carried out this attack. But the Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is vowing revenge, calling it a barbaric act, has said that it could be linked with Ukraine, something Ukrainian government has categorically denied.
 
Matthew Chance, CNN at the Crocus City Hall near Moscow.
 
HOLMES: Tymofiy Mylovanov is president of Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine's former Minister of Economic Development Trade and Agriculture also Associate Professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He joins me now via Skype from Kyiv. It's good to see you again Tymofiy. Vladimir Putin has tried without evidence to link the attack to Ukraine. Has that tech -- tactic worked on any level, and how's it going down there in Ukraine?
 <br>[01:05:21]
 
TYMOFIY MYLOVANOV, PRESIDENT, KYIV SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS: Well, in Ukraine, there is very clear, very open denial, official statements denying any involvement or relationship to the attack. It's, of course, very critical for us to demonstrate openly, to provide any evidence and to make it very clear that this is not in any way related to Ukraine. Of course, I'm afraid President Putin might not have a choice but to blame, or try to blame Ukraine in some way, regardless of the evidence.
 
Because otherwise, he appears to be weak, he needs to respond to ISIS, or to whoever was behind the attack. But he doesn't have the capacity because he's back down in Ukraine.
 
HOLMES: I added. And to that point, I'll just quote back to you a tweet that you posted. And I'll read it out. Quote, it might be the beginning of the end for Putin, once people and his thugs understand that he is weak, he will lose power. Because his power is based on strength and his ability to deliver security to the Russian people. It is a trade of secondary and human rights for security. And to that point, given how he portrays himself as the one, the only one who can provide security for the Russian people, how does this attack potentially hurt him?
 
MYLOVANOV: Well, it depends on how it is going to play out. But of course, the social contract after Yeltsin when Putin came to power was that he's going to solve the security issue in Russia, including the Chechen war. And in response, of course, there'll be some sacrifice of human rights. So I think Russian peoples have delivered on their part, it's not the democracy anymore. And there is terror and suppression of any dissent and opposition figures being killed and murdered, while you know if Putin appears to be unable to deliver security, especially in Moscow. That is going to start people wondering, especially some people around him, but also people in Moscow, because often Russia doesn't really care about what happens outside of several cities.
 
HOLMES: Yes. How else do you think he might leverage the attack? I mean, do you think some do that he's looking for an excuse to justify a full mobilization to bolster forces in Ukraine, given the massive troop losses Russia has suffered?
 
MYLOVANOV: Yes, absolutely. There is a fear. There's a concern here in Ukraine and elsewhere, that Russia will justify this event, or use this event to justify a full scale mobilization, and some kinds of major atrocities or continuation of the war or even escalation in Ukraine. But of course, mobilization itself for Russia presents a problem regardless of the terror attack in Moscow. That's going to be difficult even in the current circumstances.
 
Plus, as we have seen, the four people who have been brought to court after torturing or not, one of them non responsive, but the other three clearly are not related to Ukraine. They are not from Ukraine, they are from Tajikistan. And there is a history of terrorist attacks over the last 30 -- 20, 30 years in Russia, from people unrelated to actually to Ukraine.
 
HOLMES: While I've got you I wanted to ask you to in a war related question when it comes to the war itself, what do you -- what do Ukrainians make of Republicans in the U.S. holding up that aid package for Ukraine, aid Ukraine so desperately needs? I mean, what are your fellow Ukrainians saying about that delay and the opposition by some Republicans, including Trump, for any aid to the Senate?
 
We, you know, we see people in Ukraine die daily. We see regular daily attacks, bombings by Russia. We see progress they're making on the battlefield. So the war is nowhere in a stalemate, in fact, where, you know, we're losing some of the territory and soldiers. So that's painful. Of course, we understand that no one owes us $1. No taxpayer in the country owe us -- in any country owe us anything.
 
But on the level of humanity and especially given the commitment and given the situation security for us and for Europe, and really, really the death of people that could have been avoided, it's extremely emotional personal and painful. So now why is the U.S. in such a situation? Well, it's politics, you know, it's the election. And it's very unfortunate that we have become a victim of this.
 <br>[01:10:19]
 
HOLMES: Yes, yes, indeed. I wish we had more time, but we don't. Tymofiy Mylovanov, always good to see you. Thanks so much.
 
U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan is expected to meet Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant at the White House on Monday. And official says they will discuss the urgent need for more humanitarian aid to reach desperate civilians in Gaza and efforts to get the remaining hostages held in the enclave released.
 
Meantime, CNN analysts Barak Ravid has said that Israel has agreed to a proposal from the U.S. that would release around 700 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of 40 Israeli hostages. But he says a response from Hamas could take a few days. CNN's Paula Hancocks in Doha with the details.
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We have seen a concerted diplomatic push from the United States over the last few days trying to push these indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel forward. Now we've heard from our CNN affiliate, Channel 11, citing a senior Israeli government official, that Israel has agreed to a U.S. proposal that would see some 700 Palestinian prisoners released as part of this deal. One hundred of them we understand would be those serving life sentences for having killed Israeli nationals.
 
Now in return, there would be 40 Israeli hostages, that would be released. Now this is Israel agreeing to a U.S. proposal, we obviously have to wait to see what Hamas thinks of this particular deal. We know that there are technical teams here in Doha, still based here and trying to work out the details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL AND GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: What happens now is that Israel is -- Israel and the U.S. and the Qatari and Egyptian mediators are waiting to get the response from Hamas. And what I hear from Israeli officials that this could take between, I don't know, a day to three days because those details need to go from Hamas representatives in Doha who are negotiating to the person who really calls the shots and this is Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza who is in a bunker some 100 feet under the ground.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HANCOCKS: Now we know that Hamas just 10 days ago had proposed that there was between 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released as part of this deal. And in recent weeks, if not months, there have been quite significant gaps between the two sides, not only when it comes to the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released, but also which prisoners would be released. Meanwhile, we have heard from the chief of UNRWA. This is Philippe Lazzarini saying in a tweet that Israel has informed the U.N. group, the main U.N. body within Gaza that they would no longer be able to facilitate their aid distributions in northern Gaza.
 
Now Lazzarini has called this outrageous at a time when a U.N. backed reporters just said that there could be famine in northern Gaza between now and mid-May. Now Israel has accused two of these 12 members of UNRWA of being part of the October 7th attacks. Now those 12 have been released from their duties. We know that there was an independent investigation that's ongoing within UNRWA. Lazzarini calling on countries not to stop funding at a crucial time, he says, when those in Gaza it's so desperately needed.
 
Paula Hancocks, CNN, Doha, Qatar.
 
HOLMES: A week after the Israel Defense Forces began an operation at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza. The Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli military has now surrounded two other hospitals in southern Gaza and that their quote, teams are in extreme danger, unable to move at all.
 
The IDF released this video saying that it's conducting what it called an operation in the Al-Amal neighborhood, but denies it is inside the Al-Amal and Nasser hospitals. Israel says it launched strikes on about 40 targets in the area, claiming it's continuing to dismantle, quote, terrorist infrastructure. CNN cannot independently verify these claims as Israel doesn't permit international media to operate inside Gaza.
 
Now in the coming hours, Donald Trump will have two major legal threats colliding in New York CNN, Zachary Cohen with the latest from Washington.
 
ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: If Donald Trump cannot secure a bond in his multimillion dollars civil fraud judgment against him by Monday's deadline, he could see the New York Attorney General start the process of seizing his assets. That's things like his bank account, things like his properties, all things that Donald Trump does not want to see prosecutors take away from him.
 <br>[01:15:16]
 
But look, Trump personally owes over $450 million as a result of this judgment. He has indicated and claimed that he has enough cash to pay that, to support a bond in that case. His lawyers have corrected him saying no, he does not have that amount of cash on hand. But ultimately, if he cannot put up the money to post bond by Monday's deadline, that is when you could see the Attorney General start to eye other things to make up for that cost.
 
And look, experts say that prosecutors have already taken some steps to potentially signal that they are going to move, to seize some of Trump's assets and properties in New York should he be unable to post that bond on Monday. Those are things like one of his golf courses in New York and another private estate that he has there.
 
And at the same time Donald Trump is also expected in court as proceedings continue as part of his New York criminal case. Now this case deals with the hush money payments that were allegedly made to porn star Stormy Daniels. These were these are payments allegedly made to cover up an affair between Daniels and Trump prior to the 2016 election.
 
This trial -- this case was supposed to go to trial. The trial was supposed to start on Monday, but instead we're going to have another pre-trial hearing. This is where Trump's attorneys will try to postpone a trial for as long as possible. They will argue that discovery issues require further delay. The District Attorney's Office in New York has argued that no further delay is needed.
 
So ultimately, we're going to have to see if judge in this case could give more insight and more detail about a possible trial start date. It's already been delayed through at least mid-April. But it's possible to judge sides with the DA's office and gives us a trial date in New York before the 2024 election.

HOLMES: France and the U.S. ramping up evacuation efforts from Haiti as the Caribbean nation continues its chaotic descent into gang violence and political instability.
 
And thousands gathered in Argentina to remember the victims of a former military dictatorship which took over decades ago. Our report from Buenos Aires when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLMES: France is organizing flights for vulnerable nationals who want to leave Haiti, the country said that on Sunday. It comes as the U.S. State Department has evacuated more than 230 people looking to escape the spike in gang violence in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince. Evacuations of U.S. citizens are also happening through state coordinated efforts with Florida's government saying another 21 Americans flew out of Haiti and arrived in Orlando late Saturday. CNN's David Culver is on the ground in Haiti with more on the difficulties in trying to get Americans out safely and back on U.S. soil.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[01:20:07]
 
DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: The challenge for U.S. citizens trying to leave Port-au-Prince begins as soon as they start driving at the U.S. Embassy. Getting there involves driving through either gang controlled or gang contested territories. It's dangerous and it's unpredictable. In armored vehicles, we saw that firsthand. And yet this is the only way out for some. The airport is shut down, and many feel trapped.
 
In recent days, the U.S. Embassy began evacuating citizens who could make it to the embassy. Managing the safety of those evacuations is Regional Security Officer Steve Strickland.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CULVER: How does Haiti, how does Port-au-Prince today compared to, you know, past 19 years?
 
STEVE STRICKLAND, U.S. DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE, SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: There's nothing like Port-au-Prince, the security situations here are nothing like anything I've experienced before. I've spent time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, in Africa, and the unique circumstances here. I have not seen a parallel to those in any other security environment that I've served.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CULVER: Amid these challenges, there are some who fear Americans are being abandoned in this gang filled war zone.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
STRICKLAND: The truth of the matter is literally on a daily basis, there are phone calls that were engaged with at the highest levels of U.S. government, where the number one topic is safety and security. How do we help get our U.S. citizens out of the country to a safe place.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CULVER: Launching these evacuation flights from the Capitol is a critical first step. Jenny Guillaume (ph) and her five-year-old son, Conrad (ph), registered a few days ago. She's had to leave behind her mom and other loved ones so as to get back to their home in New York.
 
Getting into the embassy is terrifying. It's a potentially deadly commute. Some who had confirmed their spots canceled last minute, either emotionally unable to leave behind loved ones, or just unable to get to the embassy safely.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CULVER: So is there an option to go from here and go pick them up? Is that even a reality?
 
STRICKLAND: It just really isn't. Unfortunately, the security resources that we have are stretched so thin. The ability to do that is, it's really a non-starter. We just don't have that capacity to do it. We'd love to do it. It's just simply an impossibility, unfortunately.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CULVER: With some seeds unclaimed at the last minute, our team as U.S. citizens is able to travel out with them and Chronicle their journey. We board in gang controlled territory on a patch of land that's secured and surrounded by a robust and reassuring American military presence. We take off for the Dominican Republic.
 
There are a lot of mixed emotions for those who get out, gratitude and relief for getting here safely, as well as guilt and fear for those still in Port-au-Prince. Knowing that what's happening on the other side of this border is getting worse with each passing hour.
 
David Culver, CNN, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
 
HOLMES: Officials in Nigeria say at least 137 school children kidnapped from Kaduna earlier this month have been rescued. The students were reportedly rescued by the military early on Sunday morning. But it's not clear if there are still some missing students since nearly 300 were being held captive. Here's what the father of a nine-year-old girl and community spokesperson said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIBRIL GWADABE-KURIGA, KURIGA COMMUNITY SPOKESPERSON: When we had our children about happy people are happy, you know, jubilating we're only waiting to see the -- to see our children. But we believe that vaccines government cannot tell us lies. They have informed us, the children are now -- they are taking care of them so that, you know, they have to go under some treatment before they handed over to us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: The state's governor says he met with families that have children and confirmed how many were rescued. He says the students will be hosted and an official dinner on Monday.
 
Thousands gathered on the anniversary of Argentina's 1976 military coup to honor victims of that former dictatorship. Human Rights Organizations estimate about 30,000 people were kidnapped, tortured and killed during the military dictatorship nearly 50 years ago, journalist __ is in Buenos Aires with more.
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN JOURNALIST: The 24th of March is an occurrence that happens every year in Argentina and commemorates the victims of the right wing dictatorship that ruled this country between 1976 and 1983. But because of the presidency of Javier Milei, an extreme right wing self-professed a libertarian who won the election in December and is attempting to reform the state here in Argentina at breakneck speed so many more instances are protested today in Buenos Aires.
 <br>[01:24:59]
 
We spoke with people who say they're protesting economic conditions because Argentina has the highest inflation rates in the world and poverty is soaring. We spoke with women who are defending their reproductive rights because they say they're being targeted by these right wing government. And we spoke with people who say that their presence here on the streets, sends a message in defense of democracy and human rights worldwide.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is happening in the world at a global level, yes. I don't think this is an exception. I don't even think this is an idea that only Argentinians have come up with. I think it's articulated with other countries and other regions. It's important -- it's a worldwide fight for democracy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POZZEBON: This year, all around the world were seeing so many of these issues are colliding at the ballots. Argentina already held it's key election at the end of last year that many of the people around me are saying that they're already disillusioned with the winner of that election.
 
For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Buenos Aires.
 
HOLMES: Ireland is once again poised to get its youngest ever prime minister. The ruling Fine Gael Party has named Higher Education Minister Simon Harris as its new leader, the 37-year-old Harris would succeed Leo Varadkar, who surprisingly resigned last week citing personal and political reasons. Varadkar had also been Ireland's youngest ever Taoiseach when he was elected in 2017 at age 38. He guided the country through some difficult times, including Brexit and the COVID pandemic. In his acceptance speech on Sunday, Harris pledged to quote, hard work, blood, sweat and tears as the next prime minister.
 
When we come back on the program, top Israeli and U.S. officials will be meeting in Washington this week to discuss hostage and ceasefire negotiations amid the ongoing war in Gaza.
 
Plus, seeking safety in Ukraine as Russia caps off a week of nonstop aerial attacks, that story and much more after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: You're watching CNN Newsroom with me, Michael Holmes.
 
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is expected to meet the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant at the White House in coming hours. And officials says they will discuss the urgent need for more humanitarian aid to reach desperate civilians in Gaza as well as efforts to get the remaining hostages held in the enclave released. CNN's Kevin Liptak with details.
 <br>[01:30:06]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: This week is shaping up to be a critical one, not just in terms of the trajectory of the war in Gaza, but also as a major test of American influence on the Israelis as this conflict proceeds. 
 
And what you'll see this week is two very senior-level delegations coming from Israel to Washington to meet with top Biden administration officials. The defense secretary from Israel left Sunday and plans to meet Monday with senior members of President Biden's team, including the national security adviser Jake Sullivan; also the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 
 
Those discussions are expected to center around Israel's weapons needs as it continues to go after Hamas in Gaza. 
 
And then later in this week, You'll see a separate delegation led by Ron Dermer, a top confidant to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss the situation in Rafah. That's the southern city in Gaza that Israel says is necessary to invade -- to launch a ground invasion to go after Hamas. 
 
And that has certainly caused a lot of consternation here at the White House, certainly a lot of concerns about the 1.4 million Palestinian civilians who are sheltering there. 
 
What President Biden and his top officials have said is that Israel should not proceed with that ground invasion before they come up with a credible plan to protect those civilians. And the White House says it hasn't seen such a plan yet.
 
And you'll remember last week, President Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu and told him to dispatch this delegation here to hear American alternatives to a ground invasion. 
 
Now since then, Netanyahu has really doubled down on those plans and said that in fact, it is necessary for the IDF to go into Rafah on the ground to root out Hamas. 
 
And certainly that has caused a great deal of concern among President Biden's team, including the Vice President Kamala Harris, who spoke about the situation in Rafah in an interview this weekend. Listen to what she said. 
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake. 
 
Let me tell you something. I have studied the maps. There's nowhere for those folks to go. And were looking at about a million and a half people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there, most of them. And so we've been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Rafah with any type of military operation. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you ruling out that there would be consequences from the United States? 
 
HARRIS: I am ruling out nothing. 
 
LIPTAK: So you hear her there not ruling out consequences for Israel should it go into Rafah and certainly American officials have discussed what their response would be. It's not exactly clear what the parameters of that would look like. 
 
But certainly President Biden has come under increasing pressure from Democratic lawmakers to start conditioning aid to Israel based on its steps on the humanitarian front. 
 
You also hear calls for President Biden to increase diplomatic pressure on Israel. So whether or not those consequences, that response comes up in the meetings this week certainly remains to be seen. But it is clear we are entering quite a critical stretch of days as this conflict proceeds.

HOLMES: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing political challenges back home. Top Israeli officials say they will not support a proposed ultra-orthodox conscription reform that includes the Israeli defense minister and Benny Gantz, one of three members of Israel's war cabinet, who threatened to quit the coalition if the proposed military draft becomes law.

BENNY GANTZ, BLUE AND WHITE PARTY (through translator): The nation cannot accept it.

HOLMES: Ukraine's president says Russia has been bombarding the country with massive aerial attacks. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in the past week alone, Moscow has launched nearly 200 missiles, nearly 140 Iranian drones, and close to 700 guided aerial bombs. 
 
Sunday saw another huge assault.
 
You hear there the air raid sirens sounding in Kyiv. Residents hunkering down in subway systems. Ukrainian officials say the capital suffered only in the minor damage fortunately, but Kyiv was just one of the targets.
 
Russian missile struck critical infrastructure in the Lviv region as well. One missile even passing through Polish airspace. 
 
Poland activating F-16s and demanding answers from Moscow.

WLADYSLAW KOSINIAK-KAMYSZ, POLISH MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE: If there was any premise indicating that this object was going in the direction of any targets located in Poland, of course, it would have been shot down and more adequate measures would have been taken.

HOLMES: Meanwhile, Ukraine says it launched successful strikes on Russia's Black Sea fleet. They say they hit two Russian naval vessels, communications center, and several other facilities in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol. 
 
Meanwhile, Ukrainian aid has become a bargaining chip for U.S. Democrats after Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust her fellow Republican Mike Johnson from his role as House Speaker. Some democrats say they may be willing to come to his rescue if he helps pass additional assistance for Kyiv.
 
CNN's Manu Raju has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: House Democrats are considering saving Mike Johnson from a threat from his speakership after Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she would try to make Mike Johnson the second speaker ever to be ousted by his own colleagues. 
 
The first speaker happened last fall when Kevin McCarthy was booted in the aftermath of a right-wing revolt. That was a little bit different that time. Democrats all voted to oust him along with eight Republicans. Kevin McCarthy was pushed out of the speakership. There were 22 days of chaos. Johnson came in. 
 
Now he's facing a similar threat after he agreed with Democrats on a bill to keep the government open through September. Now, the question will be, how Democrats handle this? Because many of
 
 them are indicating that they are willing to save him. 
 
Why? Because of Ukraine aid being stalled in the House made them say, if Johnson were to outline a path to getting Ukraine aid approved then that would change their calculus and perhaps they would vote to save him.
 
REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): If he does the responsible thing which is allowing members of Congress to vote on a bill that will pass and that is in our national security interests. And then subsequent to that a nonserious actor who doesn't want to govern brings a motion to vacate, yes, I would motion to table in that circumstance. 
 
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD); I will make common cause with anybody who will stand up for the people of Ukraine, anybody who will get desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza and anybody who will work for a two-state solution. 
 
RAJU: Now the timing of this is all a bit unclear because Marjorie Taylor Greene can essentially call up that vote whenever the House that she's recognized on the house floor. 
 
Now the house is in recess for the next two weeks. She told me that she is not certain about her timing yet, but when she comes back, she could -- that could change. She could move to the floor, start the process, which would be two days before they would actually cast that critical vote. 
 
The first vote is expected to be a motion to table or kill this resolution on a procedural matter, procedural grounds. That is one the Democrats are considering doing, essentially voting to kill the resolution from going forward. But their demands are pretty clear. Move on Ukraine aid and if there's a path that they believe Ukraine aid could become law, perhaps Johnson can stay in the job.

CNN's Christopher Lamb with details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Pope Francis decided to skip his homily during the Palm Sunday mass at the Vatican. In an unusual move, the Pope decided not to give his reflection that he would be expected to deliver during this important mass at the Vatican, which marks the beginning of Holy Week, the most sacred week in the Church's calendar. However, Francis, who is 87 years old has been suffering from various
 
 bouts of ill health over the winter months. He's had bronchitis, cold, and flu, and in recent weeks he's been asking aides to read his speeches because he's been feeling too unwell to do so. 
 <br>[01:39:48]
 
LAMB: Although the Pope did not read his homily, he did, however, give the Angelus prayer at the end of the mass. Beforehand, he condemned the Moscow terrorist attack as vile and assured his prayers and closeness to the victims. 
 
POPE FRANCIS, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): I assure my prayers for the victims of the vile terrorist attack carried out in Moscow. 
 
May the Lord receive them in his peace, comfort their families, and convert the hearts of those who planned, organized, and carried out these inhumane actions that offend God who commanded that you shall not kill. 
 
LAMB: He then greeted cardinals individually and went on to the Pope mobile, where he circled St. Peter's Square and greeted the crowd.

HOLMES: Coming up on the program how obsolete cell phones and outdated computers are causing major environmental problems around the world. There is hope for the future though if we change some things. That's after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Now most of us can't imagine our lives without electronic devices. And not just screens we rely of course, on larger items like refrigerators, air conditioners, and so on. 
 
Well, according to a new joint report from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and the International Telecommunication Union the world is now producing a record amount of electronic waste or e-waste and its putting our lives at risk. 
 
Kim Brunhuber has that.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: These men in Ghana are rummaging through discarded electronics. Using screwdrivers and pliers, they break down computers and cell phones for any parts they can salvage. But this is just one electronic wasteland.
 
An alarming new U.N. report says that since 2010, the amount of global e-waste has grown five times faster than it can be collected and recycled. According to the study, a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste was
 
 produced in 2022. That's an increase of 82 percent from 2010. And the world is on track to generate a whopping 82 million tons of e-waste in 2030. One U.N. researcher says that we're losing the battle against e- waste and the wealthy are mostly to blame.
 
KEES BALDE, SR. SCIENTIFIC U.N. INSTITUTE FOR TRAINING AND RESEARCH: Well, the richer you are, the more you consume, and the more you consume the more products you are buying on the batteries and the (INAUDIBLE), and the more e-waste you are generating. 
 
BRUNHUBER: What's more, e-waste recycling only produces 1 percent of the rare earth elements needed to meet the current demand which leaves the world highly-dependent on just a few countries where rare earths are mined including countries in Africa. 
 <br>[01:44:47]
 
BRUNHUBER: The continent generates the lowest amount of e-waste but recycling rates there are below 1 percent. A high-level official with the International Telecommunication Union says it's up to the manufacturers to make a difference by giving devices a longer life cycle. 
 
COSMAS LUCKSON ZAVAZAVA, DIRECTOR, ITU TELECOMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT BUREAU: They too will be benefitting if they take measures to make sure that there's responsible manufacturing, there is a responsible consumerism. 
 
BRUNHUBER: While some countries have implemented environmental regulations to tackle the problem some are working on a more grassroots level. Places like the fixing factory in London are teaching consumers to make more sustainable choices. 
 
DERMOT JONES, PROJECT MANAGER, CAMDEN FIXING FACTORY: We buy these things. And the first time they fail, we don't get them fixed and were trying to change that mindset so when it fails, just think that's just a part of its life cycle. 
 
It's not the end of it. How can we get that going? How can we get it going a few more years. 
 
BRUNHUBER: But such efforts won't do enough to address the rapidly growing mountains of e-waste, especially as society grows more dependent on tech devices which are linked to the Internet.
 
Despite the dire forecast, the report says there's still time to introduce infrastructure to process e-waste more efficiently, driving up demand for recycled materials and increasing recycling rates overall.
 
Kim Brunhuber, CNN.

HOLMES: Now Kees Balde, the lead author of that study, joins me from Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Thanks for being up early for us.
 
One thing that struck me in the report is that global electronic waste has not only reached record highs, its growing five times faster than rates of recycling what's the impact of that? What can we do? 
 
BALDE: Well, this type of waste is very hazardous, and mismanaged waste releases (INAUDIBLE) chemicals to THE environments and contributes to global warming too. 
 
HOLMES: I think for a lot of people, myself included, it's not easy to recycle electronics properly in your day-to-day life, there's not easily accessible facilities or processes. What, what should we do when we've got an item which we'd like to recycle.
 
BALDE: Well, you should always separate it from the other types of waste at the collection point, which is designated to collect electronic waste. And then it should be treated at specialized recycling facilities afterwards. 
 
HOLMES: As we just heard in that report, so often electronic waste is sent to Third World are low-income countries then recycled, if at all, there often without oversight or health considerations. What -- what risks are those workers taking when this material is sent out like that? 
 
BALDE: Well, these (INAUDIBLE) these workers are looking for available -- for available components in the toxic waste stream. And so while its doing this they inhale, you know, toxic fumes and also toxins may penetrate through the skin by handling this hazardous type of waste. And they will, it will cause -- there are dangers to the DNA and cancer. It's not good for them. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, absolutely. 
 
I'm curious, what responsibility do manufacturers have not only to perhaps recycle what they made, but also to make things last longer. There's so much, you know, planned obsolescence with many products these days designed to stop working after a while. So we go buy a new one. 
 
How big of a factor is that? And what responsibility do manufacturers have? 
 
BALDE: All products should be designed to be repairable, recyclable, and nontoxic. And in addition, the manufacturers should also proactively facilitates the collection and the management of electronic waste in (INAUDIBLE).
 
HOLMES: I was going to ask too because it occurred me that, you know, in a climate sense, so many electronics require raw materials, rare earths, and so on that are extracted and processed in a highly energy- intensive way, many powered by fossil fuels. So that adds to the climate change, right? And the more we recycle, the less we have to mine those things. 
 
BALDE: Definitely, yes. I can't say more than this and this will also -- well the more that we recycle, the less we have to mine. 
 
And this prevents the emissions of greenhouse gases and also preserves the biodiversity.
 
HOLMES: I did want to ask you this too, I was reading, I think it was in the report. Only 81 countries had e-waste policies in 2023 and policies don't always equate to action. 
 
The U.S. is one of the largest producers of e-waste, has no federal law mandating the recycle od electronics. What needs to happen in a legislative sense on a global level? 
 <br>[01:49:54]
 
BALDE: Well, first of all any country should develop specific legislation to manage this type of waste. And if you haven't enforced, you also should make sure it's being enforced so that actually action is going to take place in those countries. 
 
HOLMES: All right. Great to get you on. Thanks for getting up so early. Kees Balde there. Appreciate it. Thank you.
 
BALDE: Thank you. 
 
HOLMES: Well, there is a gambling investigation involving a longtime interpreter for one of the world's biggest baseball stars. Coming up next, how the L.A. Dodgers Shohei Ohtani is planning to respond to the controversy. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HOLMES: Baseball star Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter is being investigated for gambling, in case you hadn't heard. Ohtani's lawyers accusing him of stealing millions of dollars from the star. 
 
Well now the Japanese player who signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the offseason for a lot of money is planning to speak to the media.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's the day a lot of Dodger fans were waiting for, watching Shohei Ohtani play here at home. But it comes with so much controversy. We're talking theft, millions of dollars, lies, gambling and now an IRS and an MLB investigation.
 
Let's sort of recap where we are right now.
 
Shohei Ohtani's longtime interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired after Ohtani's lawyers accused him of massive thefts, millions of dollars, and placing bets with a bookmaker that's currently under a federal investigation. That's according to ESPN and the "L.A. Times," who first reported on this. And CNN did speak to a spokesperson with the IRS that confirmed that Ippei Mizuhara, and a man by the name of Mathew Bowyer (ph), are both being investigated by the IRS. 
 
We spoke to Boyer's attorney and here's what she said.
 
DIANE BASS, ATTORNEY: What we've learned during the course of the investigation is that Ohtani's name was on one of the wire transfers to Mr. Bowyer's organization to cover a bet. But, as far as Mr. Bowyer understood, the bet was from Ippei or it was being covered by Mr. Ohtani for Ippei.
 
BERNAL: And the problem that a lot of the fans and people following this controversy had is the changing statements from Ohtani and Mizuhara. Ohtani's reps first telling ESPN that he was aware of the gambling debt. Then later saying he had no knowledge of any of this.
 
And Mizuhara speaking to ESPN initially said that he asked Ohtani to pay his debt and that he had agreed to do so. But later walking everything back saying that he lied.
 
And that Ohtani had no knowledge of any of this so again a lot of questions and major implications when it comes to these investigations because of the fact that Ohtani is a worldwide baseball star and because of the fact that he did sign that massive $700 million, 10- year deal with the Dodgers. 
 
We are being told that Ohtani will likely speak to the media on Monday. That's according to a number of media outlets. So of course, a lot of people having questions for Ohtani about this entire situation.

HOLMES: Hundreds of waiters in Paris served up their A-game this weekend. They I took to the streets to show who could deliver the goods the fastest and with the best balance. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Waiting Tables in Paris isn't just a job, it's a profession. And a good server needs a lot of hustle to get through the day. 
 
But just who is the fastest waiter in town? Some 200 servers in Paris suited up to put their skills to the test.
 
CLAUDE ISAMBERT, WAITER (through translator): Black pants, black socks, well-polished shoes, and tie or bow tie with a jacket. That's traditional and Parisian.
 
HOLMES: Holding trays containing a typical French breakfast, the participants navigated a two-kilometer course through the Marais District. In the revival of Paris' classic cafe waiter race last held in 2011. The rules are simple, no running, that would just be gauche; and no spilling anything on the tray, which must be held in one hand. 
 
LOUANE MOREL, WAITRESS (through translator): I've been doing this job since I was 16. I don't necessarily expect to be the first because I don't necessarily have the best cardio. But I hope to at least arrive with the tray in good condition at the finish line. 
 
HOLMES: The race began in 1914 with servers balancing a bottle on a tray in the earlier days, but 13 years ago, organizers couldn't find any sponsors. So the race was put on the back-burner until the Paris city hall and Water Authority fired up the event again this year. 
 
ANNE-SOPHIE BLANCHET, SPECTATOR (through translator): I find it wonderful that were reviving this race, which highlights a very beautiful profession in which above all, is very difficult I think on a daily basis. 
 
So congratulations to them. And may the best win.
 
HOLMES: So while this might not look like a typical day at the cafe the men's and women's winners who completed the circuit in 13 minutes, 30 seconds; and 14 minutes, 12 seconds respectively say it's an expedited version of what they do every day. With a healthy serving of stamina, getting them across the finish line. Bon appetit. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: I'm sorry. he was running he was running. You're not meant to run. 
 
Thanks for spending part of your day with me. 
 
I'm Michael Holmes.
