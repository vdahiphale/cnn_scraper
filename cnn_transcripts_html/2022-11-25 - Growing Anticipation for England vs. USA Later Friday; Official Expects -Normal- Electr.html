 <br>[11:01:00]  
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello. And welcome back to what is a Special Edition of CONNECT WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson coming to you live all week 
 
 from Doha in Qatar where we are following yet another stunning upset in the World Cup.  
 
It's been a day of high emotions on the pitch here in Qatar with a thrilling win in the day's opener.  
 
Iran scoring two goals very, very late into stoppage time to defeat Wales two-nil. They had the best of the play. Iran's chances of advancing the 
 
 final 16 now revived with that win. The same cannot be said for host, Qatar, desperately needing to squeeze out at least a draw against Senegal, 
 
 but the African champion won three-one despite what was a spirited effort by the host.  
 
And there was history made here.  
 
First goal of the tournament which the crowd in the stadium and the fans here in Doha - in downtown Doha into a frenzy. The biggest game of the day 
 
 yet come, the United States facing off against England, World Sports Don Riddell is getting ready for that. He is outside the Al Bayt Stadium where 
 
 that match will kick off at 10 o'clock, local time. What can we expect? Phil us, sir.  
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  Yes. Hello, mate. I'm really, really looking forward to tonight's game. It kind of has the atmosphere here where 
 
 we can have a bit of a kick around ourselves before the game, if you want it to, Becky. But this was described pretty much as soon as the draw was 
 
 made as one of the most hyped or most anticipated games of the group stage.  
 
Of course, England and the U.S.A. they have a bit of history when it comes to the World Cup. Famously, the Americans beat the England back in 1950, 
 
 which was a national humiliation. They drew back in 2010 and the U.S. has made such great strides with their development of soccer, as they call it, 
 
 that this really could be quite a game and the English team certainly know a lot of the American players, a handful of them play in the Premier 
 
 League. They've improved a lot over the last few years.  
 
But some people are tipping England to go all the way in this tournament, especially the way they began with a six to drubbing of Iran. America 
 
 definitely need to get something out of this game after they were disappointed that Wales came back against them and snatched a draw the 
 
 other night.  
 
ANDERSON:  Iran getting a win today, two goals very, very late on in that game. They needed that. Just describe for our viewers what happened.  
 
RIDDELL:  I mean, this was just an extraordinary game from start to finish, Becky. And remember everything that the Iranian players are going through 
 
 back home, the stress that they are dealing, with the pressure that they are under, remember, they didn't sing the anthem in the England game. Some 
 
 of the players did seem to perhaps reluctantly sing the anthem on this occasion.  
 
It was a really highly charged atmosphere. The game was really all Iran's in the second half, certainly towards the end of the game and a decisive 
 
 moment came in the 86 minute when the Welsh goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, was sent off for coming miles out of his goal and making a pretty dangerous 
 
 challenge on Mehdi Taremi.  
 
So with the Welsh down to 10 men, Iran then scored two late goals. The first one being an absolute belter from Roozbeh Cheshmi and then Ramin 
 
 Rezaeian, putting the icing on the cake. A massive, massive win for Iran, an incredible result for them.  
 <br>[11:05:00]  
 
ANDERSON:  Absolutely. All right. Well, looking forward to the match tonight that is a roundup of the Group B. Of course, we have got the 
 
 Netherlands playing Ecuador as we speak and the local fans here in Qatar will be watching that one very, very closely.  
 
Thank you, sir.  
 
For a lot of Iranian football fans, today's win that we've just been discussing will be bittersweet a massive win on the pitch as we've been 
 
 suggesting, but overshadowed by recent events inside Iran. Some fans wanted to use this opportunity to express their solidarity with protesters back 
 
 home. One of them holding up a flag with the name of Mahsa Amini, the young woman whose death in police custody has set off weeks of deadly protests 
 
 and calls for change. This fan also wore makeup depicting tears of blood.  
 
We should also note the Iranian players sang their national anthem before today's match after not doing so in the World Cup opener. And Italy's 
 
 captain and goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon, had a message after the pitch for his counterparts on - in Iran saying, "You will be remembered for your 
 
 courage. This win is a sign of hope and strength for those in your country who are fighting for freedom. For many people you are heroes."  
 
Well, my next guest is Iranian American football fan, Camellia Senemar. She was at Iran-Welsh game earlier and says the match security, giving her a 
 
 hard time over a protest patch she was wearing in support of Iranian women. She joins us now. Tell me what happened.  
 
CAMELLIA SENEMAR, IRANIAN- AMERICAN FOOTBALL FAN:  Thank you for having me. It was clearly - I went to the first game for Iran and it was clearly a 
 
 much stricter security. And all I had was same similar top, a patch that said women, life, freedom on it in very small writing. And they gave us the 
 
 hardest time to even try to go through. They were going to bar us access from the stadium.  
 
We saw this happened to a handful of other people in line. My family, I was with my mother and father and brother. I hid mine in my pocket just before 
 
 I entered the security area and I was able to get it through. They gave my brother a very hard time. That's what I caught on video and it wasn't until 
 
 I caught the footage and I had my phone up, they backtracked and they said, okay, you can go.  
 
ANDERSON:  Did you have your patch?  
 
SENEMAR:  Yes.  
 
ANDERSON:  In the stadium.  
 
SENEMAR:  So as soon as we got through, got over to the seats, I put my patch back on and I had a hat as well that (inaudible) woman, life, 
 
 freedom.  
 
ANDERSON:  It's been interesting, hasn't it? Because FIFA says the football pitch in the stadium is not a place for political messaging. Why is it 
 
 important to you to put up a woman, life, liberty patch (inaudible) and we've seen some banners there during that day. Just explain.  
 
SENEMAR:  I think for me, it's a matter of basic rights for human rights. And I grew up in America, I was born there, but my parents immigrated from 
 
 Iran. They came to America and gave me the life that I have there and I'm so grateful for it. But it - I'm conflicted because I have such pride in 
 
 the Iranian culture, yet, the government is not representative of, of the people and we have a lot of family there.  
 
And for me, showing that and bringing awareness to it, visibility, and - helping fight for it, knowing that there are people on the streets dying 
 
 from the same fight is very important to me.  
 
ANDERSON:  The coach, Iran's coach, Carlos Queiroz, has pleaded with the media and others to let players focus on the game.  
 
SENEMAR:  Yes.  
 
ANDERSON:  We don't know why it was that the Iranian team actually sang the national anthem tonight. I'm not sure you want to tell me whether you did 
 
 or not.  
 
SENEMAR:  Yes.  
 
ANDERSON:  What do you say to the coach when you hear that? It's tough, isn't it?  
 
SENEMAR:  It's tough. It's a complicated situation, but we're hearing that I think if you watch the anthem when the players were singing, they were, 
 
 in fact, mumbling a bit. I don't think they did this by choice. Again, what we're hearing from a lot of people is that they were forced to do this by 
 
 the regime and I think, again, while I don't have a definitive source on that, I think it's true that the regime, every action they're taking, 
 
 whether it was through the security that was at the World Cup stadiums, it's intended to defy the people of Iran.  
 
And I think that you saw that in the first game where the fans were conflicted about whether or not to support the players. And that's showed 
 
 in the result and the players, I think, felt Just as conflicted and - today was different. I walked into the stadium and you could sense it around. No 
 
 one was willing to back down and people were unified and you could hear it in the stadium and the result was tremendous, so.  
 
ANDERSON:  It was a nerve-wracking result.  
 
SENEMAR:  Yes.  
 
ANDERSON:  I've run out of time with you. I mean, I can talk all right. What a result. I mean. I mean, and I know so many Iranians who are 
 
 conflicted about whether to actually support the team.  
 <br>[11:10:00]  
 
And those very same Iranians who I was with in 2018 in Russia who takes such pride in being Iranian and watching the team, so ...  
 
SENEMAR:  We got to support that. We got to support that.  
 
ANDERSON:  It's good to have you.  
 
SENEMAR:  Thank you so much.  
 
ANDERSON:  I hope you're enjoying the tournament. I know it's odd, but it's good to have you and thank you for joining us here on CNN tonight.  
 
SENEMAR:  Thank you so much.  
 
ANDERSON:  Well, there has been singing and sharing.  
 
And that, folks, is over a United Nations' decision to investigate Iran's deadly crackdown on protests. I'm going to be talking next to the president 
 
 of the U.S. Human Rights Council that came up with that resolution and what they hope it might achieve. That after this.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
 <br>[11:13:05]  
 
ANDERSON:  Let's get you up to speed on our top international stories this hour, a race to get power restored in Ukraine amid blackouts and freezing 
 
 temperatures there. A government advisor now says Kyiv should have normal electricity coverage Saturday.  
 
Meantime the Capitol has set up hundreds of power supply stations so that people can get warm and recharge their devices. And in some cases, devices 
 
 are vital. This photo reportedly shows a child went to a Kyiv gas station to get an oxygen mask working. The international nuclear watchdog fears the 
 
 outages could lead to a nuclear accident.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
RAFAEL GROSSI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY:  Yesterday, for the first time ever, all of Ukraine's four operational 
 
 nuclear power plants - Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi - lost external power and were disconnected from the grid. This 
 
 unprecedented situation would have been unimaginable just months ago.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
ANDERSON:  And forgive the sound behind me, we are of course in Doha in Qatar here. Let's get you to Sam Kiley. He is in Zaporizhzhia. Clear 
 
 concern being voiced there by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Sam. Just speak to that and explain what you are witnessing and 
 
 hearing on the ground.  
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well here in Zaporizhzhia, unfortunately, the population is no stranger to these 
 
 warnings coming about what happens if you disconnect a nuclear power station in the case of the one downriver from here the biggest in Europe, 
 
 in fact, if you disconnect it from the national grid, it means it doesn't get power to cool its reactors.  
 <br>[11:15:00]  
 
It's reactors then have to go onto diesel power, which the other four of the other - all of the other nuclear power stations across the country, the 
 
 other three had to do recently, following this massive attack by Russian cruise missiles, they were disconnected from the national grid had to use 
 
 their diesel backup generators to stay cool. If those break down, then there is a risk of a nuclear meltdown.  
 
And that is the greatest risk posed to any of these nuclear power stations, bigger even than being struck with artillery or similar, because they're 
 
 actually built ultimately to withstand that kind of conventional disaster. But nobody ever plan for the idea that you would have a massive World War 
 
 II-type invasion of Ukraine, a European country, by Russia that could be threatening to the nuclear power industry.  
 
An industry that supplies 50 percent of the country's energy. So if you disconnect them, you just start disconnecting the whole country like you 
 
 just said, they are getting the system back on track again on Saturday, but every time it gets attacked in this way in what NATO is calling Putin's 
 
 weaponization of winter, things get a bit tougher, a bit harder to fix and therefore exponentially much harder for the civilian population of the 
 
 country as winter approaches, Becky.  
 
ANDERSON:  Sam Kiley is on the ground. Thank you, Sam.  
 
Well, the UN's top human rights body is taking action investigating Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests. Before the U.N. decision was 
 
 announced, this was the scene in Geneva.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
CROWD:  (Foreign language).  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
ANDERSON:  Then, when the resolution from the U.S. Human Rights Council was passed on Thursday, this was the reaction by supporters of the move.  
 
Like the demonstrators, some football stars have also been taking action. Popular Iranian footballer, Voria Ghafouri, wasn't part of his country's 
 
 winning squad in Qatar. Earlier on he wasn't called out, but now he's attracting attention back home because he is under arrest after being 
 
 supportive of those anti-government protests that have gripped the country since September.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
CROWD:  (Foreign language).  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
 
ANDERSON:  And hundreds of people marched in the capital Tehran on Thursday night. Authorities are accused of committing widespread abuses. Well, it is 
 
 worth asking the following question, why does establishing an international fact finding mission matter? Because that's what the U.N. has done.  
 
Well, briefly, you now have a U.N. funded body that can keep track of human rights violations. Previously, news organizations and human rights groups 
 
 are forced to piece together social media videos and accounts (inaudible) closing the special session, the president of the Human Rights Council 
 
 noted that it is a multilateral and democratic body where differences of opinion are legitimate. And he said he hoped Iran would cooperate.  
 
Well, to find out more, the president himself, Federico Villegas, joins me now live from Geneva. You hope the Iranians will cooperate? Do you believe 
 
 that they will?  
 
FEDERICO VILLEGAS, PRESIDENT, U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL:  Hello. Yes, I think that at one moment or another, they will realize that the Iranians 
 
 across the world are asking for change and there are demands for change that are directly linked to human rights, because they will like to see a 
 
 different situation in the country in relation to human rights have been heard by the Human Rights Council.  
 
Having for the first time a special session on Iran and approving an independent body to investigate the violations that are being reported on a 
 
 daily basis. So yes, I think that this is the mechanism that can make a difference.  
 
ANDERSON:  Okay. Because, frankly, it's so important that there is some sort of mechanism that will make a difference, so good to get your optimism 
 
 on that. Let's talk about the draft. We understand the fact finding mission could take months, perhaps years, and a final report could be expected as 
 
 late as March 2024.  
 
So what immediate changes does this move bring about right now for Iranians who continue to risk their lives every day on the ground?  
 
VILLEGAS:  The immediate changes that you have the most important body created by the international community that decided to take action and the 
 
 independent experts will be starting to work soon.  
 <br>[11:20:08]  
 
I intend to appoint them in record time in the next few weeks and they will start collecting the information on all the violations that are being 
 
 reported. But what you mean by the reports in the next year is the procedural presentation of a report in - before the Human Rights Council.  
 
But the work will start immediately as soon as they are appointed. And they will actually collect all the information to identify responsible and they 
 
 can, of course ...  
 
ANDERSON:  Okay.  
 
VILLEGAS:  ... they can do that being granted access or not, but they can still do the job.  
 
ANDERSON:  Realistically, just how much power does the U.N. Human Rights Council wield over the government of Iran at this point. How much power to 
 
 hold Iran to account?  
 
VILLEGAS:  The power that we have maybe different than other instances, is that Iran has international obligations of the - of human rights on 
 
 peaceful assembly and freedom of expression and women's rights and Iran is a U.S. member and is an observer of the Human Rights Council.  
 
So the power is precisely that we are the only independent body that is created by a system in which Iran has obligations as a state. And that is 
 
 the only one, the only chance that Iran has to maybe tell their side of the story as they have said during the session.  
 
ANDERSON:  Right.  
 
VILLEGAS:  If you listen to their presentation, they have another side of the story of what's going on in Iran. If there is a chance to tell their 
 
 side of the story, they should cooperate with this mechanism. We are the only chance by the international community to have their story.  
 
ANDERSON:  Okay. And in a hint of their potential position and what they may do next, Iran's representative has stressed that this draft is, and I 
 
 quote here, "completely biased in nature and substance and does not reflect the facts and realities," calling it an attempt to, and again, I quote 
 
 here, "misuse human rights to achieve narrow sighted goals by certain self appointed human rights guardians." What's your response to that?  
 
VILLEGAS:  That is the traditional excuse to prevent international scrutiny of the human rights situation in a country. And that is basically something 
 
 that no country should use, because this mechanism has been approved by a multilateral body with wide support of different countries from different 
 
 regions. This is not a single country decision on Iran, it's the U.S. that decided this.  
 
ANDERSON:  So I must press you on this, because - let me press you on this, because that reaction to me doesn't bode well and I'm sure it doesn't bode 
 
 well for many of our viewers watching around the world. You said you hoped Iran would cooperate. Are you confident that they will and what will the 
 
 repercussions be if they don't? I think it's important that we discussed that.  
 
VILLEGAS:  The repercussions if they don't cooperate with the mechanism created by the U.N. is that they will be more and more criticized for what 
 
 they are doing with the Iranian people are not responding to the demands. So the reaction might be at this moment in rejection of the make of this 
 
 body. But let's be honest, what's going on, it's obvious and you mentioned it, it's not only the national team of soccer, we have several other 
 
 international sports team of Iran that - expressing themselves.  
 
So the pressure will continue. These societies evolve naturally and is not written in stone any cultural value or any way of interpreting religion in 
 
 relation to human rights value, humanity has evolved. So in this moment that the Iranian society obviously is expressing a need to change directly 
 
 linked to human rights.  
 
ANDERSON:  Right.  
 
VILLEGAS:  I am sure that they will end up cooperating with this mechanism. It's the best chance they have to have a smooth transition to a better Iran 
 
 with greater respect and a new path for human rights.  
 
ANDERSON:  Okay. Well, it's good to have you on, sir. Let's follow up on this conversation as the fact finding investigation gets underway. Thank 
 
 you. We are going to take a very short break at this point, back after this.  
 <br>[11:25:00]  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
 <br>[11:27:21]  
 
ANDERSON:  Well, I don't know if you can hear the fans behind me and I have to say I've got a feeling these Argentinian fans, despite the fact that 
 
 they lost in their first match to the Saudis, their fans are in fine fettle, making an awful lot of noise. A lot of the fans out in the soup 
 
 tonight, a lot of games going on, of course.  
 
And in a couple of hours today, final match is as the Americans would describe it, an absolute doozy, the U.S.A. versus England. Now, Iran's 
 
 victory over Wales earlier today has putting new pressure on the U.S. to get points if they hope to qualify for the knockout round, the teams in the 
 
 same group.  
 
England and the U.S. have not faced each other in a World Cup since 2010 and that was a surprising one-one draw, surprising to many England fans, an 
 
 absolute joy to U.S. fans. I spoke just a short time ago to JT Batson. He's the CEO of the U.S. Soccer Federation and he told me that the team is 
 
 feeling confident about their match with the heavily favored England squad. Have a listen?  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
JT BATSON, CEO, U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION:  Well, the team looks good. The team is feeling good as we were leaving the hotel, they were certainly in 
 
 good spirits. The coaches last night were feeling good about the prep, feeling good about the - how the players are looking and feeling and so 
 
 ready to go.  
 
ANDERSON:  How do England look to your mind?  
 
BATSON:  The - England look great. As we discussed before, as an Arsenal fan, seeing some of some of - seeing soccer get two goals is always 
 
 exciting. But England look great in the first game and we know we've got some stiff competition but the guys are up for it, which we're excited 
 
 about.  
 
ANDERSON:  With the Thanksgiving holiday yesterday as we understand it, this may just have been the most watched game of soccer in U.S. history. 
 
 How does that speak, do you think, to the growth of the game in the States?  
 
BATSON:  So I'm almost 60 days into the this role and so, obviously, the World Cup schedule came out before I knew I was going to do this and my 
 
 entire family was reorienting our Thanksgiving plans around being together to watch this game. And I know our family was not alone in that and so the 
 
 numbers of the folks who are going to be sitting around television in Washington. Times Square, the largest TV in the world is going to have the 
 
 game on today.  
 <br>[11:30:06]  
 
And so the number is going to be incredible. The excitement is palpable and we're looking forward to it.  
 
ANDERSON:  And if you look back to the history of this tie, you have a chance, explain why.  
 
BATSON:  Sure. We have a great record in the World Cup against (inaudible) and so we look to keep that rolling today. So obviously, many years ago, 
 
 the big win one-nothing and then our famous one-one win as the New York Post put it a few World Cups ago. So yes, the team is confident and I think 
 
 our fans are super excited and so we're looking forward to it.  
 
ANDERSON:  How are you finding the atmosphere here in Doha?  
 
BATSON:  It - I had lunch this - earlier today, specifically outside of our hotel to be with - just sort of to - sort of soak it in. And the energy was 
 
 great, the - we were able to go to the Brazil, Serbia game last night and that felt like a World Cup final, even though it was the first game. And so 
 
 the fans are loving it and it's great to be here.  
 
ANDERSON:  I was at the U.S.-Welsh game and the fans were making a lot of noise, the American fans, as were the Welsh fans, it's got to be said. FIFA 
 
 had said that nearly 3 million tickets have been bought for this tournament and America ranks as one of the top nations in those sales. Why do you 
 
 think it's been such a draw, this tournament?  
 
BATSON:  Well, I think Americans love big competitions, and of course, we love to win. And nothing gets bigger than the World Cup. And as we're 
 
 talking before, the growth of the game in the States has been incredible over the past few decades. And the generation who grew up with the game 
 
 like and so many of my friends, we're now at an age where we can afford to do these sort of things and we can now bring our kids to these sort of 
 
 thing. And so I think this is only going to grow.  
 
My guess is, the Women's World Cup next year, we're going to be number one or number two in terms of tickets sold and, of course, the World Cup coming 
 
 to North America in '26, the numbers are going to be insane in terms of the number of fans who go to games and so, yes, it's only going to grow.  
 
ANDERSON:  What are you learning from this tournament, because you, of course, are hosting the tournament, the World Cup in 2026, alongside Canada 
 
 and Mexico, what are you learning here?  
 
BATSON:  Well, I think the - it's such a unique environment around the fact that stadiums are so close together. And, of course, in the States, the - 
 
 and it's not just America, it's also Canada and Mexico. And so, it's going to be a different sort of experience, where you'll get to see the West 
 
 Coast. You'll get to see the South. You'll get to see the Northeast, the Midwest, Canada, Mexico and so I think the sort of different cultural sort 
 
 of experiences for fans, I think, is going to get to be quite cool. And it's something that we've heard from fans here to - over the last couple of 
 
 days that they're excited to experience as well.  
 
ANDERSON:  The Germans have cover their mouths ...  
 
BATSON:  Sure.  
 
ANDERSON:  ... that was an iconic shock really of this tournament. There's been some controversy about the European captain wanting to wear the One 
 
 Love armband. Can we expect a demonstration of inclusion on the pitch by the American team tonight?  
 
BATSON:  The team has been very focused on the Be the Change message. And that's something that has manifest itself off the field in their press 
 
 conferences and it's really around giving the players the platform to do what they feel comfortable with. And the - one of the beauties of America 
 
 is its diversity and so we have players from all over the world, from all over the country, from all sorts of different backgrounds of all different 
 
 perspectives.  
 
And so we really want to give them the platform to advocate on things that are important to them, whether it's gun violence, whether it's Black Lives 
 
 Matters, whether it's basic human rights, whether it's anything beyond that, we want to support them in that.  
 
ANDERSON:  So what can we expect from you?  
 
BATSON:  We - this evening, for them to - we got a great game ahead of us and the folks are excited about it.  
 
ANDERSON:  You've agreed with the women's national team for equal pay between them and the men. It took a while.  
 
BATSON:  Yep.  
 
ANDERSON:  What changed your mind?  
 
BATSON:  Well, I think we've long been committed to this and I think our president, Cindy Parlow Cone, one of the legendary players on our women's 
 
 national team winning World Cups, winning gold medals, she really did a great job of bringing both the men and women together to sit down and say, 
 
 hey, we need to do this and how do we work together to solve this.  
 
And actually, one of the biggest obstacles was the FIFA World Cup prize money, because it's not just equal pay on what U.S. Soccer pays the 
 
 players, it's also - it also is equalizing the World Cup prize money and how do you do that when the Men's World Cup prize money is demonstrably 
 
 larger than the Women's World Cup prize money.  
 <br>[11:35:05]  
 
And they agreed to share and so it's really sort of transformational in terms of what it means not just for football or soccer, but what it means 
 
 broadly for sport and society. And so, we're really proud of that and it's something we want to build on more broadly.  
 
And we've long been a leader in women's football, we know the rest of the world, fortunately, is now investing in that which is exciting and we want 
 
 to continue that investment.  
 
ANDERSON:  It is Thanksgiving. The squad is away a long way ...  
 
BATSON:  Sure.  
 
ANDERSON:  ... from home for many of them, what did they have last night? Did they get turkey?  
 
BATSON:  So yesterday, we were fortunate enough to have Thanksgiving with the American Chamber of Commerce locally with our players families and 50 
 
 members of the U.S. military who were based here in Qatar, which was a really sort of a special experience. The players don't actually get 
 
 Thanksgiving until tomorrow ...  
 
ANDERSON:  Right.  
 
BATSON:  ... and so there - no turkey lethargy for - so some of my English friends have been texted me to make sure that we gave them extra stuffing, 
 
 cranberry yesterday. That doesn't come till tomorrow, but our players' families are here. We had a really wonderful time with them, and the 
 
 military folks and other Americans based here in Qatar yesterday. And so that was a special thing and I look forward to being with the players 
 
 tomorrow after - as we celebrate a great result tonight.

SHAIKHA AL-SULAITI, QATAR SUPPORTER:  I mean, it's completely surreal for me. I wasn't expecting to be in Doha during the World Cup, because I just 
 
 assumed that it would be madness. But thankfully, due to work commitments, I'm here and I'm experiencing this amazing once in a lifetime event.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).  
 
AL-SULAITI:  I mean, it's completely surreal for me ...

ANDERSON:  Well, a view from one of the fans dotted across Madin Musharraf (ph), just a stone's throw from where I am. And sure that Qataris didn't 
 
 win today, but the Maroons did score their first ever World Cup goal. And for the Qataris gathered there, that fact and the fact that their country 
 
 is hosting the global spectacle of sport is a victory in itself.  
 <br>[11:40:05]  
 
Well, now as many of you regulars will know, I strongly believe that sport can truly be transformative. And that's a view shared by the organizers of 
 
 this tournament through the Generation Amazing Foundation. A legacy program that funds children's education and sports facilities around the world that 
 
 they say has touched a million lives, lives of kids like those in tonight's Parting Shots.
