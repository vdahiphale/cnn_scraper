FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. 
 
I'm Fredricka Whitfield. 
 
And we begin with gun violence across the U.S. this weekend. Mass shootings across three states have killed two people and injured dozens more from Massachusetts to Michigan and Texas. 
 
A short time ago, police in Massachusetts said eight people were injured after an overnight shooting where hundreds of people gathered at a spontaneous meetup, organized over social media. 
 
Seven young people were shot, two of them are in critical condition. One other person was seriously injured while trying to escape and fell. Officials say no arrests have been made and they do not have a suspect at this time.
 
And hours earlier in Rochester Hills, Michigan nine people were shot at a random attack at a splash pad park, including four and eight- year-old brothers and their mother. Authorities say the gunman pulled up to the Brooklands Plaza splash pad and opened fire nearly 30 times.

REP. JOHN JAMES (R-MI): Under no circumstances is it normal for ice cream cones and flip-flops to be strewn amongst blood and bullet casings.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WHITFIELD: CNN national correspondent Gloria Pazmino has the latest. Gloria we just heard and learned from the White House that they're working with local law enforcement on the Michigan shooting in particular. What are you learning about that? 
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we are told that President Biden has been in touch with local officials there, Fred. And as you said, just a really violent and bloody weekend across very different cities around the country.
 
Here in Michigan, we are learning more first about the victims. As you said many of them young children, nine people in total were shot between the ages of four and 78-years-old. That group of people includes a family -- 4-year-old boy who was shot in the leg and an 8- year-old boy who was shot in the head and remains in critical in addition. Theres also a woman who sustained gunshot wounds. All of them are part of the same family.
 
Now, just a short while ago, we did hear an update from police who told us that they have identified the suspect. He is 42-year-old Michael William Nash. He is from Shelby County -- Shelby Township, I should say. 
 
And police tell us that this appears to be a random attack. He drove up to the splash pad, got out of his vehicle, and opened fired nearly 30 times. Stopping to reload just a few two feet away from this playground where young families were gathered on Saturday. 
 
Now, as I said, police say the shooting appears to have been at random. He then got back into his vehicle, fled the scene and barricaded himself at his mother's house. 
 
That's where police tried to contain him and later were able to find him inside the house deceased from an apparent gunshot wound. 
 
Police also tell us they found the weapon they believe was used in this shooting, sitting atop the kitchen table. You can see video there of forensic experts out this morning cleaning up the scene. 
 
This is a playground, a place where children and families gather every day. 
 
Take a listen to one of the witnesses who heard the shooting.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHERYL DELCOTTO, WITNESSED SHOOTING: We were standing (ph) on the patio and we heard -- we heard what we thought was firecrackers and it was I guess it was gunshots because we -- because we heard people screaming. Like help us, help us. So we ran around. I called 911. 
 <br>[14:04:40]
 
DELCOTTO: I've seen people lay on the ground. I've seen a guy (INAUDIBLE) stomach. He was sitting on the chair, the older man. And then I've seen these guys like, where's my -- his son was coming out on the stretcher, blood all over his face.
 
And it was scary.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAZMINO: We heard from the mayor of Rochester Hills who described this as a nightmare. 
 
And Fred, just you know, this is the second mass shooting to take place here in this county, Oakland County in the past five years. This is also home to where the Oxford High School shooting happened just a few years ago in 2021. 
 
So an area that has already been severely impacted by gun violence. And now, once again, reeling after the shooting there yesterday. 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, horrible sequence of events. Gloria Pazmino, thank you so much for that. 
 
And then to Texas now where a deadly shooting took place last night, this one taking place at a Juneteenth celebration. Two people are dead and multiple others injured, including two children when police say a fight broke out between two groups of people.
 
This happened in Rock Round, Texas, which is about 20 miles north of Austin. According to police, the two victims who died at the scene were innocent bystanders. Police are still looking for a suspect. 
 
Musician and Texas native Paul Wall, performed at the Juneteenth celebration about an hour before the shooting and he posted on Facebook, quote, "Prayers up for Round Rock. This truly hurts my heart."
 
All right. 
 
We're also tracking a dangerous wildfire that is rapidly growing in Los Angeles County. The Post Fire has burned through more than 11,000 acres and forced at least 1,200 people to evacuate a state park. The cause of the fire still under investigation. 
 
Let's bring in CNN's Camila Bernal who is near the evacuation zone in Gorman, California. It looks like this wildfire is spreading pretty fast.
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is Fred. And one of the biggest problems is the wind. We are seeing wind gusts of 45 to 55 miles per hour according to the National Weather Service and they're particularly concerned about tonight because we could see between 60 and 70 mile per hour winds. 
 
And so what firefighters right now are trying to do is create those fire lines and we are being told that there are firefighters on the ground.
 
But what we're seeing in the area where we are now is those efforts in the air. Helicopter after helicopter coming to do those water drops. You just missed it by about two minutes.
 
Because the good thing about the area where I am now is that it is near a lake. And so these fire fighters are able to essentially make these rounds, go to the lake, grab that water, and come to this area.
 
Just about two hours ago right here there were raging, you know, flames right behind me and what we've seen is those helicopters coming over and over again. And so they have been able to get some control of this area where we are now.
 
But again, like you said, there are about 1,200 people under evacuation orders and there are others under evacuation warnings. Authorities telling people to have their stuff ready in case they need to go extremely fast. 
 
And I want you to take a listen to what the California Fire Department is saying about this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CRAIG LITTLE, L.A. COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: So along with that 10,500 acres burned, we have zero containment at this point. 
 
We have numerous resources in place. We have Los Angeles County, we have Ventura County, Kern County, Angeles National Forest, and CalFire fire arrived this morning. 
 
The winds are probably going to be the biggest factor in battling this blaze. We're going to have gusts as high as 60 miles per hour. But that would not be a constant. Mostly, we're going to see an average about 24 mile per hour winds.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BERNAL: and of course you see that wind in my hair and the trees behind me. the fire is only 2 percent contained. So there's still a lot of work to be done here, Fred. 
 
And you know, there is a helicopter coming as we speak, but you know, it's just a lot of work that these guys are doing here nonstop, Fred. 
 
WHITFIELD: Yes, it's very clear how that wind is going to be a giant obstacle.
 
Camila Bernal, Thank you so much.
 
All right. Still to come, President Joe Biden said another fundraising record at a star-studded event in Los Angeles. While Donald Trump makes a fresh appeal to black voters in the battleground state of Michigan. 
 
And later a surprise appearance at the mound. Snoop Dogg, throws the first pitch at an MLB game and then he heads to the announcer's booth. You've got to hear this.
 <br>[14:09:25]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. 11 days to go before the presidential -- the first presidential debate, which will be hosted right here on CNN and the 2024 campaign is kicking into high gear. Last night in Los Angeles, President Biden held a star-studded
 
 fundraiser where he was joined by former President Barack Obama and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. 
 
The president cashed in on that star power raising more than $30 million for his campaign -- a record-breaking number for Democrats. He also delivered a stark morning about a second Trump term.
 
For more, let's bring in CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, what more can you tell us about this? A huge fundraiser and Biden's message? 
 <br>[14:14:45]
 
PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this was yet another event where President Biden's trying to underscore the stakes of the election and warned of a second Donald Trump presidency. 
 
This time, however, he focused specifically on the Supreme Court and argued that in the next four years there could be openings on the Supreme Court. And if Donald Trump were to be reelected what that could portend for future rulings. 
 
Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The next president is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees -- two more, two more. He's already appointed very negative in terms of rights of individuals.
 
The idea that if he's reelected, he's going to point two more flying flags upside down is really -- I really mean it.
 
JIMMY KIMMELL, TV HOST: Could this be -- could this be the scariest part of all of it? 
 
BIDEN: Well, I think it is one of the scariest parts. Look the Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today. After the decision that overruled Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision you had Clarence Thomas talking about the fact that there are going to be other things we should reconsider including in vitro fertilization including contraception, including all these things.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ALVAREZ: So a couple of points there. He talked about the flags in reference to the flag controversy around Alito and the flags flown outside of his home. But also on abortion and the overturning of Roe v Wade. 
 
Of course, this has been an argument that the campaign has used and used forcefully in battleground states in terms of what else could happen down the road if there, if President Biden isn't reelected. Of course, the president went on to say that institutions matter. And former President Barack Obama also added to that argument, noting that some of the -- some of the behavior of former president Donald Trump has been normalized in ways that would be disqualifying to a candidate in the past. And also noting that the core values of each of the candidates have to be considered. 
 
So all of this to again build that argument for the next few weeks, something we'll be hearing a lot of and also adding to the campaign coffers, as we noted, millions coming into their pockets from this fundraiser and all of this as they hope to build more momentum going into these next few months, Fred. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Priscilla Alvarez, thank you so much.
 
Meantime, former president Donald Trump also on the campaign trail this weekend, traveling to the battleground state of Michigan, where he spent part of his day courting black voters at a church in Detroit.
 
He then baselessly cast doubt on the 2020 election as a way to attack the 2024 election at a conservative conference last night.
 
CNN's Eva McKend has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: The former president continued to echo conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, telling his supporters that he wants his margin of victory to be so large that it should be too big to rig. 
 
Of course, we know the 2020 election was not rigged, but you hear that refrain being echoed by his supporters, too big to rig.
 
He's also adding something else to his routine. Its really consequential and he's telling his supporters that they have to plan their vote, whether its early or by mail on or on election day, they have to make a plan.
 
That's really a departure from 2020 when he casts doubt on those mechanisms of voting early and voting by mail. And it really indicates that this time around, he's not trying to leave any votes on the table. 
 
Take a listen.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: the radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. 
 
Listen, we don't need votes. We got more votes than. Anybody's ever had. We need to watch the vote. We need to guard the vote. We need to stop the steal. 
 
We want a landslide that is too big to rig. 
 
Make a plan to vote, either by mail or early in person or on election day.
 
MCKEND: Trump also spending his time in Detroit at a historically black church. He thinks that he can make inroads with black voters this election.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Eva McKend. thank you so much.
 
Join us Thursday, June 27. It's the most anticipated moment of this historic election season and the stakes couldn't be higher.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
WHITFIELD: New today, Israel's military announcing a tactical pause in an effort to allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. The IDF designated a single route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the European hospital in Khan Younis. 
 
But Israeli officials say despite this pause, there has been no let up to fighting in southern Gaza. 
 
CNN's Oren Liebermann is live for us out of Haifa, Israel. 
 
So Oren, Israel says more than a thousand aid trucks are waiting on the Gaza side of the crossing. Is any of this actually getting to people? 
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, we don't have a number on how many of those thousand trucks were supposed to crossed Kerem Shalom and into Gaza through that tactical pause route to the European hospital. 
 
But at least from what we're hearing from the Israeli military, that pause went into effect today, 11 hours from the morning until the early evening. And it is supposed to remain in effect, at least on a daily basis going into the future here. The idea is to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza and allowing it crucially to go north.
 <br>[14:24:50]
 
LIEBERMANN: This is something the U.S. and others have been pushing for, more humanitarian aid into Gaza.
 
This, as for example, UNRWA, the U.N. agency focusing on Palestinians as 50,000 children within Gaza are suffering from malnutrition.
 
Meanwhile, at the same time, there are issues with -- serious issues, I should say, with sanitation, with sewage, with living conditions, with malnutrition across the general population, an ongoing concerns of a famine. 
 
But as the IDF pointed out, the fighting itself in Rafah where the IDF is currently pushing sort of northwest from the Gaza border with Israel towards the beach is ongoing. 
 
Now, according to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he heard the news that there would be a tactical pause. He then reached out to his military secretary and said this was unacceptable until he was assured that the fighting in Rafah would continue.
 
That kind of raises the question about where the order for a tactical pause came from. But at least from what we're hearing right now, and we'll have a better sense of this over the next few days as we get reports from inside Gaza, that tactical pause will continue.
 
WHITFIELD: And then Oren, what do you knew about this U.S. envoy arriving to Israel tomorrow. And as we see tensions surging with Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. What is this visit hoping to accomplish? 
 
LIEBERMANN: There was serious concern earlier this week that the tensions and frankly fighting and hostilities across Israels northern border between Israel and Hezbollah can spark, could spark into a much wider conflict. And this was highlighted when Israel killed a senior Hezbollah official in southern Lebanon. Lebanon or Hezbollah responded with 200 rockets more than in a single day and followed that up with more rockets in the next days. 
 
And it's around this time that the fear was the greatest of a wider conflict. The pace of the fighting has significantly dipped since a couple of days ago. 
 
And yet the chief envoy that deals for the U.S. between Israel and Lebanon is still on his way. Expected, to arrive tomorrow, Amos Hochstein. We don't yet have a sense of who he'll meet. 
 
And if he'll go to Lebanon to have follow-on meetings there, but crucially, he has been the Biden administration's chief point on this specific issue, trying to make sure that the war started in Gaza eight, nine months ago, does not spill over into a regional conflict and everybody has been concerned about the border between Israel and Lebanon.
 
WHITFIELD: Oren Liebermann, thank you so much from Haifa, Israel.
 
All right. New today, a two-day major peace summit on Ukraine ended with some of the key attending nations refusing to sign a final agreement. More than 100 countries and organizations gathered in Switzerland to drum up support for a ten-point peace plan first outlined by President Zelenskyy in 2022.
 
The communique signed by more than 80 attendees calls for a ceasefire, restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the restoration of Ukraine's pre-war borders -- demands Ukraine says would be allowed to own nuclear power plants and the return of children and civilians taken by Russia.
 
Joining us right now as Kateryna Stepanenko. she is a deputy team lead at the Institute for the Study of War and a Russian analyst.
 
Kateryna, good to see you. 
 
So we've seen President Zelenskyy meeting with many world leaders in recent weeks in France, at the G7 summit in Italy. And now at this peace summit in Switzerland. But how does all of this diplomacy translate to actual support on the ground where Ukraine needs it most.
 
KATERYNA STEPANENKO, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR: I think that we are seeing very positive signs from today's summit and as well as yesterday. 
 
Number one, you know, the objective of the summit is to gather international support for Ukraine and most importantly, that the war needs to end with the territorial integrity of Ukraine restored. This means that we need to adopt a principled position, which is that Putin doesn't get to walk away with the occupied territories as well as the people that are currently located in occupied territory. 
 
So overall, I think Ukraine has been on a very good diplomatic path to ensure that its voice is heard and its vision for peace in Ukraine is heard as well. 
 
WHITFIELD: Is the international support Ukraine is receiving enough to help turn the tide in Ukraine's a favor in this war.
 
STEPANENKO: of course, there's always prospects for more. It is disappointing to see that China didn't join the Swiss conference. So of course, you know, there needs to be additional international pressure on Russia to make sure that Russia feels that it can no longer sustain this war in Ukraine.
 
WILLIAMS: so several of the world leaders Zelenskyy has met with in recent weeks while they've, you know, continued to reinforce their support for Ukraine, they're also fighting for their own political futures from President Biden to President Macron of France, Prime Minister Sunak. 
 
WHITFIELD: Is that complicating the impact that these other nations might be able to have on this war.
 
STEPANENKO: So of course, you know, domestic politics always play a role in larger international considerations. 
 <br>[14:30:02]
 
However, I really do think that today's outcome that we saw around 80 countries sign the resolution is a promising starting point. And I think that were probably going to see a lot more commitments for Ukraine in the future.
 
WHITFIELD: And how do you think Russia is viewing this peace summit? STEPANENKO: So Russia deliberately try to sabotage the peace summit.
 
 First, it really -- Putin decided to have a speech on the eve of the summit, making false demands and trying to pretend that his maximal demands are for Ukraine's capitulations, are actual ceasefire or position for peace talks, that was not the case. It actually was an information operation deliberately made so that the attention of the summit would be turned around and focused on Putin.
 
WHITFIELD: Earlier today, the E.U. president accused Putin of not being serious about ending the war, claiming that Russia is insisting on Ukraine ceding territory, not even currently occupied by Russia. Obviously, Putin wants to keep this war going.
 
STEPANENKO: Yes, and I totally agree with that assessment. The Russians have not made any attempts to actually compromise. And all of their calls for peace talks are essentially an effort to deflect our decision-making and slowed down our processes through which we are trying to supply Ukraine and make sure that Ukraine stays active from the battlefield.
 
WHITFIELD: Kateryna Stepanenko, thank you so much for being with us today. 
 
STEPANENKO: Thank you. 
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Back in this country, extreme heat is building across from coast-to-coast nearly. It's so bad that high temperatures could reach 20 degrees more than average in some places.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:36:33]
 
WHITFIELD: All right, the national weather service is warning people to stay cool this Father's Day amid record-breaking temperatures. Today, an intense heat dome takes over the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast. And millions are subject to heat-related health risks. 
 
And on the gulf coast, heavy rainfall and a potential tropical system. 
 
CNN's Allison Chinchar joins us to tell us more about these dangerous conditions.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yeah. We're talking a lot of areas here. More than two dozen states have the potential to break records. Look at this number, over 170 potential records just in the next five to seven days and it's over several different regions. 
 
Now, a lot of these records would begin in the south before finally spreading northward and eastward in the coming days. So, even places like Atlanta and St. Louis, very hot to finish out the weekend. But then you'll finally start to see those temperatures coming back down by midweek. Now, keep in mind even by midweek, its not necessarily getting back to
 
 normal, just cooler than it is this weekend. Look at Chicago, for example, the average is 81 degrees this time of year, but they will spend every single one the next seven days well above-normal, about five to ten degrees. But if you look in places in the northeast like New York, Boston, even Philadelphia, those areas you're talking 15 to 20 degrees above average over the next several days. 
 
Now, heat is just one of the stories were keeping an eye on. We also have severe thunderstorms in the forecast for Sunday, flood threat for areas of the Midwest and also a pretty potent flood threat down along the Gulf Coast. 
 
Now, the reason for that is we're keeping an eye on to potential systems for possible tropical development. But see this one down here has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in the next seven days. But regardless of whether this becomes a name tropical storm, as it moves northward, it's going to bring all of that moisture with it. So there is the potential for very big rainfall and heavy flooding not only Monday, but also Tuesday along the Gulf Coast. 
 
And that includes places like Houston. When you look at some of these numbers, some areas of Texas could pick up more than ten inches of rain in just the next few days.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WHITFIELD: Wow, lots of extreme conditions. Thank you so much, Allison Chinchar.
 
On Wednesday, CNN will airy special program celebrating Juneteenth. You can watch "Juneteenth: Celebrating Freedom and Legacy" at 10:00 p.m. Wednesday, right here on CNN. And you can stream it on Max as well. 
 
Up next, the hidden costs of owning a home. A new study finds housing expenses are surging, making it harder for first-time buyers to afford a home.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:43:39]
 
WHITFIELD: You could buy a used car for what it's costing some homeowners to maintain their houses in an entire year. 
 
On average, U.S. homeowners are now paying more than $18,000 a year. We're talking about cost beyond the mortgage like home maintenance, insurance, property taxes, utilities, and these costs are often overlooked when you are buying a home. A new study by Bankrate shows expenses tied to homeownership have jumped 26 percent since the pandemic. 
 
Here to discuss is Jeff Ostrowski, an analyst at Bankrate.
 
Jeff, great to see you. I mean, it's hard enough to try to, you know, afford buying a home and
 
 a lot of our producers started doing the math on their home costs and expenses in a year. So, everyone is in agreement and it's just costing everybody a lot more. 
 
So walk us through some of the expenses. Why is it beyond trying to afford buying a home? There are all these other expenses you have to make an account for?
 
JEFF OSTROWSKI, BANKRATE ANALYST AND PRINCIPAL WRITER, HOME LENDING: Yeah. That's one of the things that surprises me even as a longtime homeowner, it's just how much I spend every year on things like maintenance and repairs primarily, but then also homeowners insurance, which is going up in many parts of the country, property taxes, power bills cable and internet. So, all those things really add up.
 <br>[14:45:02]
 
And I think you mentioned where you calculated that those costs are up 26 percent on average over the past four years, inflation over that time is up 21 percent. So this isn't completely surprising, but it is. I think a shock for a lot of first-time buyers when they get into the home, they think that saving up for the down payment and qualifying the mortgage or qualifying for the mortgage meant that they've reached the finish line. And really, they're just the starting line for this whole new race to meet all these financial responsibilities.
 
WHITFIELD: Yeah, these are big expenses. I mean, who then should, you know, be warning of potential buyers about this? I mean, is this something you count on your realtor to remind you of or even the lenders, because oftentimes you go into it saying, okay, I think this is the house that I can afford based on your income and everything else, in terms of the sticker price of the actual home. 
 
But you need a little nudge on trying to do the calculations on everything else, don't you?
 
OSTROWSKI: Right, right, and the lenders and realtors do play a role in preparing buyers for this. So, you know, generally, the estimated property taxes, it shows up on the listing data. The homeowners insurance is usually baked in by the mortgage company as they're doing the qualifications and the underwriting. 
 
So, it's -- some of these things aren't a huge shock that the biggest one, and the most surprising one to me is that just ongoing maintenance and repairs. And so, lenders do require borrowers to have some cash reserves, the ideas that they don't want a first-time homebuyer to close and then six months later, will be running up a huge credit card balance to pay for all these unexpected costs. 
 
But, yeah, there is some -- there are some safeguards built into the lending process. But even with those safeguards, it's -- there's a reason the phrase house poor exists, especially for first-time buyers. They're probably going to spend the first couple of years just scraping and saving as much as they were before, so that they can afford some of these costs. WHITFIELD: Yeah, trying to catch up. I mean, it ends up being painful
 
 when things like your garbage disposal suddenly goes out or the air conditioning, those are things that sometimes a first-time buyer so think about really could happen right around the corner. 
 
All right, so then is there a way to know where some of the most expensive places to own a home or perhaps the least expensive are on the map right now?
 
OSTROWSKI: Yeah. So because this is based primarily on home values, it's not a huge surprise that the really expensive states are places like Hawaii and California, where a homeowner can expect to spend and close to $30,000 a year and these ongoing costs. The least expensive are states like Arkansas and Kentucky where the tab is less than $12,000 a year.
 
Intriguingly, three of the top five states in our rankings were in the Northeast where the property taxes are very high. So, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts. New Jersey in particular, has an average property tax bill north of $10,000. So that was a place where property taxes really, really swing these costs upwards. 
 
But in most states, its really just a factor of how much your house is worth and how much you're going to have to spend on maintenance and repairs over the years. 
 
WHITFIELD: You got any quick advice for people well on how to prepare for those kind of unexpected or perhaps you need to expect a certain expenses are going to come after you buy a house.
 
OSTROWSKI: Yeah. Yeah. You just have to inspect or expect them. I slipped there and said inspect because a lot of home buyers have been waving inspections. 
 
I would say even if you're -- even if seller is requiring you to wave an inspection, still hire a home inspector to come in there and look at it. That'll give you an idea of some of these surprise repairs that might be coming in the next few years. 
 
And the other thing is just to build up your emergency savings account, you want to have a war chest of cash so that you can pay for some of these things without having to run up a credit card debt.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. Very good. Jeff Ostrowski, great to see you. Thank you so much for great advice.
 
OSTROWSKI: All right. Thanks.
 
WHITFIELD: All right. On this week's episode of "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER", we talk with astronomers that are working with the James Webb telescope to answer some fundamental questions about the universe. 
 
CNN's Kristin Fisher has a preview.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fredricka, the Webb telescope is one of the most incredible things that's ever been built, but it's really only as good as the scientists that get to use it. And so for two years, we have been following around two scientific teams and these are for some of the scientists who are the very first in the world to ever get to use the most powerful telescope ever built.
 
(voice-over): The James Webb space telescope, unprecedented in science and scale. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is effectively the best time machine that we've ever created.
 <br>[14:50:06]
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: James Webb is revealing the cosmic story.
 
FISHER: Where do we come from? Are we alone in the universe? These are big questions.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unlocking the secrets that we never knew.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well over 10,000 individuals, $10 billion.
 
FISHER: Behind schedule, over budget.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's thousands of ways this can go badly in one way, it goes right? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: James Webb begins a voyage back to the birth of the universe.
 
FISHER: And those otherworldly images displayed on a cosmic tapestry. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a historic moment for humanity and I feel we are super privilege that we can actually see this.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hopefully, we'll be able to see a reflection of ourselves and to live learn more about where we came from.
 
FISHER: Replacing our reality by rekindling a childlike imagination.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are all astronomers as a kid, as an adult, you look up, you say, what's out there?

FISHER (on camera): And you can see, one of the astronomers that we profiled there, Dan Milisavljevic, getting a bit choked up as he walked into Webb's mission control for the very first time. You know, so much has been said about the telescope itself, the hardware, and it is an engineering marvel and so much has been said about the incredible images that the Webb telescope has already been able to capture. But what we wanted to do with this show is capture the scientists and tell their stories because its up to them to come up with a questions that the telescope then has to try and help them answer. 
 
And these are questions that really cut to the core of who we are and what this all means --- Fredricka.

WHITFIELD: The Edmonton Oilers found the net early and often in game three of the Stanley Cup finals, CNN's Coy Wire has more.

COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Fredricka.
 
Only one NHL team has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit in the Stanley Cup Final. That was 82 years ago. And all other strands are hoping their team will be the next to do so.
 
Have you ever seen fans so hype with their team down 003? That's love. Edmonton had only scored four goals in this series against Florida, but they go off, scoring eight of them last night. Their two-time MVP Connor McDavid finally scoring the first time this series, seven different Oilers scoring goals. McDavid notching three assists, just wanted to Dylan Holloway, who puts it in the top shelf, McDavid now with 30 to assist this postseason surpasses Wayne Gretzky for the most in a single postseason. Edmonton wins 8-1, sending the series back to south Florida for game five on Tuesday.
 
Round three at the U.S. yesterday, and Bryson DeChambeau had to work out some kinks. So laid down in the woods on the 11th holes and got his stiff back all stretched out BDC or BRB, just what the doctor ordered. He birdied that hole, then put up one of the best rounds in the day. 
 
The 2020 champ is seven under, three strokes clear the field entering the day. He lost his dad about 18 months ago, and he said he's going to be thinking about on every hole in today's final round, hoping to win his second major on Father's Day.
 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU, 2020 U.S. OPEN CHAMPION: I still feel like I'm that same kid that came out here right under the start, but I feel like my as a person, I'm just different to interact with. And my dad passing gave me a great perspective on life, just everything in general has changed. He said, they say every five years somebody's life changes, and it couldn't be more true.
 
WIRE: U.S. swimming trials taken over Indianapolis Colts stadium and Katie Ledecky tackling yet another opportunity to qualify for the Olympics with ease, winning the 400 meter freestyle by about four seconds, already was six individual goals more than any female swimmer in Olympic history. Ledecky will now look for revenge in Paris against the Australian terminator, Ariarne Titmus, who in the 400 handed Ledecky, the first individual loss of her Olympic career last time around.
 
But it was 21-year-old. Gretchen Walsh stealing the show, setting a new world record in the 100-meter butterfly with a time of 55.18 in her semifinal hit. She breaks the world record, set back in the 2016 Rio Games. She still has some work to do those shift phase three medalists from the Tokyo Games next, but she certainly making some ways and look swell ahead of the final tonight. 
 
If you can believe it, Fredericka, the Olympics are just 40 days away.
