JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, we have some breaking news this morning. Police in Michigan are searching for the suspect who shot and set fire to patrol cars at a police post in Sault Ste Marie. 
 
CNN's Omar Jimenez following this story. 
 
Omar, what are you learning? 
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, John, well, for starters, this is way in the upper peninsula of Michigan, Sault Ste Marie, where Michigan State Police say that multiple vehicles of theirs were lit on fire and hit with rifle rounds around 3:30 this morning. 
 
I want to show you some of the pictures they've released of the suspect here where, as you can see, it appears to show a man stepping out of a vehicle, aiming what appears to be a gun in the direction of the camera, which according to Michigan State Police is likely where those police vehicles were. Gets back in the vehicle, and then leaves. 
 
And it's why Michigan State Police are asking people to be on the lookout now because this is someone that is not in their custody. They put out the description of the vehicle, a silver Honda CRV. They're considering this man who they described as a white male to be armed and dangerous. They also mention what he was wearing at the time, which they believe to be camouflage as well. And they're asking anyone with information to come forward here. 
 
But obviously, a scary sight to see pop up on surveillance video or to wake up to seeing those vehicles shot out. Now, thankfully, there were no troopers inside as we understand from Michigan State Police. No one was actually hurt here. But the threat of someone who appears to have the ability to fire at vehicles at will is one that they want that community to be on the lookout for. 
 
BERMAN: All right, Omar Jimenez.
 
Omar, keep us posted on this. Thank you very much. 
 
Kate.
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, let's look at -- talk about another manhunt right now. A dangerous game of tactical hide and seek, that is how one U.S. Marshal is now describing the manhunt for the escaped murder in eastern Pennsylvania. Officials there say that they are trying now to stress Danelo Cavalcante into making a mistake. Hundreds of law enforcement officials are combing through heavily wooded terrain as part of the search area. Now essentially a week with this man on the run. 
 
CNN's Danny Freeman is tracking the latest on the search. He joins us now. 
 
And, Danny, you have new reporting in also about how this man escaped. 
 
DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Kate, new reporting just in the past few minutes that really sheds light on how convicted murderer Danelo Cavalcante escaped the Chester County Prison behind me. A law enforcement source telling me that investigators believe Cavalcante climbed up on to the roof of the prison behind me, ran across the roof and escaped that way. 
 
This also comes, Kate, I should note, about three months after another -- a separate inmate escaped this particular prison back in May. That's according to court documents. 
 
Kate, we also have other new information about the potential shifting of the search area. You might remember, we spoke a lot about this yesterday. That trail cameras on Monday night captured Cavalcante a little bit outside of the initial two-mile perimeter that police had established just south of the prison where we are. The trail cameras were in Longwood Gardens, this big, sprawling botanical gardens that's really a popular tourist destination. So then that, a little bit further south, that's where police started to expand their perimeter. 
 
Well, today, we drove around that area. Fewer troopers near Longwood Gardens but a lot more troopers near the Brandy Wine Creek along Route 1. And the reason that that is important is because that's actually further east than most law enforcement officials have been searching before. 
 
We're still waiting on some confirmation from law enforcement that this search has expanded. But, again, just from looking at the footprint on the ground, that's what you can see. 
 
But still, those who are trying to capture Cavalcante, they are not deterred. Take a listen to what one of the U.S. Marshals said last night on CNN. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROBERT CLARK, SUPERVISORY DEPUTY, U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE: This is a dangerous game of tactical hide and seek. 
 
This is a dangerous, dangerous man. He's got nothing to lose. But I can tell you this, his desperateness will not outlast the resolve of our law enforcement officers here. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREEMAN: So, again, those two new pieces of reporting that a law enforcement source has told CNN, they believe the escape happened when Cavalcante climbed on to the roof and we believe that this manhunt is expanding. We're going to get a press conference and more information at 3:00 today. 
 
Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, so now we've just had also announced a lot of new information here, a new press conference that's going to be coming. You're going to be here. 
 
Yesterday they were expanding it south, the search area. Now it's moving over to the east. Schools closed again in some of the search area. This clearly is in the thick of it still. 
 
Danny, thank you for being there. 
 
Sara. 
 <br>[09:35:01]
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: All right, it is now up to a judge in South Carolina to decide whether convicted killer Alex Murdaugh will get a new trial. He was found guilty of killing his wife and son in a sensational and highly publicized trial this year you'll remember. Attorneys allege the jury that convicted Murdaugh was tainted after the court clerk encouraged them not to believe Murdaugh's testimony and to come back with a quick verdict. Murdaugh's lawyers provided the court with sworn affidavits from at least one of the jurors who decided the case and one who was dismissed. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JIM GRIFFIN, MURDAUGH ATTORNEY: When I shared with him the affidavits, he's a lawyer, he was astonished, he was shaking, he was in disbelief. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: I guess the question now is, is it enough to get him a brand- new trial? 
 
Joining me now, Eric Bland. He's an attorney who represented the estate of Murdaugh's longtime housekeeper after she died of suspicious circumstances in the Murdaugh family hope in 2018. 
 
Eric, thank you so much for being with us this morning. 
 
I want to delve into this a little bit and look at what the filing says. So, here's what it says. It says, the Colleton County clerk of court, Rebecca Hill, instructed jurors not to be misled by evidence presented in Mr. Murdaugh's defense. Here is a cutout from that actual filing. She told jurors, it says, not to be fooled by Mr. Murdaugh's testimony in his own defense. 
 
I'm curious what you think about these allegations just in general and what it might mean. I mean could he potentially get a new trial because of this? 
 
ERIC BLAND, ATTORNEY: They are very serious allegations, Sara. For our system to work, it has to work for the worst of us so that it works for the rest of us. And Alex certainly is -- represents the worst of who we are as a society. We have to have a system where the jurors listen to a judge. A judge is the one that instructs the jurors. A clerk of court has a very, very important role in our system. They're coordinators. They're fascinators. They make the system run smooth, the filings of all cases that take place. They deal with jurors and scheduling. Very, very important roles. But they are not instructors to the jury. 
 
However, I do want to say, it should be fully investigated. But let's wait until we hear from people under oath. Let's wait until we hear from the clerk of court under oath. I don't think we're going to hear from her on a press release or a press statement like we saw yesterday from the defense. 
 
However, we have to be very careful for jurors who want to change their opinions after a jury verdict is rendered. Remember, Sara, these jurors were polled and they said that this verdict was based on our free will. So, we don't want jurors to change their mind. And I'm suspect of whether somebody's going to send somebody to prison for life, for murder, simply because there were some suggestions from a clerk of court. 
 
So, I want to hear a full investigation, but it is a very serious allegation. 
 
SIDNER: Can I ask you, sir, if it matters the numbers. In other words, we've got one juror who decided the case, one juror who was dismissed that are saying in sworn affidavits that, you know, they were pressured by the court, or they felt pressured. Does it matter if it's one or does it have to be many, enough to give him a trial, new trial? 
 
BLAND: That's up to a court. 
 
SIDNER: OK.
 
BLAND: I would think for a judge it should be more than one. Some -- one juror getting buyer's remorse or decision remorse, that's not going to do it. But if we have a lot of other jurors who confirm exactly what was saying, we don't -- again, we can never have a clerk of court or any court official, whether it's a bailiff or a police officer or anybody making that kind of merit (ph) communication on substantive issues with a jury. And certainly it's never appropriate for anybody to tell a jury to disregard the testimony of a witness. Again, that's within Judge Newman's province. It was very clear. 
 
So, these are serious allegations. Whether it had a substantive change on the verdict, whether they were not going to convict him, we'll have to hear. But I doubt that what the clerk of court said swayed anybody's mind. But he may be entitled to a new trial. We have to have a system where everybody is treated fairly. 
 
SIDNER: Yes, it's a really good point. I've never heard of a clerk having this much conversation with a jury. So, this will be interesting to watch. But the poor family who is going through this, it's quite a lot, a lot of twists and turns. 
 
Eric Bland, thank you so much for your analysis on that. 
 
John.
 
BERMAN: All right, Sara. 
 
Donald Trump widening his lead over his Republican rivals in a new CNN poll with some numbers beneath the top line that might surprise you. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:44:25]
 
BERMAN: This morning a new CNN poll shows just how big Donald Trump's lead is in the Republican presidential field. It is big. Trump is at 52 percent. Governor Ron DeSantis, from Florida, at 18 percent. That's a 34 percent gap, which is big. Bigger than it was when we last polled. 
 
But, this is a national poll. What matters most, of course, now is the situation in the states, particularly the early voting states. 
 
And CNN's Jeff Zeleny has been talking to voters in New Hampshire and is at the center of the universe in Manchester, New Hampshire, for us this morning. 
 
Jeff, what have you heard? 
 <br>[09:45:03]
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John, good morning. 
 
I mean one of the big questions hanging over this Republican presidential race is whether it's becoming more of a coronation for Donald Trump or a full-blown campaign for the rest of his rivals. But talking to many voters here over the last several days certainly offers a more nuanced view of the race. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BOB TILTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER: To catch up to Trump -
 
ZELENY (on camera): Yes.
 
B. TILTON: It's a big climb. 
 
ZELENY (voice over): Bob Tilton has a front row seat to the Republican presidential contest. He likes a few options, but he loves former President Donald Trump. His wife Crystal does not. 
 
CRYSTAL TILTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER: I think he's had his time and there was enough controversy over it and it's time to move on. 
 
ZELENY: Their disagreement brings to life a monumental divide inside the Republican Party. 
 
B. TILTON: They were attacking him constantly. How can anybody do a good job? I mean, he did, but he was constantly attacked, and it was all fake. 
 
ZELENY: Here in New Hampshire, home to the first in the nation primary, a summertime campaign has given way to a fall fight for survival in a race dominated by signs of Trump's strength. 
 
Republican Governor Chris Sununu insists the GOP contest is still competitive. 
 
ZELENY (on camera): You don't believe that this primary is effectively over? 
 
GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Oh, God, no. Oh, my God, no. Not even close. Not even close. Was it over when Clinton was leading Barack Obama by 20 points at this point back in 2008? No one could beat the Clinton machine, you remember? 
 
ZELENY: I do.
 
SUNUNU: No, not - not at all.
 
ZELENY (voice over): Sununu believes Trump will be unable to win back the White House for Republicans. He points to the general election in New Hampshire, where in 2016 Trump fell short to Hillary Clinton by fewer than 3,000 votes. But four years later, he lost to Joe Biden by nearly 60,000. A big reason, he believes, is independent voters turned away from Trump. 
 
SUNUNU: Here in New Hampshire, though, I think they'll play a big role. I think a lot of independents will come out and vote in the Republican primary. 
 
ZELENY: At a campaign stop for former Vice President Mike Pence, Larry Rocha introduced himself as one of those independents. 
 
LARRY ROCHA, NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER: I was a Republican from the first day I could vote. Many, many years later, I went independent. 
 
ZELENY: He later told us he's looking for a candidate who can turn the page from Trump. 
 
ROCHA: I'm just waiting for someone to step up so I can feel comfortable voting for someone not against someone. 
 
ZELENY: Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is staking his candidacy entirely on New Hampshire. 
 
CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And this is the state in the country that can get it rolling. ZELENY: His Republican challengers are also urging New Hampshire
 
 voters to keep their minds open. Today, Pence had this quip at the ready. 
 
MIKE PENCE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, what did Indiana Jones say? Never tell me the odds. 
 
ZELENY: Linda Russell is sizing up the Republican field in hopes of finding a fresh face. 
 
LINDA RUSSELL, NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER: I do like the thought of either DeSantis or Vivek. Someone that's younger. We definitely need younger. 
 
ZELENY (on camera): Trump's not your first choice at this point? 
 
RUSSELL: He's not. I mean I like - yes, I think everything was great when he was here, but there's just so much baggage with him and people are going to vote for Biden just because they don't like Trump. And I don't -- we don't need that again. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ZELENY: And Linda Russell there, she was looking for a fresh face. She also mentioned Nikki Haley. 
 
I was at a town hall event with Nikki Haley last night, John, and several people said they came for the first time because of her strong debate performance they were intrigued by her and indeed plan to support her. She will be campaigning in New Hampshire again today, as will former Vice President Mike Pence. He'll be delivering a big speech this afternoon trying to remind Republicans about the true meeting of the party, the conservative nature of the party versus the populous streak that it has had in the era of Trump. 
 
So, no question, John, this is a dynamic race, still unfolding, at least in some voters' minds, here in New Hampshire. 
 
John.
 
BERMAN: So important to hear from the voters and see it through their eyes. Not sure whether they picked up on the fact that Mike Pence got it wrong, it was Hans Solo who said never tell me the odds, not Indiana Jones. 
 
ZELENY: That's right. 
 
BERMAN: So, I don't think that they'll vote against him for just that. Might --
 
ZELENY: Good fact check. 
 
BERMAN: Jeff Zeleny, thank you very much. 
 
Facts first. Facts first. 
 
BOLDUAN: Wait. Wait, wait. But I did just look up famous Indiana Jones quotes, because they're very important. One being, I don't know, I'm making this up as I go. So --
 
BERMAN: Everyone's lost but me is one of my favorite Indiana Jones quotes. 
 
BOLDUAN: Did you seriously just pull that out? 
 
BERMAN: It's one of my favorites. 
 
BOLDUAN: The useless knowledge in that big brain of yours. 
 
Thank you so much.
 
OK, coming up for us, more than two decades behind bars, the longest prison sentence of all the January 6th defendants has been handed down to the former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. What he said before learning his fate. That is next. 
 
And it has been a summer like no other in at least one way. Scientists now say this season was the hottest on record, and what they are now warning could come next. We will be back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:53:43]
 
SIDNER: On our radar this morning, Proud Boys -- former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison Tuesday. That is the longest sentence given to anyone in relation to the January 6th attack so far. His lawyers told reporters outside of the courthouse that they are respectfully disagreeing with the judge's decision. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The sentence, we respectfully disagree, but -- yet we respect it. There will be a day and a time when an appeal will come, and we expect that the appeal comes soon. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SIDNER: But he was convicted by a jury of his peers. Prior to his sentencing, Tarrio apologized for the pain and suffering associated with the Capitol attacks. 
 
In just a few hours, Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, will lie in state and the New Mexico Capitol Rotunda. Today's remembrance will be open to the public with a celebration of life planned for tomorrow. Richardson died in his sleep at his summer home in Massachusetts on Friday. He was 75 years old. 
 
Now as Tropical Storm Lee develops in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center warns the storm's strength is nearing hurricane status. It's forecast to become a category three storm, which is a major hurricane, or possibly even higher this week. And it could impact the Leeward Islands by the weekend. 
 <br>[09:55:02]
 
Kate. 
 
BOLDUAN: So, to state the obvious, summer is hot. But this summer was hotter than hot. Phoenix, Arizona, you'll remember, experienced a record-smashing 25 consecutive days of temperatures hotter than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. China posted an all-time national high of 126 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat in Italy and Spain pushed Europe's all- time record to 119.8 degrees Fahrenheit. You get where I'm going.
 
Now scientists with the European Union confirm that the summer of 2023 was the hottest one on record globally. 
 
CNN's Bill Weir is here with more on that. 
 
How hot was it, Bill, and what it -- serious stuff, though. What does it mean? 
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Serious stuff because it's not just a little bit, this new record, it's by a lot. 
 
BOLDUAN: Ah.
 
WEIR: Take a look at the last 30 years here on the northern hemisphere and you can see it tops itself. It's been going up gradually there.
 
BOLDUAN: Holy smokes.
 
WEIR: And then along comes 2023. And it is over a half a degree Fahrenheit. Off the charts. And this is happening around the world. This is happening from the polar bears at the North Pole to the penguins at the South Pole. And the sea surface temperatures are most striking. It is literally off the charts when you look at where we are in 2023 compared to the last '70s, '80s and '90s. These are the decades before.
 
This is what science has been predicting. This is the result of our fossil fuel habit heating up the atmosphere, inundating the oceans. 
 
BOLDUAN: That's - I mean I'm just -- I'm just looking down. Just - there -- it really just keeps rising. 
 
WEIR: Right.
 
BOLDUAN: Like, there's very little - right, but the jump here, I mean, what comes next then? 
 
WEIR: Well, this is - that's the scary part. The real headline is, this is the coolest summer for the rest of our lives. So much of this is built in. If we can level off the CO2 level in the atmosphere. The new science says the temperature will stabilize there. But how high that goes is anybody's guess because there's no movement in terms of getting off of fossil fuels. The big companies are still drilling.
 
BOLDUAN: Right.
 
WEIR: The politicians are still banking it. And until that changes, this is just going to get worse and worse. 
 
BOLDUAN: And it's not just - it's not just incremental change when you see this. It's big change. 
 
WEIR: It's big now.
 
BOLDUAN: It's big. It takes money. You've done so much reporting on the people that are trying new things and the systems that could be put in place, but lacking in all of it is political will. 
 
WEIR: Absolutely. It is in our hands -
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
WEIR: But it has to be changed. 
 
BOLDUAN: Because this -- everyone needs to keep an eye on this chart and remember this. 
 
It's great to see you. Thanks for doing this.
 
WEIR: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: John.
 
BERMAN: Those charts are incredible. 
 
BOLDUAN: Really. Yes.
 
BERMAN: All right, counting down to cameras in the courtroom. A hearing in one of criminal cases against Donald Trump and for the first time we will see it. 
 
Stand by.
