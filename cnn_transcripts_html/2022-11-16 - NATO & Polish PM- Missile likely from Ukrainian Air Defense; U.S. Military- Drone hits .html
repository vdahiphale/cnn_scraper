LYNDA KINKADE, CNN HOST: Welcome back to the show! I'm Lynda Kinkade filling in for Becky Anderson. Good to have you with us.
 
An accidents not an attack that's the consensus building about the missile that landed Tuesday in Poland killing two people. Polish and NATO leaders 
 
 say it appears Ukraine was trying to defend itself from the barrage of Russian missile attacks when the incident happened.
 
An American official telling CNN the Ukrainian military informed the U.S. and its allies that it was trying to intercept a Russian missile around the 
 
 same time and place. NATO Secretary General chaired an emergency meeting today with ambassadors who said Russia still bears responsibility even if 
 
 it didn't fire the weapon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: You have no indication that this was the result of a deliberate attack. And you have no indication that 
 
 Russia is preparing offensive military actions against NATO. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the incident was likely caused by a 
 
 Ukrainian air defense missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks. But let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's 
 
 fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: The G7 and NATO leaders met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia. Most of the G20 members wrapped up their meeting earlier 
 
 by strongly condemning Russia's war in Ukraine. Indonesia's leader says in his words, the most debated section of the Joint Declaration was on the 
 
 conflict in Ukraine.
 
The G20 also focused on what it calls the immense human suffering that the war is inflicting on people in Ukraine. And we have a team of 
 
 correspondents covering this story. Our Sam Kiley is in Ukraine. Melissa Bell is at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. Good to have you with us.
 
Let's start with you first, Sam. So at this point in time, we believe that this was a Russian missile, rather than it being fired by right Russia, 
 
 figure now being pointed to Ukraine as part of its anti-defense system. What more can you tell us?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Ukrainians use predominantly particularly the S300, which is a Soviet era, anti-aircraft 
 
 and anti-missile defense system developed in the 70s and 80s. So it's been updated since then, but it's a leftover piece of technology, from the old 
 
 days, effectively not a piece of very sophisticated modern weaponry.
 
They used it yesterday to good effect around Lviv alongside no doubt other, NATO supplied weaponry to take down 10 of the 13 missiles that the Russians 
 
 fired just against that city among some 85 or more cruise missiles that were fired in a storm attack right across the country by Russia yesterday.
 
Now it would appear that the Ukrainians are beginning to accept. In fact, they're openly accepting that there is a Ukrainian anti-missile system that 
 
 landed in Poland, it's not yet clear whether or not it made contact with an incoming Russian missile or whether it was fired at a Russian missile and 
 
 missed.
 
These systems are largely automated. But Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary Austin, all of Ukraine's allies and the Ukrainian Government is making the 
 
 emphatic point that the original blame for this incident rests not with Ukraine, but with Russia, because of the illegal war, but also because of 
 
 the very substantial use of these missiles.
 
And inevitably, when you're defending a country that Ukrainians are saying, that is right adjacent to another country, these sorts of accidents can 
 
 happen and the subtext of this of course, being boosted really coming out of NATO and statements by Secretary Austin, suggesting that there is an 
 
 imperative now to get more sophisticated anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems into Ukraine that have been increased recently. But the more 
 
 sophisticated weaponry that gets in, the less there is a chance, perhaps of these sorts of accidents.
 
KINKADE: Our thanks to you, Sam. And I do want to bring in Melissa Bell for the NATO response. Melissa had this been a Russian fired missile this would 
 
 have triggered a very serious response by NATO members?
 <br>[11:05:00]
 
KINKADE: What is NATO saying now that it seems that this was an accident rather than an attack?
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, of course, as we arrived here for the morning meetings of the ambassadors who held that emergency meeting, 
 
 before we really knew exactly what the nature of the origin of dismissal was, we understood that it was rushed and made fairly quickly.
 
We didn't know where did come from, or what certain - what circumstances that had been fired. And, of course, the huge worry, and the reason there 
 
 was such tension here is that it would or it could, and Poland was certainly suggesting that it would seek to invoke Article IV, which is the 
 
 beginning of the consultations that can then allow for Article V to be invoked or not.
 
So it would have been a substantial step. And that was where we were this morning. It was at the end of that meeting that Jen Stoltenberg made those 
 
 remarks explaining what we now believe to have been that case - the case that preliminary analysis and of course, that changes everything, it 
 
 changed the tone, and immediately calmed things down.
 
In fact, the speech that followed from Jen Stoltenberg was all about the fact that what was needed right now was calm and coordinated action, there 
 
 was no escalation of the rhetoric, there was no announcement of a beefing up of, of military means or equipment or personnel on the Eastern Flank of 
 
 NATO.
 
It was very much about route, taking the pressure back down and explaining that this was no longer something they were concerned about, even though 
 
 they continue to investigate it. However, there was after that a meeting held virtually and chaired by Lord Austin, the American Defense Secretary 
 
 of the Ukraine contact group.
 
And what the American Defense Secretary said at the outset, referring to the incident of the night before in Poland, was that it was important that 
 
 the minds of everyone be focused as a result of this. It is a Sam was just saying, essential that Ukraine should get more updated, more sophisticated 
 
 defense systems that it's been asking for.
 
He praised the fact that more and more NATO countries were pledging them to Ukraine; this had shown how necessary they were. But also, an official told 
 
 me a senior official told me as meeting finished here, that it was also about showing the world that this was a commitment that NATO was not going 
 
 away, and that they were going to continue to giving Ukraine, the weapons and the support that it needs to see this through.
 
KINKADE: Thanks to you, Melissa Bell at NATO Headquarters. And I do want to bring in our Matthew Chance who is in Poland, and not far from where that 
 
 missile came down a just a few miles a few kilometers from the Ukraine border. What more are you hearing from the Polish side?
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, obviously, there's a great deal of anxiety here, because even though now it's been 
 
 pretty much broadly accepted that this was not a Russian ordered attack on Polish territory, it's still brought home to the Polish people in general 
 
 and the residents of this small close knit community in particular, that their proximity to the war zone is in itself dangerous.
 
There are two people from here farmers who were working just a few 100 meters away from here, who were killed as a result of this incident. And 
 
 that's really shaken the local residents who I've spoken to.
 
In terms of the country as a whole well, the Poles the - the Polish government has put it to military on a more secure footing in terms of 
 
 increasing the deployments and tightening security around this border region.
 
There's also that ongoing investigation that is trying to piece together forensically exactly what happened. So that you know, the firm conclusion 
 
 can be reached. Already Polish officials are saying that look, they've got enough material from the scene to know that this was essentially a 
 
 Ukrainian surface to air missile that caused this damage, as it tried to successfully attack they say and attack a Russian missile.
 
So again, the context all of this is this massive barrage this huge onslaught of Russian missiles on Ukraine throughout the course of yesterday 
 
 attacking essential crucial infrastructure.
 
KINKADE: Alright, Matthew Chance for us in Poland, our Sam Kiley in Ukraine and Melissa Bell at NATO Headquarters thanks to you very much.
 
Well, my next guest is the Foreign Minister of NATO member at the Czech Republic. Now he tweeted a short time ago that he spoke to his Polish 
 
 counterpart and expressed condolences to the families of those two victims. And we fully support Poland in investigating the whole matter.
 
The Czech Republic and Poland will continue to work together to strengthen the security of the EU, and NATO. I'm joined now by the Czech Republic 
 
 Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavsky who is in London right now. Good to have you with us.
 
JAN LIPAVSKY, CZECH FOREIGN MINISTER: Hello.
 
KINKADE: So firstly, you've spoken to your polish counterparts. Take us through that discussion?
 <br>[11:10:00]
 
LIPAVSKY: So I called him to send a message of solidarity with Poland, and of course, with families who lost their loved one. And also, it is very 
 
 dangerous that the conflict is spilling over from Ukraine territory to NATO member states. And we need to be very careful when investigating this 
 
 situation.
 
And also we need to be ready to take appropriate measures. So it was very important that today was a meeting in - organization and the General 
 
 Secretary Stoltenberg have its own word on that.
 
KINKADE: Yes, the General Secretary certainly making it clear that Russia bears the ultimate responsibility for this in this illegal war in Ukraine.
 
LIPAVSKY: Exactly.
 
KINKADE: And we heard the U.S. Defense Secretary reiterating that. He said that, basically Ukraine has the right to defend itself. But this could have 
 
 played out differently had this missile been fired by the Russians, right? This could have been a serious escalation.
 
LIPAVSKY: I'm not in a position to speculate and what would be the more serious escalation? We are in a situation when there were more than 100 
 
 rockets flying from Russia and Belarusian territory on Ukraine to destroy the energy infrastructure. And of course, Ukraine has a full right to 
 
 defend from such horrendous and barbaric attacks.
 
KINKADE: And your country, the Czech Republic, one of a number of countries, that once a Special Criminal Tribunal established to try the 
 
 political leadership of Russia to hold Russian leaders accountable. What do you propose and at this point in time, what realistically is achievable?
 
LIPAVSKY: To establish a special tribal on crime of aggression would be a clear message to Russia leadership that they are accountable for what they 
 
 are doing in Ukraine. And we have the Charter of the United Nations, which says that the borders of state cannot be changed by the brute force.
 
And the Russia has done exactly this. They have illegally annexed Crimea. They have any illegally annexed Kherson and the other region Donbas and 
 
 Luhansk. They need to pay a price for it.
 
KINKADE: And Ukraine's President, of course, laying out this 10 point peace plan this week at his presentation is taped address to the G20. From your 
 
 perspective, what needs to happen right now to begin those peace talks?
 
LIPAVSKY: This is - this is something where I say that, especially we need to listen to Ukraine, because Ukraine has a full right to protect its 
 
 sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it is important that Ukraine has a war in the shape of the peace, and until that the Czech Republic will be 
 
 supporting Ukraine in the effort to defend themselves.
 
KINKADE: Jan Lipavsky, the Czech Republic Foreign Minister, good to have you today. Thanks so much for your time.
 
LIPAVSKY: Thank you very much.
 
KINKADE: Well, still to come an oil tanker off the coast of a mine is hit by a self-detonating drone. Why Israel thinks the attack is linked to the 
 
 upcoming World Cup? And Former U.S. President Donald Trump throws his Maga hat back into the ring as he announces a White House bid for the third 
 
 time. We'll have a live report on what this means for him and the United States?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:15:00]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back! U.S. military officials say a self-detonating drone attacks an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman on Monday night. No major damage 
 
 is reported on the Liberian flagged ship, which is affiliated with Israel, and there has been no claim of responsibility.
 
And Israeli official blames Iran saying Tehran is trying to disrupt stability and influence World Cup events ahead of the tournament in Qatar. 
 
 CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now from Jerusalem. Good to have you with us Hadas. So thankfully no reports of any injuries, what more can you tell us 
 
 about this incident?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: So what we know is around 10 p.m. last night 10 p.m. local for Oman off the coast of Oman about 150 miles off 
 
 the coast is when this attack took place. It's been described as a suicide drone as a self-destructing drone attacked what was what is the Pacific 
 
 Zircon tanker carrying gas oil?
 
Now, the company that owns the ship, the eastern Pacific shipping company, so that there were no injuries and no major spillage that there was some 
 
 damage to their hole, but that they're still managing to continue moving on the water. Now, as you noted, this ship is a Liberian flagship.
 
It's owned by a company that's based out of Singapore. But that company's ultimate ownership does have Israeli affiliations. There's a few questions 
 
 about whether this was a targeted attack on it somehow an Israeli connected ship. An Israeli official is telling me that while they do believe that 
 
 Iran is behind this attack, they don't actually believe that it's a specific attack against an Israeli ship.
 
And that instead, they think it's something to do with more. They're blaming Tehran trying to disrupt activity in the Gulf disrupt shipping 
 
 activity. And they were specifically tying it to the World Cup, which is supposed to come under way in the next few days.
 
What's also interesting is that the Israeli official told me that they think this was a Shahed-136 drone. And these are actually the exact same 
 
 type of Iranian made drones that are being used by the Russians in Ukraine. So there's a connection there.
 
So no official response from the Iranians yet, but we are hearing from both the Americans and the Israelis that they do believe it was Iranians who 
 
 launched this drone towards this oil tanker. Lynda?
 
KINKADE: And Hadas, we have seen these types of attacks before. Does this one fit a pattern?
 
GOLD: Yes, and that's actually what the American officials say that it does fit the pattern of what we've seen in the past of Iranian drone striking 
 
 ships. And if you recall, in July of 2021, an armed drone struck a cargo ship called the Mercer Street. And that actually resulted in two people 
 
 dying in that and that ship was also actually associated with an Israeli billionaire.
 
And actually, since the beginning of 2021, for - there have been at least four attacks on ships, that Israel that are affiliated with Israel, that 
 
 Israel has blamed Tehran force. This definitely fits in with the pattern of the rising tensions we're seeing, especially on the sort of shadow war when 
 
 it comes to Israeli affiliated ships, oil tankers there in the Gulf, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: All right, Hadas Gold for us in Jerusalem thanks very much. Former U.S. President says he is running to make America great and glorious again. 
 
 Donald Trump announced his bid for the White House for the third time. The twice impeached former president touted his achievements before a crowd 
 
 gathered at his resort in Mar-a- Lago, Florida on Tuesday.
 
He painted a bleak picture of the current administration and President Joe Biden. Kristen Holmes reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: America's comeback starts right now.
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Former President Donald Trump announcing another bid for the presidency.
 
TRUMP: Two years ago we were a great nation and soon we will be a great nation again.
 
HOLMES (voice over): The twice impeached former president is aiming to be only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two non-consecutive 
 
 terms. [11:20:00]
 
HOLMES (voice over): Trump making the long anticipated announcement in the wake of election losses from several of his endorsed candidates.
 
TRUMP: Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better and frankly, much of this blame is correct. But the 
 
 citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through. And the total effect of the 
 
 suffering is just starting to take hold. They don't quite feel it yet, but they will very soon.
 
HOLMES (voice over): Given the GOP midterm losses, some Republicans are weary of another Trump presidential bid. It is widely expected he'll face 
 
 primary challengers. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is seen as one possible contender to challenge the former president.
 
RON DESANTIS, FLORIDA GOVERNOR: But just tell people to go check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night. It was a hugely underwhelming 
 
 disappointing performance.
 
HOLMES (voice over): Another potential contender is his former Vice President Mike Pence.
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: And I think will have better choices in the future.
 
HOLMES (voice over): President Biden who has yet to announce whether he will seek re-election, tweeted after the announcement, "Donald Trump failed 
 
 America".
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I believe I can beat Donald Trump again.
 
HOLMES (voice over): Trump's desire to announce his campaign early coming after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisors say further emboldened 
 
 his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. Trump is the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and federal 
 
 investigations, including his possible involvement in the January 6 Capital attack. Trump is fighting a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee 
 
 investigating January 6, over providing documents and testimony to the committee.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Thanks to Kristen Holmes for that report. And CNN's Gabby Orr joins us now from Washington. Gabby, good to see you! Give us a sense of 
 
 the take on the president's 2024 announcement last night because the commentators I've heard today, mostly describing it as pretty lackluster.
 
GABBY ORR, CNN REPORTER: That's right. He was in a crowded room at his Mar- a-Lago resort in Florida speaking to former aide's current aides, allies, advisors, members of the Republican National Committee and yet the speech 
 
 that he delivered last night was both dark but also subdued for the former president.
 
This is a man who has thrived on rallies surrounded by thousands of people has cast himself as very high energy. But he delivered remarks last night 
 
 that were lackluster in comparison to many of the speeches that he has given before including his announcement speech of his 2016 presidential 
 
 campaign.
 
Now, Trump is entering this race early before any other declared 2024 presidential hopeful on the Republican side, hoping that his early entry 
 
 will actually prevent other rivals from tossing their hats into the ring. He is also hoping that this will help him navigate the numerous 
 
 investigations if he is facing an illegal jeopardy that increases now that we have past the midterm period where Justice Department officials 
 
 typically will hold off on indicting anybody who is under investigation.
 
Of course, this announcement coming from Trump last night is historical for many reasons. First of all, no president except for global Cleveland in the 
 
 19 century has actually served two non-consecutive terms. So this is really unprecedented for him to enter the field hoping to secure that second term 
 
 after leaving office two years ago.
 
Now, there was also the historical context surrounding who Donald Trump is when he was in office, a twice impeached former president who left under 
 
 the infamous claims that he made about the 2020 election being stolen a legitimate outcome that he claimed repeatedly during the 2020 suit to cycle 
 
 was illegitimate.
 
And of course, the January 6 riot that occurred at the U.S. Capitol that he helped to incite, so he does enter this field facing possibly untold 
 
 obstacles to the Republican presidential nomination. And we will see in the months to come just how many rivals will enter and launch primary 
 
 challenges against the former president.
 
KINKADE: Visit two years ahead, Gabby Orr, good to have you with us. Thanks so much.
 
ORR: Thank you.
 
KINKADE: Well, a quick programming note CNN will close to Town Hall with former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence tonight. He'll take questions from 
 
 our Jake Tapper and a live studio audience. That's at 9 p.m. in New York 10 a.m. Thursday in Hong Kong.
 
Well still ahead an accident, not an attack. That's the initial assessment about the missile that led to Tuesday in Poland. We'll go live to Warsaw 
 
 and Washington. Also we will take you into Amazon to see how a change in the Brazilian leadership is impacting efforts to protect the rainforest.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:25:00]
 
KINKADE: Welcome back. I'm Lynda Kinkade; you're watching "Connect the World", more on our top story now. And Poland's president says is no 
 
 indication that there was an intentional attack on his country. The Polish Prime Minister says Tuesday's explosion was probably caused by the shooting 
 
 down of a Russian missile.
 
Two people were killed in a small Polish village near the Ukrainian border. Russia denies responsibility. NATO Secretary General says the incident 
 
 demonstrates that the war is continuing to create dangerous situations. Let's see how things are playing out in Washington where intelligence and 
 
 what caused the missile incident is being analyzed.
 
Alex Marquardt joins us now. And Alex, U.S. President Biden was quick to say that it didn't appear that this missile had come from Russia. Was that 
 
 based on U.S. intelligence? What are you learning?
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: It was certainly based on U.S. intelligence. And it was based on conversations that he had 
 
 with allies. There's no daylight Lynda between the United States, NATO and Poland, all of which are, of course, Poland, U.S., of course, are members 
 
 of NATO. But Poland is of course leading this investigation.
 
And the consensus is coalescing around the fact that this was most likely an errant Ukrainian air defense missile that was trying to defend Ukraine 
 
 yesterday during a monstrous barrage of Russian missiles all across the country. Now, the initial American assessments say that this missile that 
 
 landed in Poland, most likely did come from Ukraine, it was fired from Ukrainian territory.
 
President Biden, of course, for the last few days, has been in Indonesia at the G20 Summit in Bali. And after this incident yesterday, he convened an 
 
 emergency meeting with allies and afterwards spoke with reporters and said that G7 and NATO allies are in total unanimity that they need to find out 
 
 exactly what happened.
 
But he said that it was unlikely that this missile originated in Russia. So they're continuing to of course, try to get specifics and figure out 
 
 exactly what happened. But they are all coming to an agreement essentially that this was most likely an accident. Lynda, we've also been told that the 
 
 Ukrainian military told the U.S. and other allies that in the same timeframe and near the border with Poland that they did try to intercept a 
 
 Russian missile. It is unclear whether that missile that they fired to intercept the Russian missile is the same one that landed in Poland. 
 
 [11:30:00]
 
MARQUARDT: But we have to remember that this is of course, as I just mentioned, against the backdrop of this incredible day in Ukraine, where 
 
 Russian missiles were targeting cities and civilian and energy infrastructure all across the country. So no one is blaming Ukraine for 
 
 this.
 
In fact, the NATO Secretary General, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO is saying that it really is simply Russia that bears responsibility, even if this was 
 
 a Ukrainian missile that landed in Poland, Lynda?
 
KINKADE: Yes, exactly. The NATO Secretary General, as you're pointing out, blaming Russia saying this would not have happened; Ukraine would not be 
 
 defending itself if Russia hadn't fired that barrage of missiles. And the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is agreeing saying that the Ukraine has 
 
 the right to protect itself in terms of other defense weapons systems, what's on the table? Because certainly Ukraine one better systems to 
 
 protect against these sort of attacks.
 
MARQUARDT: Well, it's a great question, because as you know, well, Ukraine has continued to push for bigger, more and more sophisticated weapons to 
 
 fight both offensively against the Russian forces, but also to defend it. And this explosion this missile landing in Poland came as the Ukraine 
 
 defense contact group was about to meet that meeting taking place today.
 
We heard earlier from Secretary Lloyd Austin at the outset of that meeting. And we also heard the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg saying that 
 
 this incident certainly highlights the need for NATO allies, Western allies to provide Ukraine with more air defense systems.
 
Now, the indications are right now that this was a Russian produced missile that almost certainly was being used by Ukraine to defend itself. Of 
 
 course, they have Old Russian and, and Soviet weaponry, little by little, they are getting more Western air defense systems.
 
And this will certainly highlight the fact that more of those are needed in order to better defend themselves and to prevent incidents like this from 
 
 happening. You can certainly imagine, Lynda, that Ukraine is going to use this incident to highlight that, and that there will almost certainly be a 
 
 response from European countries as well as the U.S. to try to get those systems to Ukraine as quickly as possible, Lynda?
 
KINKADE: Yes, and that is key that weapon defense system right now. But also, any movement on what other countries the West is doing to push ahead 
 
 with these peace talks, we did see the Ukrainian president speaking to the G20 annotate - saying outline this 10 point peace plan. What else is being 
 
 done to move put push that ahead, because certainly no one else wants to see an escalation in this war.
 
MARQUARDT: Well, we heard from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, who the most senior U.S. military official says a few 
 
 days ago that the window is opening for diplomatic talks. He appears to have been ahead of the Biden Administration.
 
The Biden Administration position right now is not that they want the Ukrainians to sit down with the Russians and negotiate. What the U.S. wants 
 
 to see from President Zelenskyy in Kyiv is a willingness to eventually come to the table and negotiate.
 
Everyone acknowledges that at some point, this war will end through diplomacy but the U.S. is being very careful to say we don't want Ukraine 
 
 to negotiate. Now we just want them to be open to at some point negotiating what they call a just peace, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Alex Marquardt joining us from Washington, DC, good to have you with us. Thank you. Well, I want to bring in Michal Sznajder, a reporter 
 
 and senior anchor for TV and 24 in Poland. He joins us now from Warsaw, good to have you with us.
 
So initially, it was thought that this could be an attack by Russia on Poland. It now appears that this was a Russian missile, fired by Ukraine as 
 
 part of its anti-missile defense system. So despite the fact it may not have come from Russia, it still has taken Russia's war in Ukraine across 
 
 the border killing two people in Poland. Just give us a sense of the feeling there.
 
MICHAL SZNAJDER, REPORTER &amp; SENIOR ANCHOR, TVN24: Well, good afternoon, and first of all, thank you very much for having me. Arguably, I would say that 
 
 the atmosphere is something that could be called bitter relief, relief, because as you said, there was this threat.
 
There was this concern that this was a premeditated escalation by Russia, or perhaps some sort of tragic mistake something along the lines of what 
 
 happened with the civilian airplane in 2014 when pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine killed almost 300 people. So everything right now points to 
 
 the fact that this was not in fact a deliberate action by Russia.
 <br>[11:35:00]
 
SZNAJDER: But the bitterness does come from the fact that this does remind us of the fact that this war is happening so close to home that two people, 
 
 two innocent civilians have been killed. And in fact, that rocket fell on Polish soil. So that is something that people were very concerned with 
 
 yesterday.
 
And I will say that yesterday when the news was coming in, there was this sense of not panic, not war, mongering, war mongering, but something that I 
 
 would call being puzzled what's going on. There had been posts on social media, people were seeing the pictures, they were seeing that something 
 
 potentially very dangerous had happened.
 
Also, we were learning that there was a very high level security meeting taking place in Warsaw at the National Security Bureau. So people did the 
 
 Polish public did have to wait for a few hours to learn what was the reason for that meeting, people were connecting the dots they were concerned. And 
 
 now we are finding out that most likely this was a result of a tragic, tragic coincidence.
 
KINKADE: And initially, of course, we were reporting that Poland's president was considering triggering that NATO article for to prompt NATO 
 
 members to have some sort of security response. I assume that is now completely off the table.
 
SZNAJDER: Well, it does seem that right now, the focus has shifted to finding out what happened and why? why was it so that as the Polish 
 
 government is claiming, why did something from Ukraine fall on Polish territory, but something that needs to be said, my assessment is that the 
 
 prevailing right now sentiment is that Russia is to blame.
 
That is the most common opinion in Poland that even, even, even if this was a result of Ukraine, defending their own territory, we all remember what 
 
 happened yesterday. It was an astonishing attack; perhaps arguably the biggest since this criminal invasion began. So Ukraine was defending 
 
 itself. And what we have seen was Ukraine defending its territory from Russia. So Russia is being widely seen as the culprit here.
 
KINKADE: So an investigation is underway right now, just take us through who's involved in that investigation and the next steps?
 
SZNAJDER: Well, right now, what we are hearing from both the Polish president and the Polish prime minister and also from American sources are 
 
 that this will be something of a joint investigation with Polish and American experts co-operating. Also, we are hearing that high level, 
 
 officials from Ukraine are willing to also participate.
 
But as the Polish president Andrzej Duda said that would require an agreement from also the other participants being the United States and 
 
 Poland, one that can get the sense that Poland is feeling the need to find out to get to the bottom of this why this happened. And how can this are 
 
 prevented in the future?
 
In fact, just some 30 minutes or so perhaps a little more, the Polish prime minister in the building of the Polish parliament has said that we do hope 
 
 that such a tragedy will not happen again. And my sense is that that is the priority right now to make sure that does not in fact, happen again.
 
KINKADE: Yes, that certainly is key prevention. Michal Sznajder, good to have you with us. Thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate your time.
 
SZNAJDER: Thank you.
 
KINKADE: Well, the U.S. and China have agreed to restart talks on climate change. John Kerry, the U.S. Climate Envoy says he has resumed talks with 
 
 his Chinese counterparts at the COP27 Climate Summit in Egypt.
 
Negotiations between the U.S. and China the world's two biggest polluters are key to any agreement at COP27. Negotiators they're trying to hammer out 
 
 a new global climate deal before the summit ends on Friday. And just a short time ago, Brazil's President Elect took center stage at the Climate 
 
 Summit.
 
Lula da Silva says he wants Brazil to host the 2025 edition of the event, and he hopes to stage it in the Amazon rainforest so that everyone can see 
 
 just how important it is to preserving that rainforest for the planet. Lulu says fighting climate change will be his top priority as president and 
 
 added the global warming is a crisis that affects us all.
 
Well still to come on "Connect the World" regular viewers of this show will know that this year CNN has partnered with Dubai globe soccer awards to 
 
 launch the off the pitch prize. Find out who won next.

KINKADE: Well, we are keeping an eye on the big football warm up in Abu Dhabi before the Qatar World Cup kicks off this Sunday. The United Arab 
 
 Emirates are facing Argentina is Leanna Massey starts in a friendly in the UAE's capital.
 
The Argentine squad is among the favorites to win the World Cup and the clash is underway. The UAE and full blue are up against one of the best 
 
 players in the world and messy in the second half Argentina is leading for Mill. While the region has certainly caught football fever on Thursday, the 
 
 globe soccer awards are happening in Dubai celebrating the best the game has to offer.
 
And this year we've partnered with the awards to launch the CNN off the pitch prize acknowledging the work of players away from the field. And I'm 
 
 pleased to announce this year's winner of the prize is Ivorian footballer Didier Drogba. My colleague Becky Anderson explains why he is so deserving 
 
 of the CNN off the pitch award.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is Didier Drogba in his element, welcomed by hordes of adoring fans wherever he goes in his 
 
 native Ivory Coast. He's no stranger to glory nights, league title celebrations European Cups on the lights and playing for his country on the 
 
 biggest stage of all.
 
But in his retirement, the former Chelsea striker is giving back to his community and the African continent. Founded in 2007 his foundation has 
 
 brought electricity to schools has built health centers and donated to orphanages.
 
Recognizing those achievements, Drogba is the inaugural recipients of the CNN off the pitch prize in partnership with the Dubai globe soccer awards, 
 
 and I managed to catch him in Abidjan to virtually give him his trophy.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Congratulations Didier, it is my pleasure to present you with this beautiful award. And believe me it is extremely heavy. So I 
 
 am quite happy that I'm not having to pick it up. It is though, all yours.
 
DIDIER DROGBA, WINNER OF CNN OFF THE PITCH AWARD: Thank you so much. Really I would like to thank globe soccer award in Dubai and CNN for giving me 
 
 this award. It means a lot to me and to the people working at the Foundation. We are working really, really hard to build schools, provide 
 
 books, access to computers, mobile clinics that travel out to the villages to give people access to health care.
 
And we could give them opportunities to go out and shine in the world with the basics and do great things. Every time we get support it's the people, 
 
 kids, woman who benefit the most so I'm really proud of it. And thank you for giving me this platform to talk about the foundation.
 <br>[11:45:00]
 
ANDERSON (on camera): Explain to us why you believe it is so important for footballers to speak out, to get involved in the sort of work that you are 
 
 doing and what inspired you to start this?
 
DROGBA: I mean I've been brought up in a family where living together is something normal. So I will live, I would be living with my cousins with my 
 
 aunts, my, my uncles, everybody in the same compound and we will, we'll be happy and everything you have, you have to share with.
 
Obviously, me playing with the national team and getting all the love and the support from Ivorians and from Africans, I think if I managed to have 
 
 such a good career, it's also because of their support.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Away from his foundation Drogba is a World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador, promoting the value of sport for 
 
 youngsters and teaching how to keep safe from diseases such as COVID-19.
 
DROGBA: Enjoy being healthy, appreciate being healthy. And for that you need to practice.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): The Head of the W.H.O. described the 44 year old as a, "Proven game changer both on and off the pitch. And who can disagree 
 
 with that".
 
DROGBA: I believe movement is life. So the more you move, the more you're active, the more you're healthy and the more you are healthy, the longer 
 
 you can live. And we've seen it during this pandemic, where COVID has killed a lot of people.
 
And the pandemic has been really, really difficult for people who are not really active to share a message to people to stay active to be more active 
 
 to boost their immune system.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): I want to understand a little bit more about what motivated you to be an advocate for public health in Africa?
 
DROGBA: I believe that the health system is improving, could be better. I think people like me and others who can have an impact on the continent. We 
 
 need to do good things and we need to help our people to push towards development. And there is no development if there is no health, there is no 
 
 development if there is no peace, there's no development, there's no education.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): Even during his career, Drogba used his influence to impact society. During the first Ivorian civil war, he played an 
 
 extraordinary role in encouraging a ceasefire, a famous televised speech after again, where he and his teammates ask for unity, a profound moment 
 
 for our country tired of war.
 
DROGBA: I just felt, again for my own happiness because my country was at war. And it really saddened me to see that from far away. I just took my 
 
 responsibilities and spoke out loud, maybe what millions; millions of people in Ivory Coast were feeling. And I think it worked out well because 
 
 this message went on the TV news for lunch and at night.
 
Every day for six months, we managed to get a ceasefire. So that's the impact a message like this one from a football player can achieve.
 
ANDERSON (on camera): So Didier Drogba is not seeking political office. Is that what you're telling me?
 
DROGBA: Not at all. Not at all, wanting to help people straight away they see you as someone having ambitions political ambitions. That's not the 
 
 case. For me the most important thing I want to live in Ivory Coast, I would have been very happy to go back and finish my career in Africa, for 
 
 example.
 
And this has nothing to do with politics. It's just I want a healthy continent. I want a place where Africans can go abroad play and come back 
 
 to their countries and enjoy another good life. That's all I want.
 
ANDERSON (voice over): So no political ambition just yet. But that hasn't stopped the Ivorian doing all he can to affect change. And the name 
 
 continues to echo through the streets of Abidjan. Didier Drogba, a brilliant footballer on the pitch and a remarkable human of it. Becky 
 
 Anderson, CNN, Dubai.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
KINKADE: Thanks to Becky, congratulations. Well, a new chapter in human lunar exploration after a successful rocket launch to the moon, we'll have 
 
 that story when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:50:00]
 
KINKADE: And historic mission to the moon blasted off early Wednesday morning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three, two, one, boosters and ignition and liftoff of Artemis 1.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
KINKADE: Well the Artemis 1 rocket finally launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 1.47 a.m. local time, the unmanned test fly will 
 
 travel around the moon before returning to Earth in 25 and a half days.
 
And this is the start of NASA's eventual plan to return astronauts to the moon. Well, CNN Correspondent Tom Foreman joins me now from Washington, 
 
 good to see you. So that launch is finally happening in the middle of the night, certainly a lot of relief.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, yes, unbelievable. And think about the amount of power being expended here. Just one of those engines, there are 
 
 four clusters underneath that just one of them generates enough energy for 1.3 million kilometers of street lights. That's an idea of how much power 
 
 is involved with these things.
 
And they're lifting a tremendously huge rocket. This is the most powerful rocket ever more powerful than the Saturn V rockets back from the old 
 
 Apollo missions many years ago, which were the benchmark for powerful rockets. Here's the thing, why are they so powerful if you think about it, 
 
 you could actually launch a rocket to the moon with a lot less power.
 
The reason they are so powerful is because this spacecraft has the capability of carrying 50 tons of payload to the moon, 50 tons. That's like 
 
 two dozen cars that it can carry. So you have an idea of how much energy they have to put behind it to get it up there, get it into space, it's 
 
 accelerating to roughly 18,000 miles an hour in a matter of minutes.
 
And then when it comes back, it'll come back in at about 24,000 miles an hour, not the whole craft, just the main pot up there. And of course, we'll 
 
 have to heat shields to ease it back down to earth. But this is a very big moment they build toward it a long time.
 
And the power of this spacecraft is something we have never seen before on this earth. And I will point out one more things, when you launch a 
 
 spacecraft of this power, it is burning fuel so quickly, accelerating so quickly, changing atmosphere changing temperature so quickly.
 
It is effectively becoming a different vehicle every few seconds to adapt to all of those things, a remarkable, remarkable technology here, Lynda.
 
KINKADE: Incredible and just amazing that it took off after being impacted by a couple of hurricanes, the most recent one thing, hurricane the call. 
 
 But this of course is the first stage right, there's going to be an Artemis 2, there's going to be an Artemis 3, where eventually, NASA will put humans 
 
 back on the moon.
 
FOREMAN: That's the goal here, right now as we're speaking; they have mannequins that are floating inside the spacecraft that are taking all 
 
 sorts of readings up there to give them an idea of what it will be like for the four person crew. Next time they take off, they hope to take a four 
 
 person crew up there to circle around the moon like this.
 
This will come within about 60 miles of the lunar surface. And then after that, they hope to have one that will land on the moon. Now to do that 
 
 they're going to have to connect with a different spacecraft, the starship is being made by SpaceX to actually land on the moon with human beings.
 
And they're hoping to take for the first time a woman astronaut to the moon and they hope for the first time to have someone of color step on the moon. 
 
 Remember it's been 50 years since humankind has walked on the lunar surface.
 <br>[11:55:00]
 
FOREMAN: United States is the only country that has ever done that and hoping to do it again. So many fraud things to think about here Lynda 
 
 though, you have to remember this is engineering at its extreme. But the great part about that is when you engineer at the extreme in space, high 
 
 speed, high temperature, Deep Ocean, that's what produces extraordinary technology that we use all the time.
 
You know the reason your phone is small, your phone is small because things in space have to be small because they have to be light, so it developed 
 
 technologies that all of us use, all the time. That's what you'll get out of Artemis even if you aren't care about the moon.
 
KINKADE: Well, my girl certainly care about the moon, they want to go to the moon one day. So we'll be watching on "First Move".
 
FOREMAN: So does my daughter.
 
KINKADE: Excellent.
 
FOREMAN: My daughter is an aerospace engineer, she helps to get there. So we'll see.
 
KINKADE: Amazing, amazing. Tom thanks so much, good to see you as always.
 
FOREMAN: Thank you. Hope to see you again.
 
KINKADE: And thanks so much for joining us today. That was "Connect the World". I am Lynda Kinkade, thanks for joining me. Stick around, my friend 
 
 and colleague Zain Asher is up next.
