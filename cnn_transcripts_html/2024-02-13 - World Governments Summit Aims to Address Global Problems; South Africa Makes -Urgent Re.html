BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST (voice-over):  Well, this hour we are here in Dubai for what is the World Governments Summit, where global power brokers 
 
 have gathered to discuss the future of our planet. We will be bringing you some of their discussions on everything from sustainability to artificial 
 
 intelligence. 
 
All important stuff. First up, though, your headlines this hour. 
 
The city of Rafah bracing for what could be a devastating Israeli ground offensive for the people sheltered there, which U.S. President Joe Biden 
 
 has expressed concern about. 
 
And just in the last hour, South Africa has made what is described as an urgent request to the International Court of Justice on the matter. 
 
Meantime, the CIA director, the U.S. CIA director, is in Cairo right now. Bill Burns is there, meeting the head of Israel's intelligence agency, 
 
 Mossad, as hostage negotiations are ongoing as we are told. 
 
Well, the U.S. Senate has passed a $95 billion foreign aid package with funding for Ukraine and Israel and setting up a showdown with the House. 
 
 More on that coming up. 
 
And all eyes were on the Super Bowl this weekend, 123 million U.S. viewers tuned in, the second most watched TV program in the country's history. 
 
What did it follow?
 
Well, the only TV program to get more was the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing. 
 
(MUSIC PLAYING)
 
ANDERSON:  Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD, 7:00 pm here in Dubai, where we are at World Governments Summit. Gathered here, world 
 
 leaders and members of governments from around the world focused on a number of issues. 
 
Not least, global development conflict is at the heart of the discussion, with two wars in Israel and Ukraine. and refocusing much needed funds here 
 
 at WGS, as it's known locally. It's an opportunity to reassess the issues around some of the other challenges we are facing, some of those even being 
 
 existential. 
 
But we start tonight in Cairo, where right now the director of the CIA is meeting with the head of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Onside, 
 
 Qatar's prime minister and Egyptian official. 
 
They are they're discussing the potential to get a hostage deal and a truce deal. Earlier, a Hamas official told CNN that if today's talks have 
 
 developments, it could send its own delegation to Cairo after these talks. 
 
Meantime, South Africa is making an urgent request to the International Court of Justice as Israel eyes up Gaza's southern city of Rafah for its 
 
 next ground offensive; 1.3 million Palestinians are now hemmed into that area. 
 
U.S. President Joe Biden says, Israel should not proceed without a credible plan to protect civilians. Nada Bashir is live for us in Cairo tonight. 
 
 David McKenzie is in Johannesburg with the latest on the urgent request south Africa has made to the International Court of Justice. 
 
And that is where we'll start, David, with you, if we can.
 
What more do we know about this request? 
 
As we understand, there is this backdrop to the potential for an enormous assault on Rafah at this point. Could be brinkmanship by Israel as these 
 
 negotiations on hostages and a truce are ongoing but we don't know that at this point. 
 
What do we know?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the South Africans, Becky, just a short time ago announcing that they had lodged this 
 
 urgent request to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
 
That request went in on Monday. They say they are calling on the court to see whether they need to put additional what they call emergency measures 
 
 in light of this proposed or possible assault, ground assault onto the highly densely populated section of Rafah. 
 <br>[10:05:06]
 
Now the South Africans saying through that statement that they are gravely concerned. You'll recall, just late last month, the ICJ did provisional 
 
 rulings, a restraining order as it were, saying that Israel needs to do everything it can to avoid mass civilian casualties. 
 
In particular, to avoid any push or any type of warfare that might amount to genocidal action. That court did not rule on whether Israel had 
 
 committed any kind of genocide. That is what South African lawyers were alleging. 
 
But it did rule on the urgency of the matter to try and scale back the civilian deaths and calling on Israel to ramp up its humanitarian support. 
 
This latest sign, whether it's brinkmanship or not from the Israelis, certainly South Africa appears to be taking the leadership of Israel at its 
 
 word. And they put this urgent request to the court. 
 
Now this could come in the form of a message from the judge, from the judges, to warn Israel that they might further harm their case that will be 
 
 investigated over many months on this issue. It is a significant move by the South Africans. It does show that they are committed to staying the 
 
 course on this issue. 
 
Israel, of course, for its part, has repeatedly denied, Becky, that it had any kind of war crime or genocide, in the words of the South African 
 
 lawyers, during its campaign. And they point to the hostages that remain under hostage by Hamas, something even the South Africans, of course, have 
 
 called for their release. 
 
ANDERSON:  As we understand it, more than 130 at this point, David, thank you for that. 
 
Nada, let's bring you in there. Let's talk about what we understand to be going on in Cairo. There is an Israeli delegation of intelligence 
 
 officials. The U.S. CIA chief Bill Burns, the Qatari, all meeting Egyptian officials and intelligence assets in Cairo. 
 
The effort here clearly to try and effect some sort of progress on a deal to get those hostages released and to avoid, one assumes, a full-on assault 
 
 of Rafah at this point through what could be, if these talks are successful, a truce. We know these talks have started. 
 
What more do we know at this point? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, look, we have heard now from Hamas saying, according to one official speaking to CNN, that if those talks 
 
 result in some sort of progress, they may well send their own delegation. 
 
Of course, this off between the CIA chief of the country, prime minister, Egyptian intelligence officials and, of course, the head of the Israeli 
 
 intelligence agency comes less than a week after a senior Hamas delegation also came to Cairo for talks with Egyptian intelligence officials. 
 
We have seen these back-and-forth diplomatic efforts behind in the scenes, trying to come to some sort of agreement. This of course, all after the 
 
 Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, dismissed a counter proposal for a prolonged (INAUDIBLE) put forward by Hamas. 
 
The focus, as you mentioned, Becky, on trying to secure some sort of prolonged pause in fighting to allow for a gradual release of hostages as 
 
 well as a withdrawal of Israeli troops. That is what Hamas wants to see. In exchange the hostages would be released for Palestinian prisoners. 
 
Now there hasn't been any firm agreement, of course, at this stage, no commitment from either side as we understand it. We heard yesterday from 
 
 U.S. President Joe Biden, the key elements for this framework are on the table but there are still some gaps. 
 
Previously, the U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken saying that in Hamas; counterproposal, there were some nonstarters. So we do know that 
 
 there is intense discussions going on behind the scenes back and forth if you like, between those parties involved in the immediate negotiations.
 
But also (INAUDIBLE) international and regional allies as well, who are deeply concerned about the regional ramifications of an escalation. But of 
 
 course, all eyes very much focused on what is happening in Rafah. 
 
The potential for a ground incursion by the Israeli military. Hamas has already been clear if there is a ground operation launched by the Israeli 
 
 military, that would jeopardize any sorts of negotiations that are ongoing. 
 
So of course, there is real concern there. But as we have seen, airstrikes are continuing as we continue to hear those warnings of a looming offensive 
 
 on the ground. And a warning to our viewers, some of the footage in this report of the aftermath of those airstrikes is distressing. 
 <br>[10:10:02]
 
Take a look.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR (voice-over):  Yet another distraught Palestinian mother, her hands and face bloodied, her injured daughter limp, carried out of the car. 
 
 Around them, more casualties arrive, badly wounded. Some of the youngest in a state of shock. The horror that they have faced will be hard to move 
 
 past. 
 
"We were at home when the airstrikes began," this young girl says. "I told my mother that I wanted to use the bathroom, then suddenly all the walls of 
 
 the bathroom and all the water containers above us collapsed on me." 
 
This was the scene overnight. A terrifying series of airstrikes by the Israeli military on a city where some 1.5 million people are now 
 
 concentrated. The target, said to be Hamas, part of an operation to secure the release of two Israeli hostages. 
 
But as dawn breaks on the southern border city, it's clear that the aftermath is yet again one of sheer tragedy. Bullet holes ripped through 
 
 the thin plastic of this tent. Inside, the bodies of displaced civilians, killed while they were sleeping.
 
"We were asleep and then suddenly we heard the sound of missiles falling around us," Haisa (ph) says. "We could hear the gunfire, the destruction." 
 
According to the Palestine Red Crescent, at least 100 people were killed overnight. But that figure is expected to rise, with many still believed to 
 
 be buried beneath the rubble. At least a dozen residential buildings are said to have been targeted, according to local officials.
 
"We're civilians. We're not part of the resistance. We haven't taken up arms," this man says. "Look around here. Everybody here worked on the land. 
 
 We're civilians, not fighters." 
 
Eyewitnesses tell CNN that Israeli helicopters fired machine guns around the border area. A foreboding warning of what could lie ahead for this 
 
 city, with Israel now threatening to launch a ground offensive on Rafah. 
 
"We were first displaced to Khan Yunis, where we had many difficult nights," Nasser (ph) says. "Then we came to the Egyptian border, to Rafah. 
 
 We can't be displaced anymore." 
 
The Israeli military has been directed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prepare for a mass evacuation of civilians from Rafah, drawing criticism 
 
 from many in the international community.
 
The U.N. human rights chief warned on Monday that any ground operations could lead to, quote, "further atrocity crimes by Israel," with nowhere 
 
 safe for civilians to flee to.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BASHIR:  Becky, what we have seen the last 24, 48 hours is civilians in Rafah now taking the decision to flee, to evacuate and move back north. 
 
 They are moving to central Gaza, an area that is almost entirely destroyed and still facing aerial bombardment. 
 
Many have said to our teams on the ground in Rafah that they are afraid of what is to come for the city and would rather move back than to wait there. 
 
ANDERSON:  Nada Bashir on the ground in Cairo in Egypt. 
 
Gaza, then spiraling further into a humanitarian crisis. A seeming freefall into famine at this point but also falling away is desperately needed aid. 
 
The UNRWA organization says its major donors have withheld hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funds since those allegations by Israel that 
 
 13 members of staff were involved in the attacks on October 7th. 
 
The joint statement by my next guest and others says, quote, "Withdrawing funds from [the agency] is perilous ... with far-reaching humanitarian and 
 
 human rights consequences in the occupied Palestinian Territory and across the region." 
 
U.N. development program administrator Achim Steiner joins me now. 
 
You've said the current level of destruction in Gaza already amounts to a development crisis. You've called for a ceasefire. I was just looking back 
 
 to your original call. I think it was October the 13th; maybe it was October the 19th, calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and for the release 
 
 of hostages. 
 
As you listened to Nada's report -- and we consider the enormity of any threatened action by Israel -- what are you thinking? 
 
ACHIM STEINER, U.N. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR:  I'm thinking, first of all, what the secretary-general has repeatedly called for, which is 
 
 respect for international law, respect for international humanitarian law. 
 
The minute we began to have two different interpretations on what is right and what is wrong, I think the world no longer has anything to refer to. 
 <br>[10:15:02]
 
That's why the prosecutor of International Criminal Court this morning also said that further attacks are now taking place in Rafah. This could give 
 
 rise to charges on war crimes.
 
So I think we have to be extremely conscious of the fact that, while this is not an issue of legality, it is an issue of fundamental principle. What 
 
 is happening right now has, by virtue, all leaders across the world, already been called for not to take place. 
 
A further attack on people who are already in Rafah right now, I think, would be, on top of the humanitarian disaster, yet another catastrophe and 
 
 one that would give rise in the end to many legal claims in due course. 
 
But most of all, we also need to think about the impact that it is having on people right now. We are already faced with a humanitarian disaster, a 
 
 political crisis and, on top of that, a development crisis that will take decades to recover from. 
 
ANDERSON:  The agency charged with working for Palestinians and supporting Palestinians, UNRWA, has offered as one that it will have to halt its 
 
 operations by the end of this month. 
 
You've said that the pause in funds could have catastrophic consequences, not just for the people of Gaza but the more than 5 million people who are 
 
 supported on a daily basis across the region by the agency. Just explain the impact that this war is currently having. 
 
STEINER:  Imagine for a moment, for the 2.3 million people in Gaza, essentially, most hospitals have been destroyed. Health care systems no 
 
 longer function. Health care, even in a live setting sense, is extremely difficult to find. You saw the images just now. 
 
The entire education system has collapsed and imploded. Over 600,000 children unable to go to school. And on top of that, essentially match with 
 
 the infrastructure not working anymore, trying to get clean water, even adequate food. 
 
We are now talking in Gaza about a situation where it's no longer just malnutrition in some parts, it could be bordering on starvation. Part of 
 
 the difficulties that the U.N. cannot even reach all parts of Gaza right now.
 
So in whichever way we look at it, this situation continues to deteriorate. And I think when you look also at the challenge of trying to deliver 
 
 humanitarian support, we have heard from many agencies, whether its UNRWA, UNICEF, WFP, the Red Cross/Red Crescent, that access to Gaza is a 
 
 fundamental constraint. 
 
On top of that, Philippe Lazzarini, yesterday in Brussels, also in the presence of many of the development ministers of the European Union, also 
 
 indicated that the loss of safety for operations of U.N. staff in Gaza are now almost on the point of collapse, because the local police force is no 
 
 longer able to provide --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  The problem is, without any funding and funding that may run out by the end of the month, these conversations are going on in this sort of -
 
 - in a vacuum. Meantime, 1.3 million civilians, hemmed in down on the border, a border that Egypt threatens may close, should Israel, carrying 
 
 out its threat of a full-on military assault. 
 
Joe Biden has said, you need a plan before you can carry that out. He said, effectively, the U.S. does not support any full-on assault without a 
 
 constructed -- without a -- without a plan. Even the IDF have admitted there is no plan at present -- or certainly they haven't they haven't 
 
 presented one to Israeli officials. 
 
I just wonder, you're in the business of supporting individuals. UNDP's work is about ensuring that people have a reasonable existence. 
 
Are we ultimately failing the people of Gaza at this point? 
 
STEINER:  I think catastrophically so. There is no other way of describing the fact that we are now months into a war that has killed already well 
 
 over 26,000, maybe 27,000 people, most in women and children. 
 
ANDERSON:  We've failed all of those who've lost their lives. We failed all of those who have been injured. We failed all of those who are -- you know 
 
 -- We don't even know where they are, a lot of these people, something like 9,000 people. 
 
What -- how do we -- how do we move the needle on this? 
 
STEINER:  I think where we are right now is essentially at the moment, where I think both Israel and the international community must decide 
 
 whether they return to the adherence to international law. And the respect for international humanitarian law become the guiding principles by which 
 
 actions on all sides are judged. 
 
And I think what we're seeing right now is an international community, I think, unified as we have not seen in the last few months, in appealing to 
 
 Israel not to proceed with this visit --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  Or is it the U.S. running out of patience?
 <br>[10:20:03]
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  Because the international community ran out of patience a long time ago.
 
STEINER:  Yes, but I think there are many, who were arguing at a certain point, that the right of Israel after the October 7th attacks and the 
 
 killings that took place there, had a right to defend itself. 
 
I think whether it is the foreign minister of Germany, whether it is the high representative of the European Union, who, yesterday, also at a press 
 
 conference in Brussels, again appealed for not taking this final step in terms of invading Rafah and attacking it. 
 
I think there is no question that there is a perception that a limit has been crossed in the minds of some. It will have been weeks ago in the minds 
 
 of somebody's, maybe tomorrow. 
 
The harsh fact, the harsh truth is that thousands have died. This conflict has not been resolved. 
 
And therefore, the urgency of at least saving those who are currently living under extraordinary conditions, including our own staff, who we are 
 
 not able to support, who are living in extraordinary conditions also as refugees and internally displaced people within Gaza. 
 
And yet our UNRWA colleagues still trying to deliver, under these circumstances, lifesaving aid. That's why my colleague, Philippe Lazzarini, 
 
 has also appealed that cutting off funding right now to UNRWA may be a tempting response to the allegations. And again, yesterday in Brussels at 
 
 the press conference, it was underlying. 
 
These are so for allegations, horrendous as they may seem, until this review and the investigations provide further evidence or Israel provides 
 
 further evidence. I think we need to recognize that there is an imperative to have UNRWA continue to provide the infrastructure for keeping people 
 
 literally alive in Gaza. 
 
ANDERSON:  It's good to have you. You and I've talked about a series of issues here today, not just Gaza but obviously front and center on this 
 
 show this hour. As you said, talks, continue, at least get underway in Cairo. And we will continue to monitor what's going on there as we continue 
 
 to monitor what is going down in Rafah. 
 
Thank you very much indeed for joining us.
 
Most eyes are on Gaza. There are also concerns about growing violence on the West Bank. France today announcing that it is banning 28, quote, 
 
 "extremist Israeli settlers," accused of committing violence against Palestinians yesterday. 
 
The U.K. said it was sanctioning four settlers. Israeli human rights activists say 2023 was the most violent year on record for settler attacks 
 
 in the West Bank. 
 
Well, as we have been reporting, hundreds of thousands, as many as 1 million Gazans are hungry. Some food and water is available. Much of it 
 
 can't get in. In our newsletter, "Meanwhile in the Middle East," we show you the obstacles that agencies are facing in delivering aid. 
 
The conversation that we have just been having and we look at how the situation is becoming more dire. Scan the QR code on your screen or log in

Humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza is part of the $95 billion foreign aid package passed by the U.S. Senate today. So is help for Ukraine 
 
 in the fight against Russia. But that aid package faces a major hurdle in the U.S. House. More on that is after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:25:00]
 
(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
ANDERSON:  Well, the U.S. Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid package that has funding for Ukraine and Israel. It comes after a long night of 
 
 speeches and debates ending in early morning. The funding package passed with bipartisan support, although many Republicans opposed further aid for 
 
 Ukraine. 
 
Now this sets up a showdown with the House, where its speaker, Mike Johnson, has already said that the Senate failed to meet the moment because 
 
 of a lack of border security issues or measures. 
 
Ukraine claims it has evidence that Russia fired an advanced hypersonic missile. Now if that's true, it's the first time that Moscow has used this 
 
 technology, which experts say is nearly impossible to shoot down. 
 
In a Telegram post, scientific experts in Ukraine claim that debris recovered after a February the 7th attack in Kyiv point to the use of a 
 
 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile by Russia's military. U.S. based experts say this missile and its hypersonic speed would be the fastest in the 
 
 world, making it nearly impossible to defend against. 
 
Europe also ramping up its support for Ukraine as Kyiv's military supplies run low and U.S. aid wavers. Russia's military power far outweighs 
 
 Ukraine's and Kyiv needs the West's help more than ever to overcome Moscow. 
 
CNN's Fred Pleitgen shows us how Europe and Germany, in particular, plans to boost its weapons production capabilities. Have a look at this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A German-made Leopard 2 tank hitting Russian positions on the eastern front. 
 
 This video provided by the 21st Mechanized Brigade, showing, they say, how effective Western weapons are on the battlefield. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Every infantry is scared of a tank. Tanks go out and work and they fire frightfully. They fire straight 
 
 into their faces and they don't even have time to think about what to do. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The Ukrainians say they need a lot more Western arms and ammo but Republicans have blocked U.S. military aid in Congress 
 
 and their likely nominee for president, Donald Trump, even suggested he might encourage Russia to attack NATO members who didn't meet military 
 
 spending guidelines. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (R):  I would not protect you. In fact, I would 
 
 encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Those comments literally have Europeans up in arms, now ramping up weapons production for Ukraine and for themselves. Germany's 
 
 chancellor visiting a major arms plant with Denmark's prime minister, trying to downplay Trump's comments 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR:  (INAUDIBLE) for the United States, for Canada, for European countries. And we cooperate so long since World War 
 
 II. And this is really something which is a good alliance for the future. We stick to it. The President of the United States sticks to it.
 
And I'm sure the American people will do so.
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But Denmark's prime minister says she has no illusions. U.S. support for European NATO members no longer seems certain. 
 
METTE FREDERIKSEN, PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK:  No matter what will happen in U.S. and this year, I think the conclusion has proven (ph) already now 
 
 that Europe needs to be stronger and we need to do -- we need to be able to do more on our own.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And ammo production is the biggest concern as NATO allies struggle to help Ukraine make up for massive shortfalls while facing 
 
 overwhelming Russian firepower. 
 
PLEITGEN:  This is one of the most important things for the Ukrainians to stay in the fight. They're not only outmanned; they're also outgunned. And 
 
 the biggest problem they have is a lack of ammunition. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  They broke ground for a new ammo plant here and the company's CEO says they will drastically increase ammo production quickly, 
 
 especially for artillery. 
 
ARMIN PAPPERGER, CEO, RHEINMETALL:  They need 1 million to 1.2 million. And if I give them 700,000, I think there are also some other producers in 
 
 Europe who have to give them something. So 700,000 is, at the moment, the maximum that we can produce. 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And the Ukrainians say they need the max their allies can give with or without the U.S. to keep their forces in the fight 
 
 against the Russians.

(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, here at the World Governments Summit. Fresh shift from the front 
 
 lines of Ukraine, where he visited the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. 
 
This is, of course, Europe's largest nuclear power plant and it has been in control of the Russians for well over a year now. The fighting around the 
 
 plant, along with trying to maintain its safely amid a full-scale war, of course, raised fears of a catastrophic nuclear incident. 
 
Well, I sat down with Grossi here in Dubai and asked him, on a scale of one to 10, how worried is he about the danger posed by the plant at this point? 
 
This is what he told me. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, IAEA:  You go to Zaporizhzhya on a sunny day and you believe that you are in a nuclear power plant here in 
 
 Baraka. Everything is apparently calm. 
 
But then the next hour, you can have a drone coming and attacking. So it is the uncertainty and the terrible fragility of war. I can be zero, I can be 
 
 10 within minutes. 
 
ANDERSON:  You're on your way at some point to Russia. 
 
What will your message be there?
 
GROSSI:  My message is cooperate with the IAEA. Remember that it's only working with us, avoiding a nuclear accident that we will all benefit, 
 
 because no one, whichever side of the conflict you are sitting, will benefit from a nuclear accident 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Grossi and I also talked about Iran after a recent report from the IAEA says Iran increased its production of highly enriched uranium. I 
 
 asked the director general how concerning this is, given the increased hostilities in the region. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GROSSI:  Well, of course, this is an accumulation of complexities, so because in a region in the current circumstance, to have a country that it 
 
 is presenting a face which is not entirely transparent when it comes to its nuclear activities, of course, this increases dangers. 
 
There is loose talk about nuclear weapons more and more, including in Iran recently --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  -- elsewhere. 
 
GROSSI:  -- high official said, in fact, we have everything. It's disassembled. Well, please let me know what do you have because you are an 
 
 NPT, non-proliferation treaty, party, so you're not supposed ever by your own decision to have nuclear weapons 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Rafael Grossi speaking to me earlier today, here in Dubai, at what is the World Governments Summit.
 
Now ahead on the show, come together to tackle one of the world's most pressing issues. That is what some of those here are doing. And we are 
 
 talking climate crisis. That's one of the top priorities for some of the global leaders here in Dubai. They've got a plan with a fancy name and a 
 
 big ambition. 
 
We will explain more on that up next. 
 
And how looking at problems from space can offer solutions on the ground. Multi-hour satellite imaging can play a role in solving some of the 
 
 planet's biggest issues. More on that, after this.

(MUSIC PLAYING) 
 
ANDERSON:  Some news just coming into CNN. There are talks ongoing now in Cairo, hostage and ceasefire talks, which Hamas is describing as entering a 
 
 critical 24 hour stretch. Let me just explain what we have in to CNN. 
 
Hamas considers the next 24 hours of the ongoing hostage and ceasefire talks underway as critical, as sources tell CNN that, despite some progress 
 
 in recent days, the negotiations there remain difficult. 
 
To quote Hamas, "the picture will become clearer within the next 24 hours." A source from Hamas tells CNN, adding, "there is clear and strong 
 
 determination among the mediators to reach ceasefire understandings and begin an exchange process to release prisoners from both sides and bring in 
 
 food supplies, medical and oil supplies." 
 
What we do know at this point is that the CIA director Bill Burns, along with the head of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence authority, and a 
 
 delegation from Israel meeting in Egypt with officials there and the Qatari prime minister, of course. 
 
Qatar and Egypt have been involved in mediating what are these indirect talks between Israel and Hamas supported by the Americans. 
 
And the efforts really stepping up here as Joe Biden voices real concern about not just the hostages but what is going on with the -- in Rafah, with 
 
 the threat of a full-on Israeli onslaught. There Israel suggesting that is the only way that they are going to get their hostages out. 
 
That's a very maximalist approach from the Israeli government. That hasn't started as of yet. Some will say that there may be some brinkmanship going 
 
 on here as far as Israel is concerned. 
 
But the Americans certainly have said, without a plan, don't go into Rafah. Joe Biden has also said, he is hoping that these talks ongoing in Cairo at 
 
 present might elicit a -- some six week truce alongside the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, which at least will provide 
 
 some short-term relief for civilians. 
 
In Gaza particularly, those now hemmed in at the border with Rafah. So more on that, of course, as we get it. And the conflict in Gaza, of course, has 
 
 been in the -- certainly cast a shadow over some of what is going on here at the World Governments Summit. 
 
And it has been an issue which has been discussed. Policymakers and global leaders meeting here to come up with -- solely to discuss some of the 
 
 world's most pressing issues, including that of Gaza, and on others to come up with innovative solutions to what are some of the world's biggest 
 
 challenges in this region.
 
High-level gatherings often circle back to Israel's war on Hamas. Guest of honor, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used his platform here in a 
 
 keynote speech to propose a solution. This was just hours ago. Have a listen.

RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator):  Every step taken will remain incomplete and the problem will remain unless an 
 
 independent sovereign and geographically integrated Palestinian state is established within the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Well, Erdogan's call for a long-term solution to this crisis is important here, because the World Governments Summit is focused on the big, 
 
 sometimes existential challenges and opportunities that unite us -- education, artificial intelligence, health to name just a few. 
 <br>[10:40:11]
 
And one of the key issues being discussed at this year's summit is building off progress made at the U.N. climate conference held in Dubai at the end 
 
 of last year. On Monday, the COP28 presidency announced the COP Presidency Troika. 
 
Its a platform to provide closer coordination across these COPs sees meetings off the back of the meeting here. COP29, of course, set to take 
 
 place in Azerbaijan; COP30 to be held in Brazil. 
 
And the idea is put more strength behind what's known as the roadmap to mission 1.5 degrees Celsius. There is a lot of work to be done following 
 
 what was an historic and unprecedented agreement made here, calling for the transition away from fossil fuels. 
 
That of course, was a first, that language in the closing communique from here. It was a challenging road to reach that agreement, not least bringing 
 
 some 200 countries with very different priorities, set together to find common ground. 
 
There was also plenty of noise ahead of the conference given the COP28 president also serves as the CEO of the UAE's national oil company. When I 
 
 sat down with Sultan Al Jaber, I asked him if he ever regretted taking on the role. This is what he told me. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SULTAN AL JABER, PRESIDENT, COP28:  I never regretted accepting the job to be very honest with you. I never regretted it --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  Really?
 
JABER:  No. I never regretted it. In fact, it was the challenge that through drove my motivation. It was the sheer size of the problem that we 
 
 have been entrusted with. And the fact that our leadership saw in me and my team the composition of a team that will help address this global 
 
 challenge. 
 
Was a great honor and I did not want to miss out on this opportunity of showing the world what a small country like the United Arab Emirates, a 
 
 young nation, like the UAE, can actually do as a true global citizen and helping address such a global challenge. 
 
We did not want to miss out on that opportunity.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Sultan Al Jaber here with me at the World Governments Summit. 
 
There are 16 at this year's summit, all centered around the future, sustainability and the next frontiers. And one company contributing to all 
 
 of those, all the way from space. 
 
Think of this, how do you predict a flood before it happens?
 
How do you monitor the health of coral reefs all over the world without setting foot in the water? 
 
How can being in space help you survive on Earth?
 
These are all questions at satellite imaging company, Planet. Labs are working to answer using their constellation of more than 200 satellites in 
 
 orbit. That is happening as we speak. Joining me we now here is Planet's chief impact officer, Andrew Zolli. 
 
It's good to have you. And we were talking before this interview. And I want to start with this. We've headlined this show, rightly so, with the 
 
 conflict in Gaza. It is being discussed here. 
 
Your organization in imaging so much data and analytics provide some real impact for humanitarian organizations and organizations like ours, media 
 
 organizations, looking at data investigative pieces in conflict zones. Just, just explain the work you've been doing. for example, across this 
 
 Gaza conflict. 
 
ANDREW ZOLLI, CHIEF IMPACT OFFICER, PLANET:  Well, it might be good -- first of all, its great to be on the show and great, great to be with you -
 
 - it might be useful just to explain what it is that we actually do. 
 
We operate the largest constellation of satellites that look at the Earth. If you can imagine the Earth spinning around, these are satellites that 
 
 spin from the North Pole, down over the equator, down over the South Pole.
 
As the Earth turns sideways underneath them, we line scan the planet every day. So every part, unless you are personally an astronaut or any of your 
 
 viewers are personally astronauts, every place you've ever been we're imaging every day. 
 
Now you can imagine how valuable that information is for all kinds of reasons, especially in humanitarian context. So we work with humanitarian 
 
 organizations and U.N. agencies, front line first responders in disaster contexts. 
 
And these satellites, we don't do anything particularly special to focus in one area; in other words, capturing the whole world every day. 
 
So we do take steps to make sure that front line media organizations like yours and all of the world's leading media organizations, that, that 
 
 humanitarian and human rights groups and all of the other kinds of organizations can have a common set of understandings about what's 
 
 happening on the planet. 
 <br>[10:45:06]
 
So that we can rush the scarce resource, which is humanitarian aid, or a first responder directly where it's needed. 
 
ANDERSON:  Last week -- I want to get on to climate but thank you. That work is particularly important and significant as we continue to monitor 
 
 what's going on in Gaza. 
 
Last week marked the world's first yearlong breach of the key 1.5 degree warming limit. And that spells out -- spells more natural disasters to come 
 
 conceivably.
 
How does your company's technology helped mitigate before, before that and address the very fact that this is going on? 
 
ZOLLI:  That's a great question. The first thing is that when we think about climate change, we talk about it as a single thing. We say climate 
 
 change. But really, if we're going to address climate change, sustainability and the biodiversity crisis, it's billions of little 
 
 decisions we have to make every day. 
 
And that many, many people have to make at the same time. So the one of the things we can do is use the satellites to make the invisible visible. For 
 
 instance, I'll just mention two things. 
 
We have a big program with a partner called Climate Trace. They're using satellite imagery to identify every major source of emissions on the Earth. 
 
 So we have one common sense of truth with our colleagues at Microsoft and The Nature Conservancy. 
 
We are mapping every single renewable energy resource on the planet. At COP28, a few months ago, the world signed up to say, we're going to triple 
 
 the amount of renewable energy. Well, we have to be able to have a dashboard that tells us if we're making progress and you can only see some 
 
 of those things from space. 
 
ANDERSON:  You use a metaphor that you are building a moral mirror in space. 
 
Tell what you mean by that. That sounds slightly lofty. Have to say. 
 
ZOLLI:  Yes, I appreciate that. 
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ZOLLI:  Let's unpack it. So satellite imagery, if we take any of the big problems in the world that we're confronting a climate crisis. We're 
 
 confronting a crisis in nature and our relationship to the natural world. 
 
And we're -- all of these crises in the international order -- one of the important subtexts of this discussion is about how do you governments 
 
 cooperate with each other to tackle these kinds of problems?
 
Now the important thing is that, when you're imaging the whole Earth every day, you see every disaster and disruption the day before it occurs. And 
 
 you continue to monitor it every day after. That creates a common set of truth for everyone to work from 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON:  How do you ensure that people's privacy is secure? 
 
ZOLLI:  Also a great question. The important thing is, we're not in the spy business. Our -- when we take a picture of the Earth, its about three 
 
 meters on a side, each pixel. So you and I could be sitting in one of those pixels and no one would know we were there. 
 
But what it does let us see is every tree crown, every road, every building. So you can imagine, for instance, like monitoring deforestation 
 
 in the Amazon, we can see every act of deforestation but, even more importantly, we can see the illegal roads that go in before the next act of 
 
 deforestation occurs. 
 
In fact, we work with a partner in Brazil to build a system that alerts the environmental police when they see that leading indicator. And they have 
 
 conducted literally dozens and dozens of raids, arresting deforestation, right before it's about to occur. 
 
ANDERSON:  Fascinating. Its good to have you. 
 
ZOLLI:  Pleasure. 
 
ANDERSON:  Sorry, we didn't have more time next time. 
 
ZOLLI:  Understand.
 
ANDERSON:  Next time.
 
ZOLLI:  Next. 
 
ANDERSON:  Some news just coming in, in a case involving presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Supreme Court indicating it plans to act 
 
 quickly after Trump asked justices to temporarily block a lower court's decision that denied him immunity for alleged crimes while he was 
 
 president. 
 
Now moments ago, chief justice John Roberts asked the special counsel for a response by next week. Whether the court takes up the case could be 
 
 absolutely the critical to whether Trump will be put on trial on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election while he seeks another term. More on 
 
 that, as we get it. 
 
Well, you're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Big stars, a close game and Taylor Swift all leading to a record setting Super Bowl. 
 
 Details of the most watched sporting event in U.S. history is coming up. 
 
Did you watch? 
 
Excellent. You were one of 123 million.

ANDERSON:  Well, for the second straight year, the Kansas City Chiefs are Super Bowl champions. And to the victors go to the spoils. The Chiefs' 
 
 plane was doused with a water salute after arriving home in Kansas City. 
 
The champs will get a victory parade in downtown Kansas City tomorrow. Well, a Super Bowl is by far the biggest annual sporting event in the 
 
 United States. It got even bigger this year, scoring record TV ratings. The Chiefs' victory over the San Francisco 49ers was watched by more than 123 
 
 million viewers in the U.S. That's the most for any TV program since he --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) bring him back, the main driver (ph) of Mahomes' career (INAUDIBLE) overtime. He is the best (INAUDIBLE) -- 
 
ANDERSON (voice-over):  Here's some reaction for you.
 
PATRICK MAHOMES, NFL STAR:  I still got a long way to go to get to seven but I mean, just enjoying it every single day. I mean, the adverse that we 
 
 battle with this season and the continue to grind and get to the Super Bowl championship again, back-to-back. And we'll see we can do next year. So I 
 
 will just continue to work by day by day and see where we get end up at. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON:  Mahomes there. Good stuff; 123 million U.S. viewers. TV still resonates, folks. We are back after a quick break. I'll have a glass of 
 
 water, don't go away.

ANDERSON:  Well, as global leaders here in Dubai focus on a whole range of issues -- AI, climate change -- we're hearing more evidence of why that is 
 
 such an urgent problem. Scientists say that, over the past three decades, Greenland has lost an area of ice 36 times the size of New York. 
 
The loss rapidly giving way to shrubs and wetlands or barren rock. That's a problem because that newly exposed land will absorb the sun's heat. Warmer 
 
 land temperatures could melt the permafrost, releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and creating what is a feedback loop, which adds more 
 
 fuel to global warming.
 
Something to be aware of. 
 
Well, that is it for CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Stay with CNN. "STATE OF THE RACE WITH KASIE HUNT" is up next.
