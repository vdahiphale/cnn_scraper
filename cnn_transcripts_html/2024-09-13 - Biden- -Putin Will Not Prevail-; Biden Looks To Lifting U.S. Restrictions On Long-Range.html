<br>[18:00:00]
 
PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: It's 7:00 a.m. in Seoul, 4:00 p.m. in San Salvador, and 6:00 p.m. right here in New York. I'm Paula Newton, in for 
 
 Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your "First Move."
 
And a very warm welcome to "First Move." Here's today's need to know. Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin will not prevail in Ukraine as he looks at 
 
 lifting U.S. restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range missiles.
 
CNN goes inside Gaza to the Philadelphi Corridor. A 14-kilometer piece of land that's crucial to ceasefire talks.
 
And atomic ambitions. Kim Jong Un is photographed apparently inspecting a nuclear facility.
 
And betting big. Gambling machine maker Light &amp; Wonder goes on a winning streak. We'll speak to its CEO, that conversation and plenty more coming 
 
 up.
 
But first, Putin will not prevail. The words of U.S. President Joe Biden in the last couple of hours as he welcomed prime minister -- British Prime 
 
 Minister Keir Starmer to the White House.
 
Now, one topic that's high on their agenda, the issue of allowing Ukraine to fire long-range missiles provided by the west on targets deep inside 
 
 Russia. While a decision on lifting restrictions is not expected today, Russia's president has said ending those limits would put his country at 
 
 war with NATO. But Biden seemed to take that in stride, stressing that the U.S. and the U.K. will continue to back Ukraine.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I want to thank you for U.K. 's leadership in this front. The United States is committed to standing with you to help 
 
 Ukraine as it defends against Russia's onslaught and aggression. I'm clear that Putin will not -- make it clear that Putin will not prevail in this 
 
 war. And the people of Ukraine will prevail.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Now, in a CNN exclusive, Fareed Zakaria sat down with Ukraine's president to get his response to the discussions over Ukraine's using long-
 
 range missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine needs the ability to target military sites within Russia. And that time is of the essence, 
 
 like never before.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  Everybody's looking the decision of the United States. Everybody's waiting for such decisions. After that, 
 
 they make decisions. It's true. And so, we wanted very much to use this weapon and just to attack these jets on the military basis, not civilian 
 
 infrastructure. Military base.
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN ANCHOR:  So, you just want to be able to attack -- 
 
ZELENSKYY:  Yes.
 
ZAKARIA:  -- the bases that are being used to launch these weapons, these planes, these missiles?
 
ZELENSKYY:  Yes, because these jets, Farid, these jets, from there they use not only missiles. They used these jets and jets used per month 4,000 
 
 guided aerial bombs on -- just on the east of our territory, 4,000 bombs.
 
ZAKARIA:  And these bombs and missiles are hitting Ukrainian civilians -- 
 
ZELENSKYY:  Schools.
 
ZAKARIA:  -- energies.
 
ZELENSKYY:  Universities. All our energy infrastructure, they destroyed, 80 percent. By these guided bombs, 80 percent. Now, I said, we had some 
 
 meetings with officials and I said, we waited too long. Now, Russia began to move their jets from 100, 150 kilometers, 300 to 500.
 
After that, I will tell you and that now we need more permissions. But now, you will tell me, maybe we will give you 100 or 200. But for what? To 
 
 destroy what? If they began to move? So, we're again, like with the packages, again, slow decisions. And again, we can't win in such 
 
 circumstances.
 
ZAKARIA:  Do you have permission now to -- 
 
ZELENSKYY:  No. Until now, no.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON:  Now, you can watch the full interview with Ukraine's president on Fareed Zakaria GPS. It's airing Sunday at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time or 5:00 
 
 p.m. in Kyiv.
 
Colonel Cedric Leighton joins me now. He's a CNN military analyst and a founding member of CYFORIX, a global Cyber security consulting firm. Good 
 
 to see you again as we continue to parse exactly what the Biden administration might do here.
 
You know, this is both a political and a military decision. I want to get to the military decision first and something that I know you heard that 
 
 Secretary of Defense Austin said a few days ago that, in his words, there's no one capability in and of itself that would be decisive for this 
 
 campaign. So, in other words, it wouldn't be a game changer. Do you agree with him there?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, I do, Paula. It's great to be with you. There are certain factors, of course, that play into 
 
 all of this. One of them is the weapon system itself. So, what you're talking about, the ATACMS system, which is the American system, or the 
 
 Storm Shadow system, which is the British French system, those weapon systems would definitely take care of things within the 300-kilometer 
 
 range, depending on the specific weapon system that you look at.
 
But when you look at other factors, you know, as President Zelenskyy just mentioned in his interview with Fareed Zakaria, there are other areas that 
 
 the Russians are using as bases that are beyond the 300-kilometer range, and that is really evidence of what Secretary of Defense Austin was saying 
 
 that there are multiple capabilities that are needed to counter the Russians and to do these kinds of things.
 
Now, what the other side of this is, of course, that the weapon systems that could have been deployed to Ukraine were not deployed in the way that 
 
 they should have been in the timed manner that they should have been. So, the time frame here is definitely off when it comes to deploying western 
 
 weapons, but deploying something with adequate training is definitely key to at least allowing Ukraine to maintain its capabilities and to maintain, 
 
 frankly, its sovereignty.
 
NEWTON:  And I will get to how important that is in a minute. But politically, you know, Vladimir Putin has already issued threats warning 
 
 that Russia would be in his words, at war with the United States and its allies if they do, in fact, lift those restrictions.
 
You know, he promised to take action. How do you interpret his comments? And I'm sure you're going to tell me you wouldn't expect anything less from 
 
 him. It's not like he's going to say, yes, go ahead, lift those restrictions.
 
LEIGHTON:  Exactly. And that's precisely the key, Paula. One of the other things to remember about this is that the Russians believe that they are 
 
 already at war with the west, looking at the cyber activity at the sabotage operations that they've conducted in Europe, especially the targeted 
 
 assassinations, they see the west as being a major enemy and they are conducting themselves basically using alternative methods, using asymmetric 
 
 methods to go after western societies and western institutions. And part of that, of course, is you know, in addition to the cyber piece, the 
 
 disinformation campaign that is targeted at elections, like the U.S. election, like the various European elections.
 
So, when you look at the way the Russians are putting everything together right now, you see that they are gearing up for a prolonged conflict with 
 
 the west. That is going to happen whether or not we provide ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles to the Ukrainians. But in this particular case, in order to 
 
 safeguard Ukraine, it becomes essential that we provide them with the types of weapons that they need in order to survive.
 
NEWTON:  In terms of what happens next, though, it's difficult at this time to really see a clear strategy with the U.S. and its allies. If they are 
 
 not willing to help Ukraine to the extent that it would militarily help them defend themselves against Russia more than they already have, does 
 
 this not put off peace negotiations, and worse than that, perhaps, really disadvantage Ukraine when they do get to that bargaining table?
 
LEIGHTON:  Yes, one of the key factors, I think, Paula, is the fact that the Ukrainians need to have something in the form of leverage, and they've 
 
 made an attempt to gain that kind of leverage with their incursion into the Kursk region that borders Ukraine inside Russia. So, that comes a one of 
 
 the key factors, whether or not they could hold the Kursk becomes important. But of course, when you look at relative territories, the 
 
 Ukrainians have about 1,300 or so square kilometers of land that they've captured, that pales in comparison to the approximately 20 percent of 
 
 territory that the Russians have captured from the Ukrainians.
 
So, this is going to be a very difficult thing for the Ukrainians to deal with. They're going to have to be concessions at some point when it comes 
 
 to negotiations of whatever type they are in the future. But at the very least, the thing that the west can do is basically create a type of 
 
 porcupine style defense for the Ukrainians so that they become incredibly difficult to take advantage of and that they become incredibly difficult to 
 
 conquer, at least when it comes to the core areas of Ukraine. And that, of course, is going to be a bitter pill for the Ukrainians to swallow, but the 
 
 key thing is for them to maintain that sovereignty and the ability to at least take part of their country into western alliances, like the European 
 
 Union and NATO eventually.
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
NEWTON:  Yes. Well, we've certainly seen that the United States, the Biden administration says they're considering, at least, this one move, to lift 
 
 those restrictions, but it will not be happening imminently. Colonel Cedric Leighton, thank you so much.
 
And we now want to go to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaking at the White House. Let's listen in. 
 
KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  It's not just about a particular sector or tactic or business (ph) strategy relationship (INAUDIBLE). But 
 
 also, we covered the Middle East to some expensive detail and other areas (INAUDIBLE). But it's really important occasion for us to have this chance 
 
 to discuss with our allies. There's another chance we can't potentially under and will take up as well.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have repeatedly said that you believe that you do have to agree tactics to recompute it within months. Is that because of the 
 
 deadline of the American presidential election, and the risk of a President Trump victory?
 
STARMER:  No. I think if you look at both the Ukrainian situation and the Middle East, it is obvious that in the coming weeks and months there are 
 
 really important attentions (INAUDIBLE), whatever timetable is going to (INAUDIBLE). And that's why I want to have this opportunity to directly 
 
 talk to the president. But his invitation about those decisions in the next few months. But to make sure that those decisions were -- as it were 
 
 (INAUDIBLE) avoid a strategic (INAUDIBLE) in relations to Ukraine in the (INAUDIBLE).
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Prime Minister, what did you decide on with regard to - - 
 
STARMER:  Well, we had a wide range of discussion about strategy in Ukraine, of course, in the Middle East and other parts of the world. This 
 
 wasn't a meeting about a particular capability. That wasn't why we got our heads down today. It was to allow ourselves the space which we took, the 
 
 time which we took, to have a strategic discussion so that tactical decisions could be seen within the wider strategy.
 
And it was a -- there's a really good invitation from the president. We've had a very productive and we've come to a strong position. I'm very pleased 
 
 that we've had this discussion.
 
NEWTON:  And we were just listening to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer there flanked by his foreign secretary, Lammy, and both of them coming out 
 
 of their meeting at the White House. The British prime minister described this as a strategic discussion and said that they were not making any 
 
 decisions today on any, as he calls them, certain capabilities.
 
We bring back a colonel Cedric Leighton with us now who's listening in. I mean, that was pretty much what we expected. But I'm sure that you've been 
 
 following this closely, right. When you look at what the -- with the -- pardon me, European allies are discussing, what Britain is discussing with 
 
 the U.S., do you get a sense that it is the European allies and perhaps NATO itself that is trying to convince the United States we need to do more 
 
 here?
 
LEIGHTON:  Yes, I think that's certainly quite true, Paula. At the beginning of this conflict, at least the February 2022 phase of the 
 
 conflict, I would have said probably the reverse that the United States was kind of leading things in at least part of that. But in this particular 
 
 case, I think you're right. I think that, you know, as things have evolved, it's very clear that the Europeans have contributed a lot in terms of 
 
 financial and military aid quite a bit more, actually, than the United States by itself. I -- and that is a significant aspect to this.
 
The Europeans see this, I think, as a major threat to see the Russian encouragement into Ukraine as a major threat. The invasion has really 
 
 changed the way they perceive all of the security arrangements. And what they are really trying to do is make sure that the United States doesn't 
 
 leave them high and dry in during this period. They want the United States to be involved in NATO and to lead NATO, quite frankly.
 
They also want to be able, from a military industrial base standpoint, to have the kind of military industrial base that will allow them to respond 
 
 to the Russians. And that has proven to be a bit of a difficult situation because our industrial basin, by our, I mean, the western world's 
 
 industrial base has not really kept pace with the demands of the Ukraine war.
 
And that is something that is going to, I think, impact your defense budget. It's going to impact, of course, the overall defense fiscal health 
 
 of both the European Union countries as well as the United States. So, this is, in essence, a major European country, although, outside of the E.U., 
 
 Great Britain, saying to the United States, we need you to be involved and we need to work in concert from a strategic perspective to get the kind of 
 
 -- achieve the kinds of goals that we need to achieve when it comes to stabilizing the eastern front of NATO. Meaning, at this case, stabilizing 
 
 the war in Ukraine so that it ends in a way that Ukraine can stay and into the nation.
 
NEWTON:  And all of this in the middle of an all-important U.S. election campaign. Colonel Cedric Leighton, we thank you for standing by for us as 
 
 we follow the developments there at the White House. Appreciate it.
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
Now, you also heard the British prime minister pivot there and talk about the Middle East. He said that he did have a discussion with the president 
 
 about that as well. CNN has obtained rare access to a tiny strip of land that is actually crucial to any cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas, 
 
 the Philadelphi Corridor.
 
It's 14 kilometers long and links Gaza with Egypt. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists there can be no peace unless it is controlled by 
 
 Israel.
 
Matthew Chance visited the corridor, CNN reported, under IDF escort at all times, did, in fact, retain full editorial control over this report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, being taken by the Israeli military into the Gaza Strip, and they've loaded us all, as 
 
 you can see, into this metal sided truck. We're going into the south bit of the Gaza Strip, which the Israeli military say they have under full 
 
 operational control. But it's not entirely secure.
 
They brought us to this place called the Philadelphi Corridor. It's emerged as a sticking point in the negotiations to get a ceasefire and to get the 
 
 hostages released. As you can see, it's right up against the Egyptian border. And it's important because the Israelis say this is an area which 
 
 has been used over the years as a way of smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip.
 
Some of the smuggling has taken place over land, through presumably holes in the fence and through other border crossings. But a lot of it has been 
 
 taking place right under our feet.
 
OK. Well, this is one of those tunnels. It's right on the border with Egypt. And you can see, it is absolutely huge. Wide enough to drive a car 
 
 right the way through it. The Israeli military say that this tunnel, because it's so close to the Egyptian frontier, has been used by Hamas and 
 
 other militants to store weapons in and to fire rockets from. You can see here, the back of the wall, it's completely collapsed down. Apparently, it 
 
 was closed for some time now.
 
We're driving now through the neighborhood of Tel Sultan. Every one of the buildings here has been totally destroyed. This was obviously a residential 
 
 area with many people living in it. And the Israeli military say those people have moved for the most part to safe zones, humanitarian areas, not 
 
 far from here. But look what they've left behind. Look what's happened to Gaza. Thank you.
 
Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari is the chief spokesperson for the Israeli military. How can you justify causing so much, you know, damage, 
 
 devastation, destruction in pursuit of your objectives?
 
REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  The only reason is because Hamas has built his military capabilities in that way that there is no 
 
 other possibility. There is a town underneath Rafah. If you don't demolish it, then Hamas will go back and have a stronghold, a military stronghold. 
 
 He is using the population, embedding in the population. He's creating this destruction and also the deaths of the population.
 
CHANCE:  Well, this has been a very tightly controlled bit of access into Gaza with the Israeli military. There's such a lot we haven't been able to 
 
 see, but it's incredible they've showed us what they have. It's definitely a narrow view, but it is also the only view right now that we can get 
 
 firsthand.
 
Matthew Chance, CNN, in the Southern Gaza Strip.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
NEWTON:  Straight ahead for us to North Korea, giving the world a rare glimpse inside one of its secretive weapons facilities. Leader Kim Jong Un 
 
 touring the site and issuing a troubling new command.
 
Plus, the scramble to gamble. One of the world's fastest growing slot machine firms is betting its future on new global markets and flashy new 
 
 products. We'll hear from the CEO of Light &amp; Wonder.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
NEWTON:  Welcome back to "First Move." U.S. stocks performing great amid a growing Fed rate cut debate. All that and more topping today's Money Move. 
 
 Wall Street finishing the week strong with the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ rising for a fifth straight session, get this, to close out their best week so far 
 
 this year.
 
All this as traders remain split over what the Fed will do at its policy meeting next week. They could cut rates by a quarter or a half percentage 
 
 point. In fact, as of right now, it's anyone's guess.
 
Now, it was a mixed Friday in Asia with Chinese stocks falling half a percent to their lowest point since 2019. Beijing announcing Friday that it 
 
 will in fact begin gradually raising its retirement age next year as it struggles with falling birth rates and an aging workforce. The current 
 
 retirement age is 60 years old for men and 50 for women in blue collar jobs. One of the lowest retirement rates for a major global economy.
 
Now, the U.S. is also making it official today, it will begin raising tariffs on a number of Chinese imports later this month. Tariffs on Chinese 
 
 electric vehicles will rise to over 100 percent, levies also going up on Chinese EV batteries, steel and aluminum. The goal, to give U.S. companies 
 
 a better chance of competing with Chinese firms.
 
We want to go now to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is in the battleground State of Pennsylvania.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Three days ago, Donald Trump and I had our debate. You watched 
 
 it.
 
So -- yes. So, here's the thing. So, I take it many people here watched it. So, you'll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to 
 
 families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, keeping our 
 
 nation safe and secure.
 
But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan on how 
 
 he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. Turn the page.
 
CROWD:  We're not going back.
 
HARRIS:  We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
CROWD:  We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
HARRIS:  And we are not going back because America is ready for a new way forward.
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together, which is why -- and Mary Grace, thank you, which 
 
 is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign.
 
We need a president of the United States who works for all the American people. That just stops with all the trying to divide us. Like, people are 
 
 exhausted with that stuff. Exhausted.
 
And you know, my entire career, I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against 
 
 predators who abuse them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion from middle-class families who faced 
 
 foreclosure.
 
I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges. For workers who are being cheated out of the wages they were due. 
 
 For seniors facing elder abuse. And as attorney general of a border state, I took on transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel that 
 
 traffic in drugs and threaten the safety of our communities.
 
I know these cartels firsthand. And as president, I will make sure we prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law for pushing poison like 
 
 fentanyl on our children.
 
And as president, I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. 
 
 Together, together.
 
CROWD:  We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
HARRIS:  And -- 
 
CROWD:  We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
HARRIS:  And that future we build will include what I call an opportunity economy, so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build 
 
 wealth, and to start a business.
 
You know, I love our small businesses. So, growing up, I really -- do we have small business leaders here? Raise your hand. Yes, right? So, growing 
 
 up, sister and my mother -- my sister and me had a mother -- have a mother -- had a mother, excuse me, she passed. But our mother worked long hours. 
 
 She worked hard. She worked long hours. And my sister, Maya, and I would go over to Ms. Shelton's house. Ms. Shelton lived a couple of doors down. And 
 
 she helped my mother take care of us. And we, in fact, used to call her our second mother.
 
Well, Ms. Shelton was a small business owner. And I will tell you since I was a child, I know the character and the person who is a small business 
 
 owner, you're not only business leaders, you're civic leaders. You hold the community together, you're part of the fabric of the community, and small 
 
 business owners are the backbone of America's economy. The backbone of America's economy.
 
Which is why part of my plan that you heard about the other night, we'll give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses, knowing that not 
 
 everybody, like my opponent, got handed $40 million on a silver tray and then filed for bankruptcy six times.
 
And people sometimes just need the opportunity, because we as Americans do not lack for ambition, for aspiration, for dreams, for the preparedness to 
 
 do hard work. But not everyone has the opportunity because not everyone has the access. When I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is 
 
 grounded in that foundational belief, that when given an opportunity, people excel every day. Every day.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
Part of my focus is on the fact that we need to build more housing in America. And so, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private 
 
 sector to build $3 million new homes by the end of my first term.
 
And I have a plan to help lower the cost of living for America's families on everything, from health care to groceries, including, I will take on 
 
 corporate price gouging, which, as we know, is about those few bad guys taking advantage of desperate people, and there needs to be a consequence.
 
Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, including expanding the child tax credit to $6,000 during the first year of 
 
 a child's life, understanding that new parents need support in that most critical phase of their child's development to help them buy a car seat, a 
 
 crib, baby clothes.
 
I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans, not just those with college degrees. For far too long our nation has encouraged 
 
 only one path to success, a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths, additional paths, such as 
 
 apprenticeships and technical programs.
 
So, as president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, to increase jobs for folks without a four-year degree, 
 
 understanding that requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one's skills. And I will challenge the private sector to do the same.
 
All of this to say, look, I come from the middle-class. I understand where I come from, and I'm never going to forget that. And I will always put 
 
 middle-class working people first. It will always be my priority. Always be my priority. I know where I come from. I know where I come from.
 
But now Donald Trump has a different plan. Just Google -- just look up the Google. Just Google Project 2025. It is a detailed dangerous blueprint for 
 
 what he will do if he were elected president again. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, like he did before. He 
 
 intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call the Trump sales tax on everyday basic necessities, which, as 
 
 economists have reviewed, would cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
 
In fact, independent economists like Goldman Sachs have said my plan would grow our economy, and his plan would shrink the economy, reignite 
 
 inflation, and send us into a recession by the middle of next year.
 
On top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And let's remember, like, we're not here with Trump amnesia, we remember. 
 
 Remember when he was president, he tried 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act. And as he said in the debate just this week, he has no plan to 
 
 replace it.
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
Right, right. You said it. He said -- he has, quote, "concepts of a plan." Concepts of a plan. No actual plan. So, let's just think about this for a 
 
 moment. He's going to threaten health insurance for the 45 million people who rely on it based on a concept. And take us back when insurance 
 
 companies have -- but -- because we remember where that was. We remember what that was when insurance companies have the power to deny people with 
 
 preexisting conditions. Remember what that was like? Remember?
 
Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. No, we are not going back, because ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for 
 
 freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.
 
And we remember how we got here, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intent that they would overturn 
 
 Roe v. Wade, and they did exactly as he intended.
 
CROWD:  We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
HARRIS:  And we understand where we are. We understand where we are. Hey, listen. Now, is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire. I -- we have 
 
 been working around the clock to get that done. And I respect your voice. But right now, I am speaking.
 
So, on the issue of fundamental rights and freedoms, we remember how he selected those members of the Supreme Court to undo Roe v. Wade. They did 
 
 just as he intended. And what we have seen is in state after state, they passed laws to criminalize health care providers, to punish women. Now, 
 
 more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions for rape and incest, which is immoral to tell a survivor of a violation to 
 
 their body that they don't have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? That's immoral.
 
And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. Not 
 
 the government. 
 
And I will tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into 
 
 law. Proudly.
 
I'm traveling our country, and I'll tell you, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard fought, hard won fundamental 
 
 freedoms and rights. Like the freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe. From gun violence. The freedom to join a union. And the freedom to love who you 
 
 love openly and with pride.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
And generations. Let's remember who we are as Americans, generations before us led the fight for freedom and to the friends here I say, the baton is 
 
 now in our hands.
 
And so much is on the line in this election. We all know and remember, this is not 2016 or 2020, the stakes are even higher than they were then. 
 
 Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court essentially told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he 
 
 does if he gets back into the White House.
 
Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Imagine what that might mean. Right. He who has vowed, if re-elected, he would be a dictator on day one. 
 
 He will call for the, quote, "termination" of the constitution of the United States. And let us be clear, someone who suggests we should 
 
 terminate the constitution of the United States of America should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never 
 
 again. Never again.
 
So, Pennsylvania, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And who are here understand the 
 
 awesome responsibility. The awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth, the privilege and pride of being an American.
 
NEWTON:  And you have been listening to Vice President Kamala Harris there at a rally in the all-important battleground State of Pennsylvania. 
 
 Certainly, her stump speech were things that we heard before about providing an opportunity economy and that they were not going back to the 
 
 times of Donald Trump.
 
In terms of other events here, she did, in fact, do a local interview. She has been coming under criticism for not doing more interviews. So, we will 
 
 bring you more of that when we have it.
 
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break and come right back.

NEWTON:  Pope Francis says American voters have to choose between the, quote, "lesser of two evils." On his way back from a 12-day trip to Asia, 
 
 the pope was asked about the advice he'd give Catholics voting in the U.S. presidential election. He says both candidates are against life, in his 
 
 words, citing Donald Trump's stance on migrants and Kamala Harris's position on abortion rights. Still, he urged people to vote.
 
Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT:  Pope Francis has made a forthright intervention into the U.S. presidential election campaign, 
 
 criticizing both former President Trump for his anti-migrant policies and Vice President Harris for her pro-choice. Francis saying that both of these 
 
 policies are against life. And he said that Catholic voters had to make a choice between a lesser of two evils.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPE FRANCIS (through translator):  You have to vote and one must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that 
 
 gentleman? I don't know. Everyone with a conscience should think on this and do it.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LAMB:  The pope making these remarks on board the papal plane, taking him back from Singapore to Rome. Francis, very strong in his criticisms of 
 
 anti-migrant policies, talking specifically about migrant flows through Central America, saying it was evil and wrong not to welcome migrants, not 
 
 to give them jobs.
 
Significant that he is equating anti-migrant policies with abortion. Of course, the Catholic church long opposed to abortion. Some of the church 
 
 would like to see abortion be a single political issue. Francis not doing that here with his equating of anti-migrant policies with abortion. A 
 
 significant intervention from Pope Francis after what has been the longest trip of his pontificate during his tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

NEWTON:  Now, to North Korea, which has released photos of leader Kim Jong Un apparently touring a uranium enrichment site. It's a rare glimpse into 
 
 the country's nuclear program. Now, the date and location of the visit aren't clear. North Korea is looking to ramp up its nuclear weapons 
 
 production, putting much of the west and Asia on edge. And earlier this week, Kim made that goal plain, promising to dramatically expand his 
 
 country's arsenal. Mike Valerio has our report from Seoul.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, when we speak to experts on North Korea and we ask the all-important question, why does this matter? And why 
 
 should we be paying attention to this? They come back and they say, this certainly could tie directly into the U.S. presidential election with Kim 
 
 Jong Un trying to telegraph beyond his borders that both of the presidential candidates should certainly not, from his point of view, 
 
 forget about him or forget about North Korea.
 
So, when we look at these images, you know, we're accustomed to seeing pictures of North Korean nuclear equipment looking like something you would 
 
 see out of the old Soviet Union. But again, with these images that are new, extremely difficult to verify coming from North Korea. We see what appeared 
 
 to be row after row of gleaming centrifuge, gleaming centrifuges which are used as the primary machinery to refine and weaponize -- enrich, I should 
 
 say, and weaponize uranium to be used in nuclear devices.
 
So, again, nuclear and North Korea experts are saying this could be Kim Jong Un trying to say, North Korea is nuclear, and it's not going back to a 
 
 time when it wasn't.
 
Now, earlier this week, here in the Seoul region, I had the opportunity to speak to former President Trump's fourth national security adviser, Robert 
 
 O'Brien. And I asked O'Brien, would there ever be a chance of the United States agreeing to a nuclear freeze with North Korea? Saying that it has 
 
 nuclear weapons, but no more nuclear weapons for the North. He said that would be extremely tough. Listen to his comments.

 <br>[18:50:00]
 
ROBERT O'BRIEN, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  To excuse the North Koreans and say, OK. It's OK for North Korea to have a bomb, it's pretty 
 
 hard then to say, well, no, Iran can't have a bomb and Saudi Arabia can't have a bomb to deter Iran. It can't just be that the bad guys can get the 
 
 bomb with impunity.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
VALERIO:  North Korea is acting with more confidence, who could forget earlier in the summer when Russian President Vladimir Putin came to the 
 
 North Korean capital to officially enter into a new military strategic partnership. One of the questions moving forward though is whether or not 
 
 these images are a potential, and I stress potential, prelude to a nuclear test from North Korea before the U.S. election.
 
A nuclear test from North Korea has not happened since September of 2017, and with a country as elusive as North Korea, no one can know for sure.

NEWTON:  And we'll be right back in a moment.

NEWTON:  August 2024 set a new monthly temperature record, capping Earth's hottest summer since global records began in the 1800s. That's according to 
 
 a NASA report published this week.
 
Now, while it remains difficult to predict when and where natural disasters will strike, one company in Abu Dhabi is turning to A.I. to revolutionize 
 
 how we respond to them.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Five, four, three, two, one, ignition. And liftoff of Falcon 9.
 
VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This year, a Falcon 9 rocket carried more than 100 satellites into space. One of those belongs to 
 
 Space42. It's the first of nine that will form a constellation around the Earth.
 
HASAN AL HOSANI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SPACE42:  You see the previous, or the points at the bottom there.
 
MIRACLE (voice-over):  The Abu Dhabi based satellite and technology company aims to revolutionize how we monitor and respond to natural disasters.
 
AL HOSANI:  Space42 is becoming this vertical that, as we say, has the upstream, which is the satellites in space, the midstream, the 
 
 communication of those satellites with the Earth. And then, finally, the downstream where we received this data, analyze this data and provide 
 
 insights based on these different data.
 
MIRACLE (voice-over):  Space42 satellites are equipped with state-of-the- art sensors and A.I. powered analytics to monitor and respond to natural disasters in real-time. This technology was put to the test during recent 
 
 events.
 
AL HOSANI:  What we're looking at exactly right now is the earthquake that happened in Turkey and Syria last year. Immediately acquiring the data and 
 
 applying artificial intelligence on top of the data to start analyzing the impact on the ground.
 
MIRACLE:  Yes, can you zoom in on that stadium? Just see -- I'm so curious about the level of detail as well.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
AL HOSANI:  The system is actually comparing the data imagery before the event and after the event. So, it can immediately recognize the areas 
 
 impacted, what sorts of impact is there on the urban area, on the road network and everything.

NEWTON:  And finally, on "First Move," from a historic spacewalk to another exciting spectacle, from Polaris Dawn astronaut Sarah Gillis.

NEWTON:  Lovely. Playing a violin orbiting high above the Earth, she played Racine from "Star Wars." Of course (INAUDIBLE). How appropriate. Various 
 
 music groups, you can see there, from across the globe accompanied her performance. The money raised by the event will be given to charities the 
 
 Polaris program supports. Amazing.
 
That just about wraps up our show for us. I want to thank you for joining us. Stay with CNN.
