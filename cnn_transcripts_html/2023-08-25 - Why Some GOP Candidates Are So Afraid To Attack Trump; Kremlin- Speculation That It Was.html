(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right, happening now. Silence. The morning after the first mugshot of a former president in a historic fourth indictment, we are hearing no leading presidential candidates criticizing Trump at all. Almost none of these people saying anything. Period. Full stop. So, why?
 
Joining me now is Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten. The numbers tell part of this story, Harry, particularly about the people who have criticized Trump.
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: I like to think numbers often tell a large part of the story. Look. Look at Trump's biggest critics, their net favorability ratings amongst Republicans. You'll notice they're all in the negatives. They have higher unfavorable ratings than favorable ratings.
 
Will Hurd, minus seven points. He didn't even make the debate. Asa Hutchinson, minus 18 points. Chris Christie, who is the chief Trump critic, or at least a best-known Trump critic of them all within Republican circles running for president, look at this, a minus 44- point net favorability rating with Republicans. Republicans simply put are not rewarding. In fact, they are punishing those Republicans who are critiquing Donald Trump.
 
BERMAN: You know, even to the minus seven is interesting because he's not the type of person that many people might have an opinion on.
 
ENTEN: Correct.
 
BERMAN: But if they do, it turns out to be a negative opinion in this case among Republicans.
 
ENTEN: That's exactly right.
 
BERMAN: OK. What's the other side of this for the people who have been, you know, praising Trump or at least laying off him the most?
 
ENTEN: Yes. I mean, look at the highest net favorite -- net favorability ratings amongst the GOP for the non-frontrunners. You know, a few months ago, no one knew who Vivek Ramaswamy was. No one really knew who Tim Scott was.
 
Look at these net favorability ratings. Plus 30 points for him. Plus 41 points for him. If you want to rise to Republican circles, do not be critical of Donald Trump.
 
BERMAN: Yes. It seems got by and large saying nothing. Vivek Ramaswamy saying super nice things almost all the time.
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: When pollsters have asked Republican voters whether they want to hear this type of thing, what have they said?
 
ENTEN: They said, look. What your GOP -- what your GOP voters think that Trump's opponent should focus on the Republican debate? Nine percent said making the case against Trump. Look at this. The vast majority said making the case for themselves.
 
And this I think gets at the most fascinating thing. Who Trump voters say tell them true information? Look at this. 71 percent of them say Donald Trump. Compare that to just 63 percent who say, friends and family.
 <br>[11:35:03]
 
That is how popular Donald Trump is within Republican circles and he has the majority of the vote at this point. So, if you want to rise, you got to say nice things about Trump or at least not critical of him.
 
BERMAN: We've talk a little bit about this poll on this show over the last week. It really is telling. I mean, Trump voters trust Donald Trump more than Mom, basically.
 
ENTEN: Yes. That's exactly right. If Donald Trump tells them to eat their Wheaties, they may actually eat them. If mom tells them, maybe not.
 
BERMAN: All right. Harry Enten, have a wonderful weekend. Thank you so much for doing it.
 
ENTEN: You as well, my friend.
 
BERMAN: And say hi to mom.
 
ENTEN: I will.
 
BERMAN: All right. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: In the light of yesterday's historic arrest of Donald Trump, there is silence from the White House. President Biden hasn't said a word about it publicly, but it's already being blasted out by Donald Trump himself to make money. He posted the mug shot on the social media site formerly known as Twitter and his own social media site before Trump's flight even touchdown back in New Jersey after his Atlanta surrender. His campaign was already selling T-shirts with his mug shots on them.
 
As for the Biden campaign, while not actually mentioning Trump or his booking photo, his team took a more subtle approach online. Encouraging supporters to donate saying, I think today is a great day to give to my campaign. They posted.
 
I'm joined now by CNN political analyst and White House reporter for the Associated Press Seung Min Kim. Thank you so much for being on.
 
First, Trump's mugshot being used to fundraise. But why hasn't Biden come out strongly and attacked him publicly? It would seem this would be an easy no-brainer thing to do in a -- in a political battle.
 
SEUNG MIN KIM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. You would think so especially if the person that you think is going to be your opponent in the 2024 race is under four separate criminal indictments and got booked into a jail yesterday. But President Biden from the start of his -- from the start of his time in office has been really careful as to how he approaches issues involving the Justice Department issues on ongoing criminal cases. And that certainly has applied here, and that certainly is what -- is an attack that the president and his team are taking.
 
They have said on the -- on the former president's indictments, whether it's the cases in New York or these most cases -- most recent cases in Georgia, they are taking a vow of silence. And a lot of it is because in the two cases that are brought by the federal government that are brought under the special counsel, Jack Smith, he's getting a lot of you know pushback from Republicans saying it is Biden's Justice Department that is doing this. 
 
Now, let's point out that Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to handle these matters, take it out of the Justice Department. But President Biden doesn't want to be seen anywhere near -- any -- doesn't want to get any notion of sort of being involved in matters involving -- the criminal matters involving Donald Trump at all. That's why they're staying out of it.
 
SIDNER: All right. I want to talk about him -- Biden leaning on his economic record. That is something he is talking a lot about, Bidenomics if you will. But even Democrats, if you look at the polling don't seem totally sold on that message. I think it's like 65 percent of people think he's doing a good job economically. But a much larger number think he's doing a good job overall. Why are people going for it, and what should he be touting?
 
SEUNG: Right. I mean, that is the fascinating disconnect, that the poll that you just cited, it's actually from the Associated Press poll where it shows that in terms of Democrats' approval of President Biden on his handling of the economy, it's only at 60 percent or so. And that is not a great number for members of your own party to think of you on matters as such -- as so important to your reelection chances as the economy.
 
Now, you know, some may think that he hasn't done far enough to improve the economic stances. You know, a lot of Democrats obviously support the broader so-called Bidenomics agenda. So right now -- right now, they're on a very aggressive sales pitch.
 
You're going to have more and more events. They really want to make that connection between what the president has done in his first two years in office and the tangible impact on everyday people's lives. But right now, as the polling shows, people aren't yet making that connection. So, it's going to be a huge sales job for this president and for the White House for the next two years.
 
SIDNER: Is it fair to say one of the reasons is that Donald Trump goes for sort of the emotional response to what's happening to him, even if it's of his own accord? And Biden seems to be going for a very policy- rigid response. Do you think that's going to change as we get closer and closer and closer to the election?
 
SEUNG: I mean, that's going to be the -- these strategies, I think is going to be it for the president, for the reelection campaign. They want to really focus on his accomplishments. But once President Biden really shifts into campaign mode, which we expect to be in the early part of next year, right now, he's still sort of, you know, keeping his head down raising money, he's really going to be making that contrast.
 
As President Biden always says, you know, don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative. And once the alternative becomes clear, you're going to be hearing a lot of policy contrasts from then on.
 <br>[11:40:14]
 
SIDNER: Yes. It's not just Democrats he has convinced but some independence as well.
 
SEUNG: Right.
 
SIDNER: Thank you so much Seun Ming Kim, from the Associated Press. Appreciate you coming on the show. Kate?
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Coming up for us. The Kremlin says claims they're behind the presumed death of Wagner boss and brief mutiny leader Yevgeny Prigozhin is an "absolute lie." How the Russian people are reacting to the mysterious plane crash now? Next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BOLDUAN: An absolute lie. That is what a Kremlin spokesperson is saying today about suggestions the Russian government is behind the plane crash believed to have killed Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin.
 <br>[11:45:06]
 
It's the first time that the Kremlin has directly addressed this mystery. Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin broke his silence, though kind of obtusely addressing what happened to his one- time ally turned to threat. CNN's Fred Pleitgen. He's following this. He joins us now. Fred, what else are you hearing from the Kremlin and from President Putin on this?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Kate. Well, first of all, it's quite interesting that since Vladimir Putin has spoken about the subject now and of course, offered his condolences, and then also talked about Yevgeny Prigozhin, that it seems as though a lot of other people in Russia are now doing the same as well, including the Kremlin spokesman. And you mentioned the fact that he said any sort of speculation that the Kremlin might have been behind it or the Russian state might have been behind it, which once again, the Kremlin blames on the West, that all of that is an absolutely -- an absolute lie.
 
He also confirmed that there is an investigation going on and that there would be a genetic examination of all of the debris and of course also of the bodies. And then the Kremlin says that they would say no more.
 
It was quite interesting because all this happened on a conference call with journalists and the Kremlin spokesman. And he was actually asked there whether or not Vladimir Putin might attend the funeral of Yevgeny Prigozhin. And to that, the Kremlin spokesman said they simply weren't sure about the timings at this point in time.
 
But again, right now, there are more people inside Russia who are starting to comment on this and also some allies of Vladimir Putin. Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, for instance, coming out today, of course, part of Wagner moved to Belarus after that mutiny took place. He said he couldn't imagine that Vladimir Putin would be behind all of this.
 
It's also quite interesting to get a picture sort of from on the ground inside Russia, Kate. And there have been some sort of makeshift memorials springing up in various Russian cities to Yevgeny Prigozhin, to also some of the others who were presumably killed in that plane crash. People laying down flowers.
 
And some of the sort of voices that we've heard and seen from the ground are saying that they believe that someone like Yevgeny Prigozhin for an organization like Wagner that he was so defining for that organization that he probably couldn't be easily replaced as many people who were speaking there have put it. So, that's one of the things that we've also sort of been speaking about over the last couple of days that when it now seems as though large parts possibly the leadership of Wagner seem to have been essentially decapitated if indeed it is confirmed that they have been killed that this -- in the future could be a very different organization than it has been so far. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, that's a great point. It's good to see you, Fred. Thank you so much for that. Sara?
 
SIDNER: Donald Trump is the first former president to have a mug shot, but he's not the first whose jailhouse snapshot became instantly famous or infamous. We'll look at some of the most notable examples in history. That's next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[11:52:13]
 
It is the first of its kind presidential portrait, a mugshot of the 45th president. Well, Donald Trump is the first former president to get arrested, not once but four times we should say. He is certainly not the first famous person, celebrity, musician, or politician to pose for a booking photo.
 
CNN's Tom Foreman. Oh, he's doing the story. Well, wait. Tom Foreman is with us.
 
I thought I was listing you. I thought you were like the example. See? This Tom Foreman is with us.
 
BOLDUAN: I mean I thought -- he -- do you know I was going to Tom. I thought I was going to Tom Foreman -- (INAUDIBLE)
 
BERMAN: I thought it was like I was listing names. SIDNER: Right.
 
BERMAN: It Tom Foreman was Tom Foreman's here do the story.
 
SIDNER: The disrespect.
 
BOLDUAN: Wait. Before then, Tom, what was your mugshot look like? Go.
 
SIDNER: Show us your mug shot, please.
 
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, my mug shot?
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
FOREMAN: My mugshot would be charming and people be thrilled with my mugshot.
 
BOLDUAN: Debonair. OK, continue.
 
FOREMAN: But I think, so far -- so far I've been too wildly in too fast. Yes, he's not -- he's not the first. I mean other politicians. Texas Congressman Tom DeLay had a mug shot. John Edwards, a former presidential candidate on the Democratic side had a mug shot. Rick Perry had a mug shot.
 
John Edwards, interestingly, was charged with using campaign funds to hide an illicit affair. He ultimately got off on that. But then there have been other celebrities as you mentioned.
 
O.J. Simpson one of the most famous mug shots out there notably famous too because Time Magazine darkened the image to make him look more sinister. And then they apologize for that. And he got off on the murder charges.
 
Nick Nolte he there, that mug shot, he said sort of spurred him to go get help for substance abuse issues. And then Lindsay Lohan. She's had her mugshot taken numerous times. So, there are a lot of people out there who fall into this category.
 
BOLDUAN: What -- I mean, there are a lot of musicians that have some very famous mugshots.
 
FOREMAN: Musicians, yes. Well, yes, musicians all over the place. There has been a lot of that going on. For example, James Brown famously chased with police that was involved. David Bowie. He was with one of my favorites, Iggy Pop and they got busted for marijuana. Justin Bieber for turning on what Justin Bieber's problems were like. There are a lot of them.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
FOREMAN: And then, here's one of my favorites here. You go to Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, and Frank Sinatra. Elvis Presley got into a shoving match with a gas station attendant. Mick Jagger was a drug charge along with Keith Richards, the Glimmer Twins, And Frank Sinatra was arrested for seduction.
 
SIDNER: I mean you can see why.
 
FOREMAN: Seduction.
 
BERMAN: Why? (INAUDIBLE)
 
SIDNER: You can see why.
 
BOLDUAN: He's like -- 
 
SIDNER: What are you trying to say about old blue eyes?
 
BOLDUAN: Tom Foreman, that is exactly what you would be arrested for. I'll tell you that much.
 
FOREMAN: No, I would be arrested for being charming.
 
BOLDUAN: Oh, exactly.
 
SIDNER: Oh, that adds it.
 
BOLDUAN: Wait. Speaking of being arrested for seduction, how can you not have Tom on the list? Remember the hot felon of recent years?
 <br>[11:55:02]
 
SIDNER: Oh, yes, with the green eyes?
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
SIDNER: Sorry, John. John's -- there he is.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes, exactly. This is what I think of when I think of John Berman.
 
FOREMAN: Odd.
 
BOLDUAN: He won -- he got -- he was on it was like serious charges. But he got out and then hit an entire modeling career.
 
SIDNER: Yes, modeling career.
 
BOLDUAN: I don't know what he's doing these days.
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: But you know, something like that stand next to Tom Foreman is just like a picturesque image of booking photos right there.
 
SIDNER: Wow. Is that what we're doing on this?
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
SIDNER: You know what? It's Friday. We need to be done very quickly.
 
BOLDUAN: Wait. If Donald Trump's motivation for his mug shot was defiant, what would yours be?
 
BERMAN: Just being hot.
 
BOLDUAN: Hotness?
 
BERMAN: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: I was thinking. What about -- innocence would be a good option?
 
BERMAN: Innocently hot.
 
SIDNER: Ah, my -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Sara?
 
SIDNER: My option would be I'm not getting arrested.
 
BOLDUAN: I'm not getting caught?
 
SIDNER: I'm not getting arrested.
 
BOLDUAN: Not going in.
 
SIDNER: I'm not getting a mug shot. So, that's my option.
 
BOLDUAN: All right, sultry.
 
BERMAN: Tom Foreman -- 
 
SIDNER: Sultry?
 
BOLDUAN: Sultry and sinister.
 
BERMAN: Tom Foreman, thank you for playing. You are, in fact, charming.
 
FOREMAN: All right. Thank you, John.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes.
 
BERMAN: Appreciate it.
 
BOLDUAN: Run. As we say always, run away, John -- Tom Foreman. We love you.
 
SIDNER: Bye, Tom.
 
BERMAN: Yes.
 
SIDNER: Thank you so much for joining us. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. "INSIDE POLITICS" with Dana Bash is up next.
