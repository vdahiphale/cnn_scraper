THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, beautiful people. Happy Friday eve. It`s Thursday, November 2nd. I`m Coy. This is CNN 10, where we tell you the 
 
 what, letting you decide what to think. 
 
I`ve got some great stories for you today. But first let`s talk about the holidays. Halloween is over. People are getting into the spirit -- the 
 
 spirit of spending the holidays are an important time for retailers. Many of them rely on spending in November and December for as much as 1/5 of 
 
 their annual sales or more. 
 
And according to a new survey from Deloitte, holiday spending may bounce back big time and even surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Even though shoppers 
 
 face ongoing inflation, and some are paying off student loans for the first time in years, shoppers are expected to drop an average of about $1,600 for 
 
 holiday-related purchases. That`s 14 percent more than last year.
 
But the survey says many consumers are expecting to receive half as many gifts as they did a few years ago, due to rising costs. The majority of 
 
 people who responded to the survey also said they do their shopping after Thanksgiving to make the most of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. 
 
But let`s all remember that we don`t need to stress this holiday season. The focus should be on family, friends, and loved ones. We can buy a new 
 
 watch, but we can`t buy time. We can buy a whole house, but we can`t buy a home. 
 
This holiday season isn`t about the gifts we receive or the money we spend. It`s about the moments we make.
 
Now, pop quiz, hot shot, ten-second trivia, which of these names has not been used for a NASA mission. Euclid Galileo, Kepler or Ptolemy?
 
Ptolemy was an Egyptian astronomer, mathematician and geographer born around 100 A.D., but his name has not been used for any NASA missions. 
 
"Lucy, I`m home," a famous line from the 1950 sitcom "I Love Lucy". Lucy is also the name of another NASA mission, but this Lucy is far from home. The 
 
 mission launched in October of 2021, but yesterday, Lucy reached its first target, an ancient asteroid called Dinkinesh. From a distance of about 265 
 
 miles, Lucy gathered images and data about the asteroid, which has only ever appeared as a smudge in telescopes. 
 
Lucy will be NASA`s first mission to fly past ancient asteroids around Jupiter left over from the early days of our solar system. It`s expected to 
 
 take 12 years total and cost a lot of money. The launch alone cost about $148 million. Lucy isn`t expected to reach its next target until April of 
 
 2025.
 
Here`s CNN`s Kristin Fisher with more details about this historic mission.

ANNOUNCER: Three, two, one, lift off Atlas V takes flight.
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The NASA spacecraft is on a 12-year mission covering 6.4 billion kilometers to fly 
 
 past eight ancient asteroids. 
 
Lucy is the first mission to investigate the Trojan asteroid swarms, which are asteroid clusters along Jupiter`s orbital path. Armed with cameras, a 
 
 thermometer and an infrared imaging spectrometer, Lucy will collect the first high resolution images of these asteroids. 
 
The spacecraft gets her name from the Lucy fossil, an ancient human ancestor whose remains transform the study of hominid evolution. NASA hopes 
 
 its Lucy transforms the understanding of the evolution of the solar system. After making a few fly-bys of Earth for a gravity slingshot boost, Lucy`s 
 
 expected to reach her first objective in the asteroid belt between Earth and Jupiter. She`ll then travel to the Trojan asteroids all named after the 
 
 heroes of Homer`s "Iliad".
 
KEITH NO, PLANETARY ASTRONOMER, NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER: The power of what Lucy is able to do by having so many targets. We can construct all 
 
 these comparisons between all the different varieties and the diversity that we see in the Trojans, the unexpected diversity -- the different 
 
 colors, the different collision histories. It`s really a repository of fossils, as we like to say, of things that happened at the earliest stages 
 
 of solar system evolution.
 
FISHER: Is powered by two giant solar arrays. That`ll expand outward like Chinese folding fans. They`ll carry Lucy farther away from the sun than any 
 
 other solar powered spacecraft. 
 
Lucy will never return to Earth, but she won`t be the last to visit the asteroids. NASA plans to send more. China and Russia are teaming up on an 
 
 asteroid mission in 2024, and the UAE in 2028.
