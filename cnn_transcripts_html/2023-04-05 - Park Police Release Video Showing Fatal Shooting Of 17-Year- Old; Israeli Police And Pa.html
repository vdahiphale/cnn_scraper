JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: The danger continues as severe weather threatens 85 million Americans nationwide. Kate?
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: This just in to CNN, the FBI and DOJ have opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal police shooting of a 17 year old. Now police in Washington, D.C., they've released the disturbing body camera video of that shooting. This happened last month and started with officers responding to reports of a stolen car. It ended though with a park police officer jumping in the backseat and shooting the driver as he drove off.
 
CNN's Sunlen Serfaty has seen all of this video and she joins us now. Sunlen, we should warn our viewers this video may be disturbing but you've seen it. What happened here?
 
SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, it certainly is disturbing new video that was just released by the U.S. Parks Police and the D.C. Metropolitan Police. And it does reveal more details about a shooting that happened here in D.C. on the morning of March 19th.
 
Now, this is body cam footage from officers from both of those agencies who both responded to the incident. And again the video you're about to see is very, very disturbing. Now police say the vehicle here in this photo, that white car, they believed it was stolen and inside was 17 year old Dalaneo Martin.
 
Police say he was asleep there in the parked car and the video shows the police spending some time beforehand, discussing ways to get into the car to arrest him. Now at one point, an officer opens the back door to get into the car while another officer opens the front driver's side door and the footage shows the car then suddenly drive off and one of the parks police officers is still in the backseat of the car. He yells for him to stop. Now here are those moments.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Police. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't move, don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't move.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't move.
 
(INAUDIBLE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop. Stop, man. Just let me out. Let me out. Stop. Stop or I shoot.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SERFATY: Now that right there, that's the point when the video -- in the video when this officer fires numerous shots from the back in the car seconds later crashes into a nearby home. You can see there. The video then shows police pulling Martin out to try to revive him with CPR. They were unsuccessful and police say he died then at the scene.
 
Now the Parks Police says there is an investigation into the incident. None of the officers are involved, Kate, have been identified yet by either agency and the Parks Police would not confirm the current status of the officer who ultimately shot Martin. Meantime, his family is pushing for the officer to be identified, prosecuted and they ultimately want him fired.
 
BOLDUAN: That video is so hard to watch and to see. But as I mentioned off the top, we've just learned just this morning that the Justice Department, the FBI, they've now opened a civil rights investigation into this. What are you learning about that?
 
SERFATY: Yes, this video makes clear that there certainly are a lot of questions going into this incident last month and a lot more details that need to be learned. There also was an investigation by the Parks Police and they said they handed it over to the Metropolitan Police Department here in D.C. and that will ultimately be reviewed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C.
 
You know, just remarkable that both police departments, both agencies here in Washington, D.C., trying clearly to get out front of this and really seen numerous videos, numerous angles from many of the officers who responded to this incident. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: But much more to learn. Sunlen, thank you for bringing that to us. Sara?
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: The video was incredibly disturbing and so is this. This morning, investigators are searching for whoever was responsible for murdering three teenagers in Central Florida. The bodies of the teens who were friends were found in three different locations that you're seeing there on the map. They all had gunshot wounds.
 
CNN's Carlos Suarez joins us from Miami with details. Carlos, do police have any sense of why these teens were shot?
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sara, good morning. So the Marion County Sheriff's Office is still trying to piece this case together. We know that they've dedicated 15 detectives to try to sort all of this out. As you mentioned, the bodies of these three friends were found last week, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
 
The first victim was identified as a 16 year old Layla Silvernail. Her body was found on the side of a road on Friday. The body of a 16 year old girl was also found on the side of a road not too far from where the initial body was found. And then on Saturday, the third and final body was found, a 16 year old, was found inside of a car that was submerged in some water.
 <br>[09:35:03]
 
Now according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office, there is no indication this morning that there are any more possible victims and there is no indication that they're dealing with a serial killer.
 
Sara, there had been some rumors, apparently on social media that two of those variables were still outstanding. However, the sheriff in Marion County wanted to say, look, we've got three bodies right now. We know their friends, we know that they were together. And so far, that is where this investigation stands.
 
SIDNER: Oh, my God, three teenagers who have barely started their lives. I do want to ask you about what the sheriff might be saying about these victims. Are we learning anything more?
 
SUAREZ: Well, Sara, a little over almost a week into this investigation and there's not a whole lot more information that the Marion County Sheriff's Office is releasing. They are looking into the possibility that some sort of gang activity was related to this incident. I hear is a little bit more about what the sheriff said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SHERIFF BILLY WOODS, MARIO COUNTY, FLORIDA: All of our victims are known or have we're known to know each other. And we're together leading up to the incident itself.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SUAREZ: All right, Sara, so one final note there. It's unclear whether any of these victims were a part of a gang or whether they were killed by gang members.
 
SIDNER: Carlos Suarez live from Miami, thank you. John?
 
BERMAN: All right. Thanks so much, Sara.
 
So President Zelenskyy in -- from Ukraine is now in Poland this morning for an official meeting with the president there as Vladimir Putin's nuclear saber rattling ratchets up.
 
Violent scenes in Israel. Israeli police storm one of Islam's holiest sites. A new round of rockets fired from Gaza.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:41:07]
 
BERMAN: New this morning, the U.S. is calling for restraint and de- escalation after 10 rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel. Israel responded with strikes of its own. This exchange came after Israeli police stormed one of Islam's holiest sites arresting many Palestinian worshippers. Police say they entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem to break up a large group barricaded inside and they say they were met with a barrage of fireworks, stones and sticks.
 
This video posted online does appear to show Israeli officers battling some of that group. Two officers were injured. At least two dozen were injured.
 
CNN's Hadas Gold is in Tel Aviv. Hadas, give us a sense of what led up to this?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, it's been tense here for a while now. We've been reporting on the ongoing violence and tension and there had been sort of an expectation that something could erupt especially at the holy sites in Jerusalem at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound that's also known as the temple mount to Jews very holy to both religions.
 
But I think the level of what we saw overnight, that was surprising. Now there have been groups of people who have been staying inside the mosque overnight, they have been answering calls they say to defend what they believe is defending the mosque from what they are afraid of Jewish extremists who have made calls for Jewish -- for Jews to go up to the compound.
 
Some even wanting to bring goats for some sort of very, very ancient ritual sacrifice. But what happened overnight is Israeli police saying that after trying to get the group out, they entered with force. Now I should note that these videos of seeing Israeli police entering with force into the mosque itself.
 
You can see them met with fireworks that ricochet off the walls, the Israeli police according to eyewitnesses, firing stun grenades as well as rubber bullets. And they also arrested, John, more than 350 people as a result of this incident. That's a massive number of people have arrested and we're even seeing videos and images of them being arrested and placed on the ground of the mosque itself.
 
Now to give you some context about why this is so controversial. Obviously, these sites are incredibly sensitive. There is a long running status quo that governs the site. The Israeli police even stepping foot into the mosque itself is considered a violation of it, considered very offensive and provocative. And then their actions after the fact, you know, coming in with some grenades and rubber bullets, no matter what else was happening at the mosque is considered a step even further. And that's why we're seeing condemnation from the likes of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
 
Now we just heard from the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs saying violence has no place in a holy site and during a holy season. They say they're alarmed by the shocking scenes at Al-Aqsa Mosque. And they also referenced the rockets that were launched overnight because shortly after that incident, there was a response from Gaza.
 
Militants they're flying nine rockets into Israel. The Israeli military responding with airstrikes in Gaza. No injuries reported on either side, John, but a lot of concern that this could only further spiral into something even bigger. John?
 
BERMAN: You know, here we are in his Ramadan, Easter Week, Passover all at the same time.
 
Hadas Gold, thank you very much. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is in Poland today for his first official visit there since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began. Poland's president is honoring the visit and Zelenskyy by giving him the Order of the White Eagle considered Poland's oldest and highest honor.
 
CNN's David McKenzie is following this important visit from Kyiv. He joins us now. David, at the same time, Vladimir Putin is meeting the President of Belarus a little later. What do you make of this contrast now?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you're seeing the sides being drawn and continue to solidify I think, Kate, and this is a very important meeting our President Zelenskyy with the First Lady in Poland, his first official state visit there since this war began as it were.
 
And he thanked the Polish president for two things I think. One, the humanitarian gesture of ordinary Polish people taking in up a million refugees that fled this country over the western border at the start of this conflict and were welcomed with open arms in Poland.
 <br>[09:45:08]
 
And also, the fact that Poland has been on the edge of assistance pushing other allies in Western Europe and of course, the U.S. to give more weapons, more assistance, more money to both prop up the economy of this country and help them fight the Russian invasion. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: And David, the Biden administration is sending some more aid, some more weapons. They just announced another $2.6 billion in military aid for Ukraine. What's included in this one?
 
MCKENZIE: Well, that's billion with a B, and it's another extensive expansion of the military assistance from the U.S. to the Ukrainian nation. Now the White House announced that this is at least $500 million in drawdown, so that means they are taking weapons from the existing stockpile of the U.S. military and giving them to Ukraine, including HIMARS systems, Patriot munitions, that's the sophisticated anti-missile system that the Ukrainians have been training on.
 
There's also more than 2 billion given to the strategic fund that has been used by Ukraine and its allies to give both short term assistance when it comes to weapons and ammunition as well as long term security for this country as this war drags on. I think what is important to notice here is that, Kate, they are giving both attack weapons and defensive weapons, including material that could be used in a counter offensive in the coming weeks and months. Kate?
 
BOLDUAN: David, it's good to see you. Thank you. Sara?
 
SIDNER: Coming up, coronation for a king. The official invitation for the King Charles as big day as he has been finally released. Find out the who's who on the guest list.
 
And former President Donald Trump denies all wrongdoing pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges. We'll fact check that speech that he gave to supporters after he was charged.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:50:58]
 
SIDNER: The countdown is on for the coronation of Britain's King Charles. This will be the first time England has had a king since 1952. Here's a first look at that royal invitation that Buckingham Palace just released. The coronation will happen on May 6 at Westminster Abbey where it's been held for about 900 years.
 
The invite marks the first time King Charles' wife is officially referred to as Queen Camilla. She took on the title of Queen Concert after the death of the King's Mother Queen Elizabeth.
 
CNN Royal Correspondent Max Foster joins us now from London. Max, referring to the King's wife as Queen, isn't normally controversial, but it is this time. What's happening?
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's a long story. There's one bit of card here, Sara, and there's an awful lot in it. They haven't been sent out by the way yet. So you might be receiving yours. There's a hottest invitation on the planet right now.
 
But there's a huge amount in there. And we all focused in basically on that top right hand corner part where it say Queen Camilla. So when this was initially announced, Camilla's title, it was announced by Queen Elizabeth II. She said she would like Camilla to eventually become known as Queen Consort. That is a title that exists for kings basically.
 
They are the consort to the king. So Queen Consort, but traditionally, they become known as Queen Elizabeth or Queen Camilla. You know, however, you want to look at it, but we were told that she would continue to be Queen Consort. This is the first time she's been called Queen Camilla. And the reason is controversial, partly because Queen Elizabeth said she should be known as Queen Consort. But because of the shadows of Diana, we all imagined Diana as the future queen. Are we willing to accept Camilla in what was a position destined for Diana?
 
SIDNER: Well, clearly, the person who's about to become king, King Charles, wants that to happen and it is. Looking at that invitation that I think you're going to get sent to my mother, not to me, it's very intricate. There's so much going on there. There's a significance to this, correct?
 
FOSTER: Oh, so much significance. I don't know how deeply you want me to go, Sara. But there's a little green man at the bottom that is not a sort of reincarnation of Charles, that is an ancient mythical British figure representing rebirth. So a new reign.
 
If you look around the edge, lots of flowers and wild birds and things. That's the sort of thing that Charles has passion for, but the flowers are all bunched into threes, because it's Charles III. And amongst all of that, you'll see a unicorn, a boar, a lion, they are all represented in Camilla and Charles's coats of arms as loads more, but I'll bore you to death with it. But there's a huge amount of work that's gone into it.
 
SIDNER: Perhaps one day, we'll talk about your coat of arms. Let's also talk about the new picture that's out of Charles and Camilla.
 
FOSTER: Yes, well, this is just a photo that came with the invitation. The invitation so let's say going to go out a couple of weeks before the coronation. We also got a bit more detail about what it will look like. A lot of questions about how William's children would be represented particularly George.
 
I think there's a real sense that George should be part of this in some way for him, that he could see a future coronation. He's going to be, you know, crowned as well when his time comes. So he's going to be a page walking behind Charles and Camilla, also alongside him Camilla's grandchildren. So her family very much being brought into this.
 
SIDNER: First Lady Jill Biden expected to attend the coronation. But her husband, President Biden isn't going to be there. Is that sort of the normal course over the history of these coronations?
 
FOSTER: Well, you know, there's a bit -- people are saying today that, you know, presidents hadn't gone to coronations before. There hadn't been a huge amount of them of course. We were expecting President Biden to be invited, and we were hoping that he would come but Jill Biden will be coming as the head of the U.S. delegation.
 
So I don't know how much you can read into that. I think he's probably just busy. I don't think it's necessarily that you're not expected to come if you're a U.S. President.
 
SIDNER: Max Foster, you are the best man for the job. Thank you so much for explaining all that. The invitation is so a complicated, Kate. It's pretty cool.
 <br>[09:55:02]
 
BOLDUAN: Complicated and cool. And no matter what, it all these major events the kids and how they act and the hilarity that ensues.
 
SIDNER: That's what we all want.
 
BOLDUAN: No matter the controversy we can get into that. But they're super cute and I always enjoy.
