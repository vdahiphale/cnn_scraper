PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR:  -- new details and we're going to bring you that new reporting right after this quick break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record and some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN:  That was Vice President Kamala Harris road testing her campaign's newest messaging strategy, painting Donald Trump as "just plain weird," as you just heard it. Objectively, much of what the former president said over the weekend was still unconventional, at least for any other presidential candidate. To list just one example, he once again spoke at length about fictional serial killers, now a hallmark of his stump speech.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Dr. Hannibal Lecter, you know who that was. Well, you see, he was a slightly troubled patient in an insane asylum, and he'd love to have you for dinner. You right there.
 
Elvis had a guitar. He had a lot. We love Elvis, right? But he had a guitar. I don't have a guitar. I can hit the crap out of the ball. I'm good. I shoot good scores.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BROWN:  All right. Let's discuss with CNN global commentators Maria Cardona and Shermichael Singleton. Shermichael Singleton, I want to go to you first as a Republican. I mean, we just heard what -- it was objectively straight. I mean, it kind of breaks your brain to try to understand what he was -- 
 
SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  It's interesting the, I guess, comedy a little bit that Trump is sort of playing around with that, some of these rallies with Hannibal Lecter. It was a new a new one that I've never heard before. I don't know where -- what the angle here is. I'm assuming it's just to excite people. Vice President Harris and the weird, you know, she's testing out some messaging here as well.
 
BROWN:  But is he giving her -- 
 
SINGLETON:  I mean, look, I think maybe it plays into it a little bit. But then I think on the other side, Republicans will say the best they got, it's just weird. I mean, I think both sides will point this contrasting picture that the messaging isn't quite where it needs to be. The fundamentals, I think, haven't changed the economy, inflation, cost of living, immigration, foreign policy, and that's where I think we'll see over the next several weeks, both candidates will probably hone in more on that message.
 
MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You know, I actually think, though, that Donald Trump saying those things, you know, we can all laugh about it and chuckle, but it kind of plays into something that a lot of the electorate already believes about him.
 
I mean, Hannibal Lecter, he even talks about how he's comes from an insane asylum. I don't know why he's obsessed with him. Birds of a feather maybe.
 
SINGLETON:  Maybe he likes the movie, Maria.
 
CARDONA:  I don't know. And so, I think, it focuses on the fact that Donald Trump is unhinged, not fit to be president of the United States. And this, while, you know, Vice President Harris will point out that it's weird because it's freaking weird, but it will go to the bigger themes and messages that you just talked about, Shermichael. But I think in a broader way, it is -- it goes back to -- 
 
SINGLETON:  Can you joke a little bit, Maria?
 
CARDONA:  It goes back to the fact that he is completely unfit for office.
 
BROWN:  Well, and I know -- and, you know, as you said, look, we're laughing about this, but you do have to take a step back and look at the larger picture here, right? He said when he invoked Hannibal Lecter, I mentioned him because we have people like that coming into our country. And when you put that into context, right, of him saying previously that immigrants coming into our country are tainting the blood of this country, right, evoking Hitler. You have him saying things like this. Do you find that dehumanizing? SINGLETON:  I mean, I think the point that the former president is attempting to make is that immigration is a problem. We've had an unfettered, for the most part, open border, where millions of individuals over the past -- close to four years have come into the country, we've seen a heightened number compared to previous administrations.
 
And there are Americans in the suburbs, in rural areas, in urban areas, who are indeed concerned about this influx of people coming into the country, not because we are anti-immigration, but because people would like to see a systematic reproach, if you will, to the overhaul of the immigration system, generally speaking. And I think that's the point.
 
BROWN:  But do you think dehumanizing them is the best way to get that message across? I'm just wondering for you as a Republican.
 
SINGLETON:  I think everyone is going to look at it differently. Some people will find it dehumanizing, others will say the former president is speaking directly, frankly, and truth to power. I think it depends on the individuals taking in the message.
 
CARDONA:  Let me talk about the communities that find it dehumanizing. My community finds it dehumanizing. I am an immigrant. And people will say, oh, but you came here legally. Do you think that the people out there that Donald Trump is talking to who -- when he says there's an invasion, these immigrants are coming and they're coming from insane asylums and they're all criminals and they're going to rape all your women, do you think that when I go out to Virginia or to another red, rural state where there are perhaps MAGA supporters and they hear me talking Spanish to my kids, do you think they're going to make a difference? They're going to differentiate between perhaps me being here legal or not being here legally?
 
That's what inspires the shooting in El Paso. That's what inspires people to commit crimes against immigrants. So, you are absolutely right, Pam. It is dehumanizing. It is demeaning. It completely takes away the humanity from a huge group of people who have injected trillions of dollars to our economy.
 
BROWN:  Millions of Americans agree with him when he -- I mean, the polls show after he said, you know, immigrants were tainting the blood of this country, polls show that millions of Americans -- 
 
CARDONA:  Well, but that's actually not true.
 
SINGLETON:  And not just Republicans.
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
CARDONA:  And I do have to come in here to say those polls are completely misguided, Pam, because what actually we have shown with polls is that the vast majority of Americans want a common-sense, balanced approach to immigration, where there's increased border security.
 
SINGLETON:  Well, which is what I stated. Which is what I stated.
 
CARDONA:  That's true. But that's not what Donald Trump is talking about. The mass deportation camps that he is focused on, that is not what the mass -- what the majority of Americans want. They want a common-sense approach that is strong on border security, but that expands legal pathways.
 
And then, just one other quick thing. The numbers of illegal crossings right now are lower than what they were when Donald Trump left office.
 
SINGLETON:  Yes. Maria -- 
 
CARDONA:  There's a lot of lies going on here.
 
BROWN:  The numbers are going down. And there's -- 
 
SINGLETON:  If I can interject quickly here.
 
BROWN:  Yes. Go. Please go.
 
SINGLETON:  Over the past three and a half years though, was my point early on, that we have seen a significant number of individuals coming to the country illegally. And I agree that I think most Americans would probably acknowledge that individuals are coming here for a better life, to escape poverty, crime, et cetera, and we should be that beacon on the hill that's welcoming.
 
CARDONA:  That's right.
 
SINGLETON:  But I don't think you can dismiss the fact that having such a large influx does put a strain on local resources, whether it's housing, whether it's affordable care, whether it's providing substance for food -- subsidies for food rather. And so, those are things that individuals living in impoverished areas, rural areas will look at those things. And so, we're already living in an economy that's burdened by inflation. Do we have enough resources to share with those? And I think that's a very legitimate critique.
 
CARDONA:  It is. That's true.
 
BROWN:  And just to follow up, what I was citing was, there was a "Washington Post" had that half of Americans had agreed with Trump when he made those comments. I just wanted to point out where I was getting that from. Half Americans.
 
CARDONA:  Sure.
 
BROWN:  So, I just like to make sure that we are rooted in the data and the facts here with our discussion.
 
SINGLETON:  Yes, yes. We're accurate. Of course.
 
BROWN:  But I do wonder, as we talk about immigration, I actually hadn't planned on this conversation being about that, right? But we have to go with the flow and where the conversation goes.
 
CARDONA:  And it's an important topic.
 
BROWN:  And it is an important topic.
 
CARDONA:  Yes.
 
BROWN:  Especially as you see the Trump campaign going after Harris.
 
CARDONA:  Yes.
 
BROWN:  And saying, you know, look at her failed policy. She's the borders are, you know, look at the failed policy at the border. How effective is that strategy, you think?
 
CARDONA:  It will not be effective if the vice president leans into the facts, and I hope that she does. And we just talked about one. Crossings today are lower than they were when Donald Trump left office. She was never the borders are, but that's not the point. The point is that she along with President Biden and Democrats, frankly, are focused on solutions, on a common-sense, balanced approach that includes strong border security and expanded legal pathways.
 
And do you know what they absolutely need to lean into? If Donald Trump and Republicans were so concerned about illegal immigration, they would not have turned their back on the strong border security bill that their own conservative senators had negotiated with Democrats. He said, he wasn't even put -- trying to, you know, put anything on this, trying to lie about it. He said, I need this issue for the election.
 
Do not give this win to President Biden and the Democrats. I need this issue. That means to me, he wants to use this as a weapon and does not care at all about the solutions.
 
BROWN:  I want you to weight in, but I also want you to weigh on who you think Harris' pick for VP, who could be the most threatening for Republicans.
 
SINGLETON:  So, quickly, I will just say on the immigration front, you guys at two years where you control the House and the Senate, you could have easily have done something with majority support. You wouldn't have relied on Republicans at all. So, I don't think it's fair to blame -- 
 
CARDONA:  We didn't have 60.
 
SINGLETON:  -- Republicans.
 
CARDONA:  We did not have 60 senators in the Senate.
 
SINGLETON:  But you had enough Democrats, and you could have broken the filibuster if you guys so chose.
 
CARDONA:  We did not -- 
 
SINGLETON:  I mean, Harry Reid did it before.
 
CARDONA:  Come on, Shermichael. We did not have 60 senators.
 
SINGLETON:  Harry Reid did it before. So, you could have easily have done that if you guys wanted to.
 
CARDONA:  And if you're saying that -- you're proving right there that Republicans are not interested.
 
SINGLETON:  I'm not proving anything. What I'm proving is that the first two years -- 
 
CARDONA:  No, no. No, no. When you're saying -- 
 
SINGLETON:  -- you guys could have passed comprehensive immigration reform.
 
CARDONA:  When you say, you guys could have done this on your own, this is not a Democratic problem. This is an American problem. Republicans need to be included in the solution or else you're proving that you guys don't want solutions.
 
SINGLETON:  I don't disagree with your appeals to bipartisanship. I think it's important. But my point is -- 
 
CARDONA:  We don't get that with Republicans.
 
SINGLETON:  But wait a minute. My point is, if you have a legislative priority and you had two years to accomplish that priority, and you did not, I think it's a bit ludicrous to try to blame Republicans when you could have done it on your own.
 
CARDONA:  It's not when Republicans are also responsible and should have some kind of interest in trying to solve this for the country.
 
SINGLETON:  So, Democrats -- 
 
CARDONA:  It proves their point that you don't care about it.
 
SINGLETON:  So, it didn't matter that Democrats didn't do anything for two years?
 
CARDONA:  That's not true. We absolutely tried to do something for two years.
 
SINGLETON:  You guys didn't propose major comprehensive legislation? Why didn't you pass it?
 
CARDONA:  The first thing that President Biden did when he was in office was present a bill, an immigration bill.
 
SINGLETON:  So, why didn't Congress pass it?
 
CARDONA:  Because Republicans had no interest in trying to work with Democrats.
 
SINGLETON:  Republicans? We didn't control the Senate. We don't control the Senate now. CARDONA:  Republicans had no interest in trying to work with Democrats on this.
 
SINGLETON:  So, you couldn't have broken the filibuster?
 
CARDONA:  This is a Republican and Democratic problem.
 
SINGLETON:  Oh, Maria, come on. That is not fair.
 
CARDONA:  No, it absolutely is fair because -- 
 
BROWN:  OK. Hold on.
 
CARDONA:  You guys don't want to solve this.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
BROWN:  So -- but I really do -- quickly. I never even got to the other question.
 
SINGLETON:  I'm sorry, Pam.
 
BROWN:  Well, you know what, it's an important discussion to have.
 
CARDONA:  It is an important discussion.
 
SINGLETON:  It is, it is.
 
BROWN:  And it's a big part of this election and what voters are talking about. So, I'm glad we had that discussion. But, as we look ahead to this week, we are expecting Kamala Harris to announce her VP pick, potentially this week or very soon, right? Time is of the essence. Who do you think Republicans would be most worried about?
 
SINGLETON:  I mean, I wouldn't say most worried about, I'm just going to look at this a little differently. If I was a strategist, I'm looking at probably a governor, someone with executive experience, preferably from a battleground state, maybe someone like Andy Beshear.
 
One of my concerns, if I were on the Democratic side, would be how well does Vice President Harris appeal to men, working class white voters. I would want someone to potentially shore up those numbers. So, looking at a governor who's somewhat from a rust belt or from a state that sort of represents that demographic more, I think could lead to some type of advantage for the vice president.
 
BROWN:  Maria?
 
CARDONA:  I think everyone that is being considered, we have a plethora of riches. Every single one of them will be a great partner for the vice president. And every single one of them has shown that they can prosecute this case against Donald Trump and J. D. Vance.
 
SINGLETON:  But some are better than the others.
 
CARDONA:  That they're not fit for office. SINGLETON:  But some are better than the others. We have to be honest, right? And if you're looking at -- we're looking at some of her weaknesses, I think there are a handful, Bashear, maybe Mark Kelly, former veteran, he could appeal to men. I mean, there's certain things that I'm looking at as a strategist and I'm thinking, OK, this would be smart for Democrats to play to that base if they choose that particular candidate.
 
BROWN:  All right. Maria, Shermichael, thank you.
 
SINGLETON:  Some bipartisanship at the end, right?
 
BROWN:  Yes, exactly. Good note to end on. Bipartisan.
 
CARDONA:  Thanks, Pam.
 
BROWN:  Much appreciated.
 
SINGLETON:  Thanks, Pam.
 
BROWN:  Well, the 99 days until the election, how the campaigns are adjusting to a presidential race unlike any other in history.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
BROWN:  Following an action-packed opening weekend in Paris, officials say they are confident triathlon events will take place tomorrow. That is despite the fact that a training session in the River Seine was canceled for a second day due to poor water quality. In the pool, British divers Tom Daley and Noah Williams took home silver in the men's synchronized platform event.
 
And then later today, American Jagger Eaton is going for gold in the men's street skateboarding final set to kick off in just a few minutes. And the U.S. women's basketball team will make its debut versus Japan. But right now, the U.S. is in first place for total medal count at 12, while China leads the pack in gold medals with five.
 
Simone Biles making a dominant return to the Olympic stage. The superstar put the go and GOAT fighting through an apparent leg injury to help propel Team USA to the top of the leaderboard at the end of Sunday's qualifying round. CNN's Coy Wire is live in Paris for us. Coy, Biles is already making her mark on these games pretty spectacularly.
 
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  I like what you did there. Put the go and GOAT.
 
BROWN:  Yes, right?
 
WIRE:  And it was so much hype surrounding the greatest gymnast of all time. I talked to a two-time Olympic gold medalist who said they and other former Olympians couldn't even get tickets to get in to see the team qualifiers yesterday, Simone Biles comeback tour.
 
But during warm ups, she injured herself. She's limping. The arena gets quiet, but the GOAT rises up, gets taped up, and dominates. Her coach said that it's a lingering cap injury, but Biles put on that iconic performance. And, Pam, she said that she's been inspired by those who came before her. Weren't many gymnasts that look like her growing up. Now, she is inspiring the next generation. Four of the five Team USA gymnasts are women of color. It's the most diverse team in history.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SIMONE BILES, U.S. OLYMPIC GYMNAST:  I know what it's like being the only black girl on the team and not having a role model.
 
WIRE (voice-over):  Sometimes you have to see it before you can truly believe it.
 
CORRINNE TARVER, GYMNASTICS COACH, FORMER NCAA GYMNASTICS CHAMPION: It is so gratifying to see such a diverse group of women who are going to represent this country. And it truly shows that as a sport, we have come a long way.
 
WIRE (voice-over):  Four-time Olympic medalist Dominique Dawes was the first black female gymnast to ever win an individual medal at the Olympics at the Atlanta Games in 1996. At the 2012 London Games, Gabby Douglas became the first black gymnast to win an Olympic all-around competition. Fast forward to today, and four of the five U.S. Women's Olympic Gymnastics team competing in Paris are women of color. It's their most racially diverse team in history.
 
TARVER:  I was trying not to cry, honestly, when I saw the makeup of the team. I just kind of felt -- like in my heart, I truly felt, wow, we finally gotten somewhere. We're finally able to truly show the talent that we had. And it has nothing to do with the color of one's skin, it has to do with what they do on the mat.
 
WIRE (voice-over):  This year's squad, seven-time Olympic medalist, Simone Biles, reigning all around Olympic champ Suni Lee, reigning Olympic floor champ Jade Carey, 2020 Olympic team silver medalist Jordan Chiles, and rookie Hezley Rivera, the youngest member of the entire Team USA delegation.
 
BETTY OKINO, FORMER U.S. OLYMPIC GYMNAST:  The next generation of kids growing up, that's not a question anymore if they can do gymnastics, because they don't see anybody else that looks like them. You look at our team, our national team, and you see diversity across the board, not only black and brown girls, but you see all of the different colors.
 
JORDAN CHILES, U.S. OLYMPIC GYMNAST:  When you see yourself in somebody else, and somebody else can see themselves in you, like, I think it only makes you feel, wow, like, I've done something in this world. I've been able to change, like, the culture in something, or the diversity in something. So, I just hope I just hope I can continue to, you know, be that little light for them. (END VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
WIRE (on camera):  Pamela, the U.S. qualified for a team final tomorrow, four of the five gymnasts qualifying for individual finals as well with Biles competing in four of the five individual events. So, plenty of chances for more gold for the GOAT here in Paris.
 
BROWN:  All right. Coy Wire, you've got a great assignment there in Paris. Thanks so much.
 
WIRE:  Thanks, Pamela.
 
BROWN:  And coming up on this Monday, art imitating life? Well, sort of. The showrunner, I should say, for the hit show "Veep," joins us next to talk about the boost in viewership after Biden dropped out. We'll be right back.
