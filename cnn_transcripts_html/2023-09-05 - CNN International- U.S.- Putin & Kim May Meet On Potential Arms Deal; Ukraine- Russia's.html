MAX FOSTER, CNN HOST: Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. 
 
Just ahead, finding a common cause. Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un may meet to discuss arms for the Ukraine war. Reviving the Black Sea grain deal Russia says it could happen, but only with major strings attached and Ukraine calls that blackmail.
 
And African leaders work to deliver a unified message. The summit in Kenya is the perfect place to talk climate investment. We're live in Nairobi.
 
Well, the Kremlin is keeping quiet about a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. The U.S. government believes Kim may travel to Russia, likely to discuss providing arms to Moscow for its war in Ukraine.
 
Here you can see a 2019 meeting between Kim and Putin in Russia's Far East. The U.S. National Security Council warns arms talks are actively advancing, but there's no word yet on precisely when the expected meeting might take place.
 
Kylie Atwood has been following the story and joins us from the U.S. State Department. What are your sources telling you, Kylie?
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, Adrienne Watson, who's the spokesperson for the NSC, is saying that it's Kim Jong-un who is expecting to meet with President Putin in Russia. Now, that's according to information that the U.S. has. It comes on the heels of U.S. officials warning, as you have said, that the two countries have been actively advancing the possibility of a new arms agreement between them.
 
And we know that last year, North Korea did provide Russia with some weaponry, some battlefield infantry weaponry to be used in the war in Ukraine. And the expectation now is that they're moving towards another potential deal. Now, U.S. officials are very clearly warning North Korea to back off, to cease these negotiations, threatening sanctions if they do go ahead with this.
 
But as of now, what U.S. officials are saying is that the expectation is that this potential new deal would include a significant amount of ammunition for multiple different types of Russian weapon systems, and also the possibility of new raw materials for Russia's defense sector. And that's significant, of course, because we know that Russia is facing so many sanctions so actually, you know, supplying and building up its defense sector has been a challenge.
 
So turning to North Korea here appears to be, you know, one of their only options, frankly. The NSC is calling this a desperate attempt on behalf of Russia. And we should note that we have actually seen a flurry of activity between the two countries leading up to what is this potential meeting between the two leaders.
 
The Russian Defense Minister Shoigu traveled to North Korea back in July, according to the NSC. That was an effort to try and convince North Korea to go ahead with the sale of ammunition to Russia. We also know that there were additional Russian officials who also traveled to North Korea following that visit.
 
And there have actually been letters that have been exchanged in recent months between President Putin and Kim Jong-un talking about advancing the bilateral ties between the two countries. So all, you know, indications here are that this is moving forward.
 
The U.S. is trying to warn North Korea not to go ahead with this, but we will continue to watch for when this potential engagement between the two leaders actually happens. The New York Times saying that it could happen as soon as this month.
 
FOSTER: OK, Kylie, thank you so much for that.
 
Russia says it shot down at least three drones targeting Moscow that were launched from Ukraine early on Tuesday. The country's Defense Ministry also claims a drone was destroyed over Crimea.
 
Meanwhile, Kiev is calling the Kremlin's conditions to revive the Black Sea grain deal, quote, "blackmail". Vladimir Putin told his Turkish counterpart, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Monday that Moscow won't re-enter the agreement until Western restrictions on Russia's agricultural exports are lifted.
 
CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us now. Russia basically trying to make the deal work for them potentially better than it does for Ukraine.
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, that's the nature of negotiations, right, Max? And President Erdogan is ultimately in this a mediator. He is trying to find the middle ground, and in doing that, he is absolutely toeing the line.
 
It is President Erdogan who was originally the key mediator in this Black Sea Grain Initiative at a time when Western officials were accusing Russia of using food as a weapon of war, of blockading the all-important grain exports from Ukraine, causing prices of grain of food to skyrocket in parts of the Middle East and Africa.
 <br>[08:05:19]
 
Now we're looking at a very different period in time, Max. Global food prices have stabilized somewhat since this deal collapsed a few months ago. There's still, of course, a sense of urgency. Ukraine is pointing to the fact that Russia is attacking many of the ports that would be used to export drain -- grain rather -- on the Danube River and along the Black Sea.
 
But President Putin is blaming the west for the collapse of the deal. He says promises that Russian exports of agriculture would be eased have not come through. And the main thing to take away from this is President Putin's reaction is to try to pursue unilateral action, if you will.
 
Russia says that it is working on providing for free grain to several African countries, that it will do those exports on its own, independently. President Erdogan obviously in this meeting in Sochi, there were high expectations, but very little that seems to be moving forward. And you have to remember, meanwhile, of course, food, we're talking about, grain, is yet again being used in this war as a bargaining chip.
 
FOSTER: OK, Salma, thank you so much for that.
 
One of the main goals of this week's Africa Climate Summit is to attract investment and unleash Africa's potential when it comes to renewable energy. It looks like it may be making some progress on that front, too.
 
On Tuesday, the U.S. pledged $30 million to help the continent deal with climate change, especially in the area of food security. But it was the UAE that really turned heads when it announced a $4.5 billion pledge to help develop clean energy on the African continent.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo, who's been speaking to delegates there in Nairobi. Hi, Larry.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Max. That's a very big announcement from the UAE. The U.S. announcement is $30 million to help African countries deal with food security because of climate change is also welcome but it's a drop in the ocean.
 
But what African countries are hoping to do here is to agree on a common platform going to COP 28. Africa's carbon footprint is very minimal, only 3 percent of greenhouse emissions. But the vast impact of the climate crisis here cannot be overstated.
 
I want to talk to one of the young people here. Elizabeth Wathuti is a Kenyan climate activist. You spoke here yesterday, Elizabeth, what is your message to the world?
 
ELIZABETH WATHUTI, FOUNDER, GREEN GENERATION INITIATIVE KENYA: Thank you, Larry, and it's good to see you again in Nairobi.
 
MADOWO: At home.
 
WATHUTI: Yes. So I spoke yesterday, and this is just right after we had a three-day African Youth Climate Assembly, where young people in the African continent have come together to unite and amplify their voices as one. And you had really key messages.
 
And one of them is that young people do not want to anymore watch from the sidelines or just be conference attendees, but we want to be part of the climate and environmental decision making frameworks. So we were seeking for systemic embedment whereby young people exist in the existing frameworks, especially in the African Union.
 
MADOWO: Right.
 
WATHUTI: And we also pushed for resources whereby we are looking for intergenerational green investment bank and fund that allows young people to unlock the opportunities for improving the green growth agenda for Africa.
 
MADOWO: You spoke at COP 27. You speak at a lot of environmental sessions around the world. Do you feel that what Africa's message is around loss and damage, around money for adaptation is getting heard?
 
WATHUTI: I think right now we have a really big opportunity, especially within this summit, to come together as a continent and shape our narrative, shape our agenda. And as the theme is saying, it's African led solutions to global challenges.
 
And I think if we take it as an opportunity to showcase Africa's resources, then we can be able to make things happen for our continent. And young people are leading the change. And in fact, Larry, young people are the greatest assets that the African continent has. And I strongly believe that if we empower and invest in young people to continue leading the solutions, then we're going to make change happen in our continent.
 
MADOWO: Elizabeth Wathuti, thank you so much for talking to us.
 
The young people want to be at the center of these conversations, which is a message you hear, Max, for the women want to be included, the young people, the urban poor, and they hope that in these all discussions, they're not on the sidelines.
 
FOSTER: Absolutely. Larry, thank you so much for joining us from Nairobi.
 
To Indonesia now, though, where leaders from Southeast Asian nations have gathered in Jakarta for the ASEAN summit. The meeting comes amid rifts within member states over stalled peace efforts in Myanmar and other regional and international issues. Tensions on the Korean peninsula and concerns over the status of Taiwan are also likely to be discussed.
 
CNN Steven Jiang has the latest for you from Beijing. STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Myanmar and several issues involving China very much looming large over this summit.
 <br>[08:10:01]
 
Now remember, Myanmar is still very much in crisis mode more than two years after the military there overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and the bloody coup. And several ASEAN members, especially the Philippines and Vietnam, have had long standing territorial disputes with Beijing over the South China Sea, with some recent flare ups in the region, for example, when Chinese coast guards used water cannons to prevent the Philippines from supplying one of their ships there.
 
And also Vietnam actually banning the movie "Barbie" over a map purportedly showing the Chinese claim. And then, of course, there is this dilemma faced by a growing number of countries around the world, but especially ASEAN members, given their very close economic and trade ties with Beijing. That is the role and choice in this increasingly heated U.S.-China competition, with tension very much remaining high between Beijing and Washington.
 
So it is against this backdrop that U.S. president Joe Biden's absence is made more conspicuous, given that Mr. Biden has in the past attended a summit in person. Now, that has led to some analysts to question the bloc's relevance and the White House priority in this region.
 
Now the U.S. government very much pushing back this notion, pointing to Mr. Biden's track record, and also that he actually hosted eight of the 10 ASEAN leaders in the White House just last year.
 
Now, in this place, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is attending meetings in Jakarta. And coincidentally, China is also sending its number two leader, Premier Li Qiang, to Jakarta. So a lot of scrutiny over all these potential interactions between all the leaders in the next few days at a time when the ASEAN leaders very much trying to present an image of unity and relevance with a focus on economic growth in this increasingly fractured world.
 
Stephen Jiang, CNN, Beijing.
 
FOSTER: Typhoon Haikui has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall early Tuesday in southern China. As much as 250 millimeters rainfall has already been reported, and the storm continues to drench the region.
 
Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is following two big weather stories for us. Greece just can't seem to catch a break either. Also a potentially dangerous storm pounding the country in the wake of those devastating wildfires. First of all, Haikui, though, and -- 
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. Here's the details on that, Max. It is dissipating, as you said, tropical depression. But this, remember, is coming on the heels of another typhoon that impacted the Fujian province late in July. So very saturated environment that was Doksuri that made landfall just to the north of where the current tropical depression has made landfall.
 
Now look at the rainfall totals here. We're going to -- actually over 1,000 millimeters in some of these locations across the Fujian province and into Taiwan. Mountainous terrain here kind of wringing out the available moisture in the atmosphere. Still more rain to come, another 150 to 250 millimeters in some of these hard hit areas north of Hong Kong. And you can see how the rainfall moves inland as well.
 
Now, Max mentioned the heavy rainfall threat across Greece. This is something that's kind of unfolding as we're on air right now as a large low pressure system across the eastern Mediterranean continues to fuel itself from the warmer waters above average too.
 
You can see the satellite loop and that counterclockwise rotation. Here's the latest radar from Greece. And some of these rainfall totals might be underdone as well. This is the past 24 hours, over 200 millimeters in some locations. But look at how that rain is just impacting the same location on this radar loop.
 
So we anticipate some of those rainfall totals hereto go up in the hours to come. But the problem here is that the potential for flash flooding and mudslides and debris flows definitely exists within this area. Specifically where we've highlighted that shading of red, that is where we have excessive rain that is ongoing.
 
And some of the pictures that we're seeing on social media right now indicating that as well. We're trying to get those cleared. Here's the additional rainfall that will fall on top of what's already taken place. And these are just off the chart numbers. I mean, we're talking 150 to 250 millimeters of rain for eastern sections of Greece.
 
And this is just north of Athens, by the way. And this region has been impacted by wildfires, as you know, Max. So having rain on top of burn scars creates mud flows and debris flows that can be very dangerous sometimes traveling over 50 kilometers per hour down those mountain slopes.
 
FOSTER: Yes, a huge amount for them to deal with. Derek, thank you so much for bringing us all of that.
 
Thousands of partygoers finally able to leave the mud soaked Burning Man Festival in the Nevada desert. The highlight of the counterculture event came on Monday night when the giant wooden effigy known as the man was set on fire. It happened a day later, though -- day later than planned after torrential downpours upended the event.
 
But attendees were told yesterday the mud had dried enough for them to begin the trip home. More than 70,000 people were effectively trapped over the weekend when heavy rain made it impossible to drive back out on those dirt roads.
 <br>[08:15:03]
 
Still to come, as North Korea and Russia reportedly work towards an arms deal, we ask what Pyongyang is getting from their growing friendship. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Returning now to our top story, U.S. officials are warning that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may travel to Russia to negotiate an arms deal with Vladimir Putin. We don't know yet when that meeting might take place, but there are reports it could happen this month. The two allies have been growing ever closer since Russia invaded Ukraine last year.
 
According to U.S. officials, North Korea has already delivered rockets and missiles for use by Russia's Wagner fighters. This potential new deal is expected to include artillery ammunition needed by Russia. So what's Pyongyang getting from its growing partnership with Moscow?
 
I want to bring in CNN's Paula Hancocks in Seoul. Presumably, there's going to be some sort of weaponry or technology coming back the other way.
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's certainly what the fear is at this point, Max. We've heard from two U.S. officials that they believe some of the technology that Pyongyang could get from Moscow, if this deal goes ahead, is going to be able to further its nuclear and missile capabilities.
 
Now, the potential for satellite launches is something and a technology that North Korea needs help with. It's tried twice over recent months to launch what it said was a military satellite into space. Both times that has failed. The last time, just last month. So they need more technology know how, and U.S. officials believe that could be one of the deals that they do with Moscow.
 
On top of that, you also have the fact we heard from South Korean intelligence agency just last month that they believe that Pyongyang is looking to know how to be able to repair old equipment, how to have the technical knowhow to be able to do that. So certainly they're looking further long term as to what they can reuse in the future.
 
There are a number of technologies that Moscow could help North Korea with, and that is a great concern to the U.S. and its allies. Max?
 
FOSTER: Also interesting, you know, because traditionally the closest ally has been China, hasn't it? And now they also are building this relationship with Russia so that allows North Korea to counterbalance those two much bigger powers.
 
HANCOCKS: That's right. I mean, the last time that Kim Jong-un met with Vladimir Putin was back in 2019. It was the first time he'd met him. It has been the last time that he met him. And he had been to China a number of times. So clearly the focus had always been on that closer ally.
 
But what we see is, given what has happened over the past four years or so since Kim Jong-un met with Vladimir Putin, a lot has changed. Russia has invaded Ukraine. It is faltering in its military efforts in Ukraine. So really, the status of Kim Jong-un has changed when it comes to his relationship with Vladimir Putin. [08:20:11]
 
All of a sudden, he is needed by a great power in the world. So that is something that North Korea and Kim Jong-un is obviously going to be trying to exploit. It can also get more oil from Russia. At the moment, its oil is coming from China, and Beijing can decide how much it allows Pyongyang to have at any one time.
 
It is also always good for Pyongyang to be wanting to try and counter that reliance it has on China. So that is clearly going to be one of the factors that Kim Jong-un will think about as well, to have two allies, two large allies in the region, both of which are able to give it technology, oil, potentially cash, and anything else that it might need.
 
FOSTER: OK, Paula Hancocks in Seoul, thank you so much for your analysis today.
 
Coming up, panic buying and empty restaurants. How Japan's release of treated nuclear wastewater is impacting business in China.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Japan is heading back at China over its decision to ban Japanese seafood imports, telling the World Trade Organization the ban is totally unacceptable. Tensions between the two nations have been escalating after Japan began releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima power plant.
 
CNN's Ivan Watson has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Backlash in China over Japan's decision to release treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima power plant into the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese government banning all Japanese seafood imports to prevent the risk of radioactive contamination and to protect the health of Chinese consumers.
 
Fears over Fukushima, prompting panic buying of salt in several cities until authorities reassured the public China consumes mined salt more than sea salt. Ripple effects also felt here at a Japanese food court in Beijing.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I told my daughter that we should go and eat some seafood now while it's still safe and let's not eat it anymore afterwards. Nothing from the ocean is edible from now on.
 
WATSON (voice-over): Fears echoed by her daughter.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Of course, first seafood will be affected, but other crops and food will also be affected later on. It's only a matter of time. WATSON (voice-over): The nuclear controversy, potentially crippling business for this sushi chef. Some customers are disgusted by this news. They no longer want to eat Japanese food, he says. His once busy restaurant, now largely empty.
 
After the pandemic, our business this year has not recovered yet and now with this news from Japan, our business is worse, he says.
 <br>[08:25:06]
 
Some scientists argue these fears are unfounded. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Japan's plan to release wastewater is in line with IAEA standards.
 
RAFAEL GROSSI, IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL: Our cooperation and our presence will help build confidence in Japan and beyond. That the water disposal is carried out without an adverse impact on human health and the environment.
 
WATSON (voice-over): And yet the heavily censored Chinese internet still bubbles with anger at Japan, including prank calls, harassing Japanese businesses.
 
This group of young people are purportedly calling random numbers in Japan.
 
Why do you release nuclear wastewater into the ocean? This young man shouts.
 
Elsewhere, a Chinese restaurant owner makes a show of tearing down Japanese decorations at his Japanese rest. The Chinese government is tolerating these displays of anger at Japan, tacitly encouraging nationalist fervor. Even if it results in empty restaurants at a time when China is increasingly suffering from economic uncertainty.
 
Ivan Watson, CNN Hong Kong.

FOSTER: And finally, nearly a year after her passing, a commemorative coin has been revealed honoring Queen Elizabeth II. They're calling it a coin, but it's really the size of a large dinner plate, as you can see. It's made from almost eight pounds of gold, contains about 6,400 diamonds, and took more than a year to produce. Dubbed, the crown coin, is valued at around $23 million.
 
Thanks for joining me here on CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. World Sport with Coy Wire is up next.
