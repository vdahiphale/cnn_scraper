COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Good morning, sunshine. I`m Coy. Welcome to CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. We are coming to you from Detroit today. 
 
 We`re here to report on the excitement surrounding the Detroit Lions. The city sold out Lions Stadium last night, even though the team played the San 
 
 Francisco 49ers in California for the NFC Championship, the team has brought a sense of hope and unity to the entire city, all season, 
 
 incredible run. Now there`s just one NFL game that remains the Super Bowl in Las Vegas on February 11th.
 
All right, we begin today in the Netherlands where the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to prevent genocide against the Palestinian 
 
 people in their ongoing war in Gaza. But before we get into that news, what exactly is the International Court of Justice? The ICJ is the United 
 
 Nations top court and was created after World War II to address disputes between nations and to give their opinions on international legal issues. 
 
 While these decisions are binding and cannot be appealed, the ICJ has no way to enforce them, but its opinions can heavily influence the U.N. and 
 
 other international institutions. 
 
OK. Back to the most recent news, this began earlier this month after South Africa accused Israel of breaching international laws on genocide against 
 
 the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa wanted the court to issue an emergency order that would force a cease fire. Basically, this would act as 
 
 a restraining order against further military action by Israel in Gaza until the court could consider the full case and that could take years. 
 
Friday, the court`s 17 judge panel did order Israel to, quote, "take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza." But it did not demand a ceasefire. 
 
 And as scrutiny increases on both sides of this war, last week`s ruling leaves, both Israelis and Palestinians with reasons to feel vindicated and 
 
 frustrated.

NADIA SLIMI, CO-ORGANIZER OF THE PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTEST: It feels like a victory and a significant milestone and a -- a step in the right direction 
 
 in the elaboration of the Palestinian people in a way, it is also very disappointing that the court did not rule in favor for, uh, an immediate 
 
 cease fire at this time.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself. The violent attempt to deny Israel this 
 
 fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish State. And it was justly rejected. The charge of genocide level against Israel is not 
 
 only false, it`s outrageous. And decent people everywhere should reject it.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shot. 
 
What percentage of the Earth`s surface is covered with water?
 
50%, 62%, 71%, or 96%?
 
If you said, 71%, put your hands up. That`s according to U.S. Geological Survey. 
 
All right, being up here in Detroit, Michigan, we`re nestled between two of the great lakes, lake Huron and Lake Michigan, both of which become frozen, 
 
 this time of year, at least parts of them. 
 
Well, for our next story, we head to Antarctica where a man from here in Michigan is going viral on TikTok as he`s sharing his research journey, 
 
 searching for the oldest ice on the planet all while battling some exceed cold conditions. He spoke to our affiliate WXYZ from Sydney, Australia 
 
 after completing his third trip near the South Pole.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AUSTIN CARTER, ICE CORE RESEARCHER: So, what is the difference between ice you make at home in your freezer and ice here in Antarctica? The answer to 
 
 that is bubbles.
 
ALICIA SMITH, WXYZ ANCHOR (voice-over): If Austin Carter had to pick a theme song, it would probably be "Ice Ice Baby."
 
The 27-year-old doctoral student and Royal Oak native has been living on the southernmost continent for 50 days where researchers are drilling for 
 
 ice.
 
CARTER: So, ice cores from Antarctica are this unique scientific resource. They contain a record of earth`s climate that`s pretty much unrivaled by 
 
 other archives. 
 
SMITH: I caught up with him in Sydney, Australia via ZOOM this week after he`d just wrapped up his third trip near the South Pole.
 
He joined researchers from 15 universities and COLDEX to find the oldest ice on the planet and study the prehistoric dust particles trapped inside. 
 
(On camera): What is the oldest core of ice you`ve uncovered?
 
CARTER: Our oldest ice sample that we`ve collected now is greater than 4 million years old and this is the oldest ice that`s ever been collected on 
 
 the planet.
 
SMITH: And he`s been serving up this polar science knowledge to the masses.
 
CARTER: Here are five things we can and cannot do while living here in Antarctica. 
 
SMITH: This video racked has up 27.5 million views on TikTok.
 
CARTER: My mother actually encouraged me to do, you know, she was like, "You know, people really have a lot of questions. You should make an 
 
 educational video."

WIRE: In our next story, we want to take you on a journey to explore the ocean`s Twilight Zone. This home to ecosystems has rarely been explored or 
 
 documented by science, but husband and wife divers, Emmanuelle and Ghislain Bardout made it their mission. Our Bill Weir caught up with the team as 
 
 they were preparing for a six-month long expedition in the Mediterranean. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GHISLAIN BARDOUT, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CO-DIRECTOR, UNDER THE POLE: When you are a diver, you are always curious to go to see a little bit further. I think 
 
 every single diver in the world, when you are about to go up, you always have an eye to the depth, to the bottom. Little by little, you want to go 
 
 deeper because you wonder what, what are you going to find?
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Ghislain Bardout with his wife Emmanuelle in 2007, he has conducted thousands of dives often to 150 or 
 
 even 200 meters deep. His crew has explored everywhere from the Arctic to the Canary Islands, French Polynesia to the Caribbean.
 
BARDOUT: We are talking about new ecosystem that`s covered the entire planet. All the shore, everywhere. It`s just below 30 meters, 40 meters.
 
And there are, for sure, many species, many different ecosystem that all have a huge importance. So acquiring a better understanding of their 
 
 ecology is essential for the conservation of those depths.
 
WEIR: With scientists aboard their boat under the poll aims to document these ecosystems for the first time and help preserve their future.
 
Ghislain`s team are preparing for a six-month expedition, in the Mediterranean. That will take them from Greece to Italy, to France.
 
In 2022, under the Pole help gain protection for black coral force in the Canary Islands. And they believe there is a similar ecosystem to be 
 
 explored on their Mediterranean voyage next year.
 
BARDOUT: In Greece, they already explored the depths with robots ROVs. So they know some fields of black corals, but are not able to study because of 
 
 the depths, because they do not have the divers to do so. And I like those missions where there`s huge collaborations, you know, with different people 
 
 that can do together something they cannot do alone or just with their own team.

WIRE: For today`s story getting that 10 out of 10, how many chicken nuggets can you chow down? A California family fit off way more than they could 
 
 chew when they ordered food for delivery are magnificent. Jeanne Moos serves up a major Mickey bees mishap.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my god.
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: They thought they`d ordered several burgers, some fries and a few chicken McNuggets. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a prank. It has to be a prank. 
 
MOOS: Instead they got inundated with McNuggets. So many that grandma couldn`t count.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.
 
MOOS: Without bursting into laughter, her son-in-law put his head on the counter. 
 
CHRIS MULLANCE, PLACE THE ORDER: There was nuggets and nuggets and nugget - - 
 
MOOS: Delivered from a McDonald`s in Long Beach, California by a door dash driver.
 
MULLANCE: Guy said this was the biggest order he`s ever had. 
 
MOOS: And they didn`t skimp on the sauce. Jessica Vaccaro, then four-year- old son had questions. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s a lot?
 
JESSICA VACCARO, RECORDER VIDEO: Mommy, is that a lot? Grandma, is this funny? 
 
MOOS: Jessica, we recently unearth this 2017 video. She posted it, it went viral. They ended up giving most of the McNuggets to the homeless. 
 
VACCARO: You packed them all up. And we went down to the beach and we handed them out.
 
MOOS: Her husband, Chris thinks he accidentally added a zero ordering 20, rather than just 2, 10-piece boxes. He admits, he barely looked at the 
 
 total bill and he dropped this nugget. 
 
MULLANCE: I consider myself a bit of a chicken McNuggets kind of sewer.
 
MOOS: But 200, give us a "McBreak."

WIRE: That`s a whole lot of chicken. Dad joke. Why are chicken so funny? "Because." 
 
It`s shout out time now. This shout out goes to the Gladiators from Gresham Middle School in Knoxville, Tennessee. We see you. Keep shining, super 
 
 stars. 
 
And this shout out goes to the Patriots at Orange Glen High School in Escondido, California, rise up, going out and make a marvelous moment this 
 
 magnificent Monday. Even if it`s just making somewhat smile today. I`m Coy Wire. And we are CNN 10.
