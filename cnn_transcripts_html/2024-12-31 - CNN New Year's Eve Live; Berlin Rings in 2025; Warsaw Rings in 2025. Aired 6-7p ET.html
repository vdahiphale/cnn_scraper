THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
MELISSA BELL, CNN HOST: In fact, the people at home, they'll be having their dinner, their foie gras, their champagne, and then they dance until the early hours of the morning. And then in the morning you have onion soup.
 
So, depending on how brave you are and how far you've gone through your sickness, we can do that at 6:00 A.M.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: I would love some warm soup as we key in on ten seconds. We're now just ten seconds away from ringing in the New Year here in Paris. Let's listen in to the countdown.
 <br>[18:05:00]
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
SANCHEZ: Wow. Wow. A barrage of light and sound makes you feel like you're alive.
 
BELL: Right, Boris. You brave illness, you brave pigstrotters. Was it not worth it?
 
SANCHEZ: It was all worth it. That was incredible, Melissa, one of the most beautiful cities in the world putting on one of the most elegant displays that I've ever seen of fireworks. They were popping, felt like right in our faces, and now there's a smoke billowing the smell of fireworks. But that was incredible, especially at the last minute.
 
BELL: Exactly. I've seen a few of them up here and I haven't seen any quite that loud or quite that spectacular. They've really put on quite a show. The French do pride themselves on putting on quite a show. But that really was pretty spectacular.
 
SANCHEZ: Absolutely. And I got my party hat on. Clearly, following after you, you've got a bit of a crown.
 
BELL: Happy New Year in French.
 
SANCHEZ: Competing with Laura Coates. How do you say Happy New Year in French?
 
BELL: Bonne annee. I will never compete with Laura's beret, but we've tried our best.
 
SANCHEZ: We have tried our best. I do wonder Melissa as you look toward 2025, whether you have any resolutions, whether you have anything you're hoping to accomplish this year.
 
BELL: Hoping to accomplish, I think at this stage, trying to get my finances in order is my only job for 2025, try do things better than I have. What else can you hope for?
 
SANCHEZ: That's a great one. I don't really do resolutions myself. However, I will say that I'll make a resolution potentially to come back to Paris next year.
 
BELL: Exactly.
 
SANCHEZ: Skip the pig trotter and the calf brain, but enjoy that one more time. That was truly incredible, Laura. I mean, I don't know that where you are in London, if it can compete with what we just saw and what is still apparently ongoing.
 
LAURA COATES, CNN HOST: Wow. First of all, that was incredible. And they understood the assignment. They had the name. You can't forget where you were headed. Paris right there on the Arc de Triomphe. It was so amazing to see what was going on there, unbelievable show, of course.
 
And resolutions, I, of course, always have ridiculous ones. I say things like I'll go to the gym every single day. I'll have ten glasses of water all the time. I'll sleep well. I'll cook every night. None of that happens after the first five days, but I still say them every single year. And now I'm inspired by Paris to do so. It was so incredible to see you guys.
 
Up next, we're going to bring you the spectacular celebrations from a Madrid, Berlin and Angola all ring in the new year in their own very special way.
 
Do not go anywhere. CNN's special live coverage of New Year's Eve continues after a quick break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
COATES: What a special night of cover. They already have Neil Diamond playing here in London and Isa Soares, everyone, is now back, but she's no longer Isa Soares.
 
ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR: I love that Boris is rolling his eyes. I'll give you a clue, a British icon --
 
COATES: A British icon.
 
SOARES: -- with this fabulous gown.
 
COATES: Oh, I think I know who it is. For all you Spice Girls out there, are you Ginger Spice?
 
SOARES: I am Ginger Spice. The iconic dress.
 
COATES: Are you freezing, girl?
 
SOARES: I am, but I committed.
 
COATES: You know what?
 
SOARES: It was Elizabeth I, Harry Potter. I have to commit.
 
COATES: Wow.
 
SOARES: I have to commit. And a little fact for everyone out there, do you know that this dress, it originally, obviously not this one, it was a Gucci black dress but she thought thought it was very boring. So, her sister got a tea towel and stitch it onto the black dress. And that's what made it so iconic when it came to the Spice Girls. The way it clearly is not an original. This is made of keratine.
 
COATES: You got keratine.
 
SOARES: I do. Oh my God.
 
COATES: You look good. You look good.
 
SOARES: This is so many. This is something like -- you know, this is so exciting.
 
COATES: It's exciting.
 
SOARES: I was expecting some Spice Girls. They didn't deliver the songs.
 
COATES: You deliver, Isa Soares. This -- oh my God, everyone, joining me now, of course, our -- but moments ago, Berlin rang in the New Year, the fireworks show at Brandenburg Gate. It's one of the largest years in the entire world, with many live concerts, live performances. Travelers come from all over the world to ring in the New Year with that kind of unbeatable party atmosphere that Berlin is certainly known for.
 
Boris, look at the images here. It's so incredible. Let's look at this. Isn't it?
 
SANCHEZ: Absolutely. So much color and light, and, again, just the sound of those fireworks, at times, overwhelming as we felt here in Paris moments ago. Berlin obviously a global capital, so many tourists flock there all the time. And we know there's something, like 90 food trucks and other gastronomic offerings parked all along that area.
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
So, I think folks are eating pretty good there tonight. There's also said to be a Ferris wheel more than 100 feet high.
 
COATES: Did you just say gastronomic? Wait, are you European now? Gastronomic?
 
SANCHEZ: I'm starting to pivot. I'm sorry. I think it's this hat. I'm starting to pivot a little bit toward my European side after putting on this hat and experiencing Parisian culture. I also --
 
COATES: Okay.
 
SANCHEZ: Oh, forgive me. Also I want to take folks to Warsaw in Poland, another obviously European capital.
 
COATES: I may have to contact a gastronomist or whatever you call that. I don't want you to get upset over there, okay?
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, or that vaping doctor that prescribed me an entire cabinet worth of medicine.
 
Check out Warsaw right now as it rings in 2025. You see that big tree right in the middle of the town square, big star on top, fireworks going out throughout town. It looks like an amazing celebration.
 
COATES: It's amazing.
 
And, Boris, yet again, I actually match every New Year's Eve celebration. Just saying to you, every single one, a little bit of fuchsia in there as well, everyone ahead, we've got so much more of CNN's special New Year's Eve coverage. We're heading back to Mississippi, where Morgan Freeman, the voice of God is Morgan Freeman, and, of course, Omar Jimenez as well. Love him both.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:25:00]
 
SANCHEZ: Every time I get to like sit down. Moments ago, a stunning fireworks display as people in Luanda, Angola and the south eastern coast of Africa rang in the New Year. CNN's Larry Madowo was there.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's about to be midnight in Angola and it is Happy New Year from Luanda, Angola. Feliz Ano Nuevo, and the fireworks are up in the sky. It's all going down. The crowd goes crazy. They're hugging. They are celebrating the fireworks. Okay, just behind us, there it is, lighting up the sky.
 
Here on the shores of the South Atlantic Ocean, all the lights, all the phones are facing the sky. There's more impressive fireworks. In different parts of the city, I can see them rising up in the sky, just filling up this section of Luanda from the buildings around, from the harbor, from the promenade surrounding this section of the city, way more impressive in the distance than was closest to me, but no doubt a lot of celebration.
 
And we heard one of the traditions in Angola is for you to embrace your family at midnight. They wear white to celebrate newness, to celebrate purity, and they embrace family. The kids go to party. Well, the younger people go to party. And that's what about to happen now that it's midnight in Angola.
 
Oh, there it is, the view over the South Atlantic Ocean with the fireworks lighting up the sky. Spectacular with the city lights in the back and the fireworks. And so everybody around here, the crowd is surging closer to the water so they have a good view of it -- at midnight for the fireworks.
 
These posts are going to be all over Instagram, all over TikTok, all over Facebook and X. I'm sure everybody's feed is just going to be flooded with this shot of the fireworks, even if it doesn't look that great on the phone, but everyone does it. Whatever culture, everyone celebrated New Year.
 
When you look on your phone right now on your feed, you'll see lots of fireworks pictures. Some are grainy, some are great. They're really great, but it's still an amazing moment because it's one of the most exciting things that you end an old year and get to start a new year. And if you're lucky, it's somewhere beautiful like this with the fireworks lighting up the water and lighting up the sky and the celebration around, just exceptional. And that is a view from Angola.
 
Let me try and get in a shot on the -- behind me, and I can explain a little bit of where we are with the fireworks over the water here in Angola, and more coming up from different parts of the city. That is literally everywhere. But that is a view from Luanda, here at the shores of the South Atlantic Ocean.
 
Happy New Year. Feliz Ano Nuevo.
 
COATES: Happy New Year to you in Angola. I love it. They started playing Beyonce, Crazy in Love in London. Everyone's getting excited for our own fireworks display right here. We're just a couple minutes now from midnight and from show time here in the British capital.
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
The city started working on its New Year's extravaganza, we'll call it, this summer.
 
Earlier, I talked to the London mayor, a Kool and the Gang fan, who knew, Sadiq Khan, or shall I say, Sir Sadiq Khan, about what we could expect to see tonight. He has just been knighted, so I wasn't sure how exactly to address him.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COATES: Should I call you mayor or sir? I'm not sure what to do right now. Congratulations to you.
 
MAYOR SADIQ KHAN, LONDON: Bless you. Thank you, very kind.
 
COATES: This is a happy New Year celebration. London is prepared for a very long time. It's going to be epic. I understand. Tell me about the preparations and what's going to be like tonight.
 
KHAN: Listen, look, I know that you've got views from across the globe watching this. I don't want to offend any friends overseas but we would have in London, the greatest fireworks across the globe. We've been working on this since July. There's been a team working with me on the soundtrack with more than 125,000 fireworks. We've got a great lights display. We've had since the 27th of December a 32-person crew working on setting up the fireworks tonight. It'll be 12 minutes long. It's a message of hope. It's a message where we show the world that this is a city for everyone.
 
COATES: But tell me, can you give us a spoiler alert? What kind of surprise are we going to see these fireworks tonight? Anything? Because New York wants to know, the competition, what they have against them.
 
KHAN: Well, listen, there's going to be some great music. I think those who are big fans of Sabrina Carpenter will love the fireworks tonight. And I'm the generation where I listen -- I'm so old, I enjoy Kool and the Gang, some Kool and the Gang tonight and the soundtrack as well. There'll be some surprises from some voiceovers. Some famous actors will be speaking tonight. But watch the fireworks. They're going to be great.
 
COATES: This is going to be special. Mayor, or should I say Sir, thank you so much.
 
KHAN: My pleasure. Thank you very much. And a Happy New Year to everyone watching.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COATES: Look what's going on behind me, everyone. The lights are starting to change. We're getting very close to midnight here in London. The London Eye lighting up. It looks beautiful. We got a crowd of people who are waiting. Look at the water is starting to glow with all the different light show. We've got the London Eye getting ready to just have all of the fireworks behind it.
 
I am so excited to be here in London with all of you tonight. So we've got a lot more special New Year's Eve coverage right here in London. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[18:35:00]
 
SANCHEZ: It's already 2025 here in Paris, but in Brazil, the party is just starting and it would not be a truly amazing New Year's party without a bit of Samba, a little dancing.
 
So, let's go to CNN's Julia Jones on Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana Beach. The beach is expecting some 2 million visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the fireworks and free musical performances. Julia?
 
JULIA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I am here in Copacabana, the iconic beach of Copacabana, and I have really special guests with us today. I have Uscirias and Pablinho Fantastico ()ph. They are going to teach us how to dance the Brazilian Passinho. That is an iconic way of dancing, mostly with your feet, right?
 
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: And I don't know if -- I mean, I've been trying, I've been rehearsing, I'll be honest with you, but we're going to see if I actually am prepared. Okay, yes, okay, let's go.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: So to the side and back.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: To the side.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: To the front.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: Thrice to the back, okay.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: You're going to pick it up a little bit.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: Okay, a little bit of hip movement. We're getting better.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: That was amazing, guys. Happy New Year from Copacabana, from all of us, and especially from these guys. Feliz Ano Nuevo,
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Feliz Ano Nuevo. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
 
JONES: Back to you, guys.
 
SANCHEZ: An impressive showing there by Julia. Thank you so much for that. Laura, yes, I think we got to work on that for next year. Yes, we definitely will check in with Laura in a bit.
 
COATES: We do. I'm working over here trying to practice right now.
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, that footwork is tricky.
 
Right now, we're actually going to test Laura and Isa Soares to see if they know some New Year traditions from around the world. So, we are going to spin the magical New Year's Eve wheel.
 
COATES: Do you mean -- wait, do you mean Mary Poppins? Because Mary Poppins is here now, not Isa any longer. She's Mary Poppins now.
 
SOARES: You are very welcome. And, Boris, do not roll your eyes. I take this very seriously.
 
SANCHEZ: I am not rolling my -- you are one of the MVPs of this evening. You have outdone yourself at every turn. That is impressive.
 
Listen, we have to -- we have to pause. We have to spin the wheel and see where that umbrella takes you, if you fly off in just a moment. So, let's spin the wheel. Let's go ahead.
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
So, where do they carry empty suitcases around the block to symbolize a year filled with travel and adventure?
 
SOARES: South America, South America.
 
SANCHEZ: Laura, Isa?
 
SOARES: South America.
 
COATES: I'm going to say Brazil.
 
SOARES: South America, lots of places in South America. Mexico?
 
COATES: That's a whole like continent.
 
SOARES: Mexico.
 
COTES: What is the answer?
 
SOARES: Colombia.
 
SANCHEZ: This is Colombia. You were right about South America. Colombia, of course, not the only country -- Columbia, not the only country that does this. We do this in Hialeah, Florida. Shout out to Hialeah, a bunch of Cubans there doing this down the block all the time.
 
Let's go ahead and spin the wheel one more time. Let's go.
 
SOARES: My husband would divorce me if I didn't get that.
 
COATES: All right, here we go. Plate throwing. Oh wait.
 
SANCHEZ: Plate throwing. Where do you throw plates?
 
SOARES: Greece.
 
COATES: I think it's Denmark.
 
SANCHEZ: Isa?
 
SOARES: Greece. Greece. Greece.
 
COATES: No. I think it's Denmark. It's Denmark. It's Denmark.
 
SANCHEZ: Opa, it is actually not Greece.
 
SOARES: No. SANCHEZ: Is it? Wait, it is Greece. Wait, hold on a second. It's Denmark. You were right, Laura. Denmark, during the New Year, plates are thrown at neighbors' or friends' doors. It represents a new beginning. It also represents a new way of saying thank you. So, thank you to friends. And then you throw a plate at their door.
 
All right, one last spin. Let's go to the wheel.
 
SOARES: Okay.
 
SANCHEZ: Smashing pomegranates. Where in the world do they smash pomegranates?
 
COATES: : I think Greece. I think Greece. It's Greece.
 
SOARES: You got Greece? I was going to say Cyprus. But --
 
COATES: Is it Greece?
 
SOARES: -- is it Greece or Cyprus?
 
SANCHEZ: The huge winner tonight, it is Greece. Laura sweeping the competition. Perhaps didn't get the first one right, but it was close enough. He said South America. So, we'll count it. Greece, they smash pomegranates for good fortune, life and prosperity. Heck of a thing to do with some pomegranates.
 
Laura and Mary Poppins, thank you both so much. Congratulations to Laura.
 
We do have to go to Mississippi. We're on the clock here. We got to take you to Mississippi because midnight may be a few hours away there, but the party there has already started at Morgan Freeman's blues club, Ground Zero. Our Omar Jimenez is there. He's been hitting the keys. And right now it seems like Mr. Freeman, the voice of God, is about to lay something down.
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, we are in Morgan Freeman's world right now and I've got the pleasure of standing here. You've been so gracious welcoming us in. We're a few hours from midnight, but the party is just getting started. So, as I understand, we're about to see Kingfish. Tell us who they are and what we can expect.
 
MORGAN FREEMAN, ACTOR: Kingfish is probably one of the youngest blues players ever to play here. And he got started here back when he was a teenager. And now here he is. I'll tell you who when I introduce him.
 
JIMENEZ: Yes, all right. I'm going to hand this microphone to Mr. Morgan Freeman himself and take the intros away.
 
FREEMAN: Got it. So, ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please, quietly, quietly? Thank you very much.
 
I am here, perhaps sober, to introduce a young man who I think got his started right here in this club in this town We call him Kingfish. He's a, believe it or not, Grammy Award winner and he should have won a few other things, and he will, I know, but he is the future of the blues. I would say he's the future of music. Ladies and gentlemen, Kingfish.
 
The thrill is gone. Shut up, will you? That's very nice, I'm telling you. It's very nice. But we came here to hear some of your stuff. Is that cool?
 
(MUSICIAN CHRISTONE "KINGFISH" INGRAM PERFORMING)
 <br>[18:49:10]
 
COATES: Wow, that was incredible. He can play. 
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Wow.
 
COATES: Man, that sounds incredible. That music. And can you believe it? That right now. I mean, you know, its good. Sound good? 
 
Can you play an instrument, Boris? 
 
SANCHEZ: You know its good. You know its good when somebody makes a stank face like that when they're playing. Oh, my god, that was amazing. That was fantastic. 
 
I can't play anything. I can't play anything. 
 
COATES: You got to have that stank face. That you write about. That stank face. 
 
SANCHEZ: Baby -- good and good. I can mess around with the xylophone. Yes. 
 
COATES: Okay, I'm going to move past that for your own sake. Okay, my friend, not cool. Or as my son would say, you lost about a thousand aura just now when you said the xylophone. That's okay. 
 
It's all good. 
 
SANCHEZ: Oh.
 
COATES: Listen, we are just over ten minutes away now from midnight here in London. We'll bring you the fireworks show after a quick break. 
 <br>[18:50:02]
 
It's starting. Can you feel it? It's in the air. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COATES: Welcome to CNN special New Year's Eve coverage. 
 
We're following celebrations from all around the world. 
 
I'm Laura Coates in London, Boris Sanchez is in Paris with the New Year is almost an hour old. But while here in London, the excitement is building. 
 
Isa Soares, the real one, is here with me, too, right now. 
 
Isa, it's almost time. 
 
SOARES: It's almost time. Can you hear the crowds? 
 
COATES: I know.
 
SOARES: I mean, the sea of humanity, and now you can really feel the excitement, right? 
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
With five minutes to go, 100,000 people.
 
COATES: Right here. 
 
SOARES: Right here, those are the people that have got tickets. There are so many others who haven't been able to get tickets. And you'll be able to see the fireworks right behind you, right here -- 
 
COATES: At the London Eye.
 
SOARES: The London Eye. 
 
And we have spoken to the fireworks display guy who is just behind us there, who said two hours ago, that's when they finished setting up just two hours ago. 
 
COATES: Now that's the last minute.
 
SOARES: That is. But this is how they normally do it. But in terms of what were expecting 12 -- I mean, we're expecting 12 minutes, 12. 
 
COATES: Twelve minutes. Wow. 
 
SOARES: Of fireworks. It is the most extensive as well as the biggest in Europe. So -- 
 
COATES: Really?
 
SOARES: -- about eight tons of fireworks. 
 
COATES: All right. London. Come on.
 
SOARES: Get yourself ready for that. These people have been here for hours. 
 
COATES: I know when we first got here, it was like no one was here. And all of a sudden the crowd started coming in. Everyone's excited to go. They have a DJ blasting music. We've been dancing requests, taking requests. Unfortunately for you, they didn't play the Spice Girls until after you stopped being Geri Halliwell. 
 
SOARES: But they did, but they did it. They did it. COATES: They did. 
 
SOARES: Thank you very much. 
 
COATES: Thank you very much. And here we are. I, of course, I'm watching the whole thing. You are blinging.
 
SOARES: She planned it with the mayor of London. 
 
COATES: I did, she actually. I'm actually a surprise, Mayor. Thank you for letting me know. 
 
We're going to hear music. We're going to have the lights. It's going to go above the London Eye. 
 
I mean, tell me a little bit, Isa, about how iconic it is to be above the London Eye of all -- on the river. 
 
SOARES: I mean, if you look anywhere around you, you see the big -- the big icons, right? This place here it is, the place where everyone turns on their TV to watch these fireworks. And then you've got the bridge, embankment bridge, Westminster Bridge, you've got Big Ben to your left. 
 
COATES: We're on the river.
 
SOARES: You're basically on the River Thames. And even though -- even if you don't have a ticket, Laura, you can cross all the way down the river. You'll be able to get a beautiful view. 
 
You've got a maternity ward there. Hospital ward there. Oh, no. 
 
COATES: Wait. 
 
SOARES: But the views. 
 
COATES: We both have babies. Are you kidding me? 
 
SOARES: I mean, what a view, though, right? 
 
COATES: I know, but here's going to happen. The baby will go to sleep and the fireworks are going to start. Every new mother is going to be like. Are you joking? Are you kidding me? 
 
SOARES: The best gift you can get.
 
COATES: I guess -- 
 
SOARES: Right? Not the fireworks. The baby. 
 
COATES: Okay, okay. Okay. Sure. Well, you know, our children are up watching. Are they not? 
 
SOARES: They are. 
 
COATES: Hi, Sydney. Hi, Adrian. Hi, husband. Dale. SOARES: Nico. Tommy. Danny,my husband. All our friends. Yes. Happy New
 
 Year to you. 
 
COATES: Happy New Year. How amazing is to be here? 
 
SOARES: It's absolutely fantastic. And you can feel the crowds. I've been to many of them from all over the world. I met some people from Bogota in Colombia, people from Germany, and just thrilled. People come here for this.
 
COATES: Colombia, is that how you knew about the empty suitcase? 
 
SOARES: Yeah. My husband is Colombian, so I didn't get that one right. He would have completely divorced me. I'm telling you right now. 
 
COATES: It's fire. Everyone here is amazing. 
 
SOARES: We got the grapes in -- I know we have grapes in parts of the world -- 
 
COATES: Oh, we have grapes?
 
SOARES: In parts of the world, you do grapes like in Colombia and Spain, you do grapes. In Portugal, where I'm from, we actually do sultanas because -- 
 
COATES: Oh, really? 
 
SOARES: Fear of choking, I think maybe. 
 
COATES: Oh, there they are. Hold on. 
 
SOARES: Maybe it's my mother. 
 
But I'll tell you what. These grapes are huge. If they are, this great for every bong, I think it's pretty dangerous. 
 
COATES: Oh, because they do a bomb for every hour. 
 
SOARES: Every for every bomb for every strike. You take a grape. But it's so difficult to chew that in some parts, like in my country, in Portugal, you actually do sultanas, so its much easier. 
 
COATES: That's amazing. 
 
SOARES: But -- yeah. And then you have lentils that you put in your pockets in places like Colombia to bring prosperity, which is fantastic to see. 
 
COATES: Yeah. See black Americans will do collard greens and black eyed peas on New Year's Day because the green is the money and the peas are the change. So you actually eat that on New Year's Day? 
 
SOARES: Oh, I had no idea. 
 
COATES: Yeah. SOARES: The only thing I would say is, don't forget to take the food. The beans out my washing machine, my washing machine had had lentils. 
 
COATES: Are you washing lentils? 
 
SOARES: Yeah. My kids didn't stick it all the way. 
 
Here we go. We're counting down. 
 
COATES: Oh my god, a minute and a half away. 
 
SOARES: A minute and a half. 
 
COATES: I cannot believe were going to be in 2025. I know this has been a heck of a year. So many things have happened. 
 
SOARES: So many -- 
 
COATES: So many good, so many challenging things. And here we are getting ready to embark on a brand New Year.
 
SOARES: Fresh start, fresh start. Here's to a better -- 
 
COATES: Better.
 
SOARES: Better year. More faith, more hope. 
 
COATES: Hey, what's your resolution going to be? 
 
SOARES: Just to be healthier. 
 
COATES: Good for you.
 
SOARES: I think more mental health. I'm not going to say fitness because that's a challenge, right? Every year, I do the same thing. But just like -- just relaxing. 
 
COATES: Yeah. 
 
SOARES: Just having more time for myself. What about you?
