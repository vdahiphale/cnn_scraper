THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
<br>[15:30:00] 
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: But our colleague Kyung Lah is on the ground with him now in Iowa -- been traveling around with him. And she told me this morning that voters are really receptive to him. So, it's interesting to see if the strategy works.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Yes, we'll see how that might change polling. Because right now the former president is still very far ahead and also still far ahead on fundraising. Though some new numbers from Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis are impressive. 
 
HOLMES: Yes, these are impressive numbers and they just released them. It's $20 million in the second quarter for the DeSantis campaign. You have to keep in mind, this is not quarter two numbers, the entire quarter. He only announced in late May. So, you're looking at about six weeks here and getting $20 million. Obviously, there is less than the $35 million that the Trump campaign said they raised during this period. But I will tell you moments ago, we heard from a source inside the Never Back Down PAC who said that they have raised $130 million. Again, this is DeSantis PAC since they launched in March. That is a huge number -- Boris. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, the race for the Republican ticket heating up Kristen Holmes, thank you so much -- Brianna. 
 
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: This just in to CNN. A member of the executive board for the House Freedom Caucus just told CNN that the far-right group voted to remove Georgia Congresswoman Marjory Taylor Greene just before the July Fourth break. We have CNN's Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill for us on this story. Melanie, what's behind this? Why now? 
 
MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yes, it's a little surprising, right? Because the Freedom Caucus is a group that has been dedicated -- or has been dedicated to former President Donald Trump. And Marjory Taylor Greene is one of Trump's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill. But what I can tell you, Bri, is that there has been frustration bubbling up in the Freedom Caucus over the last few months. 
 
And really, it boils down to the fact that Marjory Taylor Greene has become one of the biggest allies of Republican leadership. She publicly criticized some of her Freedom Caucus colleagues for supporting -- for not supporting Kevin McCarthy for Speaker during a speakers battle. She also criticized her colleagues for the backlash that they gave Kevin McCarthy for hammering out this debt ceiling deal and for blocking the House floor. 
 
And then the real straw that broke the camel's back, according to Congressman Andy Harris, he's a member of the Freedom Caucus -- was that -- the last week before recess, there was dust up on the floor. A confrontation between Greene and another member of the Freedom Caucus. Where Greene admitted that she called Lauren Boebert, a little b-word -- I will say the word. But that is what she confirmed that she said to Lauren Boebert on the floor. 
 
And I want to read what else Andy Harris told my colleague, Haley Talbot earlier today. He said, I think the way she -- Marjory Taylor Greene -- referred to a fellow member was probably not the way we expect our members to refer to their fellow, especially female, members. 
 
So a lot of this doesn't really boil down to some personal, internal issues and conflicts between members. But there is a broader identity caucus happening -- broader identity crisis happening inside the Freedom Caucus about whether they want to be a group that just stands up to Kevin McCarthy at every turn or if they want to play the inside game -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, really interesting development. Melanie Zanona thank you for the report from Capitol Hill -- Jim. 
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: A new report has found that the strict Texas abortion law may have led to nearly 10,000 more births than expected there. Next, we're going to speak to a doctor in Texas about what exactly they are seeing. 
 
Plus, police still investigating after a block party ended in deadly gunfire. More than 130 rounds fired. New details on another shooting ahead.
 <br>[15:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
SANCHEZ: Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds is having lawmakers return from vacation early next week for the, quote, sole purpose of passing new abortion restrictions in her state. Keep in mind, the Iowa Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state's six-week abortion ban. It's been just over a year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And in that year, at least 14 states have triggered new laws that ban or severely restrict access to the procedure. Six have set gestational limits. And now we are learning the effects of these bans. 
 
According to research published in the journal of the American Medical Association, a strict abortion law that took effect in Texas in 2021 may have led to nearly 10,000 more births than expected in the last nine months of 2022. We are joined by now Dr. Bhavik Kumar, he's the medical director for primary and trans care and Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. Doctor, thank you for being with us this afternoon. First, on these 10,000 more births than expected last year, people who champion the life of the unborn would say that is a huge success. But you've said that there is hypocrisy in that. 
 
DR. BHAVIK KUMAR, MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR PRIMARY AND TRANS CARE, PLANNED PARENTHOOD GULF COAST: Absolutely, yes. After seeing thousands of people, it's really removed from the reality of people's lives. Many people that we see that are seeking abortion care are making moral and appropriate decisions about what's best for their lives based on financial situation, their physical health and forcing them to have children and stay pregnant longer than they are able to. Is really, really unethical and immoral from my perspective. 
 <br>[15:40:00]
 
SANCHEZ: So you're essentially arguing that if the state is going to force families to make these difficult decisions and put them in a position to have more children, that state lawmakers should also then provide for those children and have infrastructure in communities that allows them to survive and thrive. 
 
KUMAR: Absolutely. First of all, it's important to note that people should be able to make these decisions about their bodies and their health. If the best thing for someone is to not be pregnant, they should have thought right and ability. I think in a situation like were seeing now, where people are being forced to have children, where they are not able to get to another state or to be able to access abortion care when they need to. Given the maternal mortality crisis, given the need for a paid sick leave, given the need for child care, health insurance, especially for low and poorer families. We have to do more to support people that are staying pregnant against their will and to support them, to support the children that they already have, and support the children that they are being forced to give birth. 
 
SANCHEZ: Doctor, I wondering what the biggest challenges for you have been in providing care ever since the ban SB-8 was passed in Texas? 
 
KUMAR: I think some of the most difficult things are really having face to face conversations with people who are pregnant and they're telling you, their story. Again, I've seen hundreds of people since these laws have gone into effect. Texas had an SB-8 a year before Dobbs was over turned. And you're sitting in front of real people who are saying, I almost died in my last pregnancy. I've had complications in previous pregnancy. In the reasons go on and on and on. 
 
And of course as a physician, I totally understand their reasons. I trust my patients to make the best decisions for them. But when these laws are passed and we have to say, we can't help you. We are legally not allowed to do anything for you. The best thing for you is to go to another state to get this care. And then yet people still say, I'm not able to travel. I can't get out of state. I'm not able to do that. That's not an option for me. 
 
And again, the reasons are numerous. And oftentimes, we're left with no options but to say, there is nothing that we can do. And that means we see outcomes like this where people are forced to give birth and stay pregnant longer than they are able to. And that's not what they want. That's not what's best for them and they know that. But they have no choice, they have no freedom. 
 
SANCHEZ: Advocates for abortion rights across the country, have talked about how there would need to be action from Congress in order to ensure that all women have access to the care they need. What's your message to lawmakers at the national level? 
 
KUMAR: Yes, I think lawmakers have to do more to ensure that people have access to the care that they need. Everything has to be on the table. You mentioned Iowa passing more laws. We've seen so many restrictions go into place in other states and the crisis is worsening. So, everything has to be on the table. All options have to be available. And we have to protect access to abortion in all states throughout the entire country. 
 
Dr. Bhavik Kumar, we have to leave the conversation there. We appreciate your sharing your perspective with us. 
 
KUMAR: Thank you so much. 
 
SANCHEZ: Of course -- Brianna.
 
KEILAR: Climate scientists sounding the alarm after a week that is being dubbed the hottest in 100,000 years. 
 
Plus, the company behind the Titan submersible suspends all exploration and commercial operations. We'll have more on that when CNN NEWS CENTRAL returns. 
 <br>[15:45:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KEILAR: Republican presidential candidate, Chris Christie, will sit down with CNN's Jake Tapper here in just a few minutes. They'll be discussing the latest on the Trump investigations and the race for the White House. Jake Tapper with us now. So, what can we expect? 
 
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR, THE LEAD: Well, first of all, you know, if you have any ideas for questions I should ask him, I'm all ears. 
 
KEILAR: I have ideas. 
 
I mean, not literally all ears. It's figuratively all ears. 
 
KEILAR: You're not all ears. You have very nice ears. 
 
TAPPER: I have tinny ears. But why don't you tell me what we should ask? And obviously we're going to ask about the Trump investigations There's news on both the investigation into involvement in January 6 and trying to overturn the election. And also, Walt Nauta, his aide in the classified documents case testifying -- or coming before the judge today. So, that's a couple of things. What else? 
 
KEILAR: I'm curious what he thinks about this person who showed up near the Obamas --
 
TAPPER: Oh, the January --
 
KEILAR: -- he got the address from the Trump tweet. 
 
TAPPER: The Trump Truth Social post. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, that's right, sorry. 
 
TAPPER: Yes, that's an interesting question. How much responsibility does he think Donald Trump should be on the hook for, for the fact that the guy -- according to prosecutors -- got the address of the Obamas from this post that Donald Trump put on social media that had Obamas address. How much responsibility does Trump bear for that, that is a good question. OK.
 
KEILAR: And he doesn't really pull any punches when he answers questions. Because he's an interesting person to interview. 
 
TAPPER: He's kind of -- yes. Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. Right? That's how Janis Joplin sang it. So I mean, he's running as if he has something to lose. And he's just going to call it as he sees it. And it seems only to be working -- if you go by polling -- a little bit maybe in New Hampshire. But it is early and it's only July, so we'll see. But he is running as if he's not necessarily worried about offending this person or that person. He's just saying what he thinks. 
 
KEILAR: Well, it's going to be a great interview, I know. 
 
TAPPER: That's so kind of you. 
 
KEILAR: Not the least because of your wonderful ears. 
 
TAPPER: But I'm saying, is that just your confidence in me and the governor? Or -- 
 
KEILAR: I think both. 
 
TAPPER: -- or are you a time travelling and you've already seen it and come back to tell me. 
 <br>[15:50:00]
 
KEILAR: Now you know my secret, Jake. That's what it is. No, I just -- well obviously I think you are a great interviewer and I think is a very good interview. So, think it's a --I'm going to stay tuned. 
 
Well, it's coming up. It's coming up --
 <br>[15:50:44]
 
Always me nicely KEILAR: And ask him about Threads. 
 
TAPPER: Threads, this new social media thing? 
 
KEILAR: Yes, yes. 
 
TAPPER: That's what we need. 
 
KEILAR: They're making me leave you. 
 
TAPPER: They're wrapping? 
 
KEILAR: Yes. They said this is too good, --
 
TAPPER: The only thing I could say is --
 
KEILAR: I've got to go. Leave it for your show. 
 
TAPPER: I don't need any more social media platforms. That's enough. Stop it with Threads. Threads end. No more. I'm on like 30 of them. I can't keep up. 
 
KEILAR: All right, I'll let them know. I'll travel to the future and you pass --
 
TAPPER: Thank you, once again, appreciate it. 
 
KEILAR: Jake Tapper, thanks. We're going to catch you on "THE LEAD" at the top of the hour -- Jim. 
 
SCIUTTO: Wow, 30 is a lot. 
 
Now some of the other headlines we are watching this hour. Chaos erupted among a large party crowd of mostly juveniles this early Wednesday morning in South Bend, Indiana. Police say a massive amount of gun fire broke out, more that 130 rounds fired from at least 13 different guns. Three people were injured and hospitalized. Several homes and cars were damaged by the gun fire. 
 
Also, following last month's deadly Titan submersion implosion, OceanGate, the company that owned and operated the watercraft, has now suspended all exploration and commercial operations, that according to its website. Five people, including OceanGate's CEO died during the deep-sea voyage down to see the Titanic wreck. The U.S. Coast Guard and several other international maritime agencies continue to investigate that loss. 
 
And Wall Street is down on news of a red-hot jobs market. The market often goes down with good economic news. Right now the Dow down 350 points. Stocks faltering on the fears that the Federal Reserve will now tighten interest rates to hem in the economy a bit longer. U.S. private sector businesses double -- more than double productions by adding nearly half a million jobs last month. This quarter the payroll processor ADP. The government's June jobs report comes out tomorrow. Boris, that's the one the president watches. 
 
SANCHEZ: Indeed, and we'll be there keeping track of the new numbers. 
 
If it feels hot to you this week, it's not just you. A climate scientist says this may be the hottest week the planet has seen in over 100,000 years. You heard that right -- 100,000 years. And the extreme heat is not going away any time soon. States in the Pacific Northwest and the South are breaking records left and right for the highest daily temperatures. All of this as heat alerts remain in place for more than 25 million people across the country. 
 
Let's get to CNN's chief climate correspondent Bill Weir for more. Bill, obviously alarming news. But something fascinating about it is how scientists were able to determine that it's been 100,000 years since the planet was this hot, at least. 
 
BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, amazing to think we are walking, we humans, the hottest planet humans have ever walked on. It's the same one we were born on. A lot of it has changed for the worst, and we're seeing the trend lines the June. Now we're seeing from both Copernicus and the U.S. data sets, the warmest ever by a long shot and then rest of the decade are the rest of the top nine right now. So the long-term trends are there. 
 
But to your point, we measure those records from 79 in the U.S. back to 1940 for Copernicus in the EU. Climatologists who can look at deep ice cores and measure the air going back millennia or corals and see exactly what the temperatures was hundreds of thousands of years ago and now we have this data set. Unfortunately, you know, humanity evolved in sort of a Goldilocks sweet spots that gave us predictable agriculture growing seasons. And let us grow there cities on the current coasts -- which are always changing. For 4.5 billion years, Boris, our temperatures have been going up and down, but normally that was due to wobbles in the earth's rotation or maybe super volcanos or an asteroid. Now we're the volcano, and it's just a matter of how hot we want it to get will depend on -- will be determined by how many fossil fuels we burn. 
 
SANCHEZ: Yes, that trend line heading further from a Goldilocks sweet spot -- as you were describing. Bill Weir in New York for us. Thanks so much -- Brianna. 
 
KEILAR: Was he not entertained? One tourist is saying, excuse me for defacing the Coliseum. Not just a coliseum, the Coliseum. The original, the ancient one where they cheered, in Latin. Hear his wild apology next. 
 <br>[15:55:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
SCIUTTO: So, you remember this tourist who was caught on video defacing the Roman Coliseum by carving his and his girlfriend's name into it? He's a 27-year-old. He carved Ivan plus Hailey 23 -- here he is right there -- into the wall of the Roman Coliseum. NBC has obtained a copy of his apology letter to the mayor of Rome in which he says -- 
 
I admit with deepest embarrassment that it was only after what regrettably happened then I learned of the antiquity of the monument. 
 
He seemed to be saying there, he did not know that the coliseum was old. KEILAR: What do you even say to that? I mean, the coliseum, PS, is two
 
 millennia old. Millions of visitors, of course, go there every year. And when this first happened, Italy's culture minister sent out this tweet demanding that this guy be sanctioned. Ivan Dimitrov -- his name. He has not been publicly identified actually by Italian officials, but the act could see a punishment of up to five years in prison. 
 
SCIUTTO: The good thing is that Italian has a lot of great words for dumb. 
 <br>[16:00:00]
 
SANCHEZ: He's either dumb or just full of crap. Because you see him kind of sheepishly smiling in that video. It seems like he might have known what was going on. And this is just a really lame excuse. 
 
Either way, I look forward to the Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk potential fight at the coliseum. 
 
KEILAR: Yes, they're going to throw down.
 
SANCHEZ: The first one it's hosted in, what, hundreds of years? 
 
KEILAR: In the Coliseum.
 
SCIUTTO: We'll be watching for that. 
 
SANCHEZ: "THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER" starts right now.</pre>
