MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
Ukraine repels a Russian attack over the capital city Kyiv. But some Russian drones destroyed key infrastructure in the southern city of Odesa. 
 
And former President Donald Trump has been indicted on criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He is due in court in Washington on Thursday. 
 
Law enforcement officials in Washington, D.C. area are already working with the federal partners to plan for Donald Trump's court appearance on Thursday. He could appear by video link, but a source tells a CNN that he is looking forward to the spectacle of showing up in person. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Trump was huddled with some of his close political advisers when he got the news of this third indictment in the special counsel investigation into January 6. And I am told that they spent the day talking about what their next plans were. Not just politically, but also legally. And as we have reported on multiple occasions, this has really turned into one fight, a political becoming the legal. 
 
Because as we know former President Trump likes to fight things out in the court of public opinion. And I am told by multiple sources that they really plan on painting this as election interference, saying that this is political. 
 
Now while they have been doing that since the beginning of these investigations and really ramped it up after the first and second indictment, I have talked to a number of allies who stress more confidence in this approach particularly after the last week given the recent polling that shows Trump really leading all of his primary opponents. Particularly one portion of a recent "New York Times" poll that shows him in a head to head contest with his top arrival Ron DeSantis beating him with a big margin. And I am told by these sources that they believe that this gives them the leverage to say this is political because he is effectively or at least looks like he going to effectively be the head -- GOP nominee going into 2024. 
 
Now of course, all of this cannot only be -- cannot also be the legal strategy here, that is something that they will be working on behind the scenes. But it is something to keep in mind here, it's seen going through that strategy, looking at what's going to happens next and still determining what exactly is going to happen on Thursday. We know there has been an option of a Zoom meeting or in person. They had not yet made that determination about what they will be doing on Thursday. But I am told by a source that it is going be a show and they will make sure that there is media presence as always. We know that Trump's team likes to make sure that they control the media narrative.

FOSTER: Bernarda Villalona is a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor. She joins me live from New York. Thank you so much for joining us. You're the expert on how, you know, lawyers tackle these situations away from all of the noise around it. If we could start with the prosecution. What do you think of the indictment that they laid out and their chances of success? 
 
BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND FORMER PROSECUTOR: Thank you for having me, Max. 
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
The prosecutor in this case definitely laid out a very detailed information as to what evidence they have against Donald Trump and it seems to be strong evidence against Donald Trump. They definitely laid out all the conversations as well as everyone that's involved. As you can see, there're six co-conspirators that are named in the indictment, not by name, but that were involved in this conspiracy. And it will be interesting to know whether any of those six co- conspirators will be flipped and the prosecution can use them against Donald Trump. But the prosecution in my opinion has a strong case. 
 
FOSTER: In terms of a defense then, how can they push back on this? We were talking earlier to Thomas Gift saying it's actually very difficult to prove intent. Isn't it in the situation? Effectively the mindset of Donald Trump going into these events. 
 
VILLALONA: Normally it's very difficult to prove intent on the prosecution side. But however, in that indictment -- specifically on page 31 -- there's a statement that the prosecution is using against Donald Trump where he says, I guess we'll just leave it for the other guys to handle. Right there he's acknowledging that he did not win the election. So that right there is a key piece of evidence. 
 
In terms of how the defense is going to handle this, they're going to do exactly what they're been doing with the last two prosecutions. And that is, put it in the media because if Donald Trump is able to win and become the next president, what is he going to do? He'll probably either, one, he'll pardon himself or, two, he'll direct the attorney general and U.S. attorney to drop those prosecutions and that way he is free to go. And that is his strongest defense in these cases. 
 
FOSTER: What do you make of the fact that he may or may not appear in court? 
 
VILLALONA: Oh, Max, you know this is Donald Trump, he's made for the media. Of course he's going to appear in person in court, because it's a part of this show. It's a part of his fundraising. It's a part of his defense. It's a part of him framing the narrative that everyone is out to get Donald Trump as opposed to focusing on the facts, focusing on what's on that 45-page indictment and what the prosecution has shown thus far and grand jury has voted in terms of an indictment. And again, this is the third time, this third indictment in less than four months of the former president. 
 
FOSTER: Do you worry about the judicial system? Because obviously Donald Trump's argument is that it is all part of the establishment out to get him and his supporters continue to be loyal. Don't they? All of the latest surveys, including the recent one in the "New York Times" shows that he is so far ahead, he is not losing support. Do you worry all of that might work against the judicial system and really test the judge in this case? 
 
VILLALONA: In terms of the judge in this case, the judge that is going to be appointed for the trial in this case was actually appointed by former President Barack Obama. In terms of whether the political pressures and the outside pressures are going to put pressure on this judge, highly doubt it. However, I do see this judge expediting this matter in the sense that she is not going to let the case linger and hopefully there will be a trial before the November election. 
 
So remember, while Donald Trump does have all these supporters, what's going to matter at his trial are the 12 jurors that are listening to the evidence and are evaluating the evidence and making the determination whether Donald Trump is guilty or not guilty. Not the outside noise. 
 
FOSTER: OK, Bernarda Villalona, I will be speaking to you a lot more about this in the coming months, thank you so much for joining us.
 
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed an invitation from Florida Governor and presidential hopeful, Ron DeSantis to debate his state's new Black history curriculum. Harris has criticized the state's new curriculum that states enslaved people -- states that enslaved people learned some skills they later used to their benefit. The vice president calls it propaganda meant to replace history with lies. DeSantis is accusing Harris of mischaracterizing the curriculum. But the vice president did not mince words during a speech in Florida on Tuesday.

KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm here in Florida. And I will tell you that there is no round table, no lecture, no invitation we will accept to debate an undeniable fact. There were no redeeming qualities of slavery.

Still to come, the death toll climbs in China from record rainfall and floods. The latest on rescue efforts and a new storm making its way through the Pacific. 
 
Plus, hundreds of thousands of people have fled the conflict in Sudan only to find a whole new set of challenges as refugees -- as the rainy season begins. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: Beijing has recorded its heaviest rainfall since records began 140 years ago. Thanks to the residents of Typhoon Doksuri. It's one of the strongest storms in China's mainland in recent times. Doksuri left a path of destruction in its wake and death toll is still climbing. Now crews are working to save as many people as they can from powerful floodwaters. 
 <br>[04:45:04]
 
CNN's Anna Coren joins me with more from Hong Kong. I mean, the damage from that video is so profound, isn't it, and it's only going to become clearer as the floodwaters pull back hopefully. 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Max. It is extraordinary. The destruction that the super typhoon has left in its path. We got an update to the death toll, Max, 21 people are now dead across China, that's 12 in Beijing with another dozen still missing. 
 
The storm has dumped the heaviest rainfall over the capital ever recorded in 140 years. Heavy rains began pummeling the capital and surrounding areas last Saturday with the average rainfall for the month of July falling on Beijing in just 40 hours. As a result, you know, we've seen those dramatic scenes of severe flooding. It's washing away cars, damaging buildings, roads. Many residents, you know, thousands of residents had to be evacuated. 
 
In neighboring Hebei Province over 800,000 people were evacuated. Authorities there say nine people were killed, six are still missing. And state media reports, Max, that maximum rainfall was recorded in ten weather sessions in Hebei Province, also breaking historical records. 
 
Now the good news is that rainfall in Beijing and Hebei is expected to ease today while the storm moves towards northeastern China. We've heard from Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, saying that every effort must be made to rescue those lost or trapped by the rains. 
 
China, as we know and we've been report on now for weeks, has been experiencing extreme weather and posting record temperatures this summer which scientists believe is a direct result to climate change. 
 
Now the bad news is that there is another typhoon making its way toward China. Typhoon Khanun, the sixth storm this year. It is powerful and slow moving. Now it is currently lashing Japan. Although authorities say that it has weakened slightly. Winds of up to 185 kilometers now. That's 115 miles-per-hour. It's the equivalent of a category 3 Atlantic hurricane. So far one person has died. It's knocked out power to a third of homes in Okinawa. Phone and internet connections have been disrupted. The airport in Okinawa's capital has been closed now for a second day. Okinawa, as we know, home to a majority of U.S. forces in Japan. This typhoon, Max, is expected to move towards China and Taiwan later this week. 
 
FOSTER: Anna Coren in Hong Kong, thank you.
