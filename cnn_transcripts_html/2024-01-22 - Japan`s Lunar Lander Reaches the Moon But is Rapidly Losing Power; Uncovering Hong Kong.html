COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, sunshine. Hope you have an awesome weekend. Here`s a quick thought to start your Monday motivation off right. While you 
 
 are chasing your dreams and your goals and your happiness stop being concerned about people who aren`t concerned about. You will the haters and 
 
 doubters be around no doubt, but if you put those blinders on and stay focused on your purpose and on the people who accept you, nothing can stop 
 
 you. 
 
I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start today in Japan where the country with the world`s third largest economy is now fully in the space race after 
 
 becoming the latest nation to land a spacecraft on the moon. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency or JAXA says it`s uncrewed robotic explorer 
 
 called SLIM, which stands for the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon made a soft landing on the lunar surface. But the agency says the mission may 
 
 end earlier than expected because the spacecraft solar cell is not producing enough electricity. The land`s battery power is so limited that 
 
 JAXA believes it might only last for several hours. 
 
As the agency continues to examine the latest data on the cause of the Lander`s solar cell issue. Space officials believe SLIM is actually not 
 
 pointing in the correct direction. The Japanese space agency, however, still declared this mission of minimum success due to the fact that this 
 
 was a precise, soft lunar landing. 
 
Japan is now the fifth nation in history to land on the moon. Joining the United States, China, India, and the former Soviet Union. Japan is looking 
 
 to make even more strides in the Great Space Race. As Japanese astronauts may be teaming up with NASA`s Artemis program on a mission that looks to 
 
 land the first woman and first person of color on the moon. Our Space and Defense Correspondent, Kristin Fisher has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the good news is that Japan`s Moon Sniper lunar lander has touched down on the surface of 
 
 the moon, but there`s a problem. And the problem is that it`s having a tough time generating power. There`s an issue with one of the lunar 
 
 Lander`s solar cells. And so, Japan`s space agency, JAXA is working right now, troubleshooting. They`re trying to fix it. And there is a chance that 
 
 it could be fixed. It may just have -- may just have to wait until the sun actually moves position and can reach those solar cells. But it`s just too 
 
 soon to say, we`re going have to wait. 
 
But the good news is that Japan was able to pull off this very complex mission. I mean, just landing a spacecraft on the moon is something that 
 
 only four other countries have been able to do. Only two others in this century, China and India, even the United States, hasn`t been able to do 
 
 it, or haven`t even really tried since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So, a big step forward for Japan and its space agency. But still 
 
 too soon to say, if this mission is fully a success. That`s going take a bit of time. 
 
The other thing that`s too soon to determine is if this lunar lander is going to live up to its name as the Moon Sniper because it was going for a 
 
 really precise target.

WIRE: For our next story, we take you just outside of Hong Kong, where at photographer founded way to showcase the beauty of nature that`s often 
 
 concealed during the day. Our Kristie Lu Stout strapped a flashlight to her head and went on a nighttime trek and no wilderness to hunt for critters 
 
 that coexist in the midst of the massive city nearby.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Every night Hong Kong`s iconic skyline stars in its own show. A spectacle of lasers and steel in one of the most 
 
 densely populated places on earth. Less than 20 kilometers away, another curtain opens to reveal a natural world often forgotten in the dark. 
 
(On Camera): We`re in Shing Mun Country Park. In the daytime this is an area very popular for hikers. But at night time, that`s when the creatures 
 
 come out.
 
What are you hoping that we will find tonight?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m hoping to find a couple of snakes and any other aquatic creatures.
 
STOUT: Leading are nocturnal safari, Hong Kong British educator and photographer Lawrence Hylton. In the darkness of night, Hylton has captured 
 
 images of birds like this quizzical collared scops owl, insects like the Atlas moth and snakes like this white-lipped pit viper.
 
LAWRENCE HYLTON, NATURE PHOTOGRAPHER: My favorite are snakes and spiders. However, I try and go for anything that I can get my camera up against.
 
STOUT: Hylton says he photographs the animals as he encounters them with minimal impact to them or the environment.
 
HYLTON: It will come out. It`s OK.
 
STOUT: So, we are on a way to the stream.
 
HYLTON: Yes, we are.
 
STOUT: And looking for snakes along the way.
 
(Voice-over): Wandering past water buffalo at rest, we encounter warty newts at play.
 
(On camera): Oh yes, right there, two of them. 
 
(Voice-over): A huntsman spider shows off its mysterious beauty as a monkey watches from above. It takes patience and a passion for every creature, big 
 
 and small.
 
HYLTON: Watch your step.
 
STOUT: Trekking in the dark is not easy. You have to watch your feet. And always keep your eyes open.
 
HYLTON: We have relatively pristine stream ways, which is quite rare for Hong Kong. Also, as far away enough from civilization that wildlife can 
 
 live without too much disturbance.
 
STOUT: Hong Kong is home to an astonishing array of wildlife with many creatures emerging only at night. Some 40% of the territory is protected 
 
 parkland. But here and around the world, poaching and urbanization are destroying safe havens.
 
BOSCO CHAN, WWF-HK DIRECTOR OF CONSERVATION: We have lost, on average, almost 70% of our wildlife populations since the 1970s. And that, by 
 
 itself, tells you we are not doing too well protecting the planet globally.
 
STOUT: At the end of this century, it`s estimated up to 33 million hectares of natural habitat will be lost as a result of urban development. That is 
 
 more than the size of the U.S. State of New Mexico.
 
Lawrence says his mission is to promote conservation through photography.
 
HYLTON: We have lots of trackers who visit this area and fear snake and fear the unknown. Makes people do silly things. And hopefully, someday in 
 
 the future, everyone can just enjoy nature.
 
STOUT: Nearing midnight, we spot a rare Futsing Wolf Snake -- nonvenomous, nocturnal and extremely rare in Hong Kong. Bearing witness to the richness 
 
 of nature in the backyard of a global metropolis.
 
Bye-bye.

WIRE: Pop quiz hot shot.
 
Which of these legendary artists was a feature member of the group of musicians and actors known as The Rat Pack?
 
Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, or Elvis Presley?

All right, squeak hearts. I don`t mean to be cheesy, but today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 in is pretty "ratmarkable" Jeanne Moos takes us to 
 
 Chicago where a hole in the ground is raising a whole lot of questions.

 impression. Thanks to artist Winslow Dumaine.
 
WINSLOW DUMAINE, ARTIST: They`re starting to call me Rat Hole guy, so.
 
MOOS (voice-over): In early January a friend told Winslow about the rat imprint on Chicago`s north side, his reaction.
 
DUMAINE: Immediate laughter.
 
MOOS (voice-over): He ratted out the rat hole by posting this photo and now people are making pilgrimages to the imprint, posing leaving money and 
 
 flowers even a fake mouse. Residents say the rat hole has been around for more than 20 years.
 
MOOS (on camera): But is it a rat?
 
DUMAINE: OK, it`s probably a squirrel. It has like the wide hips and the long claws of a squirrel.
 
MOOS (voice-over): Whatever it was, one state representative is touting it as the jewel of the 11th district.
 
UNIDENIFIED FEMALE: The Chicago rapper.
 
MOOS (voice-over): But everyone is wondering did he get out. Optimus say you can see paw prints.
 
DUMAINE: Leading away from the -- the splat hole.
 
MOOS: It`s become the Wile E. Coyote of Chicago. Let`s let the leader of the Rat Pack salute the city`s latest tourist attraction.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s my kind of town, Chicago.
