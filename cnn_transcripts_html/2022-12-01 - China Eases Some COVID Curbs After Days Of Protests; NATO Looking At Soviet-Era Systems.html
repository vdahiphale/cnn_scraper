PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Hello everyone, I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM. China claims it's entering a new stage of COVID controls, hoping to calm public anger and anti-lockdown protests. 
 
Ukraine says it needs more weapons from the west and fast but stockpiles are running low and it may need to rely on more arms from the Soviet-era. 
 
And heavy rains trigger flash floods and landslides in Brazil leaving dozens missing and a huge mess to clean up.
 
And so, we begin with new signs China may be ready to make adjustments to its zero COVID policy. Beijing's top COVID response official says the country now faces a "new stage and mission in controlling the pandemic." 
 
Now, some of the more notable changes are taking place in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, which has seen days of protests now. The city is lifting lockdowns in some areas ending district wide mass testing, and letting some close contacts of COVID patients isolate at home instead of in those notorious quarantine facilities. 
 
Now, there are reports of similar moves meantime in Shanghai, Reuters obtained video from that city showing people pushing and shoving people in hazmat suits. Now, it's not clear when the footage was recorded. 
 
CNN has been able to verify at least 20 protests in 15 different cities right across China since the weekend. 
 
For more now, we want to bring in CNN's Anna Coren, she is tracking developments from Hong Kong. And Anna, tell us what do you make of these latest moves, especially since it does seem as if they're capitulating right to some of the protests?
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, it certainly would seem that way, Paula, it has taken these mass protests since the weekend, you know, right across the country for the government to rethink its very strict zero COVID policy that it has maintained now for almost three years. 
 
Yesterday, we heard from a very senior Chinese official, which gave people a lot of hope. She is the Vice Premier in charge of pandemic containment. And she spoke to Xinhua News Agency, you know, one of the government mouthpieces, and she said that the focus needs to be on a human centered approach. 
 
Let me read to you what she said. With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China's pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission.
 
Now, there was no mention of zero COVID. It came after she had spoken to the National Health Commission, which also said a few days ago that, you know, China needs to rectify its COVID policies. 
 
Now, as a result, we are seeing a relaxation in COVID measures from local officials happening in Shanghai, in Beijing, in Guangzhou, which you just mentioned, as well as in Chongqing. This is giving people a great deal of hope. 
 
We even heard from the Global Times, you know, another mouthpiece of the government this morning and an editorial citing data from the U.S. here in Hong Kong as well as China's saying that this current strain of Omicron is not as virulent, it's not as dangerous. People don't need to be as worried.
 
Now, this is a complete about face Paula for the Chinese government because for almost three years now, they have cemented into the minds of the population that COVID is dangerous, that it is deadly. That if anything the government by taking these draconian measures of lockdowns, of quarantine facilities, of barricading entire complexes, that it is protecting the population. 
 
But because of these protests, which was sparked from that fire and those 10 deaths in Xinjiang on the 24th of November, and this wave of dissent, which, you know, we have not witnessed this in China for a generation, the government has realized that to quell these protests, you know, it can't do it just by censorship, that it needs to take actions and it needs to ease these very strict COVID policies. So that is what we are seeing taking place now, Paula.
 <br>[00:05:11] 
 
NEWTON: Yes, certainly extraordinary moves there in China, again, in response to what they see as you know, perhaps legitimate questions about what purpose these lockdown serve. Anna Coren for us in Hong Kong, appreciate it. 
 
Now, the Chinese city of Zhengzhou has now lifted a five day lockdown. The city is home to the world's largest iPhone factory owned by Foxconn where employees revolted over the past few weeks over working conditions and COVID restrictions.
 
CNN's Selina Wang has our report.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Anger boils over into violent protests at the world's largest iPhone factory. Workers stream out of Foxconn's factory dorms in central China, protesting unfair treatment, dirty living conditions, and chaotic COVID rules at the Apple supplier. 
 
Videos obtained by CNN show a group of police in white hazmat suits beating workers with batons and metal rods. The police are hitting people, a worker shouts in the video. 
 
A Foxconn employee at the protest told CNN, the scene turned into a river of blood. Police hit the workers ruthlessly.
 
Earlier, squadrons of riot police had rolled in. They're going to start beating us, protesters yelled in fear, facing off rows of law enforcement with riot gear. The protest escalated into the evening, workers tearing down COVID barriers using metal beams against police.
 
Masses of them hurling metal parts towards law enforcement, even using a COVID barrier as a shield against rows of authorities. They worked together to push over a police car, cheering and chanting. 
 
Since October, the Foxconn plant has been sealed off from the outside world after a COVID outbreak that forced employees to live and work on site, in what videos obtained by CNN show are filthy conditions, garbage piling up in the hallway.
 
The factory plunged into chaos. Videos showed workers scrambling, fighting to get enough food and supplies. Then came the exodus, masses of workers walked miles along highways to escape the plant. Analysts estimate this factory produces more than half of Apple's iPhones.
 
Apple already warned customers they'll need to wait even longer to get their new products because of China's COVID lockdowns.
 
So, to attract workers, Foxconn promised higher pay and bonuses. New workers signed up. But when they got to the factory, the pay package was worse than what Foxconn advertised.
 
A Foxconn employee said workers felt cheated, leading to thousands of people protesting. Foxconn later blamed the payment discrepancy on a "technical error" and sent text messages to workers offering to pay them $1,400 to quit and go. 
 
Soon after, videos showed long lines of workers boarding buses to leave the factory. Their departure possibly putting an end to another violent and dramatic scene, but increasing the pressure on Apple, it's just the latest victim of China's zero COVID policy.
 
Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON: There's a new international effort to hold Russia accountable for its war on Ukraine. The President of the European Commission is proposing a new court to investigate and prosecute Russia for its aggression and cruelty. 
 
Ursula von der Leyen says Moscow and its oligarchs must cover the costs of rebuilding Ukraine. Estimated now at more than $600 billion and compensate for the damage caused. 
 
Now, specifically, she referred to the horrors of Bucha were alleged evidence of Russian war crimes against civilians shocked the world in the early months of the war.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
URSULA VON DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Russia must pay for its horrific crimes, including for its crime of aggression against a sovereign state. 
 
And this is why while continuing to support the International Criminal Court, we are proposing to set up a specialized court backed by the United Nations to investigate and prosecute Russia's crime of aggression.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: So, Ukraine has in fact welcomed the E.U.'s court proposal calling it exactly what they've been waiting for. 
 
Meantime, Ukraine's Foreign Minister is calling on NATO to supply the country with everything needed to defeat Russia as quickly as possible. 
 <br>[00:10:02]
 
Now, he delivered the message in person Wednesday on the second day of talks between NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest. He thanked the bloc for pledging more aid to Ukraine, including for its energy infrastructure, which has been heavily damaged by weeks of Russian attacks.
 
And Ukraine welcomed additional military aid including armored vehicles, artillery and winter uniforms. 
 
America's top diplomat Antony Blinken tells CNN the U.S. is very focused on providing air defense systems to Kyiv. But Ukraine's Foreign Minister says there is one specific system they need more than all the others, listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DMYTRO KULEBA, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: The message is simple, give patriots as soon as you can. Because this is the system that Ukraine needs to protect its civilian population and critical infrastructure. This is not an offensive weapon.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Cedric Leighton is a CNN Military Analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, he joins us now from Washington. Good to see you. 
 
And I really need your opinion on this. What is the danger you think in the months ahead? Given the first issue, which is the seemingly relentless draw down of weapons from the U.S. and other NATO countries, you know, as this war continues to draw down on more and more stockpiles and equipment?
 
COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Paula, that's one of the big issues that's confronting the entire Western alliance, because the defense industrial base, as it's known, of all these countries, the NATO countries in Europe as well as the United States and Canada, it's really not built for this kind of a war. And that very fact has made it really difficult for the West to resupply Ukraine.
 
Ukraine is using weapons at a very high rate. It's using ammunition of course as part of this. And then the other thing that we're confronted with is the barrels of the various artillery pieces are overheating because of overuse. 
 
So, that's a major issue for the Ukrainians and for the West, especially if the West wants to continue to help the Ukrainian send -- help the Ukrainian stop the Russians.
 
NEWTON: You know, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, but the option we were just talking about it, right, if possibly resuscitating Soviet-era weapons systems, I never thought it would hear this after hearing for more than three decades, that the West wanted these Eastern European countries to modernize their military, but I want you to listen to them now, we'll talk on the back end.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We're looking at every option to make sure that, again, they get what they need, and what can be most effective for them. 
 
Some of that does go to Soviet-era systems that they've had in their inventory for decades, and for example, making sure that the ammunition is there for those -- for those systems.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: So, Colonel, does this strike you as a good strategic option or more of a sign of desperation that, you know, there has been a study the most recent from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and found that it would take years to replenish these stocks, given that as you say, the industrial military complex is designed for peace. 
 
I mean, does it strike you as desperate or a creative idea? LEIGHTON: Somewhat creative, in the sense that the Ukrainians of course, have had this Soviet-era weapon systems ever since they gain their or regain their independence in 1991. 
 
So, they're used to this, they've been trained on this. And even if they've had a break in service between their initial military service and their call up for this war, they're so familiar with these -- with these weapons systems. 
 
So, in that sense, it makes sense to do that. But on the other hand, these systems are old, they are not as effective as their western counterparts, especially the modern Western counterparts. And the Ukrainians would be better served if they could receive the western systems, and they could be trained on them. 
 
So, that's a big and. But that is one of the key things that would need to happen in this case. 
 
So, I think that requires a lot of creative solutions, you know, using the old Soviet equipment, but also ramping up the training for modern Western equipment to be used by the Ukrainians themselves.
 
NEWTON: Right, I see like a two-track approach that you're talking about. I'm going to lean on your expertise here, because we all remember at the start of this war that Ukraine asked for that no fly zone that they didn't get.
 
Now, you say it's now highly likely that these new air defense systems that they get maybe could potentially have a truly integrated air and missile defense system in place for Ukraine. 
 
Do you think though, that it will come soon enough, given everything you've seen on the battlefield?
 
LEIGHTON: Yes, that's my biggest concern, Paula, I actually bet they won't come soon enough. So, this requires not only the logistical piece to move forward, but also the training piece to move forward. 
 
And you know, we do understand that the U.S. is working in conjunction with the Ukrainians and with NATO partners, especially Germany to train a much greater volume of Ukrainians on a western systems. 
 <br>[00:15:12]
 
So, if that happens, it can be done. But it also requires the Ukrainians to leave their country and leave their fighting posts in order to come in and get some training and then come back. 
 
So, it's a -- it's a bit of a tough haul. And it's a, you know, certainly very concerning. And basically, the clock is running out in multiple directions. And that's going to be a really big problem for the West, for the Ukrainians and really for the world.
 
NEWTON: Yes, you really have laid bare the challenges ahead on what will continue will be for certain a tough winter. Colonel Leighton, thanks so much. LEIGHTON: You bet, Paula. Thank you.
 
NEWTON: Now, Ukraine is meantime stepping up security at its embassies worldwide after a letter bomb exploded Wednesday at its Embassy in Madrid. Spanish officials say Ukrainian employee was slightly injured. 
 
The letter was addressed to Ukraine's ambassador to Spain. A separate letter bomb was also delivered to a company that reportedly made some of the weapons Spain has sent to Ukraine. That device was safely deactivated.
 
Spanish official says the second envelope apparently came from Ukraine and investigators believe that may be the case with the first one as well. She says both letters had the same return address.
 
OK, many are watching this one after a humiliating start to their World Cup campaign. Argentina turned it around and have comfortably secured their spot in the knockout rounds.
 
I think they're relieved, that was the reaction of Buenos Aires during Argentina's 2-0 defeat of Poland Wednesday. 
 
But elsewhere in Group C, yes, it's the chaos group. There was a heartbreak. Patrick Snell has the highlights and a look at Thursday's critical showdown.
 
PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT CORRESPONDENT (on camera): I'm Patrick Snell. We start with a highly dramatic Wednesday night in Group C at the World Cup as Lionel Messi's Argentina knew there was little margin for error in the high stakes showdown with Poland led by their own superstar talisman, Robert Lewandowski.
 
35 Messi has revealed this is most likely his World Cup, the last chance to win the one remaining title he covers more than any other. Messi though is human after all missing a penalty from 12 yards out, a spot kick. Brilliantly saved by Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny, right at the start of the second half (INAUDIBLE) ahead through Alexis Mac Allister who plays for English Premier League Brighton, very well taken goal indeed.
 
And then Argentina making the game safe when the Manchester City youngster Julian Alvarez finishes superbly for the 2-0 final score lines, stunning strike. Argentina emerging as group winners to reach the last 16.
 
But what about Poland? Well, that would depend on the outcome of Mexico-Saudi Arabia, the group's other game to advance El Tri (PH) leading goals and when Luis Chavez scored a stunning free kick to put them 2-0 up, the Mexicans had hoped and at that point with Argentina also two up, Mexico needing one more goal to advance to the last 16. 
 
Instead, though, they concede, Saudi Arabia who could have advanced with a win netting throughout the Saudi. Mexico win 2-1 that failed to read the knockout stages for the first time since 1978. Huge disappointment then for El Tri and their fans who go out on goal difference having finished level on points with Poland. It was that close.
 
The Pols progressing to the last 16 for the first time since Mexico 86. They play France on Sunday, Argentina face Australia on Saturday.
 
Now, to Group D drama as Tunisia take the lead against world champions that are already qualified France just shy of the Auerbach and at that point, the Tunisians were actually through to the last 16. The skipper Wahbi Khazri taking his goal really well against the French who knew they had already advanced of course, but Tunisia nonetheless holding on for a very famous 1-0 victory. 
 
So, Tunisia is scoring in the 58th minute of that game, but in the 60th minute of the Australia-Denmark game, with the Aussies who get the goal they craved they needed this one to advance. What a moment for Mathew Leckie, finishes off a superb move, scores a priceless golf for his country, massive disappointment for the Danes who knew they needed to win to progress. 
 
Share elation over the Socceroos who remember qualify for the World Cup by the playoffs and a penalty shootout.
 
Congrats to Australia's famous win for the Tunisians which they should be very proud indeed. But it is Australia's victory that ensures they progress to the last 16 for the first time since Germany 2006.
 
Four more games on top for Thursday with giants Germany and Belgium a must win classes, watch this space, we're following it all the way, right back to you.
 <br>[00:20:02]
 
NEWTON: And our thanks there to Patrick. Now, in that upcoming Germany versus Costa Rica match that will feature a first for the Men's World Cup, which is an all-woman team of referee -- of referees. 
 
Now, the head ref will be France's Stephanie Frappart who was the first woman to officiate a UEFA men's Champions League match two years ago, she'll be joined by assistants from Brazil and Mexico, previously told CNN she doesn't think about breaking barriers or making history and is just focused on doing her job. 
 
Now, Russia meantime is stepping up its crackdown on what it calls LGBT propaganda. The Moscow sees it as a broader battle against the West, we'll explain why.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: So, legendary singer songwriter Christine McVie of the rock band Fleetwood Mac has died. No cause of death was given but a family statement says she died following a brief illness. 
 
Now McVie, was also the group's keyboardist and the songwriting force behind many of Fleetwood Mac's best known hits, including Say You Love Me, Over My Head and Little Lies, and believe me, I am only naming a few of them. The band released a statement, saying in part she was the best
 
 musician anyone could have in their band, and the best friend anyone could have in their life. 
 
Christine McVie was 79 years old. 
 
Russia is one step away from formally expanding its ban on what the government calls LGBT propaganda. The upper House of parliament passed a controversial bill Wednesday. Now it just needs President Vladimir Putin signature as Fred Pleitgen reports the Kremlin is framing the move as part of a larger battle with the West.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For years, being gay has been extremely tough in Russia. Now it's about to get even harder. 
 
After Russian parliament passed what it calls the LGBT propaganda law, claiming, in part, it's a defense against U.S. influence.
 
VYACHESLAV VOLODIN, RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKER (through translator): I cannot put it any other way, the United States of America has become the global center of this sodomy. Let them live there, don't touch us.
 
PLEITGEN: Anti-gay tirades are often embedded into coverage of what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine on state T.V., making the war out to be part of a larger battle of Russia against the West of its alleged moral decay.
 
Yarolslav Rasputin, a gay rights activist in Moscow, says he feels singled out.
 
YAROLSLAV RASPUTIN, LGBTQ ACTIVIST (through translator): This is the information noise that we are becoming victims of. We are being used as scapegoats to distract attention and redirect the hatred of the electorate that supports Putin and the war.
 
PLEITGEN: Russian President Vladimir Putin often portrays himself as the savior of traditional family values even equating Western LGBTQ freedoms to devil worshipping.
 <br>[00:25:07]
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Such a total denial of a human being, a rejection of faith and traditional values. Suppression of freedom begins to look like a perverted religion, outright Satanism.
 
PLEITGEN: The new law bans praise of what the government considers nontraditional sexual relationships or otherwise suggesting those relationships are "normal". But LGBTQ activist Renat Davletgildeev who has fled the country says the law will essentially make it illegal to be openly gay in Russia.
 
RENAT DAVLETGILDEEV, LGBTQ ACTIVIST AND JOURNALIST (through translator): The only text that I can now show publicly, according to the law in Russia in my social network on the street, in a newspaper, or in a movie, is, gays are outlawed, gays are bad, and lesbians should be in jail.
 
PLEITGEN: Not a single Russian legislator voted against the bill. Punishment includes fines of up to thousands of dollars for individuals. Foreigners could be jailed for up to 15 days and deported.
 
Vladimir Komov heads an organization providing legal aid to the LGBTQ community. And he fears the lawyers might soon be targeted as well with significant fines for legal entities.
 
VLADIMIR KOMOV, HEAD OF DELO LGBT (through translator): There are fears among lawyers that if they defend political cases like rallies or alleged gay propaganda, this may be turned against them in the future.
 
PLEITGEN: But activists and lawyers fear that even more of Russia's LGBTQ community will come to the conclusion that their only way to live openly will be to flee the country.
 
Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

NEWTON: Still ahead for us, rescuers in Brazil search for dozens of people missing after a deadly landslide. We'll have the latest on conditions in the region.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Newton. At least two people are dead in southern Brazil after heavy rain triggered a landslide. 
 
Now, it cut off access to two ports, one of which is the second largest in Brazil for sugar and grain shipments. Authorities believe several vehicles and trailers are now buried in the mud on a highway with as many as 50 people possibly missing. Flash flooding has also been reported in the region.
 
Meteorologist Derek Van Dam has been tracking all of this for us. And Derek, I really can't believe the pictures from this and obviously, 50 people still missing.
 <br>[00:30:02]
 
VAN DAM: Terrifying. And look at this picture behind me. The same truck that you saw a close-up of a moment ago, just dangling over the edge. This is a very susceptible Hillside.
 
In fact, I did a bit of research before this live hit and found out that a study on landslides back in 2007 said that slope angles, the angle of the mountainside that is most susceptible and most likely to see a landslide is anywhere from ten degrees to 30 degrees. And this is -- certainly falls within that category.
 
And these landslides are particularly dangerous, especially in the communities at the bottom of the ravines, at the bottom of the canyons, because when they pick up momentum, they can pick up anything, from boulders to full trees, even houses and vehicles, and in this instance, trucks as well. 
 
Now, the Brazilian Meteorological Agency on Wednesday did have the highest likelihood of flash flooding and landslides in the area that was struck hardest by our landslides. Basically, the heavy rain was just too much, soaking into the soil, gravity one, and we saw the landslide take out so -- so much infrastructure within that particular area. 
 
Rainfall totals here in excess of 150 millimeters from the recent rains in the Southern portions of Brazil. 
 
This is the wettest time of the year. We're talking November, December, even into January, where climatologically speaking, this particular area in the Southern states of Brazil receive over 200 millimeters within a monthly period. 
 
So what's in store for the future here? Well, they have more scattered showers and thunderstorms in the forecast. So that's going to complicate the search-and-rescue and recovery operations that are going to be ongoing. 
 
You can see the forecast for these locations going forward. They look rather wet. 
 
Back to you. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, and I see also stormy, so we'll continue to keep our fingers crossed for authorities there in Brazil.
 
VAN DAM: Yes.
 
NEWTON: Appreciate it, Derek. 
 
Now the Biden White House is pulling out all the stops for Thursday's state dinner with the president and the first lady of France. But before that happens, the two leaders have a lot of tough issues they need to try and work through. Details of that, just ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
NEWTON: So for the first time ever, a Finnish prime minister is visiting New Zealand. Sanna Marin met with Jacinda Ardern in Auckland, with both leaders reaffirming the need for global support for Ukraine.
 
And they also welcomed a U.N. fact-finding mission to investigate human rights abuses in Iran. 
 
But one reporter's question seemed to miss the mark. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of people will be wondering, are you two
 
 people meeting just because, you know, you're similar in age, and you know, got a lot of, you know, common stuff, when you got into politics and stuff, or can kiwis actually expect to see more deals between our two countries down the line? Because there is, I mean --
 <br>[00:35:06]
 
JACINDA ARDERN, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER: My first -- my first question is, I wonder whether or not anyone ever asked Barack Obama and John Key if they met because they were of similar age? We, of course, have a higher proportion of men in politics. It's reality. Because two women meet, it's not simply because of their gender.
 
SANNA MARIN, FINNISH PRIME MINISTER: Yes, we are meeting because we are prime ministers. Of course.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: So they didn't seem to have a lot of patience for that question. 
 
Marin, just for the record, is 37 years old. Ardern is 42. The Finnish prime minister says she's focused on the coronavirus pandemic, the energy crisis in Europe, and trade with New Zealand. And reporters are free to write about whatever they want. 
 
Britain's royal family is again embroiled in allegations of racism. 
 
Buckingham Palace confirms a longtime member of the household apologized and has stepped down now for allegedly grilling a black woman about her heritage at a royal reception on Tuesday. 
 
That woman was the CEO of Sistah Space. It is a charity that helps domestic abuse victims. And even though she was born in Britain, she claims the palace aide repeatedly asked her where she was from. She said the exchange was deeply unsettling. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NGOZI FULANI, CEO, SISTAH SPACE: When you come into Buckingham Palace, you're searched, quite rightly, to protect the people that are in there, but then I asked myself, what protection was there for me against this kind of racism? 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NEWTON: Now, the British media have identified the palace member as Lady Susan Hussey. She is Prince William's godmother, in fact, and served for decades as lady in waiting to the late Queen Elizabeth. 
 
Now, the racism controversy is casting a shadow of sorts over the visit by the new prince and princess of Wales to the United States. They arrived in Boston on Wednesday on their first trip to the U.S. since the death of Queen Elizabeth. 
 
The trip's focus is meant to be on the Earth Shot Prize, an environmental honor Prince William founded and will present on Friday. 
 
On Thursday, the royals plan to visit several climate tech start-ups. 
 
They were at a basketball game, as well, for the record. 
 
Now, France's president and first lady will be feted Thursday evening at the first official state dinner of the Biden administration. Day one of Macron's visit ended Wednesday night. You see it there, with a cozy, private dinner with the Bidens out and about, right, at a Washington restaurant. Quite a picture there. 
 
President Macron and President Biden get down to brass tacks, though, on Thursday, with a host of sensitive issues, including Ukraine, China and bilateral trade, all on the agenda. 
 
CNN's Melissa Bell has the details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It was the first state visit of the Trump presidency. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- only have predicted (ph).
 
BELL (voice-over): An attempt at bromance, in desperate search of common ground.
 
TRUMP: I'll get that little piece of dandruff off.
 
BELL (voice-over): A visit anchored by the traditional pomp and pageantry that will also mark the first state visit of the Biden administration. 
 
PHILIPPE ETIENNE, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: This time, I would say the context is not the same, because we have the war in Ukraine, the Russian invasion, and many, many crises, still more than in 2018. 
 
BELL (voice-over): Among them, the climate and energy crises. Areas for cooperation in theory, given the two presidents' more natural chemistry and their shared commitment to multilateralism. 
 
EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
 
BELL (voice-over): But the sailing since Biden's election hasn't been as smooth as Europeans had imagined. 
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm honored today to be joined by two of America's closest allies, Australia and the United Kingdom 
 
BELL (voice-over): With France blindsided by the AUKUS agreement, the France ambassador to Washington recalled. 
 
The G20 in Rome that autumn not quite an opportunity for a hug.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- apologize, Mr. President?
 
BIDEN: Who? (ph).
 
BELL (voice-over): Nor an apology, but at least an explanation 
 
BIDEN: What happened was, to use an English phrase, the deal was clumsy. It was not done with a lot of grace. 
 
ETIENNE: We have learned on the European side that, even if you have a U.S. administration which is more multilateral in its approach, you have issues on the table. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE Excuse me, sorry to interrupt you 
 
BELL (voice-over): But behind the proximity and unity that the war in Ukraine have brought, Europe's feathers have once again been ruffled, this time by the Inflation Reduction Act, and behind the scenes of this visit, President Macron will be demanding more help for Europe on energy 
 
MACRON: But this is, as well, a story of great cooperation between our two countries. 
 
BELL: The oak tree meant to symbolize the longevity of the transatlantic friendship that he brought last time time has since died. 
 
This time, the Elysee says President Macron will be bringing a gift that symbolizes France. And this time, too, a determination for Europe to be heard.

NEWTON: Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have chosen Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Nancy Pelosi as their leader next year. And that will make Jeffries the first black leader of one of the two major parties in the U.S. Congress, and signifies an important generational shift. 
 
CNN's Eva McKend filed this introduction.

EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After nearly a decade on Capitol Hill, Brooklyn-bred attorney Hakeem Jeffries making history as House Democrats selected him as the first black American to lead a party in Congress. 
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): I stand on the shoulders of people like Shirley Chisholm and so many others, as we work to advance the ball for everyday Americans and get stuff done. Because that's what Democrats do. 
 
MCKEND (voice-over): At 52, Jeffries' ascension marks a generational change, from 82-year-old outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 
JEFFRIES: We're going to work hard tot --
 
MCKEND (voice-over): Jeffries became Democratic caucus chair in 2019, and has long been known for his advocacy around affordable housing and criminal justice reform, working across the aisle in 2019 to get the First Step Act passed. 
 
JEFFRIES: We look forward to finding opportunities to partner with the other side of the aisle and work with them whenever possible, but we will also push back against extremism whenever necessary. 
 
MCKEND (voice-over): But it was his role as an impeachment manager during former President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial that was among Jeffries' most high-profile posts, highlighting his background as a lawyer and his penchant for weaving in the legacy of hip-hop. 
 
JEFFRIES: That is why we are here, Mr. Sekulow. And if you don't know, now you know. 
 
One of my constituents say, aren't you the congressman that shouted out Biggie Smalls on the House floor two years ago? I said, Yes, that was me. 
 
He said, and Now I hear that you're the No. 5 Democrat in the House of Representatives? How did that happen?
 
And the only way that I could respond by quoting the Bigbie Smalls lyric, which is you never thought that hip-hop would take it this far. And so I think that Biggie Smalls, Jay-Z, in many ways, you know, capture sort of the aspirational aspect of the American dream. 
 
MCKEND (voice-over): A former longtime staffer suggests Jeffries will pose a formidable challenge to Republicans. 
 
MICHAEL HARDAWAY, FORMER JEFFRIES COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: He has a mind like a computer. He is absolutely brilliant. And so he remembers every single detail of everything. For all of his speeches, we never write his speeches out. We put together the substance, and he can just go and speak for 45 minutes. 
 
MCKEND (voice-over): And argues he's the right man for this moment. 
 
HARDAWAY: In 2015, I said to him, I said, You're going to be the next speaker of the House. Because the reality of our party is that we have this old faction that was destined to leave at some point, and Hakeem was the guy that can best articulate what we stood for. And we now live in an era where that matters more than most other things. 
 
JEFFRIES: Can't stop!
 
MCKEND (voice-over): But Jeffries will have to contend with the left wing of the party, who view him as part of the establishment, and he's poised to take the mantle with a Democratic minority. MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, PROFESSOR, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY: As the great
 
 philosopher Grace Jones said, I may not be perfect, but I'm perfect for you. So for those who claim he's not progressive enough, there are far less progressive people who could stand in his stead and try to occupy his space. 
 
He's as progressive a figure as is capable of securing the broad base of the Democratic Party in order to represent them.
