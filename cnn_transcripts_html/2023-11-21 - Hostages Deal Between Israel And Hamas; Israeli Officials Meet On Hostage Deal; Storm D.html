KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Oren, what are you learning about this war cabinet meeting? What could be coming in the next hour plus?
 
OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, first, the war cabinet meeting itself, which starts in half an hour and will likely take place at the defense minister here behind me, is the first in a series of steps towards getting -- towards what would be getting a deal approved that would allow for the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza both Israeli and perhaps from other nationalities as well. For example, we know there are Nepali and Thai citizens who are hostages as well.
 
This has to go through a legal and political process. First with the war cabinet, which as you said, is scheduled to meet in half an hour. Second, with the security cabinet, which is a slightly larger cabinet that includes other ministries. And then with the full cabinet, each gets a vote. There can be some arguments, some discussion in each of those. But crucially, the process looks like it's moving and moving quite quickly here.
 
Following that, there's a 24-hour period where there can be appeals to the Supreme Court to try to stop this process. And then after that happens, if we get to an agreement, that can lead to the release of Palestinian prisoners and the freeing of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.
 
We did just learn a little bit more here about what's happening on the government side. And again, this is more of a critical indication that this entire process is moving forward and that we might expect an announcement soon. This from the prime minister's office a short time ago, it says, in light of developments on the issue of the release of our hostages, the prime minister's office director general, Yossi Shelley, is now convening the Forum of Directors General of Government Ministries to prepare for dealing with and assisting on all necessary civilian aspects.
 
So, although that doesn't tell us much about exactly what's happening, it is more statements and more indications that the government is preparing to handle the release of hostages and everything that entails. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN: And there's a lot that this deal entails, and we don't know the full contours of exactly what it would be until announced and until hostages are actually freed. But one aspect that we've heard about, especially learned about this morning, is that this would -- could, would include three Palestinian prisoners in Israel being released for every one hostage being released by Hamas from Gaza. What do you know about prisoners in Israel?
 
LIEBERMANN: There are obviously thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons, and that was the overarching goal of Hamas at the very beginning. They said quite early on, look, we'll release our 240 hostages in exchange for all of the Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
 
Now, that's not what's happening here. From our understanding of the framework of the agreement, it'll be 50 women and children in exchange, as you said, at a three to one ratio for Palestinian women and children. And if that works over the course of a four-or five-day pause in the fighting, then it could be extended, 50 more hostages released in exchange for another 150 women and children, we still believe at this point.
 
How it will work from the release of Israeli prisoners is 10 a day. We will see how it works on the Palestinian side of prisoners, whether it will be all at once or the same three to one. So, if 10 Israeli prisoners or hostages are released from Gaza, it will be 30 released.
 
It's worth noting, though, that we have gotten no indication that any of the hostages held in Gaza are to be Israeli soldiers who will be released. And that's a key question because for the full release of the hostages, Hamas will have to agree to the release of Israeli soldiers who were captured in the terror attack on October 7th.
 
But Hamas believes likely that those hostages that are soldiers are much more valuable to the Israeli government. Why? Because back in 2011, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released 1027 Palestinian prisoners for a single Israeli soldier. It is likely that Hamas believes they can get many more of their prisoners released if they were to release the Israeli soldiers held in Gaza. So, that too is something we'll have to keep a very close eye on.
 
BOLDUAN: Oren, are you also hearing -- one aspect that stuck out to me in the reporting about the contours of this deal is that during the days long pauses that Israel would agree to stop flying surveillance drones over Gaza for a six-hour period of time per day. It just stuck out to me as quite specific. Are you hearing anything more about that?
 
LIEBERMANN: Very much so. So, we had reported several days ago, along with Alex Marquardt and some of my other colleagues, that Hamas was pushing for a complete ban on Israeli drone overflights of Gaza during the pause. And that was something we said Israel would be very unlikely to agree to.
 
First, Israel uses surveillance drones to look at its own troops in Gaza and make sure or try to see in advance whether they're coming under attack. But it also uses surveillance drones to monitor Hamas movements. Now, as we can see from the framework we understand of this agreement, Hamas didn't get what they want, and a complete ban on Israeli drone overflights over the course of four days. But they do get six-hour windows each day, as we understand it, where Israel agrees not to fly drones.
 
For Israel, that means it won't be able to see the battlefield from above, which is obviously critical to anybody trying to manage a battle. But for Hamas, it allows them, first, to move their own forces around, but also crucially to move the hostages in secret.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
We know Hamas has stated they're not holding all of the hostages, so they need to round them up from other factions to do that. They need a window in which they can move around the six-hour window without Israeli drone overflight likely when they will try to do that. And that's why that's critical on Hamas' side and what Israel risks there by not allowing it -- or by not flying, I should say.
 
BOLDUAN: Exactly. Oren, thank you so much. A lot to come. Oren's going to stick close. We're going to have a lot of developments coming in the next hour. Oren, thank you.
 
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Now, back here in the United States, it is a countdown to Turkey Day and millions of Americans are right now keeping a close eye on the skies as the busy holiday travel week heats up.
 
I want to give you a live look at Atlanta International Airport right now, where a strong line of storms is moving in, and it's not the only major airport facing possible weather delays. CNN's Whitney Wild is live at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Whitney, what is the vibe there from travelers you've been speaking to over the course of the day?
 
WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Honestly, it is very relaxed, and that is the biggest surprise of the day because we have this weather system coming through the country. There was rain here in the Chicago area, which, Omar, I know you lived here. You know what it's like when the rain hits because there's traffic problems, there are car accidents. But for the most part, it has been pretty.
 
So, we've seen some crowds, but people are getting through the security line pretty quickly. Right now, it is very slow. It's been like this for about an hour. I mean, some of these security lines don't even have anybody in them. You can walk right up to TSA. So, all things considered, when you think about how many people are coming through O'Hare, as well as Midway, which is the airport on the other side of the city here in Chicago, when you consider 1.65 million travelers are expected to come through both of those airports this week, right now, this is looking pretty good.
 
We spoke with one man who's traveling with his seven adult children, his thirteen grandchildren, he was beaming with his big family here at O'Hare, but he knows that it could be very chaotic. So, here's how he planned his day.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTOPHER SKOKNA, TRAVELING TODAY: I was scared. The three older boys were yelling and saying, we got plenty of time, we got plenty of time, but I was just nervous because I didn't know if I'd get to the airport. A year ago, when I picked up my daughter from Mexico here, it took me two hours just to get into the terminal with the cars. So, it was really backed up. So, I was concerned that it was going to be really backed up.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILD: Again, right now, things are looking very good at O'Hare. Between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. about 25 delays, just one cancellation across the country. Today, there have been 946 delays, 587 cancellations, this is into and out of the United States. As far as cancellations go into and out of the United States, 19, that 587 is for a wider swath. But here in the United States, the cancellations just 19. So, things are looking very good.
 
And then as we look forward, Omar, this is expected to be a very busy travel season. 55 million travelers expected over this week. So, big week. Get here early and be prepared to wait if you want a smooth ride. Back to you.
 
JIMENEZ: I'm still stuck on that guy traveling with seven adult children and 13 grandchildren. I mean, that's like almost the whole flight. So, I -- 
 
BOLDUAN: It's a private charter.
 
JIMENEZ: I know.
 
WILD: Oh, yes. Many roads.
 
JIMENEZ: And you do it before Thanksgiving. Yes, exactly. Exactly. Whitney Wild, thank you so much.
 
BOLDUAN: And the fact that he's still smiling. I mean -- 
 
JIMENEZ: I know. That's a real warrior right there.
 
BOLDUAN: He's a man to love. OK. All right. Coming up for us, a federal appeals court strikes down a key tool used for decades to enforce the Voting Rights Act. So, what happens now, in this new fight? We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
BOLDUAN: It's really seen as a huge blow to the core of the Voting Rights Act. A federal appeals court issuing a ruling that effectively prevents any private citizen or civil rights group from bringing a legal challenge under Section 2 of the law, the crucial part of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits voting or election discrimination based on race.
 
Now, this ruling almost certainly will set up for another major showdown over voting rights and the Voting Rights Act, specifically before the Supreme Court. But before then, CNN Political Commentator and Former Democratic Member of the South Carolina House of Representatives Bakari Sellers is here to discuss.
 
Bakari, I want to read something for you. It was a stat that was cited in court over this that has stuck with me, over the past 40 years, there have been at least 182 successful Section 2 cases. Of those 182 cases, only 15 were brought solely by the attorney general. This is part of the dissent. I mean, so what do you think the practical impact then of this ruling is?
 
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND ATTORNEY: Well, the practical impact currently is that those states that are in that circuit, in the Eighth Circuit, now they have to rely on the attorney general to bring these claims. And as you just stated, the attorney general very rarely brings those claims. I mean, I want our viewers to just think about if there is a President Trump or President Haley or whomever it may be, you cannot rely on their attorney general to bring those claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
 
And this is very important. It's not just for access to the ballot box. But right now, you're starting to see all of these redistricting actions come up around the country. And when you're unable to bring these claims, whether or not it's the NAACP legal defense fund or whether or not it's a cohort of legislators, or whether or not it's the NAACP or whatever it may be, if they're unable to bring these claims, then the Voting Rights Act effectively has no teeth.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
The only thing we can do -- because a lot of people were caught off guard by this and backpedaling, I think the only thing we can do now is hope that maybe Justice Baird and Justice Roberts vote with the liberals and strike this down.
 
BOLDUAN: And it's not just private citizens, Bakari, we're talking about limiting the reach of NAACP, the ACLU. I mean, what do you see as the impact of these groups, you know, over time that they have been able to have when it comes to voting rights and what it will mean if, essentially, then their hands are tied?
 
SELLERS: So, first, I want to -- that's a great question. I want to go back even further because people forget the price that was paid for the Voting Rights Act. There's a lot of blood on that ballot box. There are a lot of people who were arrested. There were a lot of people who were beaten. If you think back to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, you think back to sit ins, you think back to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, et cetera. So, there's a lot of blood on the ballot box in this country. And there was a high price that was paid for the Voting Rights Act.
 
One of the things that happened in the Voting Rights Act, particularly with these southern states that have a history of discrimination, is you had these organizations, the ACLU, you had the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, that were able to come in and fight for that right and access to the ballot box when they felt as if that right was being infringed upon by laws that were passed by these state legislatures in the south.
 
And so, now, it's a gut punch. Because now you just simply have to rely on the attorney general of the United States. And we're going to see how that plays out. I have faith in Merrick Garland. Don't get me wrong. I have more faith in Kristen Clarke who is over his department, his civil rights department. 
 
But this is not simply about this period of time, this is about what happens in the future. This is about what happens if there's a President Trump and what that means for his Department of Justice and what that means for voting rights around the country. This was a really, really tough day for a lot of black folks in the country.
 
BOLDUAN: Yes. We'll see where this goes. We have to follow, obviously this -- the legal fight on this is not over, but it's a really big day on this. I want to ask you one thing about President Biden while I've got you. Yesterday was his birthday and he's making a practice now of cracking his own age jokes, it seems. Let me play for you what he said at the Turkey Pardoning.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: And by the way, I -- it's my birthday today and they can actually sing happy birthday to me. I just want you to know it's difficult turning 60. Difficult.
 
This is the 76th anniversary of this event. And I want you to know I wasn't there in the first one. I was too young to make it up.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BOLDUAN: And Bakari, then on Instagram, he wrote, turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles. I mean, self- deprecating humor is tried and true. You're actually very good at self-deprecating humor as well in terms of a political strategy. But what -- is that the way to go about this though?
 
SELLERS: I guess so. I mean, you have to embrace it. I mean, the fact is he's 81, 82 years old, he's not getting any younger and he has to embrace it by using that self-deprecating humor. I mean, we're going to have two individuals who are nearly octogenarians, and one is running for president of the United States. That's just where we are in this country. And he has to show that vitality. And I think humor is a way to show that you -- you're quick, you're witty, and you have some level of vitality.
 
I mean, everybody doesn't have the handsomeness of Bakari Sellers in your (INAUDIBLE).
 
BOLDUAN: Is this happening? I knew this was going to happen. You all should have been here for the -- what happened in the commercial break. Apparently, I am so lucky to be standing next to and on TV with two men that are apparently interchangeable according to Twitter.
 
JIMENEZ: We're both Bakari Sellers and we're both Omar Jimenez.
 
SELLERS: There you go. That's -- 
 
BOLDUAN: But here's the key. Here's the million-dollar question. Which one do you want to be? Do you want to be Bakari Sellers or do you want to be Omar Jimenez? I'm just happy to have both of you as he tries to delicately walk out of this landfill. All right. It's great to see you, buddy. Thank you.
 
JIMENEZ: Oh, look -- 
 
BOLDUAN: Bakari.
 
JIMENEZ: -- we'd love to be Bakari. Yes. I mean, I'm choosing Bakari. I'm choosing Bakari. What can I say? He's taller than me, a lot taller than me.
 
BOLDUAN: He's extremely tall.
 
JIMENEZ: Yes.
 
BOLDUAN: That's the only thing I know about Bakari.
 
JIMENEZ: All right. So, we do have a lot to follow, a lot going on over the course of today. For one, we're continuing to follow major and significant news this hour. We're learning a deal may be imminent, a deal to free some of the hostages being held by Hamas.
 
The Israeli War Cabinet is set to meet literally minutes from now to begin a crucial approval process, and these developments are coming fast, we're staying on top of it all, and we'll bring it to you as we have them.
 
Plus, a woman who has previously accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault has filed a lawsuit against him under a New York law that's set to expire this week. More on that next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
BOLDUAN: A woman who previously accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault is now filing a new lawsuit against him. Now, the suit is from journalist and publicist Joan Tarshis, and it's being filed under a New York Adult Survivors Law that expires this week.
 
Let's bring in CNN's Jean Casarez, she has more details on this and importantly the backstory. Tell us what's happening here.
 
JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this Adult Survivors Law allows that window for people to file suit, and there have been hundreds upon hundreds of suits filed in the last year. Six women have filed suit against Bill Cosby of a civil nature. Now, Joan Tarshis. So, this would be another one. [10:55:00]
 
She alleges that back in '69 or '70 she was in California lived in New York but she was a comedy writer and he asked her to meet with him to write some script for him. She alleges she was given a beverage. Went out and was raped. When she woke up it was in the process of happening. 1970, she says she was back home with her parents, Bill Cosby calls her mother invites her to the Westbury music show where he is going to perform, says the limo will pick her up.
 
She spoke to CNN in 2014 describing what happened to her. This is Joan Tarshis then.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOAN TARSHIS, HAS FILED LAWSUIT AGAINST BILL COSBY: I noticed he had this big shaving kit, this men's shaving kit, opened up with lots of pills bottles and almost filled up with pill bottles, which I thought was really odd. And he made a drink, the red eye, and I drank it and everything was fine. Then we went down to the limo. I passed out in the car. And the last time I came to -- when I came to, it was the next morning. And I was in bed with him naked.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CASAREZ: And this civil suit is based on that story that CNN was told in 2014. Bill Cosby's spokesperson says, not commenting on this case, these look back windows are like a pandemic to successful wealthy men in America. When will our lawmakers stop fueling this assault for likes and clicks?
 
BOLDUAN: It doesn't seem people should be putting Bill Cosby necessarily in the general category of what we've been hearing here. It's great to see you, Jean.
 
CASAREZ: Thank you.
 
BOLDUAN: Thank you so much for bringing us that update.
 
JIMENEZ: Moments from now, Israel's war cabinet will meet to review a deal to potentially release 50 of the roughly 239 hostages who have been held by Hamas for more than a month now. We'll be live with the very latest straight ahead.
