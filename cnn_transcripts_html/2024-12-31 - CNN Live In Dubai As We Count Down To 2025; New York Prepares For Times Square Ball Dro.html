 <br>[13:00:35]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: Well, hello and happy New Year's Eve from Expo City in Dubai. CNN will be ringing in 2025 here in the UAE from inside this incredible space, Al Wasl Dome, the world's largest 360- degree projection service. It is 10:00 p.m. here in Dubai.
 
I'm Becky Anderson and this is CNN's special coverage of New Year's Eve around the world. The DJ has just kicked off under the dome. Behind me, the crowd is gathered here. So much excitement over the next two hours, not just with me and our guests here in Dubai, but also with CNN reporters fanned out from the fabulous Copacabana Beach in Rio to the iconic Acropolis in Athens to the Raha Music Festival in Nairobi. We've got it all for you, all leading up to the big countdown and those incredible fireworks displayed across the United Arab Emirates.
 
Well, here with me on our main set under this dome, Vishen Lakhiani. He's the founder of Mindvalley with all the self-improvement insight you need to tackle your New Year's resolutions. And his partner on the Mindvalley podcast, model, biomedical engineer, TV personality, Megan Pormer. Coming back to them in a moment. 
 
We've also got with us an entrepreneur who you might recognize from the Real Housewives of Dubai, Sara Al-Madani. And to top it all off, we are cooking up a smoky surprise for you this evening. A live cooking station with the Arab world's first pitmaster, Chef Hattem Mattar.
 
And at the hub of tonight's entertainment, DJ Brooklyn, who will be spinning the beats all night. And I will join him there later for a live DJ masterclass.
 
All right, back on the CNN set here under the Al-Wasl Dome, I've got Vishen and Megan with me.
 
You are the CEO, Vishen, of Mindvalley. This is a global personal growth empire. And when I say empire, I mean empire. It is remarkable what you've done with this kind of mind, body and soul self- improvement organization that you've got.
 
So, as we go into 2025, what are your big tips for taking a positive view of the world, Vishen?
 
VISHEN LAKHIANI, CEO, MINDVALLEY: Well, I think the most important thing, most important thing I think people need to do as they go forward is not worry about New Year resolutions, rather commit to just embracing growth, learning something new every week, whether it's one hour or two. And as you learn, you grow.
 
I'm not a fan of resolutions. I'm a fan of like learning, whether it's at your favorite podcast or a Mindvalley course or a great book, setting aside time to learn and learn and learn.
 
ANDERSON: Is that what you do, Megan, on a regular basis (INAUDIBLE)?
 
MEGAN PORMER, HOST, MINDVALLEY PODCAST: Absolutely. Absolutely. I set time aside every single morning to manifest the way I'd like my day to unfold and every night that I'd like for my dreams to unfold. So, it's all intentional.
 
ANDERSON: Do you make New Year's resolutions?
 
PORMER: New Year's resolutions? Yes. My New Year's resolution is to have more heart-to-heart time with me, to date me, to get to know me, to nurture me.
 
ANDERSON: I love this because what you do spend a lot of your time doing is listening to other people. You're the co-host on the Mindvalley podcast.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: What's the most important lesson that you've learned this year as far as tools for mind, body and soul from people that you've been speaking to on that podcast?
 
PORMER: What I've learned is in the end of the day, as human beings, we're on earth school to learn our individualized lessons, our customized lessons. And we're all in pain. A little more, a little less, but we're all experienced this earth school and we're all in this to help one another, shoulder to shoulder.
 <br>[13:05:12]
 
So, I think this year it's time for all of us to go shoulder to shoulder and say, you know what, this is a tough school, we're all schoolmates, let's help each other pass the exam.
 
ANDERSON: I love this, get shoulder to shoulder as we go into 2025. So many of us make New Year's resolutions and I've learned just in the past couple of days that something like more than half of us at least break them.
 
Now we've been making news resolutions since way back when, ancient Babylon and Rome, why do we do it? And you say drop it, you say drop it -- 
 
LAKHIANI: Yes. Yes.
 
ANDERSON: --don't make those resolutions, why do we do it?
 
LAKHIANI: They don't make sense. Well, you know, gyms see a spike in attendance in Jan and then people start dropping out in February and March and April. We should see every week, every day as an opportunity for growth. Don't wait till January 1st or February 1st or your birthday, every day do 20 minutes, something that helps you grow.
 
You know, if you improve by one percent every day, at the end of one year, guess how much you've grown?
 
ANDERSON: Don't test me here, don't test me.
 
LAKHIANI: OK. Everyone underestimates this, right? Because our minds can't process it but it's compounding. You grow 3,700 percent.
 
ANDERSON: No way, wow. That's (INAUDIBLE).
 
LAKHIANI: So, every day do something little, 20 minutes.
 
ANDERSON: I'm going to ask you both, what are you taking with you from 2024 and what are you leaving behind? Vishen.
 
LAKHIANI: There's a lot I want to leave behind. Look, I love learning from my mistakes, I reflect on my mistakes and then I practice self- forgiveness. I made so many mistakes last year.
 
ANDERSON: That's good for us to hear because I'm sure those who know how successful you are and many people around the world will have heard of Mindvalley, they'll be pretty happy to hear that you make your own mistakes.
 
We wouldn't want you to be perfect.
 
LAKHIANI: Tons, tons.
 
ANDERSON: What are you taking with you and what are you leaving behind, Megan?
 
PORMER: You know, I just had a heart-to-heart conversation with myself right before coming here and I asked myself what do I really want to leave behind, what baggage I want to leave behind this year and that's taking things personally.
 
I'm not going to take anything personally in this coming year and what I'm going to keep with me is to stay grounded within myself.
 
ANDERSON: I love these two and they're going to be with me all evening, folks, from here at Expo City in Dubai. For the time being, thank you very much indeed.
 
I can't wait.
 
LAKHIANI: Yes, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you for taking the time to spend it with me on New Year's Eve and our viewers around the world. Wonderful. 
 
They brought their families, folks, as well. It's wonderful to see the families here.
 
Well, it's a New Year's Eve tradition that's more than a century old. The iconic ball drop in New York City's Times Square where hours from now, thousands of people from around the world will be gathering to ring in 2025. And Brynn Gingras, my colleague, is there in Times Square for us.
 
Has that crowd started gathering, Brynn?
 
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Not yet. You know, this is unusual, I got to say, from past years because usually, yes, they are allowed inside these pens which we're going to show you. Look how spacious this is right now. That will not be the case in about an hour and a half or so. They actually pushed back the time people were allowed to come here into Times Square.
 
That might actually be a good thing because it is expected to rain. But you know what? We have met some people on the outskirts who said they don't care. They don't care if it rains, it snows, it's freezing cold. They want to ring in 2025 here in the heart of New York City. It is quite a celebration.
 
I can tell you when that ball drops, which I would show you guys, but the sun is coming right at me, so you won't be able to see it this time. But when that ball drops, ringing in the New Year, there are just going to be loads of confetti falling onto this crowd. Each of those confetti has the well wishes of people, what they want for the New Year, their wishes, their hopes, their dreams. It's such an exciting moment and we are right in the heart of it.
 
Let me quickly give you a recap of what's going on for security measures. The NYPD says this is the safest place to be in all of the country at this moment and they take quite the measures to do that. They have drones, they have barricades, they have bomb sniffing dogs. We have seen it all as they start to prep this area for those roughly one million revelers who are going to be filing in here very shortly to celebrate this New Year.
 
ANDERSON: Brynn, it's great to have you. I've brought myself down onto the DJ deck here underneath the Al Wasl Dome and let me introduce you to DJ Brooklyn. 
 
How are you, mate?
 
DJ BROOKLYN, PROFESSIONAL DJ: What's up, guys? How are you? How are you doing tonight?
 
ANDERSON: I'm doing well. What an atmosphere there is here. This is fantastic.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: It is. It is amazing. It is amazing.
 
How have you guys been?
 
ANDERSON: We've been fantastic. We've been fantastic.
 <br>[13:10:04]
 
Listen, what's your tune that will be ultimately the soundtrack for you for 2024? What was it over the past year that you're like, that means 2024 to me?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Easily Kendrick Lamar, Not Like Us. That song took the whole industry by storm and it came to a point where we're playing it in clubs like six, seven times and people are still asking for it. So yes, that's the song of the year for me.
 
ANDERSON: Is there a song that you love playing? I don't know whether the crowd loves it, but is there one song that you love playing in a club? It really gets the -- it gets the juices flowing as it were.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: It's very difficult to ask a DJ that question, you know what I mean? Because at the end of the day, like we -- we -- I love -- I like all types of music, but sometimes you -- you have to get out of your way and play songs that you don't like because the crowd likes it. But I think just to play safe, anything Michael Jackson remixed original just gets the crowd.
 
ANDERSON: That's always going to get you going, a bit of Michael Jackson.
 
Mate, how long have you been in this game?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Eighteen years now.
 
ANDERSON: Wow.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Eighteen years.
 
ANDERSON: And how's the crowd changed? How's the music changed over that time?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Oh, drastically. I mean, generation after generation, it just changes and you as a DJ need to adapt and listen to the new genres and stuff like that. Again, you might not like them, but you have to because (INAUDIBLE).
 
ANDERSON: I need a little bit of a masterclass here. Show me what -- what you are doing that, what -- what I might do.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: (INAUDIBLE). You know what, because I'm mixing and you -- you don't have headphones, but what I could do is I could teach you how to -- how to scratch.
 
ANDERSON: OK. So do that.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Hold this deck. Scratch it. Oh, there we go. There we go. You got it.
 
ANDERSON: If I go backwards (INAUDIBLE)?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: No, backwards. The song is already backwards.
 
ANDERSON: Oh, OK.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Now, hold it from here.
 
ANDERSON: Now, back in the day, that used to be vinyl, right?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Yes. Yes. Correct.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. That was some time back in my day.
 
DJ BROOKLYN: I still use vinyls, by the way. I have a -- I have a big collection of vinyls at home from my dad's, from my uncles. I still have vinyls and I still have turntables.
 
ANDERSON: What are your big dreams for 2025?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Sorry, I can't hear you.
 
ANDERSON: What's your dream for 2025? What are your goals?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Peace in the world. That's my dream. Peace in the world. To stop everything that's going on right now without getting into details, but just peace and love. I wish the world could just be nice and smooth and everybody's living, children are growing, future's right there. That's it.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, well, that's, I'm sure how many, many people feel around this region and around the rest of the world. It's a wonderful, wonderful idea and it's what we all want as we go into 2024.
 
You've got kids, haven't you?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Yes, I do.
 
ANDERSON: Has it been a good festive season for you?
 
DJ BROOKLYN: Yes and no, because it's a lot of work, but yes, yes, it's been amazing. It's been amazing so far, yes.
 
ANDERSON: All right, DJ Brooklyn, I'm going to come back and see you a little bit later on. Let's pump up the tunes here. Let's get this crowd moving. They're all here for New Year's Eve, which of course is going to be about, what, two hours, just under two hours from now, about an hour and 45 minutes.
 
We'll be ringing in the New Year here at Expo City in Dubai. We'll also go 20 minutes down the road where you'll see the fireworks from downtown Dubai and from Abu Dhabi, from the desert in Al Wathba, where we will see some records broken by the Sheikh Zayed Festival. All that is coming up here on CNN as we ring in 2025. You take it away, mate. Let's watch it.

AMNA ABULHOUL, EXECUTIVE CREATIVE DIRECTOR, EVENTS &amp; EXPERIENCES EXPO CITY DUBAI: Winter City is a phenomenal time of the year. And we have received over 200,000 guests so far. It's a celebration of North Pole under this dome. It's the North Pole under the snow globe.
 
Having Toy Factory, Santa's North Pole. It's really bringing all the adults to become kids once more.
 
ANDERSON: And it's full of families.
 
ABULHOUL: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: And it's full of joy. I know so many people who visited over the festive season. Then, of course, there's this, the Al Wasl Dome.
 
ABULHOUL: Definitely.
 
ANDERSON: Which in typical Dubai fashion -- 
 
ABULHOUL: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: -- has something very special about it.
 
ABULHOUL: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: What is it?
 
ABULHOUL: It definitely broke the World Guinness record as the largest interactive dome in the world. And it's really, it's not just about an architectural or a technology marvel. But it's actually a spirit, a living space that when you enter, you feel you're in your grandmother's house. You're greeted by your families.
 
So, Al Wasl Plaza will always be the home for families and children from all around the world.
 
ANDERSON: Happy New Year.
 
ABULHOUL: Happy New Year, Becky.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Wonderful. With Amna there, a look behind the scenes at the magic of events like Winter City here at Dubai's iconic Al Wasl Dome. That was Amna Abuhoul, who is the Executive Creative Director of Events and Experiences at Expo City in Dubai. She's the power behind experiences like Winter City and this New Year's extravaganza.
 
But look, Expo City Dubai is much more than any one single event and this beautiful setting of the Al Wasl Dome.
 
Let me introduce you to the force behind all of this. Nadia Verjee is driving the vision for what happens here at Expo City Dubai now and in the future.
 
Nadia, thank you for joining us on New Year's Eve.
 
NADIA VERJEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GLOBAL INITIATIVES &amp; ADVISORY EXPO CITY DUBAI: Becky, it's amazing to have you back at Expo.
 
ANDERSON: Did you have other plans?
 
VERJEE: No, of course not. This is the plan.
 
ANDERSON: This is wonderful to be here. Look, I mean, it's so many happy families and grown-ups. I think it's the first time in my life I've been somewhere where I've seen and brought my own kids.
 
VERJEE: It's incredible.
 
ANDERSON: To celebrate, you know, at the same time as we are on New Year's Eve.
 
Tell me about Expo City Dubai because you and I now have known each other for a long time. For the folks out there, who don't know what this is all about, just fill us in.
 
VERJEE: Yes. Well, two years ago when CNN was here, we hosted the biggest mega event in the region and welcomed 24 million visitors through our doors over a period of six months.
 
Fast forward a year, we hosted COP28, the biggest climate change conference, because we are a green print, a sustainable city that has the right to host these big mega events. Today, fast forward two years, Expo City is at the center of gravity of the future of the growth of the city of Dubai.
 
So, 35 minutes up the road from Abu Dhabi, equidistant to Dubai, in the transport corridor between Jebel Ali Port, Al Maktoum International Airport just up the road, and the new Dubai Exhibition Center that's going to be the center for all of the Dubai World Trade Center activity.
 
ANDERSON: So, people know Dubai, they'll know about its ambition, they'll know about its vision. I think this really very much personifies this. But this is a living, breathing city.
 
For those who may have been here for Expo or indeed for COP28, it was an event space ultimately. But this is so much more than that.
 
So, what's the vision for this now and going forward?
 <br>[13:20:00]
 
VERJEE: So, at COP28, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Prime Minister of the UAE, announced this place as a center of gravity for planetary solutions. Effectively, consider us an urban lab. A place that can test, that can scale, and that can bring transformative solutions to the world.
 
So, every part of our city really is at the service of something much bigger. Respect for nature, respect for planet, but also a place that welcomes residents, that welcomes businesses. So, you know, around this incredible family vibe, we actually have a lot of businesses that have already set up shop and have made this place their home for their business.
 
So, DP World, Emirates Airlines, Siemens, Fujifilm and their research and development, the Indian Institute for Foreign Trade, we're effectively building this incredible ecosystem.
 
ANDERSON: So, this is a living, breathing city. It has an air, of course, as well. It's got tens of thousands of people living here now and tens of thousands more coming in on a daily basis.
 
VERJEE: So, there will be, at our maximum capacity, once the full master plan is rolled out, around 75,000 residents and daily residents coming in and out of the city. We're connected on the metro, so we're effectively the center of the future growth of the city of Dubai. This is where it's at.
 
ANDERSON: You and I spent so much time together back in 2021. It seems so long ago now, and yet it feels like yesterday. The six months that was the Dubai Expo, of course, facing so many challenges. We're sort of at the back end, or perhaps not even at the back end of COVID at the time. What you pulled off here was absolutely remarkable.
 
I know it would have taken some time to reflect on that because it was an exhausting six months. But when you do sit back and reflect on this place, what goes through your mind? Because I remember this being nothing but palm trees at one stage.
 
VERJEE: Yes. I think the word that springs to mind is transformative. And I think the transformative vision of the leadership of this country manifested by Her Excellency Reem Al Hashimy, the UAE Minister for International Cooperation and the CEO, and the driving vision behind this city is effectively really the first thing that really springs to mind. Also, the fact that she's writing a book about her experience, I think will be fundamental reading for anybody who wants to know how we did it and how the UAE does it, and that's coming out in the New Year. So, watch out for that.
 
ANDERSON: That's amazing to know. I know so many people who've come to Dubai to find out personally from Reem Al Hashimy, Her Excellency, exactly what it was that went into this and how you were able to pull it off.
 
Mabrook, wonderful.
 
VERJEE: Shukran. Shukran (INAUDIBLE) -- 
 
ANDERSON: Happy New Year to you.
 
VERJEE: Happy New Year to you.
 
ANDERSON: We're about an hour and a half or so away at this point. We will be ringing in the New Year here in Dubai at Expo City, and lucky me gets a welcome at 2025, not just with great company like Nadia, but with great food as well.
 
I'm here with the world's first Arab pitmaster. We're going to talk about what has inspired him and, of course, what he is cooking up next.
 
I'm Becky Anderson. Stay with us. And we'll go to Rio where (INAUDIBLE).

WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hania Aamir Pakistan's sweetheart and a rising star is winning hearts with her acting. Stage performances and her upcoming role in Pakistan's first Netflix original series.
 
What would you say you're most grateful for over the last year?
 
HANIA AAMIR, PAKISTANI CELEBRITY: Just all the love that I've received to be honest.
 
RIPLEY: You have a new Netflix show coming out. What can you tell us about that?
 
AAMIR: Just that I'm really excited about it not much. I can say about it it's an absolute honor to be working with people who've been working for over a decade who are so much more experienced and just -- just lovely to work with.
 
RIPLEY: Is it a lot of pressure being called the face of Gen Z in Pakistan? AAMIR: I -- I don't know. I don't think -- I don't think a lot of pressure. I just -- I just try and be myself and whatever comes my way I just try and do it -- do it with as much honesty as I can.
 
RIPLEY: You have a lot of fans and also close friends in India as well. How important is that cross-border relationship?
 
AAMIR: We're like distant cousins. So, we're just so similar in so many ways. So, it's absolutely lovely to see that we can collaborate and are just so appreciating of each other.
 
RIPLEY: Do you have a special New Year's message for your fans in Pakistan and also your fans in India and around the world?
 
AAMIR: Just that I wish them a lot of love and health and success and I just hope that they lead the New Year's with a lot of authenticity and they're just kind to themselves.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANDERSON: Let's be kind to each other as we get ready to bid farewell to 2024. I'm welcoming the New Year of 2025 90 minutes from now. That'll happen here at Expo City in Dubai.
 
Before the break I promised you that we were cooking up something rather special. So, I've left the set and I've come over to introduce you to the world's first Arab pitmaster Hattem Mattar.
 
How are you mate?
 
HATTEM MATTAR, ARAB PITMASTER: Happy New Year. Good to see you.
 
ANDERSON: Good to see you. Happy New Year as well.
 
What you got going on, man.
 
MATTAR: We've got third culture barbecue at its finest. Egyptian born in Emirati race, Texas trained, tomahawk, camel stock, smoked ribs, sticky date barbecue sauce, Mendy rice all over live fire. I don't think you could get that dish anywhere.
 
ANDERSON: I love it. There will be people from Texas.
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Georgia. They'll be watching tonight.
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: We're streamed on Max and they'll be saying what's a nice boy like you from this parlor? We're trying to do what we do best.
 
MATTAR: That's the point. That's the point.
 
ANDERSON: How have you learned to combine sort of Arabic culture with barbecue? Shoot this all started in Texas? MATTAR: Yes, correct.
 
ANDERSON: Back in 2013, right?
 
MATTAR: Yes, correct. So essentially barbecue is the only culinary that the world has in common, 195 nationalities everybody has barbecue even the vegetarian cultures of Southeast Asia. They grill their vegetables that's still considered barbecue. So, if you think about it, it is the only cuisine that we all have in common. So, whether I'm barbecuing or you're barbecuing the -- the spices could be different, but the cuisine essentially is the same.
 
ANDERSON: Listen, I've always wanted to know how long does it take to sort out a decent brisket like seriously?
 
MATTAR: Oh, man, OK. Not a hard and fast rule. I -- my Texan guys are going to give me grief for this but not a hard and fast rule but anywhere from 18 to 22 -- 16 to 22 hours depending on the size of the brisket.
 
ANDERSON: Wow.
 
MATTAR: Grass-fed grain fed. That's my final answer.
 
ANDERSON: And what's your secret rub?
 
MATTAR: My secret rub is spices from my mother's Kabab Halla, I'm Egyptian and the brisket rub that I got from Bastrop, Texas put all of those together and you've never had brisket like that in your life.
 
ANDERSON: That is amazing.
 <br>[13:30:01]
 
All right, let's go over here.
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: And find out what's going on in here. You set up a business in Dubai -- 
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: -- sometime ago. You were an engineer.
 
MATTAR: Correct.
 
ANDERSON: You started barbecuing in the in the back garden.
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Right (INAUDIBLE).
 
MATTAR: So, the reason I learned to barbecue was because I was in oil and gas. Houston once a quarter, traveled with brisket in my suitcase said a respectable member of society. I can't keep doing this. So, I taught myself how to make it and here we are left oil and gas.
 
ANDERSON: So, what's going in there?
 
MATTAR: So, there's smoked ribs in here wrapped in butcher paper like I learned in Texas.
 
ANDERSON: All branded up Mattar.
 
MATTAR: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
 
ANDERSON: The business of course.
 
MATTAR: Yes, yes, yes.
 
ANDERSON: What are you taking with you from 2024 and what are you -- what are you hoping to achieve in 2025? So, I know there's some -- there's some exciting stuff (INAUDIBLE).
 
MATTAR: Yes, yes. We've got a lot of Arab storytelling. You know this part of the world, we don't get to tell our own stories all the time. So, I'm super honored and super glad to be an Arab storyteller. And because barbecue is such a universal cuisine, if you put that on any table and say, hey I've got a story to tell you, everybody's going to sit down at that table.
 
ANDERSON: That is such a wonderful idea. What are the common misperceptions that you find? Oh, yes -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
MATTAR: Yes, we're losing all that temperature. We're losing that temperature, yes.
 
ANDERSON: Oh, I thought you were just worried about me getting hot.
 
MATTAR: Also, that, also. You're hot already.
 
ANDERSON: What the -- what the classic misconceptions that you find people have (INAUDIBLE)?
 
MATTAR: You know, I -- the culinary ambassador to the UAE Embassy in Washington D.C. under His Excellency Yousef Al Otaiba, we got to travel to 62 cities in a hundred days. And when you travel the south which you would assume is not the type of place that would be welcoming to our part of the world, this -- the American South has more in common with the Arab part of the world, a high sense of reverence for their elders, neighborly affection, strong roots, a very strong theological core.
 
We got to be strangers in the very beginning making something that they taught me how to make and by the end of it, we exchanged rosaries and we're still best friends to this day. The people that I apprenticed under are still my friends and I get to visit them every time I fly to Texas.
 
ANDERSON: That's amazing. What do they think of you as a pitmaster? MATTAR: Super proud.
 
ANDERSON: Are they. Do they think you're super good or they just super proud of what I got?
 
MATTAR: I've got -- so we got to -- that's a good question. I got to -- I got to fly to Austin to cook for them years after they taught me and -- and I cooked in the first restaurant I apprenticed in.
 
ANDERSON: That's amazing.
 
MATTAR: Yes, big deal for me.
 
ANDERSON: Listen, we're here all night.
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: I can't wait to welcome in the New Year with you.
 
MATTAR: Thank you very much. I'm honored to be here.
 
ANDERSON: Here on CNN. The folks around the world. Give it up to have to Hattem Mattar in the house. We will see you -- 
 
MATTAR: See you soon.
 
ANDERSON: -- a little later on. Keep cooking.
 
I know he's going to do. I know you're all watching so you won't actually get to experience this in real time as it were really with me. But you'll get a virtual experience because what he's doing tonight is cooking up a storm for us and about 90 minutes from now, we, me, my guests and those who are lucky enough here at the Expo City Dubai will get to experience this brisket and these tomahawks for real.
 
We are going to take a very short break at this point. I'm Becky Anderson you with us here in Dubai.
 
Before we do that -- I'm going to -- yes, before we take a break. I'm going to get you to Julia Jones who is Copacabana Beach in Rio, of course, she is.
 
Julia, take it away.
 
JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Hello Becky. So great to come to you from Rio de Janeiro today on this last day of 2024 as you can see around me people are still enjoying a beach day a day out a sunny day on Copacabana Beach, the iconic Copacabana Beach.
 
Look this is going to be a massive celebration tonight. Ten different stages with artists that are the most popular artists in this country. We have Caetano Veloso, Anitta is going to be playing tonight. And also, a giant display of fireworks, we're going to see boats, ten different boats, 15 tons of explosive fireworks for this spectacle tonight, a drone ballet. We're told that for now Brazilians are still just enjoying their last day on the beach. It's Copacabana after all. And I mean I am on rollerblades. Not everyone is joining me here today.
 
But there are folks that have been here for just a little bit of time and they're already enjoying their time in Rio. Take a listen.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The weathers beautiful. It's a really busy New Year's Eve. When I was planning our trip (INAUDIBLE). Rio is -- Rio is one of them. So, I planned it so it could be here and luckily the weather is beautiful so, I hope to see that.

 <br>[13:35:11]
 
JONES: So, we heard from Americans and Brits and people from all over the place that have come here to just experience the magic that is Rio de Janeiro.
 
And I've been thinking a lot about this. Like, what is it that makes us want to get into the middle of a crowd like this to celebrate New Year's? You know, I mean, we obviously surround ourselves with family and friends, but to experience something like this, I think it's something transcendental, Becky. It's something that, as humans, we crave.
 
It's this kind of connection, a shared experience, going through the New Year together. And tonight, is going to be a spectacle that we don't want to miss.
 
Becky.
 
ANDERSON: I know. We've been talking about this, going into 2025 shoulder to shoulder. We can't wait to get back to you. Enjoy it. It looks absolutely amazing. Thank you.
 
You are back with us here under the Al Wasl Dome at the Winter City here at Expo City. And this is the families enjoying themselves. You've got the elves there. You've got the jewelry stands here. And I will be joined by one of our special friends.
 
We'll get a hot chocolate and we'll just chat. Chat about what we're going to leave behind in 2024 and what will it take with us into 2025.
 
See you shortly after this short break.

ANDERSON: And welcome back to Expo City, where we will be welcoming in the New Year in just more than an hour from now.
 
And I'm here with Sara Al-Madani. And those of you around the world who recognize her, of course, will recognize her from Real Housewives of Dubai.
 
My goodness, what success you've had. Have you enjoyed it? Two episodes now -- two seasons.
 
SARA AL-MADANI, TV PERSONALITY: Two seasons, yes. I mean, it's fun, but you have to be crazy to do something like that. Definitely.
 
ANDERSON: Totally. What's your key take out? What's your best moment, as it were?
 
AL-MADANI: Look, I'm known on the group to be like the guru, the healer, the Mother Teresa. And this is who I am. But, you know, it pushes you to the edge, but you've got to keep your sanity. You've got to keep your sanity.
 
ANDERSON: How do you keep your sanity?
 
AL-MADANI: Because I have a healing retreat, so I do my own healing thing. So, I know how to go back inside and heal all of these things. So, after filming, I take off for like three months. Nobody sees me. Because some of the cast members are crazy.
 <br>[13:40:10]
 
ANDERSON: I love it. And if you haven't seen it, you should see because some of those cast members are crazy.
 
AL-MADANI: Are crazy.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: He's going to sell a hot chocolate from these guys. Nice to see you George (ph). And what's your name?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello. My name is George. Welcome to (INAUDIBLE).
 
ANDERSON: Brilliant. Thank you very much. Let's put let's walk Sara's way.
 
AL-MADANI: Becky, I am lactose intolerant, but I'm doing this for you. Just for you.
 
ANDERSON: Please, don't (INAUDIBLE). No, no, no -- 
 
AL-MADANI: Just today. Just today.
 
ANDERSON: I don't need you to hate me going into 2025. Listen, you were (INAUDIBLE) Dubai.
 
AL-MADANI: Yes, I'm a Emirati. And I just love the UAE. I'm so proud to be from this country.
 
ANDERSON: Why?
 
AL-MADANI: Because -- 
 
ANDERSON: What is it about the UAE that makes your proud?
 
AL-MADANI: Not only that the country is beautiful, our leadership, our leaders in this country, their energy rubs on you. You have no choice but to be a warrior, but to be a fighter, but to be an entrepreneur, but to be inspired because of them. We have an amazing leadership.
 
ANDERSON: There is much positivity in here.
 
AL-MADANI: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: And it's, you know, you feel it even here, you feel it here tonight -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: -- with all of the kids learn.
 
AL-MADANI: I know.
 
ANDERSON: And the family is here, it's absolutely fantastic. The elves most of you might think of from the Philippines. There are 200 nationalities here -- 
 
AL-MADANI: More.
 
ANDERSON: -- in UAE.
 
AL-MADANI: More. Different religions, different nationalities.
 
ANDERSON: Yes. AL-MADANI: We all coexist, we all love each other.
 
ANDERSON: What are you taking with you from 2024 and what are you are leaving behind?
 
AL-MADANI: Maybe I'm not taking anything Becky. We're leaving everything behind. New Year, new you. That's what it is.
 
ANDERSON: But solutions -- 
 
AL-MADANI: (INAUDIBLE) taking in the lessons I learned from my healing and my growth journey and all I'm going to say is never again.
 
ANDERSON: That's what you're going to say?
 
AL-MADANI: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Never again. 
 
AL-MADANI: Never again.
 
ANDERSON: Yes, but what happened.
 
AL-MADANI: Never again to self-neglect, never again to no boundaries.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Nice to see you. Hi, nice to see you. It's New Year's Eve for (INAUDIBLE) Sara -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: New Year's resolutions right, half of this break them. I don't know why we bother. Do you bother?
 
AL-MADANI: No. Resolutions? No, I feel like I limit myself if I put like ten resolutions. Wherever life takes me I flow. I'm like water. So, I'm going with the flow. That's it (INAUDIBLE).
 
ANDERSON: So, what -- what's the -- what's the -- what's the goal for 2025 and you've said how you feel? What are you doing career-wise? What's next for Sara?
 
AL-MADANI: So, I have my own healing retreat called the Amara. We're expanding. After you do the inner work and you help people, I love it.
 
ANDERSON: I'm sorry not too much.
 
AL-MADANI: Not too much. Not too much. After doing the inner work, after doing all these things, you want healing for people, you want the same joy and happiness for people. And that's my main core business. And then I do tech. We're growing a lot in tech.
 
But I'm so excited about my public speaking tour because I go on a world tour every year to inspire people.
 
ANDERSON: Yes.
 
AL-MADANI: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: And you do inspire so many people.
 
AL-MADANI: Thank you. Thank you so much.
 
ANDERSON: It has to be said particularly women and young girls, which is amazing.
 
AL-MADANI: I hope.
 
ANDERSON: So, what is your message to them tonight?
 
AL-MADANI: My message to you is that life starts when you find out who you really are. Now who you were told to be how you were told to be. We're all born with a blueprint. But I want you and I urge you to be curious to find out who you really are. And go deep and find go on a soul journey. I did that and it changed my life.
 
ANDERSON: There will be many people who say, Sara doesn't look like an Emirati female to me.
 
AL-MADANI: Like a what?
 
ANDERSON: Doesn't look like an Emirati female -- 
 
AL-MADANI: No.
 
ANDERSON: -- to me. Is this part of your journey Sara?
 
AL-MADANI: I mean look, I -- part of being an Emirati is we have a minister for tolerance. Tolerance is something big in the UAE and our leaders practice it. And I might not look like a typically Emirati. I have over 90 tattoos. I don't dress like them, I don't act like that. But I'm welcomed and I'm loved for my differences, and I love the UAE for that.
 
ANDERSON: And there's still so many misperceptions about this part of the world.
 
AL-MADANI: Of course.
 
ANDERSON: So, meet Sara who is a proud Emirati.
 
AL-MADANI: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: The Emirates is proud of Sara. We can't wait to see in what will be season three, I guess.
 
AL-MADANI: We have so.
 
ANDERSON: So, Housewives.
 
AL-MADANI: If there's a season three. Yes. For sure, for sure.
 
ANDERSON: Do we know if there's a season three?
 
AL-MADANI: We don't know. They always keep us on our tiptoes.
 
ANDERSON: All right, Sara.
 
AL-MADANI: Prepare your popcorn and your stray jackets. It's going to be wild.
 
ANDERSON: Sara Al-Madani with us tonight, and she'll be with us as we welcome in 2025 from this Expo City in Dubai.
 
This would have been nothing. When you were growing up here, there was nothing here. Nothing here. Amazing.
 
AL-MADANI: Yes. Yes.
 
ANDERSON: You're going to join us after this very short break folks.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: And a very warm welcome back to CNN's New Year's Eve live coverage. I'm Becky Anderson, live from Expo City, Dubai. Well, we have just over an hour left of 2024.
 
Joining me once again are Vishen Lakhiani, CEO of the self-improvement platform, Mindvalley and the Mindvalley podcast host, Megan Pormer.
 
Good to have you back again, guys. Best piece of advice that you have ever given. Vishen?
 
LAKHIANI: That's interesting. I got to think, but I got to say, I think it's this. The universe doesn't give you what you want. Rather, the universe will reflect back to you who you are. And what this means is that, you know, we talk about things like manifesting all the time. Manifest was the Cambridge Dictionary Word of the Year in 2024. But you don't manifest from what you want. You manifest by taking tiny steps to emulate, become, and feel that which you want.
 
You want to be an entrepreneur, take a tiny step, register a domain, register a company, read a book on business. It's step by step by step. The universe reflects back to you, your identity, who you believe you are.
 
ANDERSON: That is fabulous. Demure also, one of the words of 2024. PORMER: Yes, absolutely. And you know, for me, the best piece of advice I've ever received was the fact that the universe it's not the world and the life is not happening to me. It's happening for me. And in every experience that I'm going through, there's a lesson. And as soon as I pass that lesson, I don't have to experience that pain or that suffering ever again.
 
ANDERSON: I love this. Mindvalley has a whole tool available to its millions of users on the platforms that you have. If you had one piece of advice, or one tool that people should take from what you do, the philosophy that you have into 2025, what would that be?
 
LAKHIANI: So, I love this practice. I learned it from a spiritual teacher by the name of Christie Marie Sheldon, and it's called Lofty Questions. And you look at yourself in the mirror and you ask yourself questions that emulate who you want to be.
 
For example, questions such as, why do I just love eating food that's good for my body. Why am I so good at making multiplying and earning money? Why am I such a great writer? Why am I such a good mom and dad?
 
Now you don't have to be at that level, but a weird thing happens. When you ask these questions, your subconscious mind is going, how do I get there? Your subconscious mind is like a goal focused machine. And slowly by slowly there's a form of self-hypnosis that happens.
 
ANDERSON: One of the things that I learned this year was not to say I have to do things, but to say I get to do things. This is particularly useful when you have naughty toddlers as I do because sometimes, you're like I just get to be with these kids whereas that's not actually what's going through my brain, but it really helps. It really helps a set the right kind of mindset for me.
 <br>[13:50:25]
 
We talked about this earlier on you do a lot of listening. You also do a lot of traveling. You are between L.A. and Dubai. You grew up on three continents. And you're a TV personality, fantastically successful model. You are ladies and gentlemen also a medical engineer. When did all of that come together? When did you -- when -- at what point in your life did you say I think I'm where I need to be at this point? I was certainly going in the right direction.
 
PORMER: Right in this moment. In 2024, it was the first time that I met Megan Pormer. Up until 2024, I have met different versions of who I thought I was. It was only in 2024 that I met me.
 
ANDERSON: That is amazing. Did you meet Megan Pormer in L.A. or in Dubai? Because you spend time between the two just explain why.
 
PORMER: I met Megan Pormer in here. So, whether she's in L.A. or she's in Dubai, she's right here, right now.
 
ANDERSON: What draws you back to Dubai every two months?
 
PORMER: People, the warmth, the culture, the mindset, the fact that the government in Dubai promotes the mindset -- mindset of abundance that the government here really loves people. And they care about the mental wellbeing and the emotional well-being of people.
 
ANDERSON: And that's been really important to you, hasn't it? Because you've set up business here. You and I think met two -- two and a half years ago.
 
LAKHIANI: Right.
 
ANDERSON: Right. And you were talking about at the time establishing a business here. What is it for you about Dubai that makes sense?
 
LAKHIAN: In so many countries around the world, I find that there's generally a pessimism and cynicism about life. In Dubai, people operate at a whole different level. You have an idea, people want to support your idea. Business is so easy to do here. People here are genuinely positive, optimistic.
 
I don't get it. It's like, I don't know what they put in the water, but whatever it is, it's working. Everyone here is excited about life.
 
ANDERSON: I share your enthusiasm. Front foot forward, very forward looking. Positive. And you can press that way.
 
You know, if everybody else is feeling that way all the time, but I mean, that's the overarching sense and you're able to sort of press that wave and see some success. So, you see a vision for success in front of you.
 
It's fantastic having you guys here.
 
We are getting closer -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ANDERSON: Of course, New Year's Eve. Getting closer to midnight when we will of course welcome in the New Year, stay with me for that.
 
Music, of course, can bring people together as it will do tonight from a variety of cultures in a way that few other things can. The mastermind behind the music in the movie Slumdog Millionaire Oscar winner. A. R. Rahman knows this all too well. I had the chance to hook up with him earlier this year and listen to him play a special song for us. This is for you. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: What are your hopes and fears for 2025?
 
A. R. RAHMAN, INDIAN MUSICAL COMPOSER: I feel very light because I feel like this world is transitional. Nobody is permanent here. Evil people die, good people die, and that makes you feel very light, that it's transitional, it's just like a airport launch.
 
ANDERSON: Has it been a good year?
 
RAHMAN: No.
 
ANDERSON: No.
 
RAHMAN: I mean, for me, it's been a great year, but when I see the world, and I see suffering, and see stuff happening, not taking any, any sides, I believe that human is a whole being by itself, and if there's something wrong with the -- there's a cancer in the left arm. The whole body suffers.
 
But I'm hopeful. They're always good people.
 
ANDERSON: Players out. Let's play us out of 2024, if you will.
 
(MUSIC)
 <br>[13:55:33]
 
ANDERSON: Happy New Year.
 
RAHMAN: Happy New Year. Thank you so much.
 
ANDERSON: Thank you very much indeed.
