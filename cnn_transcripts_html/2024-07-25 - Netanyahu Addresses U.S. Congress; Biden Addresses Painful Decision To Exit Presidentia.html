ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead. U.S. President Joe Biden gives his first public address after dropping out the 2024 race, saying it was time to pass the torch to someone new. 
 
On Capitol Hill Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a fiery defense of Israel and labels some protesters, Iran's useful idiots.
 
And tracking Typhoon Gaemi. We will have a live report as the storm makes its way into Mainland China.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from Atlanta, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Appreciate you joining us. The U.S. president has delivered the most important speech he never wanted to make. Addressing his painful and reluctant decision to bow out of the race for the White House. A choice he may still be struggling with. During a primetime Oval Office address, Joe Biden said it's time for a new generation to take the reins. He also made it clear who's putting democracy and patriotism ahead of personal ambition.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I revere this office. I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is a stake, I think it's more important than any title. America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward. Between hope and hate, between unity division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.
 
In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that? This character in public life still matter. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: President Biden also offered unwavering support for his chosen successor Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her tough, experienced and capable. His speech came just weeks after that disastrous debate performance. And right after a bout with COVID. A White House advisors said the remarks were scheduled for Wednesday to give the President's voice more time to regain its strength. 
 
Emotions were running high at the White House during Biden's televised address. One official saying many watched in tears. The administration's deputy communications director later posted this photo of President Biden speaking in the Rose Garden with his family standing behind him. More now from CNN's Karin Caifa.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BIDEN: It's not about me, it's about you, your families, your futures.
 
KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Joe Biden addressing his decision to step away from the 2024 presidential race.
 
BIDEN: I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): And priorities for the final months of his term.
 
BIDEN: I keep defending our personal freedoms on our civil rights. From the right to vote to the right to choose.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): Biden's Oval Office speech time to give the President's voice and opportunity to recover from COVID-19 and deliver the address with vigor a senior adviser said regarding Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the President has no regrets.
 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is again a decision that this President made and I think he is proud to have made that decision.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): Here is that a quick start to her presidential bid.
 
KAMALA HARRIS, UNITED STATES VICE PRESIDENT: There's so much at stake in this moment. There's so much at stake.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): And former President Donald Trump in North Carolina for his first rally since Biden's announcement wasted no time pivoting his attacks.
 
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The vote for Kamala is a vote for four more years of dishonesty, incompetence.
 
CAIFA (voice-over): But back at the White House, President Biden used one of the most important speeches of his long political career to stress the importance of November's election even as he leaves the ballot.
 
BIDEN: History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.
 <br>[02:05:02]
 
CAIFA (voice-over): In Washington. I'm Karin Caifa.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: I want to bring in presidential historian Alexis Coe from Amsterdam. She is the author of You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington. And she's also a fellow at New America. Thank you so much for being with us.
 
ALEXIS COE, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Thank you for having me.
 
CHURCH: So, in an historic address to the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday, President Joe Biden said democracy was at stake, and passing the torch was the best way to unite the nation. Adding "I revere this office, but I love my country more." What did you think of his address? And did he adequately explain why he stepped away?
 
COE: It was wonderful to see President Biden and to see that he had recovered from COVID. I think it was really important for the nation to have that commune with him on television and to see him talk about his legacy and reestablish what would have eclipsed. It was important to hear him say that he wanted to pass the torch. So, he was forward thinking. He made it less about him and more about America.
 
CHURCH: Yes. I want to talk about that because in his address President Biden offered a striking contrast to Donald Trump, doesn't he? With this selfless act of leadership, putting the country first and focusing on what he hopes to accomplish in his last six months in office. And he finished by saying to the American people, history is in your hands and power is in your hands. So how will voters likely respond to this, do you think?
 
COE: Well, it was a wonderful way of him also to take away the responsibility that people were worried. He -- his legacy would bear for losing the election and by extension the American experiment. I think that it was also though at the same time, a less cynical interpretation of that is he was reemphasizing that the President serves the people, and that it's really important that is at the forefront of everyone's mind as they continue to move towards November with an open mind towards both candidates.
 
CHURCH: And President Biden attempted to define his legacy of more than 50 years of public service. Where is Joe Biden's place in history? And how would you write his story?
 
COE: Now, I think it's much better. I think that I wrote in Rolling Stone, that Daniel Kahneman, the late scientists told us that the way things end matter. And so, I fear that the -- this time from the debate until November would have eclipsed his entire record, not just the presidency, but his many decades of service. And so, now I think he'll be remembered for things. He'll be remembered for stepping aside, and also a return to democratic norms.
 
So, after, of course, we had, for the first time in our almost 250 years of break in the peaceful transition of power. We saw quiet and not only accept power with responsibility and humility, but he's also leaving it that way. He'll surpass FDR, as far as legislation, he'll be known as one of the most progressive presidents in all of American history. And certainly, anyone even coming in, in the 21st century will have a really hard time.
 
His lifelong service, of course, and that we can once again return to these norms and these sorts of accepted values that we know Joe Biden for. For example, empathy, before, it seems selfish, like he wanted to finish two terms. He wants it to be president. And now we understand that he sees our anguish. He understands that America is for the future and that we need a reinvigorated office.
 
CHURCH: Alexis Coe, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
COE: Thank you.
 
CHURCH: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both hitting the campaign trail. How is addressing voters in Indiana and Trump holding a rally in North Carolina. The former U.S. President is wasting no time launching attacks on his new opponent. He's accusing the vice president of being a dangerous radical and blaming her for "catastrophes in the Biden administration."
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
TRUMP: For 3-1/2 years Lying Kamala Harris has been the ultraliberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country. If she ever gets the chance to get into office, we're not going to let that happen.
 
You know, I was supposed to be nice. They say something happened to me when I got shot. I became nice. And when you're dealing with these people, they're very dangerous people. When you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice. You really can't.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Oh, meanwhile, Harris is striking back against Trump and his vision for the country telling voters that her values include freedom, opportunity and justice for all.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[02:10:07]
 
HARRIS: In this moment, our nation needs your leadership once again. In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation. One focused on the future. The other focused on the past. You may have seen their agenda, part of it is called Project 2025. A plan to return America to a dark past. These extremists want to take us back. But we are not going back. We are not going back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Vice President Harris is scheduled to return to Washington for a meeting with Israel's Prime Minister later today. Before that, Benjamin Netanyahu will hold key talks with President Biden on a range of issues. Then the two assets a mesh with families of hostages being held in Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu will meet with Donald Trump in Florida on Friday. The talks come after the Israeli Prime Minister lashed out at critics of his handling of the war in Gaza in a nearly hour-long addressed to U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: Clarity begins by knowing the difference between good and evil. Yet incredibly, many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers. For all we know Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests that are going on right now outside this building. Not that many, but they're there and throughout the city.
 
Well, I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising, promoting and funding you. You have officially become Iran useful idiots.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Following his speech protests erupted near Union Station, the main rail station and the U.S. Capitol. Some burn flags and effigies of Netanyahu and a pro-Hamas slogan was spray painted on a monument. The White House called the scenes disgraceful. Nine people were arrested.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on the Prime Minister's speech from Tel Aviv.
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Israeli Prime Minister certainly struck a bipartisan tone as he sought to shore up support for Israel during his remarks to Congress. The Israeli Prime Minister thanking both President Biden as well as former President Trump for their support for Israel. He also sought to kind of bring the U.S. into Israel's war against Hamas, saying our enemies are your enemies.
 
Our fight is your fight. Especially as he sought to broaden Israel's war against Hamas as a battle against Iran at the end of the day. And the Israeli prime minister as he was trying to do all of this. He was also defending Israeli military conduct in Gaza. And he was doing so not always by sticking to the facts. The Israeli prime minister at one point tried to claim that there were practically no casualties, no civilian casualties during the Israeli military campaign in Rafah. That's simply not true. I can think of several strikes in Rafah that
 
 did indeed result in civilian casualties. He also tried to portray overall the Israel -- Israeli military's fight in Gaza as one that has among the lowest civilian casualty rates in the world. Citing the one expert that he cited on this issue. A man named John Spencer at West Point, who is a total outlier as it relates to this issue.
 
The majority of experts on this issue, including former U.S. generals say that the way the Israeli military is fighting in Gaza, the extent to which it is minimizing civilian casualties is nowhere close to what the United States has done in multiple conflicts around the world, including conflicts where the U.S. itself has acknowledged that it simply did not do as well as it could have in terms of defending civilians.
 
Now, overall, the Israeli Prime Minister addressed a number of different audiences in his speech. He made nods to the families of the hostages, to a former hostage Noa Argamani who was in attendance at his speech vowing to bring all of the hostages home. He also vowed to destroy Hamas. And it was clear that despite that nod to the hostages, it was that issue of continuing to fight in Gaza until victory that kept on coming up again and again.
 
The Israeli Prime Minister vowing we will fight until we achieve victory. And what he certainly didn't do was say that he is on the verge of reaching a ceasefire agreement. And that's very notable because his focus, his emphasis on victory on fighting until victory, certainly doesn't sound like a man who is on the verge of signing a ceasefire agreement. 
 <br>[02:15:06]
 
Now, it's possible, of course, that he could be trying to mollify his right-wing allies, his right-wing base in Israel before taking that step.
 
But it's also possible that as we have wondered over the course of the last couple of weeks, whether or not the Israeli prime minister is actually committed to a ceasefire deal that perhaps he does not intend to sign a deal at all. We do know, though, that an Israeli delegation is set to depart to meet with the mediators and submit Israel's latest response to that trip, however, has been delayed.
 
It was expected to happen on Thursday. It now likely won't happen until Sunday after the Israeli Prime Minister first meets with President Biden on Thursday.
 
Jeremy diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
 
CHURCH: Israeli airstrikes and shelling have killed at least 33 people east of Khan Younis in the last 24 hours. That is according to a hospital spokesperson. A Gaza official says residential buildings were destroyed. Israeli troops and vehicles are still in the area and trapped Palestinians are pleading for help to be evacuated. Defending its operation, the IDF says there's been significant terrorist activity and rocket fire from the area toward Israel. Meantime, the IDF confirms it has recovered the bodies of four Israeli hostages from Gaza. Among them Oren Goldin. The Kibbutz where he lived says he was part of their civilian emergency squad and was killed on October 7th by Hamas. His body taken to Gaza. Maya Goren's body has also been recovered by the IDF. Her Kibbutz says she both she and her husband were killed on October 7th but only her body was taken to Gaza. Goren was a preschool teacher and she will be buried next to her husband.
 
Still to come. Mainland China is bracing for powerful winds and rain from Typhoon Gaemi after the storm battered Taiwan and the Philippines. We have the latest on its path.
 
While some voters in Venezuela are vowing to leave the country if strong man Nicolas Maduro was reelected president on Sunday. What's at stake in the elections?  We'll take a look at that after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: The center of Typhoon Gaemi has moved into the Taiwan Strait as it continues to pummel Taiwan with heavy rain, strong winds and damaging storm surge. Gaemi took an unusual path with Taiwan's mountainous terrain causing the powerful storm to make a full loop just off the coast. It then sat offshore for hours before finally making landfall early Thursday. At least two people have been killed in Taiwan and hundreds injured. 
 
The storm is also blamed for at least 13 deaths in the Philippines. Authorities there say almost a million people have been impacted by Gaemi. 
 <br>[02:20:03]
 
The storm is now moving toward Mainland China. Landfall is expected in Fujian Province later Thursday bringing heavy rain to areas that have already experienced deadly floods and landslides.
 
And CNN's Marc Stewart joins us now live from Beijing. So, Mark, what more are you learning about Typhoon Gaemi?
 
MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's a lot of concern particularly here in China, Rosemary, because in recent weeks, we have seen extreme flooding, particularly in the southern and central parts of China. Now the good news is this typhoon appears to be weakening. That's what CNN weather has been telling me. But nonetheless, attention is certainly heightened because of all of this.
 
Because of some of the damage we've seen in Taiwan, but also in the Philippines. And I want to start in Manila and show you some of the images that we have seen rescue after rescue. We have seen boats in the water. We've seen vehicles submerged. Not only adults being rescued, but children who have been wrapped up in blankets with their parents and family members watching. 
 
In fact, we have some new reporting that indicates north of Manila and area that was hit by the floods. There were 55,000 people evacuated. That includes nearly 16,000 family. So, the impact in the Philippines is quite tremendous. Businesses have closed, schools have been cancelled. More than 150 flights were also canceled so far today with many homes just submerged under the water, making it very difficult for anyone to get around.
 
So, the Philippines dealing with some very treacherous conditions. I should also point out that the Philippines itself was not hit by the typhoon. It's just the bands, the bands of rain -- of the water of the wind, all sweeping the Philippines. Not necessarily landfall by the typhoon itself. But that just shows how powerful of a storm this has been. And then now let's go to Taiwan, which is certainly a very typhoon prone area.
 
Among the images that really struck me were just the gusts of wind that we have seen people struggling to stand up over the past few hours. What's interesting about the Philippines and you alluded to this, Rosemary, is the fact that the mountainous terrain almost has served as a barrier for the movement of that typhoon. And while it did prevent it from moving further inland, it did concentrate some of this rain and wind and areas that previously thought wasn't going to be the effect wouldn't be so hard.
 
But as we've seen, it has -- it has caused a lot of hardship in parts of Taiwan. As far as here in China, again, the hope is that the storm will weaken. But as we have seen in recent months, the financial impact and the human impact has been tremendous. A price tag of impact so far this year of more than $10 billion. And of course, Rosemary tens of millions of people have felt the impact of flooding here in China. The hope is that it will not get worse.
 
CHURCH: Our Marc Stewart brings that live report from Beijing many things. Ahead of Sunday's presidential elections in Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez holding rallies Thursday, the last day of campaigning. Mr. Maduro has said that if he's not reelected, Venezuela might face a bloodbath. And many Venezuelans say if he stays in power, they will leave the country possibly triggering a new wave of migration. More now from Stefano Pozzebon.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): It's election time in Venezuela, using flyers and some crucial explanations.
 
POZZEBON (on camera): This is the voting card for the Sunday. You can see there are 12 faces of Maduro, three of the opposition. So they feel that they really need to explain to everybody which person to cross on. Look at these. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 Maduros.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): these opposition voters showing a new resolve to take on the Venezuelan strongmen.
 
POZZEBON (on camera): Aren't you worried about Maduro yesterday saying that it's going to be if he lost? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): He's not on left wing and the right-wing issue, no. These are the types (INAUDIBLE) government and democracy and freedom.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): But behind the determination.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): My plan B is to prepare my bags and leave. I can't keep losing my future here. Experts are warning of a new migration wave if Maduro wins this Sunday selection. Something these supporters are all too aware of.
 <br>[02:25:01]
 
POZZEBON (on camera): Who of you has family living abroad?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): United States.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): Colombia.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): Spain.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): Dominican Republic.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (text): Argentina.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Almost eight million Venezuelans have fled the country since Maduro came to power in 2013. Among them, the grandchildren of the opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez.
 
EDMUNDO GONZALEZ, OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a drama that will have Venezuelans. Eight million Venezuelans abroad with families separated and asking for a better life. That's something that we have to find a solution for that immediately.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): On the campaign trail. Maduro has also urged migrants to return home, but not many are listening. Venezuelans were the second largest group at the U.S. southern border last year. Was migration a central issue in the U.S. election in November. This is one such a family. While Amber Liana (ph) still lives in Venezuela, her uncle moved to Miami. 
 
One of the options if Sunday we don't win is to go stay with him, she tells me. Even if it meant walking all the way to America. Her uncle says that nobody wishes to leave their home but he's thankful for the new life he rebuilt in the U.S. Although he meant not seen his relatives for four years.
 
Two sides of the same family separated for now with a firm desire to hug each other again, here or elsewhere.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love you.
 
POZZEBON (voice-over): Stefano Pozzebon, CNN, Maracay.

CHURCH: Coming up. A new CNN poll shows us a first look at how well Kamala House is doing up against Donald Trump. That's next. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: In an historic speech from the Oval Office, U.S. President Joe Biden explained why he decided to end his 2024 reelection bid and vowed to keep fighting for Americans for the rest of his term. President Biden's decision to step aside came after fellow Democrats convinced him the chances of an election win looked bleak, following his disastrous debate performance.
 <br>[02:30:04]
 
And while he didn't mention Donald Trump by name he referred to what he believes is the existential threat the Republican candidate poses to the country. The president concluded by reiterating his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.
 
Well, a brand new CNN poll is giving us the first glimpse into the head-to-head matchup between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. CNN's Political Director, David Chalian breaks it all down.
 
DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR:  Here's the top line. It is a margin of error race, no clear leader, 49 percent for Donald Trump, 46 percent support for Kamala Harris. That's among registered voters, and that three-point differential, well, that's about half the margin that Joe Biden was trailing Trump with just in the spring. He was down six points in our spring poll. So, how is Harris narrowing that gap now into a margin of error race?
 
Well, among young voters, 18 to 34, Harris has a four-point advantage over Trump in this poll. Trump had a seven-point advantage over Biden with young voters. Black voters, Harris advantage, 63 percentage points over Trump. Biden had a 47-point advantage over Trump. Hispanic voters, Donald Trump's advantage over Biden was nine points. Now, Kamala Harris has narrowed that to a two-point advantage for Trump, still a warning sign, Democrats won the Hispanic vote in 2020 by 30 points. And among female voters, Kamala Harris has a five-point advantage over Trump, where he was tied with Biden.
 
Take a look here too. She has flipped the script on whether or not people are voting for her or against Trump. 50 percent now say they're voting for Harris, 50 percent say they're voting for Harris to cast a vote against Trump. Look at what it was with Joe Biden, only a third of his voters were voting for Biden. And Donald Trump has increased his affirmative vote now, 74 percent of Trump supporters say their vote is for Donald Trump, only a quarter are saying they're voting against Kamala Harris.
 
CHURCH:  President Joe Biden's decision to stop his bid for re- election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor has Republicans scrambling to find a way to stop at GOP and the Trump campaign considering various legal challenges. And on Tuesday, the Trump campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, they're arguing that money raised for Biden's re-election can't be transferred to Harris' presidential campaign.
 
CNN Legal Analyst Norm Eisen joins me now from Washington. He is a former White House Ethics Czar and served as Special Counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. A pleasure to have you with us.
 
NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Great to be back with you, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH:  So, ever since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee, Donald Trump and his campaign have gone on the attack, now threatening lawsuits against the Democrats and Harris' campaign. So, let's do some legal fact checking here. Trump wants to stop Joe Biden's campaign funds going to Kamala Harris. Can he legally do this?
 
EISEN:  There's one little problem with Donald Trump's legal argument, as is the case with so many legal arguments he makes. It is wrong; those funds are the property of the Biden-Harris ticket. Harris has now ascended to the top spot and under U.S. law, the money goes to her and Donald Trump knows it. He didn't even bother to try to file a lawsuit, he just filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, three Democrats, three Republicans. No way he's getting the votes. It's a dead loser.
 
CHURCH:  All right. What about this one? House Speaker Mike Johnson and others want to block the vice president at the state level from getting her name on the ballot using election laws. How legally feasible is that?
 
EISEN:  Again, it's a fallacious legal argument. There are no ballot deadlines that have passed. The closest one would have been Ohio, but they changed their law. Now, there are some that cut it close with the Democratic National Convention. That's why today, the DNC Rules Committee allowed for virtual balloting to select the nominee. That's going to happen in the coming days, well before any deadlines. Kamala Harris and her running mate, whoever it may be, will be on the ballot in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories. That argument is a dog that won't hunt.
 
(LAUGH)
 
CHURCH:  What about this one then? Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, and the house speaker have suggested that if President Biden isn't fit to run for re-election, then he's not fit to serve out his term and they want to see him pushed out of office using the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
How likely is it that they would pursue this? And what's the legal standing of such a suggestion?
 
EISEN:  Well, there's no doubt that Joe Biden is aging. I think he has shown that he can continue to function in this job. He performed brilliantly at the NATO Summit. He had an extended press conference after the NATO Summit, answering complicated questions on foreign policy, better than I could do and I was the United States Ambassador, showing his mastery of the subject matter and he was quite good tonight in his speech in the Oval Office explaining his decision to step aside.
 
Look, that is the right decision, but it's not a question of unfitness today, this year. It would be another four years. It was politically untenable. There's no basis for 25th Amendment Constitutional incapacity and they don't have the votes to do it. It's not happening.
 
CHURCH:  So Norm, do Republicans have any chance of succeeding with these or other legal threats that they come up with? Or are they just stirring the pot? What's going on here?
 
EISEN:  They're not just during the pot. It's the pot calling the kettle black because Donald Trump has such severe legal problems. Remember, 34 felony convictions. He has a sentencing currently scheduled for September. There is some post-trial legal skirmishing going on there. I've written for cnn.com that those arguments by Donald Trump are not going to work. So, they're trying to cast legal aspersions the other direction.
 
The problem is that unlike those well-founded jury convictions, Rosemary, there's no basis to these legal arguments. So, it's not going to work. If they want to beat Kamala Harris and I think these arguments show a level of concern, worry about that. If they want to beat her, they're going to have to do it at the ballot box, not in the -- before the judge and the courts of law.
 
CHURCH:  Legal fact-checker extraordinaire, Norm Eisen, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.
 
(LAUGH)
 
EISEN:  Thanks. Thanks for having me back.
 
CHURCH:  And we'll be back in a moment.

 <br>[02:40:00]
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Images have emerged on social media, showing three people apparently being assaulted by police at Manchester Airport in England. A warning, the images are disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH (voice-over):  One video shows an officer with his taser drawn, kicking a man and stomping on his head while he's on the ground. Another man is then seen being wrestled to the ground and kicked by an officer, while he is being restrained. A second video shows police pepper spraying another man, who then gets taken down. CNN cannot independently verify the condition of the man or of the events leading up to or directly after the violence captured on the video. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  The three officers were injured in what authorities say was a violent assault, one female officer suffering a broken nose. In a statement, police called the incident truly shocking and one officer has been removed from operational duties. They say four men were arrested and they're asking for an independent review of what happened.
 
Ukrainian athletes are getting ready for the Paris Olympics with the war at home never too far from their minds. This exhibit outside the British Parliament shows pieces of sports equipment, along with the number 487. That is how many Ukrainian athletes are estimated to have been killed during the war and are being honored by the exhibit. One former Olympian says those coming to Paris had a hard time preparing to compete.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OKSANA RAKHRA, FORMER UKRAINIAN OLYMPIAN:  They can't sleep because the siren is always disturbing them, so they need to go to the bunkers. Sometimes they train in the bunkers. And even when they are abroad -- even when they are abroad, they can train peacefully because it's always on the back of their mind because their families, their kids, their parents, they are still in Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Despite all that adversity, about 140 Ukrainian athletes will compete in Paris. They've been told to avoid shaking hands with Russian competitors because they could be promoting Moscow's misinformation. President Zelenskyy says no matter how they perform in Paris, the Ukrainian Olympians have already achieved their goal.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
