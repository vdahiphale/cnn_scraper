KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. Just ahead here on "CNN Newsroom," Ukraine is once again picking up the pieces after another round of Russian airstrikes. President Zelenskyy is using the moment to renew his call for more military aid.
 
Israel launches airstrikes into Gaza in response to rocket fire. This on the heels of a deadly Israeli raid on the West Bank and joint military exercises between the U.S. and Israel.
 
And in Kenya, a cholera outbreak has infected thousands and killed dozens, a country already battling drought and food shortages. We will speak with a doctor on the frontline in the fight to save lives.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Live from CNN Center, this is "CNN Newsroom" with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Ukraine is making the case for more western weapons following the latest barrage of Russian missile strikes. Kyiv says dozens of drones and missiles were fired on targets across Ukraine on Thursday, killing at least 11 people and leaving 11 others wounded. Ukraine says most of the missiles were shot down but dozens of buildings and power facilities still took heavy damage from the strikes.
 
The Russian attacks came just hours after western allies agreed to send their advanced tanks to Ukraine. In response, the Kremlin now accuses the west of direct involvement in the war.
 
For more, Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London. So, Salma, Zelenskyy has got his tanks, but he is already asking for more. So, what is on Kyiv's which list? Is the west going to fulfill it?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER:  Kim, almost anything and everything is on President Zelenskyy's which list. Absolutely, this victory for Kyiv and this announcement that tanks would be deployed to Ukraine is very much a victory for President Zelenskyy, who has been able to convince his partners to take steps that were unimaginable a year ago. It is his ever-present push with his partners that have finally brought those tanks to Ukraine.
 
But, again, on that wish list, everything from fighter jets to long- range missiles to air defense systems, some things that maybe the west is yet willing to give. But what President Zelenskyy does time and time again is he points to the conflict on the ground. He points to the front lines. He points to the suffering of civilians and says this is why I am asking for these weapons, and that's exactly what happened yesterday.
 
After this announcement, Russia sent a barrage, over 50 missiles towards Ukraine, killing 11 people and wounding 11 others. President Zelenskyy used his nightly address to say, see, this is why we need more help. Take a listen.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator):  This evil, this Russian aggression, can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ABDELAZIZ:  Now, what is important to remember here, Kim, is that Ukraine is operating a lot of times with Soviet-era equipment on those front lines and across the country, dated machinery that is difficult to maintain, difficult to get the parts for, difficult to get the ammunition for. So, a lot of this is about bringing Ukraine's military up-to-date, modernizing it and bringing it up-to-date with NATO standards.
 
What President Zelenskyy is attempting to do, remember, this is a disproportionate fight, Russia's military is much larger than Ukraine's, but what he is attempting to do is to make sure that the weapons his army has is qualitatively better, the quality of those weapons is better than the numbers that Russia has, especially as the country heads towards the spring counteroffensive and prepares for Moscow's troops to really pick up the tempo of this war.
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right, Salma Abdelaziz, thank you so much, appreciate it.
 
Israel says its airstrikes on Gaza were focused on a rocket manufacturing site operated by Hamas underground. That's after Gaza militants launched several missiles at Israel. This all follows what became the deadliest day for the Palestinians in the West Bank in more than a year.
 
Palestinian health ministry says nine were killed during an Israeli raid. Israel says it was responding to intelligence about an imminent attack by terrorists. Ten Palestinians died hours later during a separate encounter with Israeli police. Thousands of Palestinians marched in Jenin during funerals for those killed. [02:05:02]
 
CNN's Hadas Gold reports from Jerusalem.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN MEDIA AND GLOBAL BUSINESS REPORTER:  At least nine Palestinians were killed during an unusual daytime Israeli
 
 military raid in Jenin in the West Bank. The Israelis say they were targeting Islamic Jihad militants there who they say were preparing for what they called an imminent attack.
 
But at least one civilian, a woman in her 60s, was killed during the fire fights between the militants and the Israeli military, the deadliest single day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year and what has already been an incredibly violent and deadly period for both Palestinians and Israelis.
 
In response, militants in Gaza fired rockets into Israel. No reported injuries yet. The Palestinian authority leadership announced in a dramatic move that they are seizing security cooperation with Israel.
 
NABIL ABU RUDINEH, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  In light of the continuous hostilities on our people and the complete disregard to the signed agreements, including the security agreement, we consider the security coordination with Israeli Occupation government as nonexistent starting now.
 
GOLD:  It is not the first time the security coordination has been cut. In 2020, the Palestinian authority cut off the coordination in response to Israeli plans to annex (ph) part of the West Bank as part of former President Donald Trump's peace plan. But coordination resumed six months later when annexation came off the table.
 
It's not clear how long this cut off will last, but the U.S. State Department is warning that it is not the right step at this moment, a tense time in the region as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepares for a visit here in the coming days.

BRUNHUBER:  The U.S. and Israel held their largest ever joint military drills this week, marking a significant increase in cooperation between the two countries. More than 6,400 U.S. personnel and more than 1,100 Israeli troops participated in the live fire exercises code named "Juniper Oak." They covered every arena from air, land, and sea to cyber warfare and space.
 
The show of force is meant to send a clear signal to Iran and other adversaries in the region that the U.S. and Israeli military alliance is as strong as ever. Listen to this. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF STAFF, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  Israel and the U.S. share the same values. The IDF and the U.S. Cent Com (INAUDIBLE) this area.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  U.S. defense officials say the joint exercises focused on offensive capabilities in addition to the standard defensive maneuvers.
 
The U.S. military has killed a senior ISIS leader and 10 members of the terror group in an operation in Somalia. The Biden administration says Bilal al-Sudani helped fund the network of ISIS affiliates around the world, including Afghanistan. He was hit with sanctions in 2012 for training terrorists.
 
CNN's David McKenzie is following developments from Johannesburg. So, David, walk us through these killings. Who was targeted? How and why?
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the nature of the special operations commander attack is very interesting, Kim, because, obviously, Bilal al-Sudani, the leader designated by the Treasury and the U.S. government as an ISIS facilitator and leader in Somalia, was killed by these U.S. commanders in an early morning raid, according to U.S. officials, on Thursday.
 
Now, if you look at that map of Somalia, it is up in the frontline region, the semiautonomous area in the very far north, the northeast of the country. And why this is significant and why they believe that it was significant terror target is because of the relative risk of going in with commanders. This would've been a carefully-planned commando raid by helicopter, it seems. It would have been approved by the U.S. president.
 
And ISIS in Somalia is not the main terror group operating there. It has overshadowed the al-Shabaab, the larger al-Qaeda-linked group that has been battling the government for years.
 
But this is significant. The U.S. officials saying that al-Sudani was responsible for expanding the financial networks of ISIS in parts of Africa as well as far as Afghanistan and continues the targeting of financial networks of the terror group.
 
Now, the last time I noticed the name al-Sudani was when late last year when the U.S. government and Treasury designated the cell of ISIS funders in their estimation here in South Africa and they linked a individual here specifically to al-Sudani in Somalia.
 
Now, no civilians were killed or injured in the attack nor were any of these special forces commandoes except one was injured by one of the service dogs, according to U.S. officials.
 <br>[02:09:58]
 
MCKENZIE:  But this relatively risky maneuver is unusual in Somalia. Usually, the U.S. as recently as last weekend combats airstrikes against alleged terrorists. But it does speak to the significance they have of this individual and the potential gain and intelligence that could have been scooped up by commanders in this kind of raid. Kim?
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right, appreciate that, David McKenzie in Johannesburg.
 
A Manhattan jury has convicted a man on all counts for the deadly terror attack on a New York bike path five years ago. Sayfullo Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan was found guilty on all charges. Now, a jury must decide whether to impose the death penalty. Saipov struck cyclists and pedestrians when he drove a rented truck on the west side bike path in 2017, killing eight. Prosecutors say he was inspired by ISIS. It is New York City's deadliest terror attack since 9/11.
 
Taiwan has a new premier. Former Vice President Chen Chen-jen was appointed to the post by the president following the resignation last week of the previous premier and members of his cabinet. The move by the President Tsai Ing-wen is part of a wider cabinet reshuffle following heavy election losses by her democratic progressive party last November. Taiwan is scheduled to hold its next presidential election early next year. 
 
Police video is expected to be made public today showing a violent encounter that led to the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. Murder charges have now been filed against the fired officers. Coming up, we will take a closer look at how releasing the police video could impact the case.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER:  It has been nearly three weeks since Tyre Nichols died following a violent confrontation with police in Memphis, Tennessee. Later today, police video of that incident is expected to be made public. Memphis and other American cities are bracing for possible backlash.
 
According to authorities, 29-year-old Nichols was pulled over in a traffic stop on January 7th. After fleeing on foot, he was eventually caught and subsequently suffered major injuries. He died in a hospital three days later.
 
All five officers involved have been fired and are now facing second- degree murder charges and other offenses. The city's mayor says this ahead of the video's release.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MAYOR JIM STRICKLAND, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE:  We worked to get a resolution to these matters in record time because we take them extremely seriously. As we have said all along, we wanted to ensure the proper legal steps were followed and that the family of Mr. Nichols had an opportunity to view the video footage privately before we release it to the public.

BRUNHUBER:  Nichols was an avid skateboarder. On Thursday night, his family and supporters held a vigil at one of his favorite skate parks. His mother pleaded for calm once the police video is released. Here she is.

ROWVAUGHN WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS'S MOTHER:  When the tape comes out tomorrow, it's going to be horrific. I didn't see it, but from what I hear, it's going to be horrific. But I want each and every one of you to protest in peace. I don't want us burning up our cities, tearing up the streets because that is not what my son stood for.

DAVID B. RAUSCH, DIRECTOR, TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION:  We continue to pursue every lead. Justice demands it. And our agency exists so that guilt shall not escape nor innocents suffer. 
 
SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER (voice-over):  The law enforcement official in charge of the Tyre Nichols investigation saying he was sickened by what he saw police officers do to the 29- year-old.
 
STEVE MULROY, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SHELBY COUNTY:  We all want the same thing. We want justice for Tyre Nichols.
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Shelby County district attorney charged Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills, Emmitt Martin, Justin Smith, and Tadarrius Bean with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, and kidnapping among several other charges.
 
The lawyers for two of the former officers who were all fired last week say they still don't have the details about what happened.
 
WILLIAM MASSEY, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR EMMITT MARTIN:  We do not have discovery. We've not seen the video. So, we are kind of (INAUDIBLE) right now and this process is just starting.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  We got one male, Black running.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Set up perimeter.
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Memphis police say that Nichols was pulled over on January 7th for reckless driving.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over): (INAUDIBLE) car pulled over (INAUDIBLE) have one running on foot.
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Run that tag and see what's the address.
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Police say that a confrontation occurred and after using pepper spray, Nichols fled the scene on foot.
 
MULROY:  There was another altercation at a nearby location at which the serious injuries were experienced by Mr. Nichols. After some period of time of waiting around afterwards, he was taken away by an ambulance. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  Nichols died of his injuries three days later.
 
CERELYN DAVIS, CHIEF, MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT:  This incident was heinous, reckless, and inhumane. 
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  The five officers involved in the beating were fired after an internal investigation found that they violated multiple department policies, including the use of excessive force and failing to render aid.
 
Two EMTs with the Memphis Fire Department were also put on leave and additional officers are under investigation.
 
RODNEY WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS'S STEPFATHER:  No father, mother should have to witness what I saw today.
 
PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  The Nichols family has viewed video of the incident, which has been described as brutal and heinous. Prosecutors plan to release it publicly on Friday night with the hopes of easing tensions.
 
RAUSCH:  We are here to pursue truth and justice, realizing that we should not be here. Simply put, this shouldn't have happened. I have been pleading for more than 30 years. I've devoted my life to this profession. And I'm grieved. Frankly, I am shocked. 
 
PROKUPECZ (on camera):  We are now waiting for the next steps in this case. Obviously, it would be the arraignment. The officers spent most of the day after being charged in jail, waiting to get bond. We are told that two of those officers did bond out. They are now out with bond. Three other officers still remain in jail. They are expected to make bond.
 
And then the next steps will be the arraignment for these officers. They have to be arraigned on the indictment. That could come next week. And then finally next week, really, the emotional part of this. The funeral is expected next week.

(END VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER:  Retired Los Angeles Police Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey joins us now to discuss this. So, what stands out to you about this case and the charges? 
 
CHERYL DORSEY, RETIRED LOS ANGELES POLICE SERGEANT:  Well, I mean, what stands out is that this should never have occurred. We know from everything that we have heard that these officers used excessive force.
 
I heard a brief explanation by one of the defense attorneys that the officer believed he acted appropriately and did as he was trained to do. We know that not to be the case because officers are trained and taught to use only that force necessary to overcome resistance, and they went well beyond that and they did so for three minutes.
 <br>[02:20:02] 
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yeah. I mean, you -- obviously, we haven't seen the video, but you heard a general description of it. What are you expecting? And speak to the anger and frustration from the community that we are likely to see when it is released.
 
DORSEY:  Well, obviously, you know, this is on the heels of the George Floyd deadly use of force and there are some who thought that measures would be taken and that there would have been deterrents for officers going forward so that sort of use of force could never occur again.
 
But sadly, we are here, and I think that we will continue to experience this. There will continue to be frustration on the part of the community unless and until there is an end to qualified immunity because what have these officers really learned? Nothing.
 
There is a civil settlement paid at the end of this outrageous, egregious uses of force. The department doesn't pay it. The officer doesn't the tax. The officer doesn't pay the settlement tax payers due. And so, you have five young officers between two and five years on the job who obviously did not think anything was wrong with what they were doing.
 
And so, I hope that going forward, we can have substantive conversation about what we can do to really hold officers accountable. 
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes. There has been a lot of focus on the "scorpion unit," a type of specialized unit to suppress violent crime that they were in. I mean, you've seen similar units at the LAPD, I imagine. The mission and attitudes of those in units like these, particularly if they are inexperienced, as you said. How can that be a contributing factor?
 
DORSEY:  Well, the fact that these officers were young on the job, two to five years on the department, means that, you know, in my mind, as a supervisor who has managed officers, they did not know anything. And clearly, they probably act with very minimal supervision.
 
When you work in specialized units like that, and I have in operation south bureau crash (ph), you tend to have free reign. And if you don't have the right temperament and the experience and the skill set, you find yourself being extra aggressive. These are officers who I like to refer to as "elephant hunters." They are the ones who go out and are proactive. They get involved in what we call "pretext stops."
 
It sounds like this might have been something like that, a reckless driving, which is just an infraction, and then it can hopefully lead to maybe finding someone that has drugs or guns or in a stolen vehicle. And when you have somebody who runs, officers routinely, some, will punish you at the end of a foot pursuit, and that is what happened with Mr. Nichols. 
 
BRUNHUBER:  You referenced some of the previous incidents. But in those instances, the police officers accused were generally white. I mean, these officers involved were all African-American. So, race won't be the factor. It has been in other similar cases. So, how do you think that will play into how this is perceived and how it is dealt with?
 
DORSEY:  Well, you know, I don't think race, in my opinion, ever plays a part. I think in all instances, there are officers who are drunk with power and it's just that most of these departments have so few Blacks that we don't see them out working patrol, we don't see them engaged in this kind of outrageous and egregious behavior. It is mostly male whites. Every now and then, we will see a female involved.
 
But it's just officers who are drunk with power. One of the officers reportedly had been previously sued for some excessive use of force. So, clearly, he did not learn a lesson. He left to offend again.
 
And so, unless and until there is substantive accountability, we are going to continue to have officers who are hot dogs, who are hard charges, kick butt and take name on these specialized units involved in this kind of activity across these 18,000 police departments in the U.S.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Sad to hear. So little seems to be learned. Really appreciate your expertise on this. Thank you so much for being here with us.
 
DORSEY:  Thank you.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Severe drought and malnutrition contributing to the deadly outbreak of cholera in Kenya. Now, a shipment of millions of doses of vaccines could help save lives across the country. We will get some perspective from a health expert in Nairobi in just a few moments. Please do stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Welcome back to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is "CNN Newsroom." The death toll now stands at 79 from a cholera outbreak in Kenya. That is according to the World Health Organization. It says there have been more than 4,000 cases reported since the outbreak began in October.
 
The WHO also says the cholera outbreak is uniquely challenging because it is -- quote -- "occurring against the context of severe drought and acute malnutrition affecting some of the world's most vulnerable, those who have fled drought and conflict and sought refuge in Kenya."
 
On Wednesday, the head of Kenya's ministry of health said that outbreak could be defeated. Listen to this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. PATRICK AMOTH, DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR HEALTH, MINISTRY OF HEALTH, KENYA:  The total number of counties affected has been 14. Five counties have managed to be able to bring the outbreak under control, total control. But we still have nine counties which have active cases of cholera. If we continue together with our partners, in the not distant future, we should be able to bring this outbreak to an end.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  One key to ending the outbreak, a vaccination campaign is expected to start early next month with more than two million doses of cholera vaccine being shipped to Kenya.
 
Joining me now from Nairobi is Dr. Sam Kariuki, acting director general of the Kenya Medical Research Institute. Thank you so much for joining us here, doctor.
 
Cholera is caused by bacteria which you get from eating or drinking contaminated food or water. It is a persistent problem in Africa generally. But what is causing this particular outbreak in Kenya where you are and Malawi as well? 
 
DR. SAM KARIUKI, ACTING DIRECTOR GENERAL, KENYA MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  Thank you very much for having me on this call. One of the major contributors of the current outbreak is, again, is just (INAUDIBLE) water and sanitation. And matters have not been brought to any better because of the ongoing drought in many places, so the local communities end up using the most available water. That is water from shallow wells and sometimes open drains. This water is sometimes highly contaminated leading again to the spread of these infections.
 
And the other issue regarding this particular outbreak is that from our laboratory analysis, it is caused by bacteria, vibrio cholera, that is multidrug resistant to a lot of drugs that are currently available locally. And the resistance itself makes this persists much longer in the environment. That is one of the things that we have to grapple with. So, combination (INAUDIBLE).
 
BRUNHUBER:  So, it is not a new problem, but last year, Africa experienced its highest ever reported numbers. I want to quote from something you wrote here. You wrote, governments in endemic areas do not recognize cholera as a major issue until there is a big outbreak when it's out of control. So, what is missing from the government response then across the region?
 <br>[02:29:54]
 
KARIUKI:  I think, in our opinion, it is that governments need to recognize the cyclic outbreaks of cholera that has happened, especially when you have huge patterns of climatic change. Say, for example, we have floods then followed again by drought. And these precipitate a lot of problems, especially in the informal settlements where we have vulnerable populations.
 
Sometimes we have water contamination due to open drains, and so forth. We have vulnerable populations, those that have been displaced in refugee camps, again, sometimes with limited supplies of clean water due to challenges of -- you know, of displaced populations in very, very large numbers. And I think governments then need to put in place measures that prevent this from happening.
 
Obviously, it's going to take time to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure but we also have what I would call low -- very low-lying fruits that can go ahead and prevent this. For example, having populations that are most vulnerable, having the vaccine, the oral cholera vaccine. And that prevents cholera, at least for a year or two. (INAUDIBLE) -- 
 
KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR (on camera): Let me -- let me jump in there -- 
 
KARIUKI: Yes.
 
BRUNHUBER: Because as you say that oral vaccine, there is a vaccination campaign that will get underway in Kenya. But as I understand it, it needs a yearly booster, so how realistic is that as a solution?
 
KARIUKI: Usually, for the most effective oral cholera vaccine, you give it those one and then you give those two, after six months as a booster -- after one year -- six months as a booster, and the protection should go for up to two years. However, we think that is mainly going to respond to the acute cases -- the acute outbreaks that we are seeing. Obviously, in the medium term and long term, we have to improve wash infrastructure that is water, sanitation, and hygiene.
 
And then also inevitably the livelihoods of our populations because some of these diseases that have been eliminated in a lot of other countries are also related to poverty, with populations that migrate from rural areas not being able to find decent housing where there will be infrastructure for water, sanitation, and hygiene. So, it's twofold. It's a poverty-related disease but also a disease that in the short term must be confronted with the resources we have and that is the oral cholera vaccine.
 
BRUNHUBER: Yes. No easy solutions for sure. We wish you all the best of luck out there in dealing with this.
 
KARIUKI: None.
 
BRUNHUBER: Dr. Sam Kariuki in there over Kenya, appreciate your time.
 
KARIUKI: Thank you so much.
 
BRUNHUBER: Haiti's capital is reeling from violent protests against the string of recent police killings. Protesters including some police officers attack the country's main airport and the Prime Minister's residence in Port-au-Prince on Thursday, at least 10 police have been killed by armed gangs over the past week. Reuters reports the prime minister was flying back from Argentina where he was struck at the airport for a while -- stuck rather at the airport for a while before returning to his home.
 
A crowd of protesters converged on Lebanon's Justice Ministry on Thursday furious over the latest attempt to block an inquiry into the deadly explosion in Beirut's port in 2020. Video shows crowds attempting to breach the gates before scuffles broke out with security forces. The explosion in 2020 killed at least 215 people and injured thousands more. The inquiry into the blast was stalled for more than a year until Monday when a judge reopened the investigation. And on Tuesday, Lebanon's Attorney General rejected the move and says no official decision has been made on whether to restart the investigation.
 
India has banned a BBC documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and now it's taking action against students who plan to go ahead with a screening of the film. CNN's Anna Coren tells us how the government is cracking down on what it describes as propaganda.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Police in India have detained at least a dozen university students over attempts to screen a banned BBC documentary critical of the country's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The two-part documentary, India: The Modi Question, looks at Modi's alleged role into the deadly 2002 Gujarat riots that claim more than a thousand lives mostly Muslim when he was the state's chief minister.
 
Last week, the government blocked the documentary from airing in India after enforcing emergency powers under the country's new Information and Technology Act that allows it to suppress any information that appears online. Both YouTube and Twitter have complied with the order. The government has called the documentary a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative.
 <br>[02:35:03]
 
The BBC responded stating the documentary was "rigorously researched according to the highest editorial standards." Students at two prominent universities in New Delhi this week tried to screen the documentary but were faced with power cuts and an internet shutdown according to student leaders. Police then detained 13 students saying they needed to ensure peace in the area.
 
SANAM HUSSAIN, STUDENT: (Speaking in a foreign language)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stopping the screening of a film and then attacking the students in such a manner. This is a complete violation of all kinds of, you know, democratic, fundamental rights of every citizen of this country.
 
COREN: Critics of the ban have expressed dismay at what they view as censorship by the Indian government. The Committee to Protect Journalists also weighed in, saying this was an attack on the free press that flagrantly contradicts the country's stated commitment to democratic ideals.
 
The BBC documentary explores an unpublished British government report that reveals the violence in Gujarat back in 2002 had all the hallmarks of an ethnic cleansing, claiming there was widespread and systemic rape of Muslim women. Modi has denied accusations that he failed to stop the violence. And in 2012, a supreme court appointed a special investigation team found there was no evidence to suggest Modi was to blame.

BRUNHUBER: To Japan now where some are calling the record low temperatures hitting the country a once-in-a-decade cold snap. Kyoto registered a bone-chilling minus 16 degrees Celsius, about two degrees Fahrenheit. In central Tokyo the lowest temperature wasn't as bad, it was still chilly minus three Celsius, about 26 degrees Fahrenheit. Meteorologists are urging people to watch out for blizzards, heavy snow, frozen roads, and turbulent ocean waves. They say the cold front is expected to weaken on Friday and gain more strength again on Saturday.

The elder Djokovic says his family "has lived through the horror of war and we wish only for peace. I had no intention of being caught up in this." He also says he'll watch his son's match in about an hour from home so there's no disruption.

Music seems to be thawing some of the frosty relations between the U.S. and Cuba, cultural exchange programs that were once halted by the United States are being reinstated. And CNN's Patrick Oppmann shows us, thanks to some visiting Americans and their Cuban counterparts.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It's not the kind of music you typically hear in Cuba but then this is not a typical group of musicians either. For a week in January, four college-age U.S. musicians and their teachers travel from freezing Minneapolis to sunny Havana to try their hand at cultural diplomacy. Changes like this are just restarting after the pandemic all but closed Cuba to the world and the Trump administration once again made it harder for Americans to travel to the communist-run Island.
 
While tourism remains off limits for U.S. citizens, in 2022, the Biden administration ease some restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba. These Americans bought musical instruments to donate and say they're coming away with a respect for Cuban musicians' ability to overcome adversity.
 
RENA KRAUT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CUBAN AMERICAN YOUTH ORCHESTRA: There's something inspiring about how their lack of the best instrument in the world does not stop anyone from working and putting out the most beautiful musicianship.
 
OPPMANN: For hours each day, musicians from the two countries practice together, carry out workshops and perform in local schools.
 
DAIANA GRACIA, CUBAN CONDUCTOR: (Speaking in a foreign language)
 
OPPMANN: Their budding collaboration is overseen by renowned Cuban conductor, Daiana Garcia.

OPPMANN: I think the greatest benefit is spiritual, she says, how a culture that's apparently so different can have the same interests, the same dreams. Organizers say they're planning on bringing the Cuban students taking part in the exchange to Minneapolis in the spring so they can show off their skills to a new audience.
 
MARIANNA NUNEZ, CUBAN MUSICIAN: We have the passion, the emotion, the feelings, and the music inside of our blood.
 
OPPMANN: At the end of their time in Cuba, the American musicians and their Cuban counterparts play a show at the house of the head of the U.S. embassy in Havana. This kind of exchange isn't about solving the long-running problems between the two country's governments, the musicians say.
 
ROAN FLOER-MARTINEZ, U.S. MUSICIAN: Whatever you may think about, you know, the respective governments of any two countries you know -- it's not about the government ultimately, it's about the people and it's about getting to know them, and getting to connect with them.
 
OPPMANN: And when there is that connection, beautiful music you're sure to follow. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana.

BRUNHUBER: It could be now or never if you want to own a piece of the king, some Elvis Presley memorabilia is going up for auction this weekend including jewelry, sheets, and a brief cake -- a briefcase rather. Auctioneers hope to fetch at least $100,000 just for a jacket designed by the man who made Elvis's famous jumpsuit and cape. An address book featuring the king's handwriting and personal notes could go for more than $10,000.
 
All right, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Kim Brunhuber. "WORLD SPORT" is next.
