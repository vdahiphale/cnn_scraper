CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Christina Macfarlane in for Isa Soares. Tonight, 
 
 bombarded by night and by day. How Kyiv is resisting Russia's latest assault and how that's impacting the frontline. Then NATO allies are 
 
 congratulating Erdogan, but how will Turkey's victorious president adapt to opposition, economic and geopolitical pressures?  
 
And later, California may be too expensive and too exposed to be ensured. Why one major home insurance company will stop selling to buyers in the 
 
 Golden State. Now, weekend of terror hasn't ended for Ukraine. Kyiv residents are bracing for the night ahead after a massive Russian air 
 
 assault continued today.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Video out of the capital here shows children screaming and running for shelter. Other cities also saw waves of Russian strikes. Many 
 
 people have taken refuge in Kyiv's metro. Night-time assaults are common in the city, but an attack in broad daylight is unusual. On Ukrainian official 
 
 says the Russians are changing their tactics.  
 
And throughout it all, first responders and air defenses have kept busy. They say dozens of missiles and  drones were destroyed, but even 
 
 intercepted weapons pose a threat. This video here captures the moment a piece of flaming debris slams into traffic. Ukrainian officials are vowing 
 
 to retaliate. For the latest, CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live for us in Kyiv tonight.  
 
Fred, this daylight attack was obviously a brazen attempt to target civilians. I mean, is that the point of Russia changing their tactics here, 
 
 to kind of sow fear and chaos in the capital?  
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think that, that might be one of the things, but I also think they're trying to 
 
 make their strikes more effective. Because one of the things, Christina, that we have seen on the ground here is that Ukraine's air defenses 
 
 certainly should have become a lot more efficient and a lot more proficient as well.  
 
And if we look at that attack that happened last night and this morning, you're absolutely right to say that it was really two distinct waves of 
 
 attacks that happened. In the first one, it was mostly cruise missiles and drones that the Russians use there. And if we look at some of the numbers, 
 
 they're pretty staggering.  
 
The Ukrainians are saying that a 40-cruise missiles that were sent by the Russians overnight, they managed to take down 37 of those. So that is a 
 
 pretty good kill ratio, if you will, by the Ukrainian air defenses. And then later today or this morning here, Kyiv time, they say that the 
 
 Russians sent 11 ballistic missiles into the capital, and the Ukrainians managed to take down all of them.  
 
So, the Ukrainians are pretty happy with themselves as far as the air defense is concerned. Nevertheless, of course, for the civilians on the 
 
 ground, there were some really scary moments today. Here's what happened. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
(CHILDREN SCREAMING) 
 
PLEITGEN (voice-over): Terrified children running for their lives as Russia unleashed another massive aerial attack on Ukrainian cities. But Ukraine 
 
 says its air defense managed to shoot down all the ballistic missiles fired at the capital Kyiv, and now, Ukraine's forces seen nearly ready for their 
 
 own much-anticipated counteroffensive.  
 
This weekend, Ukraine's top General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi releasing this video, showing troops gearing up for battle and showcasing modern western weapons 
 
 with a clear message, it's time to take back what's ours.  
 
(GUNFIRE) 
 
And that's what these guys are training for. This is a unit of the offensive guard for Ukraine's Interior Ministry. We have a clear 
 
 motivation, the commander says, we defend our land. This is our nation, our homeland. The offensive guard is mustering tens of thousands of troops they 
 
 say, training to storm trenches and evacuate casualties which they know they're bound to have in the tough battles ahead.  
 
(on camera): What these guys are practicing here no doubt will become a reality for the Ukrainian Armed Forces very soon. As Kyiv says, it will 
 
 start a massive counteroffensive to take back all of their territory including Crimea.  
 
(voice-over): The Ukrainians already seem to be stepping up strikes on possible Russian supply lines in occupied areas.  
 <br>[14:05:00]
 
Russian-installed officials claiming Ukrainian missile attacks against targets around Berdyansk and Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine in the past 
 
 days.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
PLEITGEN: It's just the beginning, a top adviser to Ukraine's presidency tells me. Everything that is happening now is a precursor for a 
 
 counterattack. A necessary precursor with the intensity of fire increases. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 
PLEITGEN: And he lays out bold aims for the counteroffensive. "It will end undoubtedly on the borders of Ukraine as they were in 1991 with the de-
 
 occupation of Crimea, and with the beginning of a massive process of transformation of Russia's political system. But for now, resilience 
 
 remains key for the people in Ukraine's cities. These newly-weds had just tied the knot and were on their way to their celebration when the air raid 
 
 sirens went off.  
 
So they just continued to celebrate in the bomb shelter, vowing not to let Russian rockets ruin the best day of their lives.  
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
PLEITGEN: Certainly that, one of the signs of defiance here in the Ukrainian capital, of course, in many other cities in Ukraine as well. And 
 
 that's really been the name of the game for a while now. That when these air-raids sirens happen, yes, people run for cover, they go into shelters. 
 
 But once the air raid alerts are over, they do come out very quickly and go about their daily lives. 
 
People go back to their offices. People go around to the places that they had been aiming to go to in the first place. And it was quite interesting 
 
 because the head of Ukraine's Military Intelligence, Christina, he came out right after this set of attacks today, and he said, look, the Russians are 
 
 clearly trying to scare the population, but it clearly isn't working, Christina.  
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, and Fred, given this was, I believe the 16th attack on Kyiv this month, I mean, it is astonishing resilience, isn't it? From the 
 
 Ukrainians. Thanks so much for your reporting there. Fred Pleitgen live from Kyiv. Now, the celebrations are winding down in Turkey for President 
 
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his supporters after he won an unprecedented third term in a runoff election.  
 
Now, he faces the difficult job of uniting the country after a bitterly- divided campaign. Mr. Erdogan edged out his secular challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, despite an ongoing economic crisis. That gives him a mandate 
 
 until 2028, extending his two decades-long rule. Leaders of fellow NATO countries are congratulating Mr. Erdogan on his win, and so, too is Russian 
 
 President Vladimir Putin.  
 
Oh, we're joined now by Nada Bashir who is live for us in Istanbul. So Nada, as Erdogan begins this new term in office facing a number of pressing 
 
 challenges, not just domestically, but also externally as well from western allies, specifically regarding the ratification of Sweden to NATO. We know 
 
 that the next summit on that is due to happen in July. Can we expect any change in stunts from Erdogan, now that the elections are done and over.  
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, President Erdogan has been pretty tough in his approach when it comes to his role as a NATO leader, and in 
 
 particular, of course, when it comes to the question of Sweden joining the NATO alliance. And that was -- that language, that rhetoric was essentially 
 
 toughening up ahead of the election.  
 
He has said that he plans to continue to block Sweden's accession into NATO until those grievances he holds, his government holds towards Sweden are 
 
 resolved. Of course, there are real concerns amongst the Turkish government, around groups the Turkish government considers to be terrorist 
 
 organizations, namely Kurdish organizations operating in Sweden.  
 
And we have seen President Erdogan, of course, toughening up his stance when it comes to other international matters. This is a key NATO ally, an 
 
 influential regional powerbroker. And you mentioned there, that relationship between President Erdogan and President Putin. And that will 
 
 certainly be a key focus in his next term, particularly, of course, in light of the war in Ukraine.  
 
Over the last year, we have seen President Erdogan positioning Turkey as a mediator figure between Russia and Ukraine. And we saw last Summer, the 
 
 successful brokering and signing of that Black Sea Grain Initiative deal which was brokered by Turkey and the U.N. after months of negotiations. 
 
 President Erdogan has expressed his wish to continue to focus on potential peace efforts, despite the fact that he has faced criticism from some of 
 
 his western and NATO allies over that relationship, and that continued relationship with President Putin.  
 
And he has described it in the past as a special relationship. But of course, Turkey is an important interlocutor in the Middle East and across 
 
 this region. But home, there are some real challenges ahead of what President Erdogan has secured a victory this time around. What we also saw 
 
 is the opposition garnering greater support than was expected really.  
 
We're talking about six very different political parties coming together under the alliance led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, now they did lose the 
 
 election, but the support that they were able to get, the fact that Turkey actually had to then go into a runoff for this presidential election for 
 
 the first time, has shown a real divide in the country.  
 <br>[14:10:00]
 
And that message was certainly underlined by Kemal Kilicdaroglu yesterday. He didn't concede defeat directly, but he was clear that this is a sign, a 
 
 signal that Turkey is a very polarized nation. Now, there is a real hunger for change in this country after more than two decades of President 
 
 Erdogan's leadership.  
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, I know, it'd be very interesting to see if Erdogan can unite the country as he claims he can do when he took him -- took a step up 
 
 and did his victory speech. Closer to home, Nada, we know Turkey's economy is in bad shape, and today, the Turkish lira fell to a record-low having 
 
 lost, so I think 90 percent value over the past decade.  
 
How much pressure is Erdogan coming under to abandon his unusual policy of low interest rates to get inflation and the economy back under control?  
 
BASHIR: Well, look, President Erdogan has been coming under pressure now for months. Turkey is going through one of the worst cost of living crisis 
 
 it has seen in recent times. And President Erdogan's own unorthodox monetary policies has been blamed by experts, observers for what we're 
 
 seeing as rising inflation, the plummeting value of the lira as a result, largely by President Erdogan's insistence on keeping interest rates low. 
 
And we've heard from President Erdogan speaking yesterday during his victory speech. He plans to push ahead with this plan, and in fact, he 
 
 spoke to our own Becky Anderson ahead of that all important election. He said he believes that Turkey will seek good returns in the long run with 
 
 this economic policy. Now, of course, there is a real sense of anger and frustration among supporters of the opposition.  
 
There was a real sense that this was a crisis at the forefront of all of these voters' minds, on both sides of the political spectrum. President 
 
 Erdogan seems firm in pursuing his current agenda as it stands. There are questions, of course, now, as he formulates his next cabinet, who he will 
 
 appoint as his finance minister, perhaps, we will see some change and tact over the coming weeks and months. 
 
But of course, President Erdogan has been clear, he thinks this is the right plan. And when we spoke to supporters of President Erdogan yesterday, 
 
 celebrating his victory outside the AK Party headquarters, they said that they believe that the political stability that President Erdogan offers, 
 
 having been in power for so long is what this country needs over the coming years, considering it is experiencing so many struggles on various fronts. 
 
 Christina?  
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, so many struggles on various fronts, still a lot to do. Nada Bashir, live for us there today and for the past few days, thanks very 
 
 much, Nada. Now, Spain will hold early parliamentary elections in July. That's the word from Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, hours after his 
 
 socialist party suffered major setbacks in regional and local elections.  
 
In a statement, Mr. Sanchez said he had talked to Spain's King Felipe on -- of the decision to hold elections July 23rd. The conservative popular party 
 
 defeated the socialists in a number of important votes on Sunday. While, meanwhile, Greece's president says the country will hold a second 
 
 parliamentary vote on June 25th following an inconclusive election earlier this month.  
 
The ruling New Democratic Party fell just short of an outright majority in the May 21st contest. New Democracy wants to secure that majority, and none 
 
 of the countries' other parties were able to put a coalition together. Well, U.S. President Biden and the Republican House Speaker have a deal to 
 
 avoid a government default.  
 
Now they have to convince lawmakers on Capitol Hill they didn't compromise too much. Progressives on the left and hard-line Republicans are both 
 
 unhappy with this final deal. So Mr. Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are counting on the political middle to pass the measure. The deadline to 
 
 avoid a potentially catastrophic default is now June 5th. 
 
I want to bring in our congressional correspondent Lauren Fox. And Lauren, no doubt, there are still a lot of wrangling going on behind the scenes as 
 
 we prepare for this vote. Just walk us through what we know about the deal and the concessions that have been made here.  
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, this deal raises the debt ceiling for two years through January 1st 2025. It also deals with 
 
 the spending over the next two years, setting caps for how much the federal government can spend on federal programs. There's also some other 
 
 provisions that includes stringent work requirements on some social safety programs like food assistance programs.  
 
But this deal was something that was reached between lawmakers who are going to have to vote for it and are really in the center of their 
 
 respective parties. Already, you are starting to see that Republicans are expected to lose a number of conservative votes that typically they would 
 
 need to pass legislation through the house by a party line vote. That's not the case here.  
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
This is a deal that is really going to be passed because the center of both parties gets together and gets this across the finish line. We expect that 
 
 this vote in the House of Representatives will happen on Wednesday, after that, this goes to the U.S. Senate. There it's going to need 60 votes, and 
 
 the question over in the Senate is whether or not they're going to be able to move quickly enough.
 
Usually, the Senate can move expeditiously if everyone agrees on that process. But any one member can really start to delay this process. And 
 
 already, you're seeing some Republicans like Lindsey Graham arguing that he is going to use every tool in his disposal to try and stop and slow down 
 
 this process. Because he says that the defense spending in this proposal is just not high enough.  
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, so to that point -- I mean, there's still procedural hoops to jump through here. What are the chances of them meeting this tight 
 
 deadline, and if they don't, are we going to see this vote move back? I mean, we heard, I think Chuck Schumer coming out and saying that, that vote 
 
 could move to Friday or even the weekend.  
 
FOX: Yes, I mean, that is really -- when Chuck Schumer is warning about weekend votes, he's really accounting for the fact that any one member can 
 
 really slow this process down in the Senate. In the House of Representatives, the expectation is this vote is going to happen on 
 
 Wednesday, but the Senate is where that process can really start to slow down. 
 
The expectation is they can still meet that Monday, June 5th deadline, but obviously, all eyes are going to be over in the Senate as we wait to see if 
 
 they can pull this together.  
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, it'd be fascinating to watch in a divided house. Lauren, thanks very much. All right, still to come tonight, activists are getting 
 
 ready to challenge one of the world's toughest anti-LGBTQ laws, it was just enacted in Uganda. And living in fear under military occupation, 
 
 Palestinians in Jericho accuse Israel's army of terrorizing the population as it carries out raids targeting militants. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
MACFARLANE: Nigeria officially has a new president. Bola Tinubu was sworn into office earlier today. He won February's election with a promise to 
 
 unite the fractured country, but he faces big challenges. Nigeria has a struggling economy and is grappling with violence and massive crime. Mr. 
 
 Tinubu's election victory is also being legally challenged by the country's opposition.  
 <br>[14:20:00] 
 
Uganda's president has now signed into law one of the toughest anti-LGBTQ laws in the world. It includes the death penalty for quote, "aggravated 
 
 homosexuality", which includes having sex with a minor, having sex while HIV positive and incest. The West is strongly condemning the law and 
 
 threatening to suspend aid over it. CNN's David McKenzie is following the story.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, certainly, this law that was signed by President Museveni is one of the 
 
 most draconian anti-LGBTQ laws in the world. That includes amongst other things, a life sentence for those who are calling the act of homosexuality, 
 
 and crucially, it makes illegal the promotion of homosexuality.  
 
And I'm using the words within that bill, which means that education could be curbed for sexual education. It also asked for people to out those who 
 
 they believe are LGBTQ to the authorities. Now, I've spoken to several activists today in Uganda who fear for their lives at this moment. They 
 
 worry that people will take the law into their own hands.  
 
And there's already been an atmosphere of fear in the lead-up to the signing of the bill. Now, the proponents of the bill say that this is an 
 
 important moment for Uganda. This is a deeply conservative, mostly Christian country, and the man who put his name to the bill had this to 
 
 say. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So if we don't stand our ground as a country, as a people, as a community, then we will completely have succeeded our 
 
 sovereignty and independence as a country.  
 
MCKENZIE: Now, Museveni has already faced a great deal of pressure not to sign the bill, and I'm sure he'll be roundly criticized by western 
 
 governments and potentially face sanctions for this. Uganda is very dependent on support from the European Union and the U.S. for both 
 
 humanitarian aid, and in the U.S. case, military support.  
 
But he has stood firm and says, this law should be put forward and these punishment should be meted out. Now despite the talk of sovereignty, 
 
 there's a growing body of evidence that U.S. groups were certainly involved in helping Ugandan lawmakers push through this law, conservative groups and 
 
 the same is the case in Ghana where a similar law is being proposed. David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg.  
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MACFARLANE: Thanks to David. Now, the recent escalation of violence across the West Bank hasn't spared Jericho. Normally, a quiet time known for its 
 
 biblical significance. CNN's Hadas Gold shows us how life in a Palestinian refugee camp there has dramatically changed this year leaving residents 
 
 living in fear.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The palm-lined road into the Israeli-occupied city of Jericho and the homes in the Aqabat Jabr 
 
 Refugee Camp bear the scars of the night before.  Another Israeli military incursion targeting what the IDF says are militants.  
 
(on camera): Nine Palestinians have been killed so far this year here in the Aqabat Jabr Refugee Camp. And posters like these now line the center, 
 
 and as well as walls and houses around this camp. And while in places like Jenin or Nablus, you might see plenty of these posters of people killed. 
 
 But this is so unusual for this refugee camp that hasn't seen violence like this in decades.  
 
(voice-over): Better known as a tourist destination, Jericho is one of the oldest cities in the world and the lowest below sea level with biblical 
 
 significance, where many wealthy Palestinians also have their weekend villas. It's also home to thousands of Palestinians who live in this 
 
 refugee camp. The Israeli military says militants have risen up in the camp in recent months carrying out shooting attacks against Israelis including 
 
 on that killed American-Israeli Elon Gonales(ph) here in February.  
 
Militant group Hamas has claimed the first five of those killed by Israeli forces this year as its members. There's no indication the other four 
 
 including two teenagers were members of a group. The residents of the camp say they now live in a state of fear. Mahmoud Jamal's(ph) son Hamdan(ph) 
 
 was killed on March 1st during an operation to apprehend those who killed Elon Gonales(ph). 
 
His family says he was shot while he was on his way home from work. What's left behind, a traumatized family and a 10-year-old little sister who has 
 
 grown up faster than she should. 
 
RINAD HAMDAN, SISTER OF MAN KILLED BY ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES (through translator): I don't know what to do when I hear gunshots. I just leave it 
 
 to God. I'm now used to it because the soldiers come to the camp. I feel scared for my brothers, I feel scared for the people around us, but it's 
 
 OK, he died as a martyr. Our God gave Mahmoud(ph) to my mom and took him back. It's a sacrifice for God. 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
GOLD: Jibril Ardar(ph) was 17 when he was killed by Israeli soldiers on May 1st while they carried out arrests.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We were never used to soldiers in the camp. They're now invading the camp every two or three days and 
 
 terrorizing people.  
 
GOLD: He had been imprisoned once before by Israeli authorities. His older brother currently in an Israeli prison as well on secret charges, the 
 
 Israeli prison authority told his family. Jibril's(ph) parents say he heard his cousin had been injured, so he ran out to see what happened when he was 
 
 shut as well. In response to CNN's inquiries, the IDF said both Jibril(ph) and Mahmoud's(ph) cases are quote, "under examination".  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): This allegation is not true. Our children are just kids. When you come to someone with a weapon and want to 
 
 shoot at him, his normal reaction will be throwing a stone. That will not harm the army.  
 
GOLD: Community leader Jamal Ewada shows us around. He says he's never seen the camp like this.  
 
JAMAL EWADA, COMMUNITY LEADER, AQABAT JABR REFUGEE CAMP (through translator): The killing that you are practicing will not bring you any 
 
 security in any way. The killing will create rebels. When you kill someone who has four brothers, one of them will want revenge. The killing will 
 
 bring killing.  
 
GOLD: For weeks, the Israeli military set up check-points, at times imposing a blockade on the entire city of 25,000. For its part, the IDS 
 
 said they set up the roadblocks because of concrete intelligence about an imminent attack, but the ripple effect was huge.  
 
(on camera): Jericho is a major tourist destination, attracting millions of foreign visitors every year into sites like this, Hisham's Palace. But the 
 
 strict Israeli military measures as well as a week's-long blockade, that's cost the city tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue.  
 
(voice-over): Mayor Abdul Karim Sedir said the blockade amounted to collective punishment. If I did everything from waste management to 
 
 farmer's harvest.  
 
MAYOR ABDUL KARIM SEDIR, JERICHO, PALESTINE (through translator): Maybe there was a once passing, it's not the way. They tried to. Of course, I'm 
 
 afraid. If the blockades continue during the next Eid holiday at the end of June, there will be an exodus of investors from Jericho and a large number 
 
 of resistant fighters will be born, which will transfer the city to a different rank.  
 
GOLD: I hope that the city of the moon will soon return as an oasis of calm in the desert. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jericho.

MACFARLANE: Violent clashes have broken out between protesters and NATO peacekeeping soldiers in northern Kosovo. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
(ARTILLERY FIRE) 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MACFARLANE: NATO says 25 of its peacekeepers were hurt in the fighting. NATO troops increased their presence in the region following an uptick in 
 
 tensions between Kosovo and Serbia over the election of an ethnic Albanian mayor. Serbs boycott of those elections in April, and since then, 
 
 protesters try to block the mayor from entering their office. 
 
Tensions often flare between the two countries. Kosovo won independence from Serbia in 2008, however, Serbia still considers Kosovo to be an 
 
 integral part of its territory. All right, still to come tonight, it's a day of remembrance as the U.S. marks Memorial Day. We'll have more on the 
 
 touching tributes next. Plus, it's a kind of magic deal for rock band Queen, as sources say their music catalog could sell for more than $1 
 
 billion. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:32:19]
 
MACFARLANE: Welcome back. Today is Memorial Day in the US and the country is honoring America's fallen soldiers. Earlier, President Joe Biden and 
 
 first lady Jill Biden visited Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Mr. Biden delivered his Memorial Day 
 
 address from the cemetery. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: As it is for so many of you, the pain of loss is with us every day but particularly sharp on Memorial Day. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Today is the day of remembrance, of course, but it's also a day when many Americans celebrate the beginning of summer and that means summer 
 
 travel. 
 
CNN's Pete Muntean is live for us from Reagan airport and joins us now. I believe 42 million Americans on the move this Memorial weekend, Pete. So 
 
 any chaos yet?
 
PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: No big chaos yet, Christina, you know. It is a good thing, especially when you consider the backdrop of all 
 
 the cancellations that we faced here in the U.S. last Memorial Day weekend, 2,700 here in the U.S. It kicked off really meltdown after meltdown. Some 
 
 are long between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Airlines canceled 55,000 flights in total. It is especially good news for all of these passengers 
 
 who are flying right now. 
 
The Transportation Security Administration screened 2.7 million people at airports across the country on Friday. That is the highest number we have 
 
 seen since the depths of the pandemic. In fact, day after day, the numbers are actually bigger than the same day back in 2019. Before the pandemic, 
 
 the cancellations overall have remained relatively low. We've seen about 600 so far in the U.S. since Thursday, when this holiday travel period 
 
 really kicked off, just checked only about 63 nationwide today. And I've been talking to travelers who say all of those meltdowns of last year, 
 
 they're still thinking about them this time around. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is absolutely in the back of my mind, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed when I get home without a hitch. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hope that when I go back on Tuesday, I won't have a problem because I have to get to work. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MUNTEAN: The Federal Aviation Administration here in the U.S. anticipates operating 42,000 flights nationwide today. This is the second wave when 
 
 everybody begins coming home all at once. So far so smooth, Christina. The good news here is that the FAA has not implemented many ground stops or 
 
 delay programs just yet, although there are some issues out in San Francisco because of low clouds there. There could also be some delays 
 
 later on in the New York area, also in Florida and Houston, some major airports. So we'll see as the day develops here, Christina. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes, so far so good. Fingers crossed it stays that way, Pete. I think airlines could do with a break, couldn't they? Thanks so much, Pete. 
 
MUNTEAN: Yes. 
 
MACFARLANE: Now legendary rock band Queen might be about to set a brand new record. Sources are telling CNN the group's full music catalog could sell 
 
 for more than $1 billion, which would make it the highest amount a music catalog has ever sold for. It will include hits like this one. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
QUEEN, BAND: I see a little silhouetto of a man. Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango, thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening 
 
 me, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, figaro magnifico. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MACFARLANE: What a great tune. The discussions apparently well underway for Universal Music Group to buy the catalog from Disney. 
 <br>[14:35:01]
 
Let's bring in CNN Entertainment Reporter Chloe Melas for more. And, Chloe, of course, who does not love Queen? But I mean, one billion is a staggering 
 
 sum. What are the chances they're going to get that?
 
CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: I mean, look, the source that is close to these conversations is telling me that this is a deal that we 
 
 could see close this summer and potentially within the next month. But, again, these are conversations. The ink has not been officially, you know, 
 
 signed here yet. And these discussions are underway. 
 
I spoke to a spokesperson for Disney Music Group who said they have no plans to sell the catalog, but we know that the conversations are underway. 
 
 We have not heard back from Universal just yet. But this would set an all- time record. In 2021, Bruce Springsteen sold his music catalog for $500 million, actually, a little more than that. And that arguably remains the 
 
 highest amount for any music catalog that has been sold. 
 
But you do see that this is a growing trend, whether it's the estate of David Bowie, whether it's Justin Bieber, Sting, so many artists have sold 
 
 their catalogs and why? Because it's lucrative. It creates generational wealth. And, yes, these stars are already making money. But it really does 
 
 take it to the next level when they're able to sell these catalogs. 
 
Now, I don't know if Queen, if the individual band members that are still alive, or the estate of Freddie Mercury would see any monies exchanged with 
 
 an acquisition since it's Disney potentially selling to universal. But I've reached out to some of the members of the band to find out.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. We tried to reach out as well. But they're not saying anything for the time being it seems. To your point, Chloe, about this 
 
 being a sort of increasing trend, is this also because it is becoming harder with, you know, the advent of online streaming for bands to actually 
 
 make money and this is an obvious way to do it?
 
MELAS: That's a great point. I mean, you saw Jay-Z who started his own streaming platform at one point called Tidal. You saw Taylor Swift, who's 
 
 in the process of rerecording her masters, because hers were sold early on in her career. And so she is trying to make that money back. It is growing 
 
 increasingly difficult for artists to make money off of their work with royalties and with streaming and not really knowing how many downloads. 
 
 It's not the same old days where you can say how many CDs were purchased, right? So it is more difficult. And this is a lucrative next step for 
 
 artists who have really created a name for themselves. 
 
And listen, it has been a big music week with a lot of music news from Celine Dion putting her tour on hold, and then the passing of Tina Turner. 
 
 And obviously this is some happy music news. But this source tells me that these conversations are well underway and that you can see this acquisition 
 
 go through sometime within the next month.
 
MACFARLANE: Well, we will certainly look out for that. For the record, I still really miss my CD collection. I'd kind of rather go back to that, but 
 
 as by the by, Chloe Melas, thank you very much. 
 
All right. Still to come. Why the key to a strong heart could be strong legs, what a new study is telling us. 
 
And later, one of Venice's famous canals turned bright green over the weekend. We'll take a look at the possible reasons.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:41:03]
 
MACFARLANE: Now, in medical news, growing evidence shows that strengthening your leg muscles may be linked with better outcomes after a heart attack. 
 
 So, keep striving to the squats, lunges, and other weight training moves at the gym. That's according to new research presented this month to the 
 
 European Society of Cardiology. 
 
Joining us now is CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard. She spoke with the researchers behind this study. And Jacqueline, these researchers were 
 
 specifically looking at the strength of people's quadriceps. So talk us through what is it about stronger quads that can lead to better outcomes 
 
 with your heart.
 
JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: That's correct. They use the quad muscle as a marker for this study. But we do know that there's this 
 
 connection between your leg muscle strength and your heart. The more you work out those muscles, the more you use your heart. So, there's that 
 
 connection. 
 
But what the researchers did, they specifically looked at more than 900 heart attack patients and they measured their quadricep muscle strength, as 
 
 well as followed them over time to see how their recovery after that heart attack went. And they found that those with low quadricep strength had a 
 
 higher incidence rate of heart failure after their heart attack. A 22.9 incidence rate, those with high muscle strength in their quads had a lower 
 
 incidence rate 10.2. That rate is based on per 1,000 person years. That's a measurement scientists use where they take the number of people in a study, 
 
 multiply it by the number of years they follow that person. 
 
And the researchers say that this shows that those who had high quadricep muscle strength had a 41% lower risk of developing heart failure after 
 
 heart attack. So the takeaway here, Christina, this research really emphasizes the importance of regular exercise, as well as muscle strength 
 
 training, especially during that recovery process after a heart attack. And researchers say, as you age, you tend to lose muscle mass. So, this also 
 
 shows the importance of maintaining muscle strength and older age so that you do have a better recovery after a possible heart attack, Christina.
 
MACFARLANE: It's so fascinating and obviously a compelling reason never to miss leg day. But what are the methods are there to stay healthy after a 
 
 heart attack? Presumably this isn't the only thing.
 
HOWARD: Exactly. It's not the only thing. And the American Heart Association does say that there are five things you can do to really help 
 
 during that recovery process. Number one, of course, take your prescribed medications. Number two, go to your follow up doctor appointments. Number 
 
 three, participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Number four, get support from your loved ones or even join a heart attack survivor support group and then 
 
 number five, manage risk factors. That means eat healthy, exercise, do not smoke. Follow all of those healthy lifestyle things that we do to maintain 
 
 your heart health and, of course, to live a happy life.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. And remember to squat. Jacqueline, thanks very much. 
 
Now the famous Grand Canal in Venice turned green over the weekend but the reason why is still a mystery. Police has collected water samples for 
 
 clues. They're also looking at surveillance video to see if anyone suspicious was around the water. Our CNN's Barbie Nadeau explains. Theories 
 
 range from algae to environmental activists.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Venetians are used to just about anything happening in their beloved Grand Canal. Tourists jumping into it, even 
 
 surfing in it They're used to high water, low water. But on Sunday, they were seeing green. At first, one city official was sure it was another 
 
 episode of climate activism, giving the term Going Green a whole new meaning. None of the groups usually involved to credit. 
 
Instead, the region's President announced on Twitter that authorities believe a tracing agent used in small quantities to find leaks and 
 
 underwater structures somehow got spilled into the water. 
 <br>[14:45:09]
 
He says it isn't dangerous for the canal's flora or fauna, and hopes it doesn't give climate activists any ideas for their next stunt. Officials 
 
 say they don't know how long it will keep the canal system looking like slime. Or exactly how to get rid of it. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.

MACFARLANE: Now giant panda Ya Ya is back in Beijing. The panda returned to the Chinese capital after two decades in the United States. The Beijing Zoo 
 
 says she needs to adjust to her new environment and will not be shown to the public for now. A controversy over Ya Ya's health played out against 
 
 the backdrop of the souring relationship between the U.S. and China. 
 
Well, coming up, you may know the jingle like a good neighbor, State Farm is there, but maybe not if you live in California more on why the insurance 
 
 company is pulling out of the Golden State next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
MACFARLANE: To a dramatic incident now in Northern Carolina where a bus driver and a passenger were injured during a shootout on board a moving 
 
 bus. And before we show the moment that happened, here's some context. In this video, you can see the passenger reportedly asking the driver to let 
 
 him off the bus at a location that wasn't a designated stop. The driver said he needed to wait and the exchange continued for around two minutes. 
 
 Then this happens.
 
The passenger named as Omarri Shariff Tobias drew his gun and they both there exchanged gunfire. The two men are in stable condition and expected 
 
 to recover from their injuries. The driver has been terminated by his employer and Tobias has been charged with assault, among other charges. 
 
 Crazy. 
 
Now the eastern Canadian city of Halifax is under a state of emergency. Look at this dashcam video. You're seeing here one family trying to flee a 
 
 wildfire engulfing parts of Canada. The flames and smoke made it almost impossible to drive. And eventually they come up almost on top of another 
 
 car battling through the same smoke and flames to get to safety. 
 <br>[14:50:03]
 
Dozens of homes were damaged, thousands evacuated from the area and power temporarily disconnected. Well, the fight wildfires had a huge pool of 
 
 smoke over the port city. Strong winds and Tinder dry woods are hampering rescues. 
 
Now, it's the Golden State. And if you've ever visited, you know how expensive it is to be there. But has California become too expensive to 
 
 insure? One major U.S. insurance company, State Farm, thinks so. It's catchy jingle, I'm not going to sing it, but like a good neighbor, State 
 
 Farm is there will no longer apply to its California neighbors. The insurance company has stopped home insurance sales in the state. It cites 
 
 the growing risk of catastrophes like wildfires and skyrocketing construction costs for the decision. California sees an average of more 
 
 than 7,000 wildfires each year. 
 
So Ryan Patel, a senior fellow at Claremont Graduate University joins me now at Ryan. State Farm, I believe, is California's largest home insurer. 
 
 So this is pretty alarming news for residents of California, but it appears the cost of doing business now has just become too high risk.
 
RYAN PATEL YES, SENIOR FELLOW, CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY: And the State Farm probably needs you to sing the jingle a little more often to get this 
 
 news off the table because it is a big, big deal. Because when you think about new homes and State Farm being the leader, this is something that 
 
 they're known for going forward. 
 
And I think part of this decision, I think, it has become the economic complexity of many of these businesses, specifically here in California. As 
 
 you know, I'm based here, it's expensive. State Farm doesn't want that risk anymore, because they don't -- they believe in the short-term, they're 
 
 going to be losing more money. And that's part of the reason mainly why they're stepping out. They don't believe that that risk is worth it for 
 
 them on new sales. 
 
Now, it still went to say existing policyholders still are fine. However, it's a big deal because it could have a ripple effect in how other people 
 
 you look at the state when it comes to insurance. 
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. Are we seeing a domino effect already from this? Are we seeing any other insurers thinking about pulling out in the same way?
 
PATEL: I think we saw AIG last year kind of get out of the business here in the multimillion-dollar perspective of homes. When you think about the 
 
 residential side, you know, we may see specifically, I don't know everyone that will take out like State Farm did of that whole sector, but we can see 
 
 some certain aspects. 
 
It could be commercial property, it could be other aspects where the construction costs are rising. It's just not worth for them to be able to 
 
 be profitable while they're refocusing on the net operating income and State Farm said that at the beginning of the year, looking at the revenues 
 
 last year that they're trying to get it under control. 
 
So you can see businesses taking preventative action, instead of waiting to, you know, they don't mind losing market share. My thought around this, 
 
 Christina, is I think they'll be back eventually once the economic conditions are a little bit more stable. But that's just my thought.
 
MACFARLANE: That's a really interesting thought. Because I mean, the other idea around this is, you know, this is climate change in action. And it's 
 
 clearly businesses who are being impacted first here, in this case, it's to do, you know, with the -- with rising temperatures, while 7,000 wildfires 
 
 in one year, but in other parts of the country, we're also seeing flooding, we're seeing high snowfall. I mean, is this something that we could see out 
 
 in the years to come here playing out across the country, not just in California?
 
PATEL: Yes. I mean, thinking California, in 2021, they had the largest fire, wildfire over one million acres with more than 700 homes. Then you 
 
 look at Florida, for example, with hurricane, especially southeast here in the United States. That has always been hard to, you know, estimate, how 
 
 many hurricanes can you get or how many fires? When I say do I think they'll come back, I think when inflation and construction costs start to 
 
 decrease, you know, then there's some stability. Yes, we'll see a rise, like you said, there -- you can't control how many wildfires but there's on 
 
 the rise. 
 
Some of these companies will charge a premium. Right now, their premium isn't covering that cost. And so that's where we're at right now, is that, 
 
 you know, when there's profit to be had being made these companies, they will come back to be able to do it. But right now, there is a rise of, you 
 
 know, natural disasters that are occurring that doesn't match up with the rising cost of the economic perspective. And so, yes, especially when Think 
 
 about the East Coast and the West Coast of the United States, it's really hard to tell and people don't feel like it's worth it actually for 
 
 businesses. 
 
And unfortunately for the consumer, we, at the end of the day, will have to start shopping and who knows? This actually could hurt State Farm's initial 
 
 business because people may just preventively move somewhere else because they feel like maybe in the future, they will not be providing them 
 
 insurance.
 
MACFARLANE: Yes. I mean, it'd be interesting to see how this affects patterns of behavior among consumers. Ryan, let's hope it doesn't affect 
 
 you personally. Thanks so much for coming on and giving us your thoughts. 
 
PATEL: Thank you. 
 
MACFARLANE: All right. Now, U.S. tennis star Sloane Stephens won her watch on day one at the French Open, straight set, six love, six, four. But part 
 
 of her press conference after the match focused on something sadly ubiquitous across sport, racism.
 <br>[14:55:09]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SLOANE STEPHENS, TENNIS STAR: Obviously, when there's FBI investigations going on with people are saying to you online, it's very serious. And 
 
 obviously, it's been something that I've dealt with my whole career. And I think that, like I said, it's only continuing to get worse and people 
 
 online have the free rein to say and do whatever they want behind fake pages, which is obviously very troublesome. But, yes, it's something that 
 
 I've had to deal with my whole career and something I will continue to deal with, I'm sure, and that's that. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MACFARLANE: Interesting thoughts. Sloane Stephens says if anything, the situation has gotten worse. 
 
Now it's a national holiday in Latvia after the tiny Baltic nation took bronze in the Ice Hockey World Championships. The win came on Sunday, and 
 
 this was the scene earlier today. Massive crowd celebrating in the capital, Riga. That's a huge turnout for Latvia, which has fewer than just two 
 
 million people. They're probably all there. 
 
Canada took gold and Germany silver, but Latvia still beat hockey powerhouse Sweden before topping the United States 4-3 in overtime to take 
 
 third. Goodness me. Latvia co-hosted the tournament with Finland, and its president was in the locker room on Sunday as the party began. Great 
 
 scenes. Latvia is hockey crazy. Many people and players of course compete in the NHL. 
 
Good for Latvia. Thanks for watching. That's it for us tonight. Stay with us. "QUEST" is coming up after the break.
