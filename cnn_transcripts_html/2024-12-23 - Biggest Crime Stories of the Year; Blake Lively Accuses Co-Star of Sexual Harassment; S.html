RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN HOST:  Welcome back. 
 
The man suspected of killing a woman by setting her on fire on a New York City subway car is at NYPD custody this morning. Police say that the man approached the woman, who appeared motionless early Sunday morning, and used a lighter to ignite her clothes, before then leaving the scene. 
 
Gloria Pazmino joins us now. 
 
Gloria, this was obviously a horrific crime discovered by police officers who were conducting a routine patrol at the subway station. What more have you learned? 
 
GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Rahel, two important aspects of the story. 
 
The first is, as you mentioned, just the horrific nature of this crime, extremely graphic and just troubling in nature. We know that police tell us that this man you see on screen is believed to have approached a woman who appeared to be asleep on a train. 
 
This happened early morning in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Sunday, and they say that he approached her and used a lighter to ignite the clothes that she was wearing. She immediately caught fire and was quickly engulfed in flames. 
 
Now, there were patrol officers that were working in that station who saw the smoke and quickly responded, tried to put her out. Unfortunately, she could not be saved. But as they were responding to the scene, the man was actually seen on video sitting down on a bench. 
 
He had been sitting there essentially watching as this woman burned alive. Now, in the hectic first few minutes of their response, he got away, but they captured video and images of him. And so those two images played an extremely critical role in helping police arrest him several hours later. 
 
So, a combination of newly installed technology on the city's subway trains, which provided this image you're seeing now, as well as body- worn cameras that were worn by the officers on the platform that captured an image of his face. Now, as soon as these images went out to the media and social media,
 
 New Yorkers apparently were on the lookout, and they spotted him while he was riding the same train line. He was seen on an F train this time in Midtown Manhattan, very far from the scene. And that's where he was arrested. 
 
Take a listen to police commissioner Jessica Tisch talking about the crime and the arrest yesterday.

JESSICA TISCH, NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER:  Unbeknownst to the officers who responded, the suspect had stayed on the scene and was seated on a bench on the platform just outside the train car. And the body-worn cameras on the responding officers produced a very clear, detailed look at the killer. 
 
After the NYPD disseminated those images, three high-school-age New Yorkers called 911 to say that they recognized the suspect.

PAZMINO:  Now, Rahel, we are still waiting to hear more details about the suspect's identity. We do know that he came from Nicaragua in 2018. We don't know yet more details about his immigration status. 
 
We're also waiting to see what charges he is facing. And we're also waiting to learn more about the victim, Rahel. This is -- has been a very cold couple of days here in New York City. And the subway system is a place where people who are not housed usually take shelter during the very cold temperatures. 
 
Police believe that this woman was asleep inside that train when she was set on fire. So, another aspect of the story to consider, public safety on the transit system, something that's been very much a focus of law enforcement and public officials here in the city -- Rahel.
 
SOLOMON:  Yes, truly disturbing details. 
 
Gloria Pazmino, thank you. 
 
When we come back, the film "It Ends With Us" is now ending in a legal complaint. Why Blake Lively is accusing co-star and director Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and reputational retaliation.
 
You're in the NEWSROOM. We will be right back. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[11:38:57]
 
SOLOMON:  Now to a bombshell accusation from actress Blake Lively.
 
She claims that Justin Baldoni, her co-star in the movie "It Ends With Us" repeatedly sexually harassed her during filming. She also alleges that, when she spoke up, Baldoni then worked with his publicist and others to, in Lively's words, destroy her reputation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JUSTIN BALDONI, ACTOR:  Why haven't I seen you before? 
 
BLAKE LIVELY, ACTRESS:  Mostly because I have never required brain surgery, but also because I don't live here. So --
 
BALDONI:  So, you just broke into my building? 
 
LIVELY:  You have a really nice view. 
 
BALDONI:  I do. What's your name? 
 
LIVELY:  Lily. You? 
 
BALDONI:  Ryle. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SOLOMON:  Let's bring in Elizabeth Wagmeister, who joins us now. 
 
So, Elizabeth, this is a civil rights complaint, not yet an official lawsuit, but she does make some startling allegations here. What more is she saying? 
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.
 
And that clip that we just saw from the movie is maybe one of the only times that you will see these two directly together, because, once the film came out in the promotion during the press tour, they were not photographed together. They didn't do any interviews together.
 <br>[11:40:12]
 
And now we have learned that is because Blake Lively and other cast members on this film refused to appear next to Justin Baldoni, given Blake's allegations that came out over the weekend in this civil rights complaint.
 
So, Blake Lively is alleging that not only was she repeatedly sexually harassed by Justin Baldoni and another male producer on the film; she also says that she was working in an unsafe work environment and that then Justin Baldoni's team led a sophisticated and coordinated campaign behind the scenes to destroy her reputation.
 
And we did see across social media throughout the promotion of this film that there were a lot of negative and negative nasty things said about Blake Lively. Now, among her allegations when it comes to the unsafe work environment that she alleges she was forced to work under, she says that Justin Baldoni and another male producer walked into her trailer numerous times when she was undressed or when she was breast- feeding one of her newborns.
 
She said that some of the kisses during the filming of scenes were prolonged, when they weren't scripted. Things got so bad, Rahel, that there was actually a meeting that was set during production of this film where Blake Lively and her team, they demanded safeguards so that she and her employees would feel safe on this set.
 
Now, Blake Lively, in a statement, here is what she told us over the weekend -- quote -- "I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on the sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted."
 
Now, as you see there, she's saying, I spoke up about this alleged misconduct. Then I was retaliated.
 
And I want to read you a piece directly from this complaint that speaks to that very issue. It says -- quote -- "They manipulated the social conversation to discredit and bury Ms. Lively in retaliation for reporting her concerns about harassing and unsafe conduct during production of the film and in the hopes of deterring Ms. Lively from potentially taking those same concerns public."
 
Well, Justin Baldoni and his team, they are staunchly denying these claims. In fact, they say that Blake's team was planting negative stories about him.
 
I want to read you part of the statement that I obtained from Justin's attorney, Bryan Freedman, who tells me -- quote -- "It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations." They say that this is a desperate attempt to fix her negative reputation.
 
Now, the fallout has been swift, Rahel. Over the weekend, I confirmed with the source, Justin Baldoni, has been dropped from his agency, which, by the way, is the same agency that reps Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds.
 
SOLOMON:  OK.
 
Elizabeth Wagmeister, appreciate the reporting. Thank you.
 
We're going to take a short break, and we will be right back.

CASAREZ (voice-over):  Jennifer and James Crumbley the parents of the Oxford, Michigan, high school shooter, went to trial in early 2024 on involuntary manslaughter charges. 
 
In a first-of-its-kind prosecution, the state alleged the Crumbleys bought their son a gun days before the mass shooting and didn't properly store it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, this gun was gifted. 
 
CASAREZ:  Jennifer then took the stand. 
 
JENNIFER CRUMBLEY, DEFENDANT:  There's a couple of times where Ethan had expressed anxiety over taking tests, but not to a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist or a mental health professional right away, no.

CASAREZ:  The indictment specifically notes surveillance video showing Combs beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura at a hotel in March 2016. Combs apologized after CNN aired that video in May. 
 
SEAN "DIDDY" COMBS, DEFENDANT:  I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.
