<br>[14:00:02]
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: Well, you're watching CNN's special coverage of New Year's Eve across the globe. I'm Becky Anderson in Dubai where the New Year is just an hour away. It is already 2025, of course in much of Asia. And CNN has taken you from the fireworks in Sydney harbor and will be with you all the way to the ball dropping in New York.
 
And Abu Dhabi has a record setting firework plan. They've been launching fireworks every hour leading up to midnight. That is all part of an attempt to set six Guinness World records during the celebrations at the Sheikh Zayed Festival about 45 minutes from where we are here in Dubai. And then in less than an hour when midnight strikes, there will be an hour long presentation of fireworks in the Abu Dhabi Al Wathba desert. You will not want to miss that.
 
Well, back, -- well, back to Dubai where the excitement is also building towards the start of the New Year at the top of the hour. Here joining us now, Malaysian entrepreneur, motivational speaker and businessman Vishen Lakhiani, the CEO, founder, mind behind Mindvalley, which is a global. It's about personal power empire, I mean, it's all about the work that he does, is all about self-improvement. And is co- host of the podcast, the Mindvalley podcast is with us as well, that's Megan Pormer and entrepreneur Sara Al Madani.
 
Thank you all for being here. It's been good to have you for the past hour. You're with me through the next hour or so. You've interviewed, Vishen, so many self-help experts. What are the biggest takeaways that you have got from those discussions?
 
VISHEN LAKHIANI, CEO, MINDVALLEY: So many ideas but I think one of the biggest takeaways is you got to live life on your own terms, right? So many of us feel trapped by the lifestyles and the ideas of our parents, our society. But there's a meme on the internet I love and I think it says this, tradition that you don't like is nothing more than peer pressure from dead people. 
 
Sarah embodies this. You got to question the things that don't fit you. People who tell you, oh, you can't do that. They're simply saying, look at me, my chains are bigger.
 
ANDERSON: There'll be people listening to you who -- they'll be really -- they'll be inspired by what you're saying, but they'll say, listen, it's a tough old world out there. It's chaotic, it's -- it's busy, it's distracting. I just can't find my space, I can't find my own voice. And you'll hear that all the time. It's the reason that many people use your platforms, of course. How do we find our voice in 2025?
 
MEGAN PORMER, HOST, MINDVALLEY PODCAST: Look for a microphone. And by microphone, I mean, look for the closest platform around you, which right now everybody has social media at their disposal. Everybody can have a social media profile and speak their mind. Find your microphone and speak your mind. There is nothing that can stop you right now.
 
You know, back like 20 years ago, all of us had the excuse of oh, you know, there's no microphone, I don't have the freedom to speak my voice. But right now, social media has given that excuse away from us.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, you're right. I mean everybody has a platform. Sorry, you use that platform a lot, what is that one piece of advice that you are going to be throwing onto your social channels and saying, guys, get with the program. Here it is. This is what you need to do in 2025.
 
SARA AL MADANI, ENTREPRENEUR: I mean, look, I was blessed with a platform and I feel like I'm responsible of everything I put on my platform, my social media. And if I'm not giving something worthy, then I'm not worthy of being followed. So I have to add value. And if you want to see the world better, you got to be better. You said, how do I find my voice? It's by disconnecting and going within finding your voice and just taking it out there and be authentic.
 
And us, especially women, we come from generations and generations of silence women. So this throat chakra is open and we're not going to be quiet anymore. I want women to speak up, I want men to speak up, you know, and just speak your truth.
 
ANDERSON: In this hyper connected world, you talk to so many people who are so lonely -- 
 
MADANI: Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: -- so lonely. What do we do about that? What do they do about that?
 
LAKHIANI: Oh my God. Yes.
 
ANDERSON: (Inaudible) -- 
 
LAKHIANI: Loneliness is a real thing. 
 <br>[14:05:91]
 
Yeah, it's a real thing. And loneliness is so bad for your health. I think it's so prevalent right now, social media doesn't make it easier. It's so important to go out there and make an effort. Approach friendship like you approach your fitness routine.
 
Start getting people over for dinner. Join clubs, join societies, but find people that uplift you. Find people that have a positive vibe around them. I make the effort. Every Thursday, I host a dinner party and I invite good people around.
 
ANDERSON: Well, (inaudible) been invited. You and I have known each other -- 
 
LAKHIANI: We're going to start. We are going to start, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: You've been invited by (inaudible).
 
PORMER: Yes -- 
 
ANDERSON: You've been invited, Sara? Excellent (inaudible). I'm in. January. Let me know when -- 
 
LAKHIANI: Done.
 
ANDERSON: Listen, as we move out of 2024, around this region it's been a lot of conflict and a lot of pain. I know so many of us here in this region and around the world are looking for a bit of stability, a bit of peace, I mean, just a sense that we can stand as you and I talked about earlier on shoulder to shoulder, at this point. I mean, for those out there, it's not about making New Year's resolutions, is it? It's about standing shoulder to shoulder.
 
PORMER: It's about finding resolution with one another. It's about understanding that we're all lonely, we're all in conflict within ourselves. We're all in pain. Why don't we just hold hands, regardless of our gender, our religion and our culture and really help each other get through the earth school (ph)?
 
ANDERSON: I'm listening to the tunes behind me. I love this. I love this. I love it. What was your song of 2024?
 
MADANI: My song of 2024? I think it's by Teddy Swim. It's called Lose Control.
 
ANDERSON: Love it.
 
MADANI: I love it. It's nice.
 
ANDERSON: Love it. Love it. Taylor Swift or Sabrina Carpenter.
 
PORMER: Sabrina Carpenter. Because she said, heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another.
 
ANDERSON: I'm not going to ask you that because I'm not sure you know who Sabrina Carpenter is. Do you?
 
LAKHIANI: No. I'm a Carla Bruni fan. Yeah, I'm all about Carla Bruni.
 
ANDERSON: All right, let me ask you this. What's the best movie you saw in 2024?
 
LAKHIANI: That's so easy. Deadpool and Wolverine. So good. Ryan Reynolds is a genius.
 
ANDERSON: Best series, best TV series -- LAKHIANI: The Gentleman by Guy Ritchie.
 
ANDERSON: Nice.
 
LAKHIANI: That was a classic.
 
MADANI: Becky, you don't want to know, because I love horror. My favorite genre is horror movies.
 
ANDERSON: I can't hear you. So I'm just -- 
 
MADANI: Oh, I said my favorite genre -- my favorite genre is horror movies.
 
ANDERSON: Oh, my goodness gracious. That is -- I'm dropping horror movies in 2024. My favorite series this year, Rivals. Absolutely loved it. Did you see that?
 
PORMER: For me, it's The Notebook over and over again -- 
 
MADANI: Oh my God, I love The Notebook.
 
PORMER: -- because I need that unity.
 
MADANI: I love The Notebook.
 
ANDERSON: All right, well, listen, guys, stay with me. We've been cooking up more than just fireworks for you here to ring in the New Year in Dubai. Hattem Mattar, restaurant owner and the world's first Arab pitmaster, is working his magic. And let me tell you, you can't even put these amazing smells into words. Hattem is with us. Can you hear me, Hattem? How's the grilling going over there?
 
HATTEM MATTAR, WORLD'S FIRST ARAB PITMASTER: Okay, so tomahawks are almost done. As you can clearly see, we've spiced them. We've got this wonderful camel stock I'm going to show you, right? 
 
We're going to take this camel stock that we've been making over the same oak fire, right? Watch your camera.
 
Okay and we've got a brush that we're using that consists of rosemary, mint, parsley, coriander, and we use that to glaze the tomahawks, right? Calms down the fire a bit. Look at that cherry color. And basically, because the oak fire is turned into charcoal, you're going to get all of that oak flavor in the tomahawk. We're going to slice that tomahawk over the mandi rice. Take that mandi rice with the tomahawk in one bite. And if you're brave, you can actually eat with your hands.
 
ANDERSON: Wow. Listen, I'm just going to say -- 
 
MATTAR: Right.
 
ANDERSON: -- from the guest sitting with me here, my mate here on the CNN set, you are a legend. He is cooking up a storm. We will get to experience that storm of deliciousness at the top of the next hour because that's barbecue. 
 <br>[14:10:04]
 
Do you have -- have you had a barbecue before?
 
MADANI: Yeah. Yeah -- 
 
ANDERSON: Doesn't matter. (Inaudible)
 
PORMER: My mouth is watering watching this.
 
ANDERSON: We're all going to get to experience this a little later. In just under three hours, one of the world's oldest cities will be saying hello to 2025. My colleague Eleni Giokos is in Athens with a look at the festivities there.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, in a couple of hours from now, in one of the oldest cities in the world, they will be bringing in the New Year. We're of course here in Dubai, but the sky above Athens, Greece will be lit up with fireworks to welcome in 2025. And that's where we find my colleagues, Eleni Giokos. Eleni, what is the mood like there in Athens?
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is incredible. Look, I'm at one of the biggest parties happening in this city and of course it's going to kick off in around an hour's time. You've got music, you've got DJs, and if anyone knows Greece, it's all about partying until the sun comes up.
 
But I have to say, and this is -- I guess the rest of the world gets gifts on Christmas Eve, but Greeks do it differently. And we have someone called Agios Vasileios, St. Basil. And Becky, I have to say I took the liberty of writing to him on behalf of you so you can experience some of the Greek magic. And I believe he dropped off a gift. And I think your team has something ready.
 
ANDERSON: Hello.
 
GIOKOS: And please, once you open it, tell me what it is.
 
ANDERSON: (Inaudible) as if by magic. As if by magic, I get a gift from Eleni. Here we go. Well, it's beautifully wrapped.
 
GIOKOS: Well, it's St. Basil.
 
ANDERSON: Hold on, let me put this down.
 
GIOKOS: Okay, tell me what it is
 
ANDERSON: Eleni, you wrapped it up so well I can't open it.
 
GIOKOS: It was Agios Vasileios, it wasn't me. He clearly likes to make sure that things are, you know, difficult to open.
 
ANDERSON: Okay. Eleni, I'm getting -- 
 
GIOKOS: So this is a really important -- it's a really important ritual, right? It's something really important for us. Everyone opens gifts on New Year's Eve for the New Year. And tell me what you got?
 
ANDERSON: It's an owl.
 
GIOKOS: And I think it's something -- 
 
ANDERSON: That is beautiful. 
 
GIOKOS: It's an owl. Okay -- 
 
ANDERSON: Tell me.
 
GIOKOS: Let me tell you. I'll tell you why you got an owl. Because this is befitting of someone like you, Becky. It represents the goddess Athena. Strategy and wisdom. And the goddess Athena would either have it on her shoulder or hold it in her hand and actually symbolizes the city of Athens. So I'm not surprised you got such a magical gift, frankly, and something you can put in your office to remind you of strategy and wisdom.
 <br>[14:15:04]
 
Now, the other things that we do -- 
 
ANDERSON: Sitting on my shoulder.
 
GIOKOS: -- on New Year's Eve is we have this -- Good. That's why you should carry it. We have something called the vasilopita. This is absolutely magical. Inside there is a coin, and we cut it up and whoever gets the piece with the coin has the best luck in the year.
 
Now, the team in Abu Dhabi will know that I baked a few of these. And we've done this in Abu Dhabi for the UAE team. So this is something else that Greeks do. It's very much part of our culture as well as religion.
 
And frankly, it brings in sort of positive vibes for the New Year. And the other thing is, and I have to say, this is a message to the entire world, whatever you do on New Year's Day sets the tone for the rest of the year and Greeks fundamentally believe this. So be careful how you feel and what you do, because you'll probably be doing it for the rest of 2025. So what are your plans, Becky, for (inaudible) -- 
 
ANDERSON: Well, I hope -- my plans are to get up early with the kids then and not to have a hangover, because I don't want to go into 2025 with a hangover ever.
 
GIOKOS: Oh, there you go. That's a good plan.
 
ANDERSON: It's never a good -- never a good idea. I'll get up early with the kids and I'll, you know, I'll go into 2025 like that. Thank you. Behind you some ice skating -- 
 
GIOKOS: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: -- people are enjoying themselves there. When did they set that up? Is it cold?
 
GIOKOS: Well, they wanted me -- they wanted me to do some ice skating, but I would fall over and embarrass myself on CNN, so decided not to. But there's ice skating. This is actually the Stavros Niarchos Cultural Center. There's always an ice skate rink here, which is fantastic.
 
And we're going to have music. There's going to be incredible DJs and other performances as well. People are going to start arriving. 20,000 people came to this location last year for New Year's Eve celebrations. They're expecting a lot more this year. We're going to have fireworks. It's going to be a big party. And as you can see, it's a very -- it's a very big family affair. And Greeks have come out to enjoy themselves and bring in the New Year with the bang.
 
And then there will also be very first run of the year. So 12 a.m. so as we get in the New Year -- I think 1, 300 people have signed up to run 3km. So that's a good way to bring in the New Year, you know, nice and healthy and with positive vibes. I won't be doing that, though. I'm going to chill.
 
ANDERSON: I was going to -- I was going to ask you, you going to be doing that? Well, for those who are, good luck to them.
 
GIOKOS: Nope, nope.
 
ANDERSON: Fantastic. I know there's traditional dancing that goes alongside some of these traditions -- 
 
GIOKOS: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: -- that you have in Greece. Are you expecting to see some of that tonight where you are?
 
GIOKOS: Yes, we're going to have dancing. There's going to be some incredible things. We also got, you know, lots of carols that people -- I was experiencing this in Athens today. I just went to the store and then I had these kids. Everyone was singing what we call calanda. And then you pay these kids, you know, one or two euros and everyone comes out on the street.
 
And I remember when my parents used to make me do this in South Africa as an immigrant child I was always so embarrassed. But I see people here doing it with such love and I mean, honestly, just enjoying it and not feeling embarrassed. I've now got a different perspective of being Greek and then singing these carols all over the place in public. And it's -- it's amazing, you know -- 
 
ANDERSON: Wonderful.
 
GIOKOS: -- as a foreigner, because I feel like a foreigner here a lot of the time. Seeing it in person and experiencing the true Greek New Year's Eve, I'm telling you, Becky, it's amazing. I'm so lucky to be here.
 
ANDERSON: Wonderful. Well, we're lucky to have you there. And thank you from you --
 
GIOKOS: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: -- and from Greece. I'm going to keep this in the office to keep me company going into 2025 and beyond. Thank you. Eleni Giokos is in Athens.
 
For the busy football calendar, creating stress and potential injuries for many of its stars. CNN's Amanda Davies was in Dubai this week and she spoke to one of Real Madrid's players about what he thinks should be done. Let's do a little bit of soccer for you before we take a very short break.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: You have been very vocal in terms of your criticism playing too many games. What is your solution? What do you want to see happen?
 
THIBAUT COURTOIS, GOALKEEPER, REAL MADRID: I think players will not mind to play nine months nonstop with a proper preparation and load management. If you have two months off in summer, like NBA, if you have two months off and you can rest your body one month and you can train one month, people will be more ready to do nine months fully. When you don't rest, then it's when all the injuries pile up.
 
This year is a Club World Cup. The next year is the World Cup, then the year after is something else. So there's no rest for players. The excuse of you earn a lot of money has to be stopped because it's not always this. You can also earn money with playing 10 games less. I don't think there will be a difference for TV (ph). 
 <br>[14:20:01]
 
Just sometimes, you have to find a better way.
 
DAVIES: Do you think anybody is actually listening to the players?
 
COURTOIS: No, I don't think so.
 
DAVIES: So do you think it will change?
 
COURTOIS: Not at the moment. I think I'm sure like the FIFPRO they're trying to protect the players, definitely. But they obviously association for the players. But I think other government bodies, they don't think about it because -- obviously this new Club World Cup I think is exciting to play. I think it's something that has to exist, but it's just so hard to find the right way into it. I think clubs want to help, but we all follow the rules and follow the calendar we get given, you know.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: And this is Expo City in Dubai. People really beginning to move around, dancing under the Al Wasl Dome and getting ready for the fireworks here and around the UAE some 40 or so minutes from now.
 
I also want to get you to Kenya's capital of Nairobi where the clock will strike midnight in less than two hours. A collective cheer will then fill the air as fireworks light up the night sky there. While it is a festive season, authorities say the use of fireworks that only happen at authorized venues from midnight to 12:30 a.m. local time.
 
Well, CNN'S Victoria Rubadiri will be watching those celebrations unfold. And she joins us now live from Nairobi. What's the mood like there in the city, Victoria?
 
VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN: All right. Becky -- 
 
ANDERSON: All right, well, the technology is letting us down. We'll try and get you back to Nairobi shortly.
 
I want to get you to Rio, to Copacabana beach, where Julia Vargas Jones is standing by. 
 <br>[14:25:04]
 
It's good to see you. What a place to be.
 
JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello.
 
ANDERSON: Superstition aside, Rio holds the most famous New Year's party in Brazil. Just describe the scene.
 
JONES: Yes, it does and -- oh, okay. We got some water here, Becky. Sorry about that. Look, the reason why I am so close to the water right now is because I'm about to do something that most Brazilians will do at one point or another on New Year's Eve, which is to give flowers to the goddess of the sea. Can you come with me? I'm trying to convince my cameraman to get a little wet as well.
 
(Speaking foreign language). This girl's going to help me. You're going to show me (speaking foreign language) how it's done. (Speaking foreign language). One, dois, tres. Good job. (Inaudible) What's your name? (Speaking foreign language). 
 
WOMAN #1: (Inaudible)
 
JONES: (Inaudible). Thank you so much for your help. Happy New Year. Feliz ano novo. This is what this is all about, Becky. This kind of tradition, deep, deep rooted tradition in African religions, actually, that has transpired and has built up Brazilian culture. You know, we were talking the last hour, why is it that we get into these culture crowded spaces to celebrate New Year's? This is what it's about. It's about finding the things that draw us together, right.
 
To spend shoulder to shoulder in this beautiful place, but sharing this culture, this important moment as we say goodbye to 2024 -- oh, my God. Thank you so much. (Speaking foreign language). (Speaking foreign language). Do you want to throw it back again? Okay. I'm not sure she's quite well versed in the tradition yet, but we'll -- we'll get her there. Becky.
 
ANDERSON: I love it. And Julia's wearing white, which is really important there in Brazil.
 
As I am here with our -- our friends here at the Expo in Dubai. You guys have been moving around a little bit. You're (inaudible) -- 
 
PORMER: I know the vibe is just so (inaudible) -- 
 
ANDERSON: What do you think of the music tonight?
 
PORMER: It's just so amazing here -- 
 
MADANI: The music is so good.
 
PORMER: -- the energy, people. Everyone's so happy. I'm feeling it in my bones.
 
ANDERSON: We're going to see -- you're going to meet DJ Brooklyn in a minute. He's not bad. 
 
PORMER: He's really good.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah.
 
MADANI: He's really good.
 
ANDERSON: It's really good to see people moving around. And, you know, this is -- this is such a family affair. You've all bought your families with you tonight, haven't you?
 
PORMER: You know, Becky, I flew in my mother from Los Angeles. He flew with his family. She's here with her son. And here it feels like a big family. We're all a big soul family. And it's time for all of us to recognize that we're all one. And we're here to celebrate this oneness. This year, it's all about you love me and I love you. And you forgive me, and I forgive you.
 
ANDERSON: We all need a Megan in our lives. Listen, we're going to leave you with this. I'm going to take a very short break. You'll be back with us here with just 30 minutes to go until 2025 here in Dubai. See you on the other side of this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:30:46]
 
ANDERSON: All right. Welcome back. This is New Year's Eve waiting to ring in the New Year here in Dubai at Expo City with our friends here, Sara Al Madani, Vishen and Megan. Sara's actually just brought her son. And who's this? What's your name? Hey.
 
MADANI: Maktum (ph), say hi MAN #1: Hi.
 
MADANI: Hi, Maktum (ph). You looking forward to 2025?
 
MADANI: Yes, we're looking forward.
 
MAN #1: Definitely.
 
ANDERSON: How was the festive season?
 
MAN #1: Amazing.
 
ANDERSON: Oh, good for you, Maktum (ph). These are both Dubai residents. Maktum (ph), I think, grew up in Dubai. These two are in and out of Dubai. Wow. It's going to be a fantastic New Year.
 
Amanda Davies, my colleague, has been in Dubai this past week hooking up with a number of footballers. United fans, Man United fans are going to be hoping that the New Year brings an upturn in fortunes after a pretty dismal 2024. That football club, of course, language is in the bottom half of the English Premier League with problems on and off the pitch. So Amanda talked with the former United legend Rio Ferdinand while she was here in Dubai about how the club might turn things around. Have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVIES: What is a realistic target for this season in your opinion? I mean -- 
 
RIO FERDINAND, FORMER DEFENDER, MANCHESTER UNITED: I don't think -- it's weird to say this at Manchester United, but I just don't think we can put targets on things. We're not in a position to do that. We have a lot of rebuilding, not of players individually, of a team, but also of a culture and environment.
 
There are four big components that need to be rebuilt and that's going to take time. So to put then a target above that in terms of position and winning things is just I think that takes away from all of those four things that need building.
 
DAVIES: Do you think there's anything that can be learned from Liverpool when you look at, you know, how smoothly that transition has gone since Jurgen Klopp's departure, which could have gone very horribly wrong the other way, couldn't it?
 
FERDINAND: I think it's a whole different ball game and the way Liverpool have had that transitional period compared to Man United. It is a lot of confusion and noise over this side compared to very seamless, quiet kind of approach.
 
But also don't forget that their squad was a much more stable squad as well. Let's say people who have won at that club have been there for a long time, so they had the components in there that were working, just wasn't maybe working the right way and needed fine tuning.
 
DAVIES: Do you see them as favorites for the Premier League?
 
FERDINAND: I do now, yeah. I didn't before (inaudible) was kicked this season. I thought (inaudible) would win it again. Arsenal would run them close, but I think Liverpool have come out of traps fast. They've got a consistency that no one seems to be matching at the moment, so they're the team to beat.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: All right. You join me away from the CNN set here at Expo City because we've been promising you over this past, what, 90 minutes or so, an absolute culinary delight from the Arab world's first Pitmaster, Mr. Hattem Mattar. We've been following your progress, sir, over the last, like 90 minutes or so. How are you getting on?
 
MATTAR: We're -- we're done. We're done. And I don't mean well done, pun intended. Tomahawks are done. Cooked to 145Fahrenheit. I don't know what that means to my American friends. I don't know what that is in Celsius, but here we go.
 
ANDERSON: Sit down. Show builds my cameraman, get down and have a look at this.
 
MATTAR: So we smoked this over oak, Texas oak to be exact. And if you -- can you see the color on this? ANDERSON: Wow. Yeah, yeah.
 
MATTAR: Is that fantastic?
 
ANDERSON: Looks amazing.
 
MATTAR: So we're going to dress this over the mandi rice that we made with tomato dakkous. We've got a sticky date barbecue sauce for the ribs. And if you're brave. Are you going to eat with your hands with me?
 
ANDERSON: Absolutely. I'm going to eat with my hands. And this is where the Arabic fusion comes in. The rice, the sticky date. Tell me about the rice. Tell our viewers around the world who may not be as familiar with this as you are.
 
MATTAR: There's several versions of this dish in the Arab world. 
 <br>[14:35:02]
 
The Saudis call it Kabsa, the Yemenis call it Mandi, the UAE calls it Machboos. So this is served at the majlis. Usually on Fridays, we all get together. There's a lamb here, and we all eat from the same dish. It's very communal, and if you ask for a spoon, you're the one that has to pick up the bill.
 
ANDERSON: We talked earlier on about how barbecuing is often seen as a sort of western, of times U.S. I mean, you know, Texas, southern states, barbecuing is like -- it's the heart and soul of the cooking. But here, you know, here around this region, food is about getting together. It's about community. It's about communal experience. And that's what barbecuing is all about
 
MATTAR: 100%. Food and the invitation to your house is part of Arab hospitality. In Arabic, we say, (speaking foreign language), which is essentially your neighbor's house before yours. And that's how we treat every meal. If you finish your plate, you'll be served more whether you want to or not, right? Once, twice, three times. And there's no barbecue -- there's no cuisine that does that like barbecue. And there's no way to do it better than to put barbecue over one of our national dishes.
 
ANDERSON: Look at this. What's he putting on here now?
 
MATTAR: So we've got raisins, we've got a mix of nuts. We're going to cover it in parsley. We're going to slice the meat over top, and this is enough for me, you and the crew and maybe half of expo.
 
ANDERSON: Well, we're going to offer it to everybody who's here, of course. Let's just introduce me to your helper here tonight.
 
MATTAR: Dhanmia (ph) is our pitmaster. He's from Bangladesh, learned from scratch, and he's my eyes and ears and my pitmaster when I'm away, he knows everything I know, and I'm super honored that he's part of our team. We've kind of passed the torch to him.
 
ANDERSON: Amazing. Amazing. You enjoying yourself tonight?
 
MAN #2: Yes, ma'am. (Inaudible).
 
ANDERSON: What's the green that you put? This is parsley, is it?
 
MATTAR: Parsley, correct.
 
ANDERSON: Amazing. And these are raisins I can see here -- 
 
MATTAR: Two kinds of raisins -- 
 
ANDRSON: Yeah. These are cashew nuts.
 
MATTAR: Yes.
 
ANDERSON: Wow. Guys, it looks absolutely amazing. You talked about the sticky dates earlier. Tell me about that.
 
MATTAR: The sticky dates -- the sticky date dressing is over these ribs.
 
ANDERSON: Okay? Are you giving us any secrets here? I mean, you're telling us, yeah, there's some sticky date dressing over these ribs, but people are going to be yeah, but what's in his ingredient? What's his super, super secret ingredient?
 
MATTAR: The secret ingredient to barbecue is don't get your wood wrong. If you get your wood wrong, you can't cover that with barbecue sauce. And, I don't know if I should say this, asking for barbecue sauce at a barbecue restaurant is like asking for ketchup at a pizza restaurant. ANDERSON: Yeah, that's never a good idea. I've seen people thrown out
 
 of restaurants asking for tomato ketchup.
 
MATTAR: Now the dates, the cinnamon. We've got cardamom in there, we've got bay leaf. Traditional ingredients that we use for our dishes. But in a barbecue sauce that you would expect on any Texas dinner table.
 
ANDERSON: How good does this look? I've promised our guests tonight and our friends over there by the DJ booth who will be seeing some moments from now that they'll get to experience this with us. And for all of you, wherever you are watching around the world, I'm sorry that you don't actually get to experience this with us, but you'll have a virtual experience. It's almost as good, right?
 
MATTAR: Close, close, close.
 
ANDERSON: Are you still cooking in the garden? You used to cook in your garden in Dubai. That's how you -- because you were an engineer, right?
 
MATTAR: If you can believe it, when we first started, we did a piece with CNN called Feast on Dubai. We were with Michelin star chefs at the time it was Vineet Bhatia and two Gordon Ramsay trained chefs. And I was like the new kid on the block. When CNN called, I was like, are you guys sure you have the right number? And 10 years later, now we're the number one pop up in the country.
 
ANDERSON: It's amazing. Can't wait to celebrate with you at the fireworks in about 20 minutes time.
 
MATTAR: (Inaudible)
 
I'll see you across -- these are the fireworks. Oh, my goodness, look at these. Looks absolutely amazing. We are going to take a very short break, but stay with us folks here at Expo City. We've got an awesome awful lot more to come. We want some -- 20 minutes or so is about -- is it about 20 to the hour at this point? Somebody tell me, 20 minutes? 20 minutes to go. 20 minutes to go until the top of the hour. I will be joined by Laura Coates and Boris Sanchez, my colleagues in Paris and in London today. Stay with us, folks. Back after this.
 
WOMAN #2: New Zealand's are in the future. They're among the first in the world to celebrate the arrival of 2025.
 
CROWD: Three, two, one. Happy New Year.
 <br>[14:40:03]
 
WOMAN #3: Wow. Wow. That is the way to start a new year. Happy New Year, Sydney. What a spectacular bar setting, firework performance.
 
WOMAN #4: It was sparkling, literally. Japan is known for working really hard. They have an intense work culture. But New Year's is always a time when you get to spend it with family, spend it at home eating delicious food. WOMAN #5: Brianna, it was like an 80s teenage dream. And the pyrotechnic master here in Hong Kong delivered tonight. And as you like to point out, and I'm just going to rub it in, I'm already in the future, baby. It is 2025 here in Hong Kong. From the future, I'm wishing you and all our crews a happy new year.
 
MAN #3: You could feel the seat shaking, the ground shaking. That's how impressive these fireworks were. I'm just like letting it all sink in. It's been what a crazy and awesome New Year's Eve.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:45:28]
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: The New Year is almost here. While it's still 2024 in the United States. All across the globe, revelers are winging in 2025.
 
LAURA COATES, CNN HOST: Together, we are doing what only CNN can do, taking you live from time zone to time zone to multiple countries with their own cultures, traditions and fabulous New Year celebrations.
 
SANCHEZ: Wherever you are around the world, throw on your finery (ph) or at least your finest headgear and celebrate alongside some of the world's most iconic musicians.
 
MAN #4: My wish for 2025 is peace and love.
 
SANCHEZ: Celebrity chefs, international superstars, and us, we're making it up as we go.
 
COATES: With appearances from Sting, Morgan Freeman, Shania Twain.
 
SANCHEZ: Al Green, Colin Hay of Men at Work, Adam Devine, Sixpence None the Richer, and the Notre-Dame Choir.
 
COATES: This is a CNN special event.
 
SANCHEZ: New Year's Eve, live.
 
COATES: Welcome everyone in the United States and all around the world. You are in for an awesome show. I'm Laura Coates in London. Cheers from right in front of the London Eye.
 
SANCHEZ: And I'm Boris Sanchez, right on the famous Champs Elysees in Paris and the Arc de Triomphe behind me is lit up like you've never seen it before. We are about to experience a spectacle of sight and sound and light and music with about a million of our closest friends. Something unlike what you will see anywhere else.
 
Laura, I got to be honest with you, I almost didn't make it tonight. I was ill all of yesterday and today. I had a fever, a horrible cough, there was phlegm everywhere. I was fortunate to get a telemedicine appointment with this French doctor, the most French experience you could imagine. He was vaping during the appointment and he asked that in exchange for prescribing me essentially an entire pharmacy worth of drugs. I give him a shout out on the air. So, Dr. Ellie Benahum (ph), wherever you are, sir, happy New Year to you. If you hear me get loopy and what I say doesn't make any sense, I promise you, Laura, I've had not a bit of alcohol tonight. It's purely the meds.
 
COATES: Sure, Boris, purely the meds. I understand. Wink, wink. I'm glad you're with us today -- 
 
SANCHEZ: I promise.
 
COATES: -- and my God, I'm so glad -- 
 
SANCHEZ: No, I promise.
 
COATES: -- you're able to make it. And for everyone out there, first of all, anyone wonder why I'm the one in London and I have the beret on and Boris does not? I'm just saying, I'm not going to throw shade, but it does look pretty good. I mean, what do you guys think? Here we are in front of this magical place, the London Eye is behind me.
 
I did not intentionally coordinate. I intentionally coordinated. I called London. I was like, listen, I'm wearing (inaudible) -- 
 
SANCHEZ: You definitely intentionally coordinated.
 
COATES: Thank you so much. Listen, it's behind me. It's a magical time -- I did. I really did. You know, I did. Listen, Boris, coming up minutes from now, you've got midnight in Dubai. You've got midnight in Abu Dhabi. And if history tells us anything, Boris, Dubai is going to be spectacular.
 
I'm talking about the city that once launched half a million fireworks in a single display, mind you. From the city's top landmarks, including the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, turning the Arabian night into a kaleidoscope of color that could probably be seen from space. We've got CNN's Becky Anderson, who is live from Dubai at the DJ booth. Becky, are you going to spin for us?
 
ANDERSON: Hey, hey. Yes, absolutely. It's me and DJ Brooklyn. We are here at Expo City Dubai. So we've got three sets of fireworks going on from the UAE, top of this hour here at Expo City in Dubai. Twenty minutes down the road at the Burj Khalifa. You're absolutely right. That will be extraordinary.
 
We've also got for our viewers around the world the fireworks from Abu Dhabi tonight, where they are trying to break six Guinness World Records. They will have the longest fireworks display at something like 58 plus minutes from the Al Wathba Desert just outside of Abu Dhabi. 
 <br>[14:50:08]
 
You'll see all of that top of the hour here on CNN. But here at Expo City, DJ Brooklyn's been spinning the tracks for the crowds gathered here who are very much looking forward to seeing the fireworks from underneath the Al Wasl Dome. Here, DJ Brooklyn give it some for New Year.
 
MAN #5: Happy New Year to everybody watching us. I mean, you guys can feel the energy. It's amazing. Everybody's happy. It's a good vibe.
 
ANDERSON: Do what you did just earlier on with me because you said, watch this. You know, I asked him earlier on, have you got your favorite tune? And obviously every DJ has its -- has his favorite tune, which is the tune that gets people going and show them what you did to me earlier on when you actually suddenly got this crowd move.
 
MAN #5: I did. And while you were walking away I played Michael Jackson and you saw the reaction, so it worked.
 
ANDERSON: It's Michael Jackson. He tells me that is the song that gets everybody going wherever he DJs, anywhere in the world. Not necessarily your favorite, right? But it gets the crowds moving.
 
MAN #5: Always, Always. Any -- any song. Any song. As long as you're not playing any slow song for sure. It's like any -- any Michael Jackson party song gets the people on.
 
ANDERSON: How long have you been DJing?
 
MAN #5: 18 years now.
 
ANDERSON: Right. Okay. So you've got enormous amount of music up there in your head. (Inaudible). And let me tell you this, you will know what to do next.
 
MAN #5: I have a hard drive built in right here with -- with all the music. Yeah.
 
ANDERSON: You will know what to do next. Because, Laura, as I understand it, Laura, you're into a bit of R&amp;B? I think I'm right (inaudible).
 
And then Boris (inaudible) -- 
 
COATES: R&amp;B, all of it.
 
ANDERSON: (Inaudible). So he's one of those bad boys -- I am hearing you. Yes.
 
MAN #5: I'll play a song for both of them.
 
ANDERSON: Okay.
 
MAN #5: It goes both ways because -- 
 
ANDERSON: Okay.
 
MAN #5: I'll -- I'll do it. I'll do it in one go. ANDERSON: Okay. He's going to do it in one go. This is for you guys.
 
SANCHEZ: All right.
 
COATES: Okay.
 
MAN #5: Can you guys hear that?
 
ANDERSON: Yeah. Yeah.
 
MAN #5: Cn they hear that?
 
ANDERSON: Can you hear that? Did you hear it?
 
MAN #5: That's for Laura and -- 
 
COATES: I want to hear it. I hear it. Hold on. It's making me move. 
 
ANDERSON: From Miami.
 
COATES: I hear it -- 
 
MAN #5: Boris from Miami. Laura, shout out to you, guys.
 
COATES: I love it.
 
MAN #5: Thank you guys for coming in. I'm having fun -- 
 
COATES: It covers.
 
MAN #5: I'll see you -- 
 
ANDERSON: Masterclass. Before that, you show me what you d
 
MAN #5: (Inaudible) -- 
 
ANDERSON: -- to get these guys moving tonight. I know I said to you, I'm going to get a masterclass. He's like, I don't think you're going to be any good at this. All right, quickly, show me.
 
MAN #5: Let's do it this way. Okay.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah
 
MAN #5: You ready?
 
ANDERSON: Nice. Love it. Happy New Year. Thank you.
 
All right, so we are underneath the Al Wasl Dome here, 70 meters high at 242 projectors on what is the world's largest immersive experience. This is effectively a huge projector. Give it time, Dubai. Look at these crowds gathered here. What I'm doing for you guys is taking you up through the crowds. We're just about 10 or less minutes away from New Year's Eve at this point.
 
This is Dubai. Look at all these faces. Look at the happiness that we see here. What we're doing is we are taking you to a very special party that's going on over here with a very special man because Laura and Boris, I've got here the Arab world's first ever Pitmaster. Now, I know that you guys are Americans, and I know that you think that Americans do barbecue better than anybody else, but that is not true, or at least not necessarily true here in Dubai.
 
As I go through, let me introduce you both to Hattem Mattar and my friends this evening, Megan, the family. Hi, guys. Look at this. Come on in, Charbel (ph), and have a look at this.
 
MATTAR: You asked, we delivered.
 
ANDERSON: Tell Laura and Boris and everybody watching around the world what we have here.
 
MATTAR: So this is an oak smoked tomahawk mandi with sticky smoked ribs and a pure harvest tomato dakkous. That's it. That's what -- that's a mouthful.
 
COATES: Wow.
 
ANDERSON: Where did you learn to cook like this? Hattem. Engineer from Egypt.
 
MATTAR: Emirati. Sorry. Egyptian born, Emirati raised, Texas trains in my backyard and in Bastrop, Texas. Shout out to Southside Market and Brian Bracewell (ph).
 
ANDERSON: How do you fuse barbecue with Arab culture? 
 <br>[14:55:05]
 
What's it all about? We talked about this earlier on, didn't we? It's like barbecue may not be as familiar here as it is to people from the States, but communal eating is really familiar, isn't it?
 
MATTAR: 100%. Barbecue culture belongs everywhere in the UAE this is called -- if you cook this underground, it would be called tanoor, which is essentially the Arabic word for underground barbecue. In Jordan they call it zarb. In Oman, they call it shuwa. So barbecue culture is a huge part of Arab culture and we just added a Texas twist to it.
 
ANDERSON: Hey. Well, we are getting ready to welcome in 2025. Sarah Al Madani is with me. Megan is with me as well. Megan is from the -- she's the co-host of the Mindvalley podcast. All about self- improvement, mind body wellness and all of that good stuff. What's your advice to our viewers for 2025, Megan?
 
PORMER: My advice is that let go of any limiting belief that no longer serve you. Do not believe your limiting belief. This year is about having it all.
 
ANDERSON: It's about having it all, Laura and Boris. Poor Boris hasn't been very well. I hope you get a better start to 2025 than you have had health wise in the back end of 2024, mate. What are your goals for 2025, sweetheart?
 
MADANI: More boundaries, more self-love, more observing, not absorbing. Reciprocation -- 2025 is reciprocation. If you can't give me something, I can't give it to you.
 
ANDERSON: Real Housewives of Dubai. Season two is just finished, we think there will be a season three and when there is a season three, you will see Sarah Al Madani once again hitting your big screens with housewives. What are you looking forward to most in 2025?
 
MATTAR: I'm looking forward to opening our first branch internationally. I'm looking forward to coming back to the States to do more culinary diplomacy. I'm looking forward to you finding this on all of the airlines, all of the hospitality outlets, all of the hotels in the UAE and abroad and for (inaudible) to be household in.
 
ANDERSON: Nice. And what are we leaving behind in 2024? This is Vishen Lakhiani who's from Mindvalley. He's the founder, the CEO of this enormous global empire that is Mindvalley these days. What are you leaving behind in 2024?
 
LAKHIANI: I can't hear a thing.
 
ANDERSON: What are you leaving behind?
 
LAKHIANI: I'm leaving behind a whole slew of bad decisions this year.
 
ANDERSON: You going to share any of those decisions with us?
 
LAKHIANI: Not on CNN, no. My Mistakes are my private matter.
 
ANDERSON: All right, we are getting ready. We got two minutes to go. Two minutes to go. London and Paris before the fireworks. Here, let me just explain what we're going to do here, because we're at Expo City. This is where the Expo was held back in 2021. And this Al Wasl Dome is the sort of centerpiece of what is this remarkable new part of Dubai.
 
So you're going to see the fireworks here. You're also going to see the fireworks at the Burj Khalifa. And they will be impressive, let me tell you. They always are. Always absolutely fantastic. But as I said a little bit earlier on, you also are going to get to experience the desert in Abu Dhabi this year, Al Wathba, where the Sheikh Zayed Festival is being held.
 
And they are hoping to break a whole load of records tonight with fireworks and leisure shows and drone shows. So we're going to see those. You'll see them on your screens just, what, 90 seconds or so from now. This is going to be us ringing in.
 
And what you'll see around this dome here, just moments from now is the countdown clock. And that countdown clock will begin at about 30 seconds to go. And you'll hear the countdown happening in languages from all over the world. Look, there's more than 200 nationalities here in Dubai. And that will be reflected at least in part tonight by a countdown in multiple languages. We'll get to 10. That'll be in English. And that is where I know you will hear this crowd go absolutely wild. In fact, I think they're beginning. You can feel it coming. Feel it coming, guys. They're getting the projections ready to go. As we leave 24 behind you. Say goodbye. Good riddance. Oh, that wasn't bad, but it's going to be better in 25.
 
LAKHIANI: Personal challenges, professional success. Goodbye, 2024. That's it. That's enough.
 
ANDERSON: Excellent. Goodbye to 24.
 
MADANI: Goodbye to 24.
 
PORMER: Welcome, 2025.
 
LAKHIANI: Welcome, 2025.
 
ANDERSON: Here we go. I think we've got the countdown happening now. Have we got it?
