(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Well, it's 03:00 p.m. in Paris where Olympic organizers have postponed the men's triathlon due to poor 
 
 conditions and the same. The city is also bracing for high temperatures and a potential storm. It's 02:00 p.m. here in London, I'm Becky Anderson. This 
 
 is CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
Also happening over the next few hours, right wing Israeli protesters stormed two military bases holding soldiers detained for abuse of 
 
 Palestinian protesters. Venezuelans take to the streets protesting the re- election of Nicolas Maduro was surrounding nations pull diplomatic staff over concerns of unrest.
 
And an historic bipartisan package aimed at protecting children on social media is expected to pass the U.S. Senate today. Well, it's 09:00 a.m. in 
 
 New York, the stock markets there will open about 30 minutes from now and the futures markets at least indicating and mixed open investors in tech 
 
 stocks watching for some earnings reports this week.
 
We will begin this hour in Paris for a day of great Olympic sport but also some disappointment. The world's top male triathletes are waiting at least 
 
 one more day for their big event. Organizers are postponing the men's triathlon until Wednesday due to poor water quality levels in the river 
 
 Seine.
 
Now this comes despite months of work and massive amounts of money to get that river in shape for swimming. In addition to polluted waters, France 
 
 gap grappling with very high temperatures this week and forecasts of more rain. Well joining me now to discuss is CNN's Melissa Bell she is in Paris, 
 
 "World Sports", Amanda Davies is also with us to discuss the competitions that are going ahead today.
 
And they are big standby and let start with Melissa, the men's individual triathlon race and postponed until at least Wednesday perhaps even longer. 
 
 How big a blow is this for Paris, and the Olympic organizers and indeed, athletes.
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the organizers haven't had much luck, Becky, so far with the weather. Let's face it the 
 
 washout on Friday night, all that rain on the 70 which of course had an impact then, on the production levels here in the Seine River it is now 
 
 baking hot.
 
In fact, we've had three days of relatively dry weather even if it is very hot and humid, and that hope organizers will continue to improve the 
 
 pollution levels in the Seine. So, you're quite right this morning, the men were preparing to have the swimming their triathlon begin here in the Seine 
 
 River behind me that had to be postponed.
 
It will now be the men's and the women's that will take place tomorrow morning. In theory what happens is the water will be tested throughout the 
 
 day. And we will hear in the very early hours of tomorrow morning whether there's pollution levels or down at the right level in order that these 
 
 races can take place safety.
 
First, the women's from about 08:00 a.m. than the men's at 10:45. If all goes well, but clearly for the athletes to postpone and the disappointment, 
 
 here's what the -- issue of the Australian delegation had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANNA MEARES, AUSTRALIAN CHEF DE MISSION: We're not quite there yet, in terms of a do athlon we would like to see that triathlon kicking off 
 
 tomorrow and if the weather is expected to be very good today and other 24 hours. It's possible that water conditions can drop and what we have seen 
 
 as the levels can be very, very fluctuate and they can be high one day and drop significantly the next day.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BELL: Now that you asked one reference, Becky, refers to the last course if the water levels never get to the right place in terms of the quality of 
 
 the water and the bacteria levels. One plan would be for the triathlon to become a biathlon. So rather than having a swimming part to it, it would go 
 
 -- it would simply have a run on a bike and then run again.
 
So of course, you huge both of those athletes whose specialty is exactly there. What happens tomorrow is that if all goes well these two events go 
 
 ahead. If not, things get pretty complicated for Paris organizers and for some of these athletes, since what we're expecting tomorrow night are more 
 
 thunderstorms and rain and that could raise the possibility of the triathlon becoming a biathlon, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: That's the contingency. Many people will say that's a different event. But that is of course, the contingency at this point, thank you.
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
Amanda, look, Olympic competitions, mostly go on and what stand out at this point as far as you're concerned, you're with some of the biggest winners 
 
 of late and who is competing later today?
 
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, I'll just briefly say in terms of the triathlon, Becky. I was speaking to Joe Rowsell who won gold on the bike 
 
 with Team GB in London 2012. She was horrified as an athlete, a former athlete at the prospect of being cut to a duathlon. She said, that's just 
 
 not the event.
 
It's not what they trained for it. It would be so ludicrously unfair. But yeah, in terms of today, there is still so much to get excited about 
 
 although there's not much confirmation or compensation is there for the triathletes, but it's all about Simone Biles and Team U.S.A. and in the 
 
 Gymnastics Hall.
 
Of course, this is the chance for redemption really as it's being billed three years on from the twisties hitting in Tokyo she is back in 
 
 competition despite the concerns about the ankle and calf injury that we saw the bandages that she was wearing on Sunday and qualifying rounds she 
 
 is due to compete in all four disciplines are with her teammates.
 
As Team U.S.A. tried to get their hands back on the gold that they lost in Tokyo three years ago to the Russian Federation. They are very much the 
 
 favorites for this event. The team have been doing all they can to really shield Biles from that feeling that it is on her that she is carrying the 
 
 weight of this team.
 
But she says she's ready, she celebrated with the men's equivalent who won their first team gymnastics medal in 16 years last night, they're 
 
 celebrating their success on social media with the hashtag LFG. I won't explain it for reasons you well know but that's what that's her motivation 
 
 heading into today's event.
 
The tennis going on as well. We've got Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in doubles action, but disappointment for Coco Gauff U.S. team flagbearer at 
 
 the opening ceremony, of course, she's had such a spectacular couple of years on the tennis court. She was a runner up here in Paris at the French 
 
 Open in 2022.
 
She has won the doubles here, but there were high hopes that she would make a deep run in the singles competition, but she's just been knocked out in 
 
 the third round by Donna Vekic haven't been five to up and with a set point in the first set. Ultimately, she was being beaten into.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you both. It does look lovely in Paris at the moment. But the Olympics are heating up quite literally. France is 
 
 experiencing quite extreme heat today with temperatures expected to climb to 35 degrees Celsius or some 95 degrees Fahrenheit in addition to the 
 
 heat.
 
As we've been reporting, there is a threat of rain and thunderstorms. Let's find out what's going on. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam joining me now 
 
 from Atlanta. It is hot. It looks lovely, but it's hot. How will this impact both the athletes and the spectators and what is the forecast going 
 
 forward?
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Becky, it's already the hottest day of the year so far in Paris. So, and we're not even quite to that peak heating 
 
 hour just yet, although we're quickly approaching that. It is stifling outside. And yeah, this heat means business. Fortunately, it's a short 
 
 duration heatwave, but let me explain because this will have impacts on both the spectators and the athletes.
 
Right now, the mercury in the thermometers at 34, you factor in the humidity, it feels like 37. The actual temperature could range anywhere 
 
 from 35 to 37 degrees later this afternoon. Again, this is the heat index. So, it's a different value when you factor in the humidity levels but 
 
 anywhere you slice it, it is hot.
 
And that means it's dangerous for not only spectators but also athletes who exert themselves to their body's extremes under these types of conditions. 
 
 So, media France, this is the agency that forecast the weather advises the International Olympic Committee on advancing heat waves and severe weather.
 
They have a level two of four in and around Paris, where the majority of the Olympic venues are taking place, heatwave alerts for today. Why is 
 
 Paris so vulnerable? Well, simply it comes down to the dense urban environment. This amplifies the heat across the City of Paris. That's all 
 
 because of the asphalt, the concrete and the buildings that make up the City of Light, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Good to have you, sir. Thank you. And later this hour, we'll hear from a scientist who is researching how rising temperatures could impact 
 
 the human body so stay with us for that. Well in Venezuela protesters are voicing their anger after Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of 
 
 Sunday's presidential election.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
The vote was marred by accusations of election fraud and disputed by the opposition. Now crowds hit the streets in several cities on Monday as you 
 
 can see here blocking roads and burning cars. Maduro responded saying the government knows how to, quote, defeat those who are violent journalist.
 
Stefano Pozzebon and joins us live from Caracas, Venezuela. What does he mean by that? And what is the very latest on the ground?
 
STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Well, what does it mean, Becky, is that Maduro has been subjected to opposition seems probably even before he took 
 
 power, but definitely seems that he took power in 2013. And we've had cycles of protests in 2014 in 2017, and 2019, to have cover them all.
 
And now we see that people are back onto the streets and Maduro once again, after riding out at least 3 in 10 cycles of violent protests, the 
 
 widespread protest here in Venezuela feels like probably that he can handle these one too. Take a listen just to the language that he used yesterday on 
 
 a televised address to the nation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT: How do you call this democracy, constitution, terrorism. We have told the militants of the United Socialist 
 
 Party of Venezuela, not to fall for provocations, because their goal is by a soldier in the headquarters to clash and have well bloodshed. Now it's 
 
 clear what I was saying that I have avoided a bloodshed in Venezuela.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POZZEBON: He claims to have avoided a bloodshed. He claims that there should have he lost the election on Sunday, there would have been a civil 
 
 war here in Venezuela, just to give you an idea of how tense the situation is in this country. On the other side instead, Becky, the latest is that 
 
 the opposition is staying firm, saying that they feel they've won that election on Sunday.
 
And they have done something that hasn't been the norm in Venezuela over the last 20 years, they created a website that they say will publish the 
 
 results of the voting station ballot papers that have won even as well you don't have that type of transparency and scrutiny.
 
The electoral authority does not release the full audit and the full numbers of station by station of any election and voting center. They just 
 
 released a statement saying that according to the vote that they handle, the whoever won in this case, it was Nicolas Maduro, the opposition instead 
 
 deployed a network of tens of thousands of volunteers to take photos of the voting centers that the ballot papers in every voting center here in the 
 
 country.
 
And they're putting them online on a website for everybody to see there is sort of a race towards transparency, as many countries around the world in 
 
 Europe, in North America, most crucially here in South America are demanding a full release of an audit of the data related to that election, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Stefano, good to have you. Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas. Now a heart-breaking update to a story that we brought you this time, yesterday. 
 
 A third child has died following knife attack in Northern England. Eight other children and two adults were injured. Police have arrested a 17-year-
 
 old boy and say the motive for the attack remains unclear.
 
Now the victims were attending a Taylor Swift themed dance class in the town of Southport, the popstar wrote on her Instagram page that she is 
 
 completely in shock. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz monitoring this show and as we said yesterday, it was the officially the sort of first day of the summer 
 
 holidays for so many children here in the U.K. What's the latest?
 
SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think this is absolutely shocked every family across this country because it's those details that really 
 
 resonate with people here, that it was a mum and baby cause, we have those in every community in every neighborhood in England, don't we?
 
The fact that they were dancing to Taylor Swift songs of course, that's really prompted reaction and now we have this detail just a few hours ago, 
 
 yet another girl has died of her injuries, a 9-year-old girl that makes three victims total all three of them girls 9, 7 and 6 years old.
 
ANDERSON: What happened?
 
ABDELAZIZ: I mean, I think, Becky, that's what's adding to this shock this disbelief this absolute horror is we don't know what happened. All we know 
 
 is a 17-year-old man. What 17-year-old boy rather walked into that studio into that community center and specifically targeted those children 
 
 according to eyewitnesses.
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
And adults were trying to throw their bodies in the way unfortunately of course we now have several of these children still wounded in hospitals, 
 
 some of them fighting for their lives. I do have a statement from Taylor Swift that I want to read you because I think it captures that horror.
 
The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously. And I'm just completely in shock, the loss of life and 
 
 innocence and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families and first responders. These were just little kids at a dance 
 
 class.
 
I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families. As I said, so far, no motivation, and investigation is under way 
 
 he was wielding a knife. As you know, this is a country where guns are not a common thing to have. How do you prevent something like this in the 
 
 future?
 
How do you stop this from happening? And how do you answer those please from families right now, that are saying why? Why did this happen?
 
ANDERSON: Salma on the story, and more as we get it, of course, thank you. Well ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD as the Biden White House calls for U.S. 
 
 Supreme Court reforms. We'll bring you an exclusive look at the High Courts Chief Justice and the recent Trump immunity ruling.
 
And the U.S. Senate is expected to pass a bipartisan bill later today aimed at protecting kids from the dangers of social media. More on that coming 
 
 up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Right now, as U.S. President Joe Biden calls for more Supreme Court reforms, we are taking a behind the scenes look at America's highest 
 
 court. In an exclusive report, CNN looking at our U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts apparently made no attempt to broker a compromise on 
 
 Donald Trump's immunity case.
 
Now you may remember the 6-3 ruling earlier this month did not fully dismiss and indictment charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 
 
 election but it did strip away elements of the case against him. The three liberal High Court justices dissented strongly.
 
It's important to note Roberts has famously admonished Trump back in 2016 that jurists shared their political affiliation once they take the robe. I 
 
 want to bring in CNN's Chief Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic, she wrote this report and joins us live from Washington.
 
In your exclusive report, sources tell you that Chief Justice Roberts didn't try to get the liberal justices on board with the immunity ruling. 
 
 Just explain what's going on here.
 
JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN CHIEF SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Sure. And you were right to point out kind of what his reputation and record had been up to this point. 
 
 He was known as a chief who was looking for compromise between the left and right on these kinds of cases these big important presidential powers 
 
 cases.
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
And certainly, Becky, in the history of Supreme Court rulings on major presidential powers the court under other chief justices has tried to come 
 
 together for unanimous or nearly unanimous rulings. But what I discovered is the day after oral arguments. oral arguments that looked like maybe 
 
 there could have been some fracturing among the justices and they could have broken off in different ways.
 
Some for Former President Donald Trump, some for Special Counsel, Jack Smith, when they went into that private conference, there was not that kind 
 
 of ambiguity and shifting votes. It was a hard and fast 6-3 votes with the Republican appointed conservatives in the majority against the three 
 
 democratic appointed liberals.
 
And, you know, Chief Justice John Roberts, who normally will try to reach out to the left just at least for appearances of, you know, some sort of 
 
 impartiality just was not in the mood for that. And I think it's in part because he just saw this as a case not about Donald Trump, he tried to 
 
 persuade his colleagues and certainly tried to persuade the American public in his opinion, that this was not about Donald Trump.
 
This was about presidents in the future. But it certainly, Becky, gave Donald Trump as one of the dissenting justices said, all he asked for and 
 
 more once that's hard and fast 6-3 split was made. Then the chief just negotiated with his own colleagues on his side with the third Trump 
 
 appointee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, breaking off slightly.
 
But being with him for all the most important parts to give the former president, very broad immunity and protection from criminal prosecution, 
 
 Becky.
 
ANDERSON: You've explained what his position has been in the past. And this suggests then somewhat of a turning point. Is it clear whether this is sort 
 
 of the exception that proves the rule as it were for Roberts, or whether he really has reached a turning point. And if we as what could that mean, for 
 
 America's highest court at this point?
 
BISKUPIC: Right. You know, and I use that phrase in my story. I said he was at a turning point, but I have to say, you know, will, there are questions 
 
 going forward? Think of where he was two years ago from right now, Becky. He was the man in the middle of that -- decision in the middle alone, his 
 
 five more conservative Brethren, then seeming more conservative than he was all wanting to completely reverse Roe v. Wade.
 
And that is what happened. The three liberals were all wanting to, you know, keep precedent as it was, he was looking for something in the middle 
 
 that wouldn't completely get the precedent. He was he lost that case. And the indication from this term, not just in this ruling, Becky, but in 
 
 others is that sort of an attitude of if I can't beat him join him.
 
He definitely moved over to the right. And he definitely kept control of all the most important opinions of this term. So, my question is sort of 
 
 almost like your question going forward? What will the next year's bring for him? He's starting his 20th term, Becky, he's, you know, he's -- but 
 
 he's only 69. Age 69 is quite young for our courts. So, we'll have to see where he goes.
 
ANDERSON: Yeah, and let's remind our viewers who may not be as, you know, understand machinations of America's highest court as well as you do. Of 
 
 course, there are no term limits. This is something that Joe Biden is looking to change, and we've been discussing that this week, but at this 
 
 point, there are no term limits. All right. Thank you for that. really insightful reporting.
 
BISKUPIC: Thank you.
 
ANDERSON: Now, Donald Trump has agreed to sit for an interview with the FBI to offer his view of what was the failed assassination attempt earlier this 
 
 month. This comes as questions remain about the security errors, and missed opportunities to stop Trump's would be assassin while the Secret Service 
 
 says it's adjusting how it approved security plans for all future protected sites and events.
 
That's according to excerpts of congressional testimony which Acting Secret Service Chief Ronald Rowe is expected to deliver in the next hour. Well, in 
 
 the coming hours as well, the U.S. Senate is expected to pass a package aimed at improving children's protection online.
 
This law would require social media platforms to restrict what children see to shield them from viewing potentially harmful or dangerous content. It 
 
 also will limit targeted adverts to minus the measure expected to pass with bipartisan support which is of course in the U.S. a rarity these days.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
Let's bringing CNN's Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox joining us from Washington. I have to say this is one of those stories I know, which will 
 
 tweet the interests of so many of our viewers around the world. You know, it's fascinating to see what's going on in the states on this issue, and 
 
 what might happen elsewhere going forward if this package passes.
 
Just explain how dangerous content will be flagged what dangerous content is expected to be, as it were, and then how it will be restricted from 
 
 minors. How will this work?
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Becky, I mean, this is really a long time coming. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been 
 
 trying to work towards some kind of online protection for troller. And for the last several years, this really brings together really odd bedfellows 
 
 in Congress.
 
You have people like Marsha Blackburn, a very conservative Republican, working with Richard Blumenthal, a very liberal democrat, to chart the 
 
 course here and they have tried repeatedly bringing this bill up over the last couple of years. Finally, they are getting traction.
 
We do expect that this is going to pass in the United States Senate later today. We should know that it has been since 1998. That was the last time 
 
 that Congress actually was able to pass some kind of legislation to protect children online so a very huge step today that the Senate is taking next up 
 
 and of course it will go over to the House of Representatives, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: And we will stay with you on this one more as it comes. Thank you. Well still to come this hour. It's one of life's big questions, can 
 
 money buy happiness? Well, a new study says there may be no limits to your happiness that is if you got a whole load of money.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ANDERSON: Well, ringing the bell today in New York is the National Alliance on Mental Illness in New York City NAMI their members of that organization 
 
 about to rain the trading day.
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
It is half past 9 in New York. And that is the stock markets and investors out of the gates. Today in a rather lovely reception, it has to be said. 
 
 Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in London, where the time is half past 2 in the afternoon. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD.
 
Well, it's an age-old question many have wrestled with. Can money buy happiness? Well, for years popular theory has suggested that people hit a 
 
 so-called happiness plateau. If you had about $100,000 a year any more than that, apparently wouldn't make you really any happier.
 
But according to a new study, making more money is associated with greater happiness. So, CNN's Allison Morrow has been analyzing the new research. 
 
 And she joins me now. Many people watching this might say, yeah, right. You know, you're not telling us anything we didn't already know. But this is 
 
 actually fascinating. You've sort of drilled down on this research. Tell us what have you learned?
 
ALLISON MORROW, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS WRITER: Yeah, I mean, like you said, there's this kind of popular idea that's been, especially in the last 10 
 
 years since the study came out in 2010 or so showing that if you made a comfortable kind of middle-class income, every -- all the money you make on 
 
 top of that was just going to be kind of extra.
 
And your happiness was something that was more fundamental to who you are, it was more spiritual. And you know, it was something you had to work on, 
 
 and money wasn't going to make a big difference. But it turns out some of the methodology behind that wasn't great at measuring happiness at the very 
 
 wealthy end of the spectrum.
 
So, this new report kind of did a more nuanced look at the levels of happiness among the very wealthy, you know, people making 500,000 up to a 
 
 billion dollars. And it turns out like it's a pretty straight line from happiness levels reported by the Uber wealthy, increasing indirect 
 
 proportion to the amount of money and wealth that they had.
 
ANDERSON: Un-fascinated. What did this report mean by happiness?
 
MORROW: It's a life satisfaction. Generally, you know, the Researcher Matt Killingsworth, who's at Wharton, said he took a lot of different data 
 
 samples, you would ask people questions in the moment about who they're with, and how they feel about their lives and what they're doing.
 
And he kind of used that to cross reference, a lot of different data sets about general life satisfaction. And you know, people who are on a yacht 
 
 and not worried about making their car payment or paying for a medical emergency, generally, are much happier with the state of things, which is 
 
 not all that surprising.
 
But it also I think, is important to note that it's not the money. That's the happiness, it's the ability to navigate your life unimpeded and without 
 
 obstacles.
 
ANDERSON: Fascinating. Good to have you. Thank you.
 
MORROW: Thanks.
 
ANDERSON: Well, let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. And a judge in New York has banned the Former 
 
 Head of the National Rifle Association from holding a paid position with the group for a decade. A jury found that Wayne LaPierre and another deputy 
 
 liable for misspending millions of NRA dollars on personal expenses.
 
The judge ordered LaPierre to repay $4.4 million to the organization. At least 73 people have been killed and dozens are missing after two 
 
 landslides hit the Southern Indian state of Kerala. At least three villages and hundreds of homes have been impacted. According to officials there the 
 
 heavy rains also caused a bridge to collapse leaving hundreds stranded.
 
The U.S. is allocating an additional $500 million in foreign military financing to the Philippines. So announced by the Secretary of State Antony 
 
 Blinken during a visit there on Tuesday. Blinken called it a quote, once in a generation investment to boost security with one of America's oldest 
 
 allies, amid concerns over China. To the Middle East now and chaotic scenes in Israel.
 
What you are looking at here is right wing Israeli protesters breaching two military compounds Monday they are angry over an investigation into several 
 
 IDF soldiers who are accused of substantial abuse of a Palestinian prisoner at a controversial Israeli detention facility.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
Far right members of parliament were among the protesters arguing that the soldiers being investigated for the abuse were being treated unfairly. 
 
 Paula Hancock's following this from Abu Dhabi where she joins us from now. We should explore the details of this. What are these IDF soldiers accused 
 
 of doing?
 
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, the information we have at this point is from the military police Criminal Investigation Division. 
 
 They say that they are formally looking into what they call, quote, suspected substantial abuse of a detainee. And it is at one particular 
 
 detention center in the Negev desert in Israel called Sde Teiman.
 
It's a controversial detention center, which has been the focus of investigations in the past. And we know that it is a detention facility 
 
 where some prisoners from Gaza have been detained and questioned over recent months. Now, there was a CNN investigation back in May.
 
The CNN investigation spoke to a number of Israeli whistle blowers also former Palestinian detainees from that facility and they do describe 
 
 widespread abuse for example blindfolding extreme physical restraint and prolonged handcuffing. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister has told the Supreme 
 
 Court that this will no longer be a long-term imprisonment facility.
 
They are changing the nature of this facility following allegations that this is an ongoing investigation. We understand that the Israeli military 
 
 saying that they are investigating a number of Israeli soldiers. Now what we have seen from these videos is that far right elements of Israeli 
 
 society of the Israeli political scene as well do not appreciate that investigation.
 
They are against the probe and we saw one particular far right lawmaker Zvi Sukkot actually breached the perimeter of this detention facility, he 
 
 slipped through the bars outside and went inside the facility. This has been condemned by the Israeli military pointing out that this is a great 
 
 distraction at a time when Israel is trying to weigh up options when it comes to Hezbollah on the northern border.
 
So, it also at the same time, Becky, does highlight and show a stark illustration of the divides within the Israeli political lecture on at the 
 
 moment and reminds us all that the prime minister is very much reliant on these more far right elements within his coalition to stay in power, Becky.
 
ANDERSON: Paula Hancocks is on the story, Paula, thank you. Well, ahead on this show what a university professor in Wales has created to highlight the 
 
 dangers of climate change. More on that, is after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
ANDERSON: We talked about extreme weather a lot on this show the high temperatures, say in Paris were part of our top story today for example -- 
 
 says this climate change story affects you and me and our bodies. Well CNN Senior Climate Reporter, Laura Paddison put her body to the test under 
 
 extreme heat and humidity to highlight the dangers of a warming world. Have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LAURA PADDISON, CNN SENIOR CLIMATE WRITER: Everything that's going on with my body made that hard. We're here at the University of South Wales in the 
 
 U.K. And behind me here is an environmental chamber where scientists can control the temperature. And so, they're going to predict the temperature 
 
 up to about 40 degrees Celsius 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
And the whole point of this exercise is to see what impact extreme heat has on my body. This on my head is measuring brain blood flow, here is 
 
 measuring skin temperature on my leg, are going to be looking at cognitive functions like how is my decision making affected by the heat. We need to 
 
 understand what it's going to be like living in a much hotter world.
 
DAMIAN BAILEY, PROFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY &amp; BIOCHEMISTRY AT UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH WALES: OK, Laura, so you're fully instrumented, you're ready for 
 
 action, ready for lift-off.
 
PADDISON: It's 40 degrees now 20 percent humidity, and I can really feel it starting to sweats on faces getting very hot, my skin temperature has gone 
 
 up by a couple of degrees.
 
BAILEY: It's a really good job here.
 
PADDISON: It's 40 degrees Celsius close 85 percent humidity and the differences are 10. So, it's like a sauna in -- This is really, really 
 
 tough, like hand stand a bit shaky, everything feels tiring, even breathing. It feels weird.
 
BAILEY: Great job. Mission accomplished. So, it's not easy. Now you've got a markedly depressed increase in exercise induced blood flow to the brain. 
 
 It's gone from 600 milliliters per minute to 400.
 
PADDISON: That's really significant.
 
BAILEY: Which is huge. You're not getting enough fuel into the brain, you're not burning enough fuel, to be able to make the right decisions, you 
 
 would make potentially wrong decisions, rash decisions, and a much larger increase in pressure during exercise. So, your heart is working a lot, lot 
 
 harder, probably about 30 percent harder, just because of that increase in temperature and humidity.
 
All the patients, you know this is a big deal for them. And they wouldn't be able to do the simplest tasks even stand up to get out of a chair from a 
 
 cardiovascular perspective that would just be too demanding.
 
PADDISON: What we're seeing now around the world is this really humid heat that is pushing places to the limits of survivability we're seeing stronger 
 
 heat waves more humid weather, and the impacts on the body are pretty overwhelming.

ANDERSON: CNN Senior Climate Writer Laura Paddison reporting for us. So, we are back with some "World Sport" for you. The very latest from the Olympics 
 
 is after this. I'm back top of the hour with the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD, do stay with us.
