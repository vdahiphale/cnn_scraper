(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I am Rosemary Church. Just ahead on "CNN Newsroom" -- 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GLORIA SWEET-LOVE, PRESIDENT, TENNESSEE STATE CONFERENCE NAACP:  The blood of black America is on your hands, so stand up and do something. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  -- for police reform in the U.S. This follows outrage over the harrowing video we saw of police beating Tyre Nichols to death. Why many say change begins at the federal level. 
 
Three weeks after a first grader allegedly shot his teacher, students from one Virginia elementary school will finally return to the classroom. We will look at what's been changed. 
 
And the U.S. Secretary of State arrives in the Middle East amid rising tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. 
 
And we begin this hour with the beating death of Tyre Nichols and efforts to prevent police brutality in the future. On Sunday, the Nichols' family attorney told CNN he hopes this will become a watershed moment in the push for criminal justice reform. Hours after video was made public showing Nichols'0 ruthless beating at the hands of Memphis police, officials shut down the specialized SCORPION unit. All five former officers who have been charged in Nichols' death where members of that unit. The local district attorney discussed the timing of the charges and the videos released.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE MULROY, SHELBY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  We knew that the
 
 longer the video was delayed, the more unrest and suspicion about the process there would be. So, the video needed to be released soon. But at the same time, we also knew that releasing the video without an announcement of charges could itself be provocative and incendiary.
 
And so, the best solution was to expedite the investigation and to investigate -- expedite the consideration of charges so that the charges could come first and then the release of the video. And I think that proved to have been a fruitful sequence of events because, as we were seeing, there has been demonstrations, there has been reaction to the video which is certainly shocking, but they've been peaceful. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  And during a news conference in Memphis Sunday night, the president of the Tennessee chapter of the NAACP said congressional action on police reform is needed. CNN's Isabel Rosales has more. 
 
ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  What we heard from the NAACP in Tennessee, the president applauding the Memphis police chief for firing those officers involved in the beating of Tyre Nichols and for doing so within 20 days, not waiting months to a year to do that. 
 
Also, she applauded the D.A. for charging those officers involved. And, finally, demonstrators who took to the streets peacefully around the U.S., that president saying, quote, "We've shown the world how you do it." Here's what else she had to say. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SWEET-LOVE:  We come to call to action for Congress about failing to craft and pass bills that stop police brutality. You are writing another black man's obituary. The blood of black America is on your hands. So, stand up and do something. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROSALES:  Family attorney and civil rights attorney, Ben Crump, saying that the work is far from over. That, reform needs to happen on a national scale. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BEN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY:  Well, in our community, we say this is the blueprint going forward. Whether the officers are black or white, we expect to see swift action and swift gestures even if it's a white police officer that abuse us.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
ROSALES:  And back in Memphis, the official GoFundMe for Tyre Nichols' mother and father, for the family, have crossed over the million- dollar mark since those videos were released on Friday. Those donations will go towards helping out his parents, specifically, with their mental health services and for taking time off of work. 
 
Also, written within that GoFundMe is that they hope to use the money to build a memorial skate park. We know that Tyre was showing love with skating and sunsets. Isabel Rosales, CNN, Atlanta. 
 <br>[02:04:57]
 
CHURCH:  Tyre Nichols' death is renewing focus in Washington on criminal justice reform and in particular on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Among its provision, it proposes a ban on racial and religious profiling by law enforcement along with certain police procedures and it overhauls what's known as qualified immunity. This protects police officers from being sued in civil court. 
 
The bill passed the Democratic-controlled House in 2021, but not the evenly split Senate. The Senate majority whip says it's time to return to negotiations.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL):  Senator Booker, chairman of the Crime Subcommittee has been working on this for years and I think he and Senator Scott should sit down again quickly to see if we can revive that effort. But that in and of itself is not enough. We need a national conversation about policing and a responsible, constitutional, and humane way. 
 
REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  What strikes me is just the lack of respect for human life, so I don't know that any law, any training, any reform is going to change, you know, this man was handcuffed, they continued to beat him. 
 
I don't think these five guys represent the vast, vast majority of law enforcement, but I don't know if there's anything you can do to stop the kind of evil that we saw in that video. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are also calling for a return to negotiations and requesting a meeting with President Joe Biden to discuss the issue. 
 
Joe Ested is a former Richmond, Virginia police officer and author of "Police Brutality Matters." He joins me now from Atlanta. We do appreciate you talking with us. 
 
JOE ESTED, FORMER RICHMOND, VIRGINIA POLICE OFFICER:  Thank you for having me. 
 
CHURCH:  So, the United States and indeed the world are shocked and horrified by the brutality of this deadly attack on Tyre Nichols at the hands of five police officers. The footage released Friday night reigniting this debate over police brutality and of course the need for police reform to prevent this from happening again. 
 
And while those five Memphis police officers involved in the attack have been charged with second degree murder and their specialized unit shut down, what more needs to be done do you think to send a clear message that another black man dying at the hands of police will not be tolerated? 
 
ESTED:  We definitely need legislation. There are a few elements that I noticed being a police officer and coming from the community that is most affected for the black community. For one I noticed that officers are immune from civil (inaudible). There've been times where an officer with the, you know, a subject will be handcuffed and then the officer will actually start giving (inaudible) and they obviously stop and officer will tell me, what do you care about? Let the city cut the check.
 
And I noticed that was pretty common. I have an older brother-in-law enforcement, he was there seven years before me, I have other family that was in law enforcement, and they would say the same things. So, we need to start not throwing the payout on the taxpayers back. That's pretty (inaudible) as well. That's one. 
 
CHURCH:  And why do you think that we keep seeing this happen again and again in this country? 
 
ESTED:  Historically, culturally, law enforcement, the way that police are through force and intimidation. We need to change that mindset. And because officers allow to do that historically and the police department hasn't held them accountable, they are able to get away with that. Treating guys like after they (inaudible) it's very common and been around for centuries. 
 
So, hands down, that definitely needs to change. We need a task force for the DOJ that is combined with federal and state legislation that will investigate all police shootings and police use of force complaints. You know, you can't have the police department investigate itself, that's too much of a conflict. I mean, when I work with guys who transferred to internal affairs, now these guys are assigned to actually investigate my misconduct? It just shouldn't happen. 
 
CHURCH:  So, what was the culture of this specialized police unit that was responsible for this brutal and deadly attack on Tyre Nichols and what should happen to the Memphis police chief who, just a day before that unit was dismantled, defended it by saying the unit did good work? 
 
ESTED:  Now, don't get me wrong. The unit -- what it's designed to do if it's done correctly, it does do good work. I -- when I left patrol, I went to a specialized unit, the anti-crime unit. These guys are targeting the most violent individuals on the street. So, you got to have is normally with aggressive officers. You're going after drug dealers. You're going after robbers, murderers, killers. 
 <br>[02:09:56]
 
It's a well-needed unit to combat crime, but it needs more oversight and it definitely, definitely needs supervision because when I was a part of it, you rarely seen a supervisor. So, the guys in the unit pretty much have free reign to do what they want. 
 
So, if you have some bad apples within that unit, they are going to abuse the freedoms, they're going to abuse not being held accountable, no supervision. It does really good work but like anything, if you have the wrong personnel in that particular unit, you're going to have instances like this. 
 
CHURCH:  And what about those people at the scene of the attack and its aftermath, where we saw no one intervene or offer assistance to Tyre Nichols. What should happen to those people failing to act? How should they be held accountable, do you think? 
 
ESTED:  They -- a hundred percent they should be held accountable. Officers are out there to protect and serve a community, and that protection doesn't stop when you see the officer now as a criminal. They should be held accountable, but what we need to do is we need to give officers -- because I work with officers a lot because I was one that always intervened, always put officers over individuals. They say, what are you doing, he's in cuffs? 
 
A lot of other officers didn't do that because the police department provided no protection for officers who comes forward. There is no form of retaliation when officers speak out, so you have a huge problem where officers wanting to speak out, but they get retaliated against. When I started speaking out, I started to get sent on calls an assignment with no backup. 
 
So, they sent a strong message. I was told like, you need to start keeping your mouth closed if you want some help out here, because the same people I am trying to protect, the same people now I have to police and sometimes it can get -- it can get a little crazy on the streets. You're going to need backup. So, if you're talking against these guys, these are the same guys that will leave you out to dry when you need them. So, you've got to have protection for the officers who come out and speak or the whistleblower. 
 
CHURCH:  Joe Ested, thank you so much for joining us and talking with us. 
 
ESTED:  Thank you. Appreciate it. 
 
CHURCH:  In the coming hours, students attending Richneck Elementary School in Virginia will be back in classes for the first time since a six-year-old allegedly shot a teacher more than three weeks ago. A new administrator on assignment at the school told parents in an e-mail, to expect a police presence. 
 
It comes after staffing changes following the shooting. Teacher Abby Swerner is still recovering after being released from the hospital. The school system maybe implementing new safety changes, but some parents feel it's not enough. CNN's Polo Sandoval has more now from New York. 
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A spokesperson for the school system in Newport News, Virginia confirms for CNN that the principal at Richneck Elementary School, which is where that shooting took place just over three weeks ago, will be re-assigned to another position within the school district. 
 
She is now the third school system employee to be removed from or to step down from their post since January 6th when a sixth grader on campus shot and wounded his teacher. On Wednesday, you'll recall the school board actually voted to cut ties with the superintendent of the entire school system. 
 
There's also the assistant principal at Richneck Elementary that resigned on their own. The attorney representing the injured teacher maintaining that school administrators were warned three times the day of the shooting that the child was armed with a firearm, but the attorney maintaining that they failed to act. She even plans to file a lawsuit against the school system. 
 
Now, the school district not commenting because of the ongoing investigation. But ahead of the first day of classes since that shooting parents and students and staff so in a tough situation as many of them have to decide whether or not to return to school on Monday. 
 
Michelle Brown is one of the parents who we had an opportunity to speak to, her son a third grader on that campus at Richneck it. She says she needs to feel reassured, that those who she believes to be responsible are being held accountable. And also, that school officials are doing everything they can to keep her son safe, to keep this from happening again. 
 
Now, the school responding, trying to reassure parents, saying that they will be installing metal detectors at all of their elementary schools. They are also considering requiring only transparent backpacks on campus. But some parents saying that is still too little too late. They want a restructuring of the school system and the administrators in general and for them to take a hard look at the procedures and the policies in place. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.
 
CHURCH:  More than 15 million people are under wind chill warnings with the possibility of significant ice storms from central Texas to central Illinois. The National Weather Service in Fort Worth, Texas is asking people to avoid travel on Tuesday. They say this system could produce freezing rain and sleet for a prolonged period as cold arctic air and wind chills remain in place across the northern and central plains. 
 <br>[02:15:03]
 
And still to come, America's top diplomat continues his high-profile trip to the Middle East. He is meeting with Israel's prime minister in the coming hours. What they are expected to discuss, that's next. 
 
And later, a missile strikes a residential building in northeast Ukraine. We'll have the latest ahead. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  International security is high on the agenda as the U.S. Secretary of State begins the second day of his Middle East trip. This hour, Antony Blinken is scheduled to hold talks in Egypt with the nation's president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. After that, the secretary will head to Israel for the first time since the new right-wing government took power. He is expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and later with the Israeli foreign minister and president. 
 
Blinken's trip comes as Israel is taking strict measures to address a wave of violence. CNN's Hadas Gold has details. 
 <br>[02:19:56]
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announcing a series of action in the wake of two shootings in Jerusalem by Palestinians, what Israeli officials call terrorist attacks that left seven dead and five injured. Among those actions are increasing the deployment of the security forces across the country, but especially around Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
 
They have also vowed to demolish the homes of the two attackers. This is a common tactic by Israeli officials that they see as a way to deter future attackers. They also want to expedite and expand the number of guns permits for Israeli civilians. And they also want to revoke the national insurance benefit for the families of those who Israel have accused of terrorism. 
 
And most controversially, they also want to push forward draft legislation that would possibly revoke the Israeli identity cards and residency of those same families who Israel accuses of supporting terrorism or having terrorists in the family. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINIESTER OF ISRAEL (through translation): However, response will be strong, swift and precise. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm them and everyone who assist them. We have already carried out widespread arrests of those who support, assist and incite terrorism. We are deploying forces. We are reinforcing units and we are doing this in various sectors. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLD:  Now, the Palestinian authority has condemned those steps as collective punishment, saying that they will pour oil on the fire in preparation for detonating the entire arena in conflict. Palestinians reporting dozens of cars and shops in the occupied West Bank burned and damaged by groups of Israeli settlers. Seemingly, acts of retribution for the deadly attack. 
 
Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts are underway. The CIA chief, William Burns, meeting with the Palestinian authority, President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Sunday, ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's arrival on Monday to the region. He will first meet with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before heading to the West Bank to meet with Palestinian officials. 
 
While this was preplanned well ahead of the latest round of violence, it now comes with a much greater sense of urgency. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. 
 
CHURCH:  At least one person is dead after a missile struck a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Three other people were injured in the strike. Officials add that residents were evacuated. To the south in Kherson, this city council says at least three people are dead and six injured following Russian shelling.
 
According to local officials, the shelling it a hospital, school playground, and warehouses and damaged buildings in the region. All this as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the situation on the front lines of the war is very tough, including in the city of Bakhmut, which he says is under constant attack from Russia. 
 
And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So, what is the latest on those deadly Russian attacks on Kharkiv in the northeast, and Kherson in the south, and how is President Zelenskyy responding? 
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Rosemary, it was a pretty deadly weekend for Ukrainian civilians and I think these two attacks taken together on Sunday give you a sense of just the broad area that Ukraine is having defend. Kharkiv in the northeast of the country, the second largest city in Ukraine hit, according to the head of the regional state administration by am S300 surface-to- air missile, hitting a residential building. 
 
That is usually an air defense missile, but has been repurposed over the course of the past few months by Russia as an offensive weapon. And then about 500 kilometers or even more or way down in the south in Kherson, more civilian deaths caused they say by Russian shelling hitting civilian infrastructure. 
 
So, all of this continuing the theme that we're seeing of Russia's aerial assault. And in the meantime, of course, we see continued -- the continued heavy battles in the east of Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk region. President Zelenskyy saying this is part of a Russian strategy, essentially, of attrition. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): Russia hopes to drag out the war and exhaust our forces. So, we have to make time our weapon. We have to accelerate developments. We have to speed up the supply and launch of new and necessary military options for Ukraine. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN:  So, make time our weapon, another way of saying that the west needs to do more in terms of supplying Ukraine with ever more sophisticated weaponry and to do it more quickly, having come from the success that he'd seen in terms of those promises of tanks from western allies. 
 
Zelenskyy clearly trying to seize the moment here to push for more, to push for what Ukraine needs to try to get Russia out of the country and not just hold them in place. He talked on Saturday about how ATACMS, the so-called long-range missiles are vital for Ukraine. And we know that fighter jets are also on their wish list.
 
But meanwhile, we are also hearing from Russia today, the deputy foreign minister in an interview with state media saying that while they see these provisions and promises of tanks from the west, negotiations with Ukraine are, in his words, pointless.
 
[02:25:054]
 
They need some justification there for further Russian aggression which of course backs up Zelenskyy's comments. 
 
CHURCH:  All right, thanks to Clare Sebastian. Appreciate that. 
 
Well, former British prime minister, Boris Johnson, says Russian president, Vladimir Putin, once threatened him with a missile. Johnson told the BBC the conversation happened during a phone call before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. The exchange was released as a preview to the BBC documentary, "Putin Versus the West." 
 
And here is how Johnson described it, and I am quoting. "He threatened me at one point and said, you know Boris, I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile it would only take a minute. Or something like that, you know, jolly." Johnson went on to say, "I think that from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate."
 
Neither Mr. Putin nor the Kremlin have publicly commented on that alleged threat. 
 
Still to come, power cuts in South Africa after crippling businesses, especially poultry farmers. We'll have a live report from Johannesburg, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back everyone. In South Africa, power cuts are disrupting the lives of millions of people, especially chicken farmers. Thousands of birds have died as rolling blackouts for up to 12 hours a day have paralyzed major cities and businesses. 
 <br>[02:30:01]
 
A South African Bank estimates the country's GDP could be two percentage points higher if there were no power cuts.
 
For more on this crisis, we want to go to CNN's Dave McKenzie who joins me live from Johannesburg. So, David, what are you learning?
 
DAVE MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a crisis for South African's numbers. There's no way to get around that. Last year Rosemary, more than 200 days in this country saw blackouts of a significant amount up to 10, 12 hours, as you say. The finance minister calls it having a disastrous effect on the economy. But it really goes beyond that, it even threatens food security. And I must warn some viewers that some of them might find these images disturbing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Tens of thousands of dead birds suffocated when the power failed. And surges blew the backup systems. It's the awful impact of a country in crisis.
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): So, when you saw thousands of chickens die like this, what was it like for you?
 
HERMAN DU PREEZ, OWNER, FRANGIPANI FARMS: Glass of cold water in your face. It was so, so bad. It -- I never thought it would happen to me.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Herman Du Preez has struggled for months with up to 10 hours of rolling blackouts a day. He can't hide his anger at the government.
 
PREEZ: I'm not asking them to do me a favor. Really, I don't. I will do my job. I will produce food. I'll wake up early, work on Sundays to produce food for South Africa. I like what I'm doing. Just do your job. You have -- you have one thing to do. Just do it. Just give us power, please.
 
MCKENZIEL: But power is in short supply. The farm that Du Preez and his father built from scratch now runs at a loss during the worst blackouts. He says diesel costs could sink them.
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): The President himself has admitted that corruption, sabotage or lack of skills has caused this issue. Why should this government then be trusted to fix it?
 
VINCENT MAGWENYA, PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA SPOKESPERSON: Well, David, as you know, this problem predates President Ramaphosa's time
 
 in government.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Even the President now acknowledges that decades of mismanagement and breathtaking corruption, crippled state- owned power utility, Eskom, a lack of maintenance, a deep skills deficit and regulatory red tape have all helped cause this crisis.
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): I'm going to repeat the same question, which is why should South Africans trust the government that caused this problem to fix this problem?
 
MAGWENYA: We accept those mistakes. I've said it and the President has said it numerous times that there were massive, regrettable policy missteps that led us to where we are now. However, now we're focusing on the solution and the opportunities that have been presented by this crisis.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fallen to energy security forward.
 
CROWD: Forward.
 
MCKENZIE: Not everyone is buying it. The official opposition is calling for mass action.
 
MCKENZIE (on camera): You can sense the growing frustration in South Africa already. This crisis isn't just inconvenient for people. It can kill the dreams of a better future.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): A better future is what Thando Makhubu and his family strive for.
 
THANDO MAKHUBU, OWNER, SOWETO CREAMERY: Are you proud of your son?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I am. But we used to fight a lot.
 
MAKHUBU: OK. That's caramel canyon.
 
MCKENZIE (voice over): Tanto turned a small government COVID grant into the Soweto Creamery. It's a huge hit here, thanks to the whole Makhubu family. But when the power goes out, their profits evaporate.
 
MAKHUBU: So now, I'm about to turn on the generator.
 
MCKENZIE: Their plans to expand put on hold.
 
What do you want the government to do?
 
MAKHUBU: I want the government to be brutally honest with us. If they are able to fix it, please fix it. If they can't, we must -- let us know. And it makes us feel that we are not really in a democracy. Because it's meant to be -- for the people, by the people. But it seems as if for them by them, you know.
 
MCKENZIE: At the very least, Thano and all South Africans just desperately want the lights to be turned back on.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
MCKENZIE: Well, even look at Thando and Herman story, Rosemary and you expand it to millions of people across this country, there is a growing sense of despair, I think, because of these ongoing energy issues and bigger protests in fact are plant. The government says it's trying to cut that red tape, encourage independent power producers to get power onto the grid, but this could take years and I think even the stability of this country could be under threat because of it. Rosemary?
 
COMPAGNO: That despair and frustration is totally understandable. David McKenzie, joining us live from Johannesburg. Many thanks for that report.
 <br>[02:35:02]
 
Well, after record rainfall and severe flooding, more heavy rain is coming in northern New Zealand. The details when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Parts of northern New Zealand, including Auckland getting hit with more heavy rainfall over the past several hours. That's on top of these severe rainstorms and extensive flooding that have battered the region since Friday, leaving at least four people dead. Officials don't expect this storm to be as intense but the impact will still be widespread because the ground is already saturated.
 
And the Education Ministry has closed all schools in Auckland until February 7th due to the flooding.
 
Here is CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam with more.
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, if you're familiar with Auckland, New Zealand, you probably recognize this pinnacle and outdoor sports stadium This is Eden Park, the largest of its kind in New Zealand and look at the flooding within the pitch below. incredible amounts of rain have fallen over the past few days but especially last Friday when we saw historic rainfall in downtown Auckland. Let's contextualize this event because it was impressive. It was historic. 
 
On average, during the month of January, Auckland receives about 71 millimeters of rain. Just in a 24-hour period, on Friday the 27th, they received nearly 260 millimeters of rain. I spoke to some of the meteorologists there at the New Zealand MetService and they said they use the word torrential when they receive 40 millimeters of rain in a one-hour period. Some observation sites in Auckland saw over 80 millimeters of rain in just one hour.
 
That will cause rapid rises in rivers. It will cause significant flash flooding like it did. And the potential to isolate communities does exist and unfortunately with more rain in this forecast, the MetService has now issue their highest alert level. That is a red alert. Meaning you need to take action especially north of Auckland, that's where we anticipate the heaviest amounts of rain within the next 48 hours.
 <br>[02:40:11]
 
VAN DAM: Significant flooding, impassable roadways. And with these rapid rises within rivers and impassable roads, we could see some isolated communities because of the heavy rain. They have an equivalent of a landslide here in North America what they call a slip and that is potentially a significant problem considering this is mountainous terrain. So, some of the roads that navigate through this region could see that landslide or mudslide make those roads completely impassable, again, isolated communities.
 
Lots of moisture being pumped in from the tropics to the north. There's a low-pressure system that's going to meander just off the west coast of the North Island and this is going to bring another 100 to 200 millimeters of rain over the next three days in and around Auckland. Prepare yourself for the potential of more flooding. Back to you.
 
CHURCH: Thanks for that. Well, an earthquake in northwestern Iran has left at least three people dead and more than 800 injured. This video shows the moment the 5.9 magnitude quake hit near the Turkish border late Saturday. 70 villages across the region reportedly suffered damages. An emergency official told state T.V. some of the affected areas are also dealing with freezing temperatures, snow and power outages.
 
For our international viewers, World Sport is coming up next. But everyone else do stay with us I'll be back with more news in just a moment.
