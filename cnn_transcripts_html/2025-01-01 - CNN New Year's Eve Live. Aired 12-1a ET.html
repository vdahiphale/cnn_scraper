ENTEN: We are absolutely going the entire way, baby. We're finally going to do it. Four Super Bowl losses. We're finally going to get a Super Bowl win behind MVP Josh Allen. You heard it here first. 
 
CHAMPION: What's the data on that, sir? What's the data? Talk to Sara and I. 
 
ENTEN: Look, there are some times for data. Those are for election nights. But for New Year's Eve, we're throwing the data out the window. 
 
CHAMPION: OK. ENTEN: It's all about the gut. 
 
CHAMPION: OK.
 
ENTEN: And I'm telling you this. The Buffalo Bills are going all the way. Because where would you rather be than right here, right now? 
 
CHAMPION: OK, so we'll roll the tape back on Super Bowl --
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: -- to hold him accountable. 
 
SIDNER: Right. When the Rams win the Super Bowl. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes. OK, yes.
 
SIDNER: I'm just saying.
 
CHAMPION: And by the way --
 
ENTEN: The Bills and Rams can both be in the Super Bowl.

SIDNER: And then hip, hip. CHAMPION: And then it's a little. What are you doing here? 
 
ENTEN: I don't know.
 
CHAMPION: What is that?
 
ENTEN: Doesn't it look like dancing? 
 
CHAMPION: What are you? I don't --
 
SIDNER: Wow. 
 
ENTEN: It's a Jewish New Yorker dance. OK? I'm like Elaine Benes, all right. 
 
SIDNER: You should try out for the U.T. dancers. I mean, they --
 
ENTEN: We're going to -- You're going to see my try-out a little bit later on.

CHAMPION (singing): Can you stand the rain? 
 
SIDNER (singing): Can you stand the rain?
 
ENTEN: I'm going to let you two do that. Thank you. 
 
SIDNER: But that's a sad one. 
 
CHAMPION: OK. SIDNER: We want to do Poison or --
 
CHAMPION: Bell -- 
 
SIDNER: Don't make me --
 
CHAMPION: -- Biv DeVoe. OK. They're still a part of New Year's.
 
SIDNER: Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike, I love you. 
 
CHAMPION: I love a girl. Who cares who you like? OK. 
 
ENTEN: Ooh. Very nice, very nice. 
 
CHAMPION: You got it. 
 
SIDNER: And Sting, by the way.
 
ENTEN: Yes, we've got Sting. We've got -- We've got Sting. We've got New Edition and Sting. And, you know, he's my favorite member of the Police, so I'm very much looking forward to that. 
 
SIDNER: He is the ultimate performer. His music is, like, iconic. You can't -- you can't not like Sting. 
 
CHAMPION: OK. 
 
SIDNER: He's got so many songs. Plus, the Police. I was -- I'm a big fan. 
 
ENTEN: I think I look like him a little bit. 
 
CHAMPION: And --
 
SIDNER: I don't know about that. 
 
ENTEN: Maybe not. 
 
CHAMPION: Sara, you have such an eclectic taste in music. 
 
SIDNER: I do.
 
CHAMPION: You love country. 
 
SIDNER: I do.
 
CHAMPION: You love -- You love pop. You love hip hop. You love it all. 
 
SIDNER: I do.
 
CHAMPION: So, we're going to -- we're going to defer to her for all music tonight. 
 
But I do want to point out to everyone who is here watching you came a day early to do what? 
 
SIDNER: Oh, yes. 
 
CHAMPION: To visit what? 
 
SIDNER: So, Harry was coming, a boy from the Bronx. And I was, like, you need to see what country is like. So, we went out about an hour outside of Austin to the Natural Bridge Wildlife Ranch. 
 
ENTEN: Oh.
 
SIDNER: There we are in the car. And I said, Harry, you've got to do this with me. 
 
ENTEN: Well, what I want to point out, though, is you took us on this adventure, and the place supposedly closes at 4 p.m. We did not learn that it closed until four, until we were ten minutes out. We looked at the clock, and it was 3:50. We drive up to the gate. It's closed. 
 
SIDNER: And what do I say? 
 
ENTEN: Sara says, I'm going to try it. She goes around the closed gate, says, "What time is it open tomorrow?" 
 
And they say, "Nine a.m." And the guy waits two beats and then goes, "You guys want to come in right now?"
 
SIDNER: "You guys want to come in." 
 <br>[00:35:03]
 
CHAMPION: And you got a time. 
 
ENTEN: There you go. 
 
CHAMPION: I got to point out something really quickly -- 
 
SIDNER: That's me and Harry. 
 
CHAMPION: -- so folks at home can see. This is a longhorn. But I said, Sara. What? What is that that we're looking at? And you said --
 
SIDNER: I said, that's a ram. And there was a buffalo. So, I said the rams versus the buffalo. 
 
CHAMPION: OK, so there was a battle?
 
SIDNER: There was a battle.
 
ENTEN: It's a sign. That is the Super Bowl. The Bills versus the Rams. 
 
CHAMPION: I don't know about that. 
 
ENTEN: It will happen. 
 
CHAMPION: I might -- I might have to disagree. 
 
ENTEN: You know what? Disagree. We'll see where we are in a month. CHAMPION: But don't worry. What do I know? We'll see. What do I know? 
 
SIDNER: All right. I'll tell you what we do know. 
 
CHAMPION: Tell us. 
 
SIDNER: My girl is in the Bahamas at Atlantis Paradise island. She's partying like a royal. 
 
CHAMPION: She gets the best gigs.
 
SIDNER: We should be jealous. 
 
CHAMPION: She gets the best gigs.
 
SIDNER: She does get the best gigs. And she looks hot sauce. Stephanie Elam is there with singer Ellie Gould -- Goulding. And. Oh! Oh, look at that hair and that outfit. 
 
ENTEN: Oh! 
 
SIDNER: Hot. 
 
CHAMPION: You look beautiful. 
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know what? I -- I'm trying to be beautiful like you guys. And I'm also -- happy New Year to you, because we are living in the future. So happy New Year from 2025. 
 
And I want you to know that Ellie Goulding just got off stage and brought everyone into 2025, and she killed it. She was out there singing and jumping and athletic. 
 
How do you do that? How do you hit those notes? How do you do that and stay so active while you're on stage the whole time? 
 
ELLIE GOULDING, SINGER: Honestly, I do a lot of running on the treadmill and singing at the same time. 
 
ELAM: Do you really?
 
GOULDING: I learned that from Beyonce, and I feel like whatever Beyonce does, I do. So, yes, that's how I do it, basically. 
 
ELAM: And so, when you hear everyone start to sing your words back to you, you know, the song that you've written and you're performing, over and over again, what's that like for you? 
 
GOULDING: Oh, it's just -- it never gets old or boring. Every single time, it's a different feeling, you know. And being here, like, the atmosphere is so beautiful, and everyone's in such a good mood.
 
And well, apart from the fight that happened.
 
ELAM: There was a -- there was a fight. 
 
GOULDING: There was a fight for some reason. Everyone was just like feeling this height.
 
ELAM: Your music doesn't make me think I should fight. 
 
GOULDING: No, I don't associate with my music with fighting. But like, since like I was saying to you earlier, like, I'm a boxer and I love to box. I love to sing. And I don't know, maybe there's some kind of weird parallel, but, like, everyone was really pumped. 
 
ELAM: Yes, they were definitely pumped. 
 
Now, you came here from Las Vegas, and you performed in the Sphere. Just, like, in a couple of words, what was that experience like? 
 
GOULDING: Absolutely mind-blowing. It was like, honestly, I couldn't compute it. I couldn't compute it in my head. It's -- I don't know if you've seen -- if anyone's seen what's going on in the Sphere, but Andrea (ph) was playing there, and I have a song with him. And it was myself. Grimes was there, FKA Twigs was there.
 
And to see it like that and to be a part of that, my face -- my big old face on that screen, was like, hard to compute, but it was phenomenal. One of the coolest things that ever happened to me in my whole career. 
 
ELAM: It was -- it looks really cool what you just showed me. 
 
So, this is a New Year for the world, but it's also a new year for you because, well, now, two days ago was your birthday. 
 
GOULDING: Birthday.
 
ELAM: So happy birthday, happy birthday. 
 
GOULDING: I'm like, I'm just going to go with, like, I'm like de- aging. And like, I've been biohacking a lot lately. And like, I feel like I'm now like 35. I'm going to go with 35.
 
ELAM: Thirty-five?
 
GOULDING: From now on, I'm 35. And that's that. 
 
ELAM: And that's where you're going to stand?
 
GOULDING: Exactly. 
 
ELAM: I think as fit as you are, you can decide wherever the heck you want to be. 
 
GOULDING: Exactly.
 
ELAM: So now, what is your -- what is your plan for the new year, for your personal new year? And for 2025? 
 
GOULDING: Well, my new year consists of an album. I have my sixth album coming, and I'm going to be touring that. And I'm going to be doing a bit of acting and, like, doing a little bit of everything. ELAM: Fun.
 
GOULDING: Yes, keeping up with the training. Might do a fight, might do a boxing fight. So, I don't know. Who knows? A lot, a lot.
 
ELAM: And love it like you do. 
 
GOULDING: Yes.
 
ELAM: Ellie Goulding, you were so fun to watch. Thank you. Happy New Year. 
 
GOULDING: Happy New Year to you. 
 
ELAM: I'm so glad to have you here.
 
Sara, Cari and Harry, we have had a ball here on the Bahamas. I mean, you guys are having a ball there, too. I know. But I think -- I think we still win, because we're in the Bahamas.
 
GOULDING: We win.
 
ELAM: We win. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes. No, Stephanie. Stephanie, you have the gig. We're not even going to compete. You have it. We are jealous. But we still love you. 
 
ELAM: She called me by all three syllables. 
 
CHAMPION: We love you. 
 
ELAM: I got it.
 
CHAMPION: We love you. 
 
ELAM: Stephanie. I got it. Stephanie. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes. 
 
ELAM: I love you, too. Happy New Year, guys. 
 
CHAMPION: Stephanie. Happy New Year.
 
SIDNER: Happy New Year to you and Ellie there. Tell Ellie I said, "Hey up, me doc." Happy New Year to you both. This --
 
CHAMPION: We can be in the Bahamas next year. 
 
SIDNER: We could.
 
ENTEN: We could be warmer.
 
SIDNER: But you know what? 
 
ENTEN: It would be warmer. I was expecting warmer down here. I know, you know, in the center part of the country --/
 
CHAMPION: Yes.
 
ENTEN: -- despite the latitude, the longitude plays a little bit against you. But at least it wasn't raining here. We didn't -- you know. 
 
CHAMPION: You know, he looks as if he has a tan, though. Where are you coming from? 
 
ENTEN: I do have -- you know, I did the George Hamilton treatment earlier today, but told them a little bit less.
 
SIDNER: Are you tan?
 
ENTEN: A little bit less. But the bottom line is, you know what? When you're on for New Year's Eve, you got to look good. So --
 
CHAMPION: You have to look your best. 
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
SIDNER: That's what I heard. 
 
ENTEN: I'm competing against you, too. It's not really quite fair to me, but whatever. 
 
SIDNER: Especially this glamazon over here. Like --
 
CHAMPION: Yes. No. 
 
SIDNER: Come on.
 
CHAMPION: I don't have a hat. I'm going to bring my hat in. I just wanted you all to have your moment. And when I bring my hat, I'm going to set it off. 
 
ENTEN: I have to cover up. But I also just wanted to show my Bills fandom, because that's what I always do. 
 <br>[00:40:04]
 
CHAMPION: I will say this. The great thing about being in Austin -- and I know people talk about Austin as if it's the only place where you see South by Southwest -- but this city is so progressive. There's so much fun here. 
 
Last year, Sara and I had such a good opportunity to interview the mayor, talk about all the great things that they wanted to do with the city. They obviously have a huge, huge fan base with Texas, and obviously, they're in the Peach Bowl. Well get to that. Because you talked about the U.T. dancers.
 
But the reason why I like being here, specifically, Harry, is because I can dance better than just about everyone here. And otherwise, I don't have great rhythm. But this is my time. ENTEN: No, I think this is your time. And I mean, the bottom line is
 
 this. They put me next to you to make you look even better. 
 
CHAMPION: Thank you.
 
ENTEN: Because when I dance --
 
CHAMPION: Thank you.
 
ENTEN: -- it's just. I don't even know what it is. You know, it almost looks like a dry heave in some sort of way. 
 
But I love Austin. This is my second time being to Austin. I once gave a political talk back in Austin. But more than that, I was able to get frozen yogurt twice from TCBY, and I couldn't do that back in New York. 
 
So, that's my new Austin thing. 
 
SIDNER: That's his happy place: TCBY. Any frozen yogurt place in any city that Harrys in, that's where you can find him. 
 
CHAMPION: You are best friends in some capacity. 
 
SIDNER: We're close. 
 
ENTEN: We're close.
 
SIDNER: We're close. 
 
ENTEN: She took my mom to see a movie, and I didn't even go. 
 
CHAMPION: Oh, OK. 
 
SIDNER: It is true. 
 
CHAMPION: OK. 
 
SIDNER: It's true. I'm in the family. I'm in the family. 
 
CHAMPION: We're all a band here. 
 
And speaking of bands, one of my favorites, we're going back to the childhood band for me. A performance from the legendary R&amp;B group. You may know them as New Edition. I know them all as my boyfriends when I was a teenager. Here's a look at New Edition's residency at Wynn Las Vegas. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on, y'all, clap your hands.
 
(MUSIC: NEW EDITION, "MR. TELEPHONE MAN") 
 <br>[00:45:07]
 
ENTEN: Thank you, thank you. 
 
SIDNER: OK. 
 
ENTEN: Thank you. 
 
SIDNER: I love that song. We are jamming out, dancing to "Mr. Telephone Man," which was from 1984. Dang. I'm old. 
 
ENTEN: I was not born yet. 
 
SIDNER: Oh, we know, and it hurts my -- my heart. Good night. You're out of here. 
 
Here's the funny part. On the stage, they've got the telephone booth from the streets back in the day when you had to put $0.10, $0.25 in there. And I bet you that half the people that are there --
 
CHAMPION: Are like, "What's that?
 
SIDNER: -- probably are like, "What is that?" 
 
ENTEN: What's a telephone? 
 
CHAMPION: Have you ever used a telephone booth? 
 
ENTEN: No comment. 
 
SIDNER: You've never used --
 
ENTEN: No, of course, I've used a telephone booth. Come on, there's a telephone --
 
CHAMPION: When?
 
ENTEN: Many a times. I used to call 1-800-COLLECT to my mom at baseball camp. 
 
SIDNER: Oh, I thought you said for prison. You were calling her collect. 
 
ENTEN: Look, we're not talking about my past life. It's about the future. We're turning --
 
SIDNER: Gotcha.
 
ENTEN: -- over a new leaf on New Year's. Please, let's not make --
 
CHAMPION: Yes.
 
ENTEN: -- certain references, OK? 
 
SIDNER: I don't want to upset your mother. 
 
ENTEN: That's right. 
 
SIDNER: Of course. CHAMPION: New Edition is amazing. As I said, littered and narrated and
 
 sang most of my childhood. It's great to see them. I think we're going to have them again, are we not? 
 
SIDNER: We are, we are. We're going to hear from them again. 
 
CHAMPION: Did you not enjoy that? It was a moment.
 
SIDNER: I -- I could sit here. We were dancing and singing, all of us. 
 
ENTEN: Yes.
 
SIDNER: We're enjoying ourselves. 
 
CHAMPION: He was --
 
SIDNER: He was moving to it. We were singing the words.
 
ENTEN: I was moving. I wasn't singing. I don't have your voice. 
 
CHAMPION: No one does.
 
ENTEN: That's --
 
CHAMPION: Thank God.
 
ENTEN: That's true. 
 
SIDNER: By the way, if you want to see -- And I don't know why you wouldn't want to see New Edition. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes.
 
SIDNER: They are at the Wynn Las Vegas with new shows this February. 
 
CHAMPION: Got it.
 
SIDNER: So, you can see, you know, Bobby, Ronnie, Ricky and Mike.
 
CHAMPION: Ricky and Mike.
 
SIDNER: See them all. 
 
CHAMPION: I like the girl. Who cares who you like? 
 
SIDNER: Who cares who you like?
 
CHAMPION: OK. 
 
SIDNER: Cool it now. 
 
ENTEN: Road trip, road trip. 
 
CHAMPION (singing): Cool it now.
 
SIDNER: Plus, a chat with Adam DeVine is up ahead and a lot more as we count down the New Year here in the heart of Texas, baby.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHAMPION: Hey everyone, we are about 12 minutes away from New Year's Eve on the West Coast. Thank you for joining us.
 
ENTEN: Central.
 
CHAMPION: We're so excited. Central.
 
ENTEN: Not the West Coast, not the West Coast. Stop trying to jump ahead. 
 
SIDNER: It's OK.
 
CHAMPION: See, he's a data guy. 
 
ENTEN: That's true. 
 
CHAMPION: That's why you're here. 
 
ENTEN: I can drop the numbers for the Bills, but I can't drop them overall. I've got to bring them back.
 
CHAMPION: That's all that matters, guys. I don't know what coast I'm in. Central. Austin, Texas. But --
 
SIDNER: Yes.
 
CHAMPION: -- before we continue to talk about what we see in front of us, which is this delicious barbecue, we're going to send it out to Stephanie Elam with Adam DeVine. 
 
And of course, she's in the Bahamas, as she has told us one too many times.
 
ENTEN: Many times. 
 
SIDNER: Hey, Steph.
 <br>[00:50:00]
 
CHAMPION: Hey, Steph.
 
ELAM: Oh, wait. I lost my dance partner. Oh! 
 
ADAM DEVINE, ACTOR: Here I am. 
 
ELAM: Oh, you guys probably can't hear behind us, but they're playing. "We're sexy and, you know it."
 
DEVINE: Sexy and you know it. 
 
ELAM: So, we had to just, like, break it down. 
 
DEVINE: And here we are. And here we are. We do. We know it. 
 
ELAM: And we might know it today because, as Cari so aptly pointed out, we're in the Bahamas, and it's fun. So, what was hosting like? Getting the crowd hyped and ready to go? 
 
DEVINE: It was easy. They were ready. 
 
ELAM: They were ready. 
 
DEVINE: Lil Jon really kicked it off. 
 
ELAM: Yes.
 
DEVINE: Really ignited them. 
 
ELAM: Yes.
 
DEVINE: Started out with "Shot, shot, shot, shots." And that inspired me. So, here I am. 
 
ELAM: Lots of shots. 
 
DEVINE: And then Ellie Goulding closed it down. Some fights broke out. It was a wild night here in the Bahamas.
 
ELAM: There were fireworks, literally. And I wore fireworks, because I love the fireworks show that's here. 
 
DEVINE: You look great.
 
ELAM: Thank you, thank you. 
 
OK, so you had lots of people in there who know you from so many different things. 
 
DEVINE: Yes. 
 
ELAM: Is that fun for you when they're like -- when they're like, hey, "Modern Family" guy? Or when they're like, hey, "Pitch Perfect" guy? 
 
Because I heard some people saying that.
 
DEVINE: You know, I like that stuff. I -- I like it more when it's just a dad who's just, like, how dare you? I've had to watch that B.S. a thousand times.
 
And I have to go, like "Pitch Perfect"? And they're like, no. And I'm like, "Modern Family"? And they're like, no. And I'm like, "Workaholics"? And they're like, no, that dumb commercial you did. 
 
And I'm like, I'm sorry. 
 
ELAM: That commercial. That's the one.
 
DEVINE: I like to get paid. Sorry. ELAM: A paycheck addiction is a good thing. 
 
DEVINE: Yes.
 
ELAM: It's a good -- it's a good thing.
 
DEVINE: You know, I've got things I have to pay for. 
 
ELAM: But you did have a -- look at this. Look who's here. 
 
DEVINE: Oh! Oh! Attack of the Lil Jon. 
 
ELAM: You never know when a Lil Jon might just show up. 
 
LIL JON, RAPPER AND RECORD PRODUCER: Happy New Year!
 
DEVINE: How -- I'm so bummed that Lil Jon is taller than me. I should -- I should be Miniature Adam. 
 
ELAM: Miniature Adam. 
 
DEVINE: Yes. 
 
ELAM: He's Lil Jon. 
 
LIL JON: Hey, I just want to say happy New Year. 
 
DEVINE: Happy New Year, buddy. 
 
LIL JON: Blessings to you both. And everybody out there. 
 
ELAM: This was so much fun. 
 
LIL JON: Yes.
 
DEVINE: Yes.
 
ELAM: So much fun watching you two have fun. Because I was watching you backstage. And also, just the show you guys put on together. Folks were having a ball. Having a ball? 
 
DEVINE: Yes. If you're saying that there should be a buddy movie in our future. Yes, I think so. 
 
ELAM: Can I make a news cameo as a reporter in it somehow?
 
DEVINE: Sure. All right. Yes. 
 
ELAM: Sounds like fun. Happy New Year.
 
DEVINE: Happy New Year, buddy. 
 
ELAM: Jon of the Little. 
 
LIL JON: Boom. 
 
DEVINE: See you, Jon. 
 
ELAM: See? You just never know what you're going to get here when you're hanging out. 
 
DEVINE: Yes. We're close like that. I just said, "Later, Jon." 
 
ELAM: I just said, "Later, Little." 
 
DEVINE: Yes. 
 
ELAM: Can't you just say, "Later, Little"? I don't think so. 
 
DEVINE: It worked. 
 
ELAM: It didn't work. But no, that's the kind of fun that we have been having here. 
 
It is so great to just see people having a good time, dancing, singing along to so many of the songs. Good time.
 
DEVINE: Were having a blast. 
 
ELAM: So, I will stop talking about how much fun we're having here and send it back to you guys there in Texas. 
 
DEVINE: Yes. Enjoy the cold, nerds. 
 
SIDNER: All right. We are going to be back in just a bit, and we're going to be bringing you something absolutely magnificent from La Barbecue from here in Austin, Texas. From Hello Trouble Hall.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:56:29] 
 
SIDNER: We are back here in Austin, Texas. We are inside Hello Trouble Hall, the only mobile honky-tonk in the world. 
 
CHAMPION: What is a honky-tonk, Sara?
 
SIDNER: Girl, it's where you learn to sing your heart out. And usually, at least in places like Nashville, it's free. 
 
CHAMPION: OK.
 
SIDNER: So, you just go in there, and you can hear Dolly. You can hear Willie. You can hear anybody that -- that -- Earl -- Merle Haggard. 
 
CHAMPION: OK.
 
SIDNER: You know I love country. 
 
CHAMPION: I was going to say, OK, so Sara's giving us her deep knowledge.
 
But we also have to tell people that this is a true -- country music. The one thing I do love about country music, it speaks its truth. Because look at all the signs here.
 
SIDNER: The stories. 
 
CHAMPION: "Hootin' leads to hollerin'." Who doesn't know hootin' leads to hollerin'? 
 
SIDNER: Hello.
 
CHAMPION: I mean, I said that to you just --
 
SIDNER: Harry.
 
CHAMPION: I said that to Harry. 
 
ENTEN: Maybe I --
 
CHAMPION: Hootin' leads to hollerin'.
 
ENTEN: I mean, I did not know that until this evening. You know, I have to say, Kinky Friedman, who of course, passed recently, that's another name that obviously pops in my head. Ran for governor, basically did everything, right? He was a renaissance man, in a way.
 
SIDNER: He was a renaissance man. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes, it's true. 
 
ENTEN: So that, you know, I'm showing my country knowledge a little bit. Right? 
 
SIDNER: I like it, I like it. 
 
CHAMPION: Country music is having a renaissance.
 
SIDNER: It's -- totally a renaissance because of Bey all day. Beyonce.
 
CHAMPION: In many ways.
 
SIDNER: A lot of it.
 
CHAMPION: What doesn't need a renaissance? 
 
SIDNER: Let me tell you what doesn't need a renaissance. Actually, you are a renaissance when it comes to barbecue. No, no, no, she's being shy. 
 
La Barbecue. By the way, how many of you know a barbecue joint --
 
CHAMPION: Joint.
 
SIDNER: -- that is, it has a Michelin star.
 
CHAMPION: Not a one. Not a one. 
 
SIDNER: She did that. Founder of this amazing barbecue joint here in Austin. ALLIE CLEM, LA BARBECUE: Thank you. Thank you. 
 
SIDNER: What have we got here? 
 
CLEM: So, we've got -- I've got a brisket right here I'm going to cut for you guys. Pork ribs, of course. Our chipotle coleslaw, pickled red onions, cucumber, kimchi, house-made pickles. Chipotle -- chipotle sausage. 
 
CHAMPION: The guy from the Bronx can't help it. 
 
SIDNER: No fork. No nothing. 
 
ENTEN: No fork needed. 
 
CLEM: No, no, no. 
 
ENTEN: All about the hands. Let's go. 
 
SIDNER: OK, OK. So, you started, as many businesses do here in Austin when it comes to food, with a truck, correct? 
 
CLEM: Yes. We were a food truck for five years. It was a -- it was a journey, for sure. 
 
But we grew up, thank God. And now we are in a brick-and-mortar, and we will live the rest of our life in this building. 
 
CHAMPION: This is amazing. 
 
CLEM: Yes. 
 
SIDNER: I have to say, like, it's so impressive that you started with the food truck. Food trucks are good, y'all. Like we know this. Right?
 
ENTEN: Oh, yes. 
 
SIDNER: Like, we know this. But the fact that you actually got -- what was it like when you got the Michelin star? Like, how does that even work? I have no idea. 
 
CLEM: You know, it was --
 
CHAMPION: It's a secret, right? Like, you don't know they're coming in to do any of the things to --
 
CLEM: A 100 percent. I mean, I had no idea at all that we would even get it. But it's such an honor to even be a part of that crew, you know? I mean, and -- and to share it with my -- my staff. And that has gotten me here is -- it has just been an incredible journey. 
 
ENTEN: I just want some of that.
 
CLEM: I know. So, I cut -- so I cut these for you guys is what we call money. We call money bites. 
 
SIDNER: I'm taking the money bites. 
 
CLEM: Like --
 
SIDNER: Oh, my God. 
 
CHAMPION: OK, OK. I'm trying --
 
ENTEN: Just stuff it in there. Just put it. 
 
SIDNER: Oh my God. 
 
CLEM: Just do it. Just do it. 
 
SIDNER: It's like butter. It's like, oh.
 
CLEM: You've got this nice fatty brisket on top here. 
 
CHAMPION: It's amazing. 
 
ENTEN: Smells amazing. This is the perfect way to potentially go into the New Year, right? 
 
SIDNER: It's a little bit salty. 
 
CHAMPION: It's a little bit salty. 
 
SIDNER: It's like melt in your mouth. 
 
CHAMPION: Got that pepper. 
 
SIDNER: This guy didn't even bother taking a bite. I just stuffed that whole thing in my mouth. 
 
CHAMPION: Perfect.
 
SIDNER: This is absolutely delicious, and I can't wait to taste the rest of it. Allie Clem, you've outdone yourself.</pre>
