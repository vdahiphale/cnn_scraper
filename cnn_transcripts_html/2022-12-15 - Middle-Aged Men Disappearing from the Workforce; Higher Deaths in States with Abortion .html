DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: My gosh.
 
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: That's what the voters are saying.
 
LEMON: Right? Everyone's like, oh, yes -
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: That's - you're literally echoing the voter sentiment.
 
LEMON: No! Geez. I don't know if I can -
 
COLLINS: Did you participate in this poll?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
COLLINS: Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING.
 
Here's what's coming up in the hour ahead. 
 
We're following news out of Louisiana where a tornado ripped through the state. It left three dead, multiple injured. We'll show you what happened on the ground as the sun is coming up there. 
 
Plus, a new report that says maternal and infant death rates are higher in states that ban or restrict abortion. What the numbers show. 
 
And no longer man of steel. What actor Henry Cavill revealed to his fans and what's behind his decision. 
 
LEMON: Well, there seems to be something missing from the American workforce. We're not talking about Henry Cavill, right. 
 <br>[06:35:00]
 
That is - well, sort of, right? Men - men are missing from the American workforce. New government data shows more men are out, more women are in. Many of them working in fields traditionally dominated by guys. 
 
So, what's behind all of this? Vanessa Yurkevich, what's up? Why are the ladies taking over and the men backing out? Is this a good thing? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: It could
 
 -- yes, it's a good thing, and there's some bad to it. But, overall, during the pandemic, you know, we lost so many jobs, but what happened is both men and women have gained all of the jobs back that they lost during the pandemic. However, we are seeing something very interesting happening with middle-aged men and women. Fewer men in the labor market, more women. 
 
So, what's behind this trend? We set out to find out. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DAVID SHNITZLER, AT-HOME DAD: Good morning, Winston. Let's start the day. 
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): It's a typical day in the Shnitzler household. Seventeen month old Winston is up and parents David and Allison (ph) are getting ready for work. Winston is fed, there's some play, and then the morning good-byes. 
 
ALLISON SHNITZLER: Bye-bye.
 
D. SHNITZLER: Say bye-bye.
 
YURKEVICH: They're off to work.
 
A SHNITZLER: Bye-bye. Have a good day.
 
YURKEVICH: Allison, a family physician, and David, an insurance underwriter, now an at-home dad. 
 
D. SCHNITZLER: Caring for Winston, tending to the house, playing with him, all of that comes first. 
 
YURKEVICH: Last year the Schnitzler's made a significant life change. 
 
D. SCHNITZLER: We made that decision to have me stay home. 
 
YURKEVICH: David quit his job to take care of Winston full time so Allison could continue her career. 
 
D. SCHNITZLER: We're happy with the roles that we're in. It's phenomenal. 
 
YURKEVICH: And in recent months, more men ages 30 to 44 have been dropping out of the workforce according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate for men in that age group is lower than it was pre-pandemic. 
 
RICHARD V. REEVES, SENOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: I don't think it's a secret that many of us rethought our whole work life balance, what were we doing, who's raising the kids, how do we want our family to work? That's a question that a lot of families have been asking themselves.
 
YURKEVICH: And more women in recent months ages 30 to 44 are participating in the labor force and at a higher rate than pre- pandemic according to Labor Department data. And they're moving into more male dominated industries. 
 
REEVES: The fears of a she-cession (ph) turned out largely to be unfounded. Women are returning to the labor market. It's becoming increasingly common to see women, for example, having project management roles or generally management positions within construction. 
 
YURKEVICH: Women like Ava Sedaghat. 
 
AVA SEDAGHAT, PROJECT ENGINEER: I knew I wanted to work in construction management. 
 
YURKEVICH: Sedaghat joined the construction industry two years ago as a project engineer. Today, women make up just 14 percent of the construction industry, but it's the highest on record. 
 
SEDAGHAT: I think it was definitely intimidating. My only knowledge of the construction industry was that it was pretty heavy and male dominated. But the more that I started working in the industry and the more people I came into contact with, I think I realized pretty quickly on that there's a place for everyone in construction. 
 
YURKEVICH (on camera): Do you see the construction industry as where you want to build your career? 
 
SEDAGHAT: Definitely. 
 
YURKEVICH (voice over): Early next year, the Schnitzlers will welcome baby number two, another boy,, but that doesn't mean David is closing the door on rejoining the workforce one day. 
 
D. SCHNITZLER: I won't say that I'm out of the workforce 100 percent, ,you know, retired, what have you, but for the time being we want to give our second infant son the same thing that we gave to our first, and that is a parent who's able to give them 100 percent. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
YURKEVICH: Now, David's reason for leaving the labor force is because he wanted to stay home with his son and take care of him. But that is actually a small percentage of men and why they're leaving the labor force. Economists say that a lot of it have to do with some men are out on disability, there's mental health reasons, incarceration. But just as we've seen in this piece, women stepping into more male- dominated industries, women are leaving female-dominated industries, like teaching and nursing. So, we actually need more men to step into those roles. 
 
The pandemic has changed the way we work, but it's also changed what people are willing to do for work. It's such an interesting time coming out of the pandemic in the labor market right now.
 
LEMON: I think that's good. I think it's good. I mean, listen, barring the mental health issues and all that, right. HARLOW: Yes.
 
YURKEVICH: Yes, of course.
 
LEMON: But I think it's good because it's a reset, right?
 
YURKEVICH: Yes.
 
LEMON: These roles that traditionally you thought were male/female shouldn't have been that way, but that's sort of - that's what it was. It is what it is. There should be more male teachers. Remember, there is a shortage of male teachers.
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: I think it will help with the pay gap, with pay equity, right?
 
HARLOW: Hopefully.
 
LEMON: Women going into roles or - and switching. I think that it will help with that. 
 
But also, Poppy, as you know, I said - I told you Covid had a lot to do with it. But you get to a certain point in life where you say, nah, it's not about the job, you want to be with your family. 
 <br>[06:40:04]
 
And if I, at this point, where I'm, you know, about to get married, if I had kids, I would step back. 
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
LEMON: Yes, I would step back and -
 
HARLOW: And I told him, he was saying this in your piece, and I said, just - you wait until you have kids because it's - it's more fulfilling but harder, in certain ways, but harder to be at home. I have the most respect for what I think is the most underappreciated job in America, which is to be a stay-at-home parent, especially when they're tiny. You, like your sister, has raised twins. It's very, very hard, but - but it is - it is everything. So --
 
YURKEVICH: And David said they both go to work. She goes to his job being a family physician -
 
HARLOW: Yes.
 
COLLINS: And he's doing his.
 
YURKEVICH: And he goes to work to take care of Winston. 
 
HARLOW: And there are studies that show that men that are very involved in their children, which is why paternity leave is so important, from the beginning, changing diapers, doing the same things that mothers often - it falls on them -- are more connected to their child through their whole life. 
 
LEMON: Yes.
 
HARLOW: Through their whole life.
 
LEMON: I need to be able to afford someone to help me change the diapers, though. (INAUDIBLE). 
 
HARLOW: You're fine and you should change your own diapers. 
 
YURKEVICH: You can do it.
 
HARLOW: I don't ever want to hear that again.
 
YURKEVICH: You can do it.
 
HARLOW: That is so nuts.
 
YURKEVICH: You got this. 
 
LEMON: Cleaning up little doggy accidents, that's enough. Changing diapers, I don't know about that. 
 
YURKEVICH: Different ballgame, but you can do it.
 
LEMON: Yes, there's a little vacuum that does the other thing, but not changing diapers.
 
HARLOW: It's not that bad.
 
COLLINS: Vanessa's like, OK, I'm leaving. 
 
YURKEVICH: All right.
 
LEMON: She's like, I'm getting out of here. 
 
COLLINS: She's literally getting out of her chair. 
 
LEMON: Thank - thank you, Vanessa.
 
YURKEVICH: Breaking things as I leave.
 
LEMON: Thank you. That was a good talk. I enjoyed that. 
 
HARLOW: OK. It was good.
 
OK, up next, switching gears here but staying on health and women.
 
A sobering new study on the number of mothers and newborn babies that are dying during pregnancy. Why this data shows it's higher in certain states. 
 
Also this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS L. KEON, CHANCELLOR, PURDUE UNIVERSITY NORTHWEST: Well, all I can say is (Speaking in Foreign Language). That's sort of my Asian version of his -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COLLINS: An apology from the chancellor of Purdue University Northwest after his racist impression you saw there on stage. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:46:04]
 
HARLOW: Those were live pictures out of Jacksonville this morning. 
 
Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING. 
 
We want to tell you about this new report and what it finds is that states that ban or restrict abortion also have a higher rate of mothers and newborn babies dying during pregnancy, at birth or postpartum. 
 
Why is this happening in these states? Our CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula is here. 
 
And I should just note, this data is all 2020 and before.
 
DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Correct.
 
HARLOW: So, this doesn't include Roe v. Wade being overturned. We can get into that in a moment. But what does this tell us? 
 
NARULA: Yes. So, this is not looking at the effect of the abortion ban specifically. That's going to take us years to figure out. 
 
But what they did was say, let's look at the states that have restrictions and bans. Let's back track and look from 2020 and before to see what health care for women, maternal health care and outcomes, and babies look like. Where were the weaknesses and how might these bans exacerbate that. 
 
So, essentially, they took data from the CDC and the March of Dimes and they compared those 26 states with the restrictions and bans to those that did not have them and they found that, in fact, there were more maternity care deserts in the states that have restrictions and bans. So, places where you don't have access to providers or even hospital or birthing services. There were less OBGYNs and certified midwives, so less providers. More women were giving birth who were younger, under the age of 30. More were giving birth in rural areas. And more were giving birth without prenatal care or with late prenatal care. So, obviously, all of this impacts what is going to happen to the mom, to the baby after. But the landscape pre did not look good. 
 
COLLINS: If the landscape before didn't look good, I guess the question is, is after it's not going to look much better. I mean, I'm from Alabama. I'm very proud to be from Alabama. But there's a state where you can't get an abortion right now. And to see what the numbers for that state individually are, as many other states in the south, including Louisiana, Mississippi, that's the question here, I think, if they restrict this care, this access, then shouldn't the care at least be improved? 
 
NARULA: Yes, I think that's the question. And, really, what we're looking at is maternal outcomes and infant outcomes and those percentages are not great again. And that's what they looked at in this study and they found that, in fact, again, in those states with restrictions and bans, looking backwards, in 2020, there was a 62 percent higher maternal mortality rate at that time. Between 2018 and 2020, if you looked at just women of reproductive age, 15 to 44, there -- for all-cause mortality it was 34 percent higher. And the maternal mortality increased. The rate of increase was two times as much over those years. 
 
And let's not stop at the mom. Let's talk about what happened to the babies. Again, infant mortality from 2018 to 2020, higher for that whole first year across all races and ethnicities. And in 2019, in fact, 15 percent higher mortality for babies in that first week in those states that restricted. So, this is not a pretty picture, at least, you know, where we started from before. 
 
LEMON: That makes what's happening now with abortion all the more important to follow it and the studies that come after 2020. It's going to be interesting to see.
 
NARULA: Yes. Correct.
 
LEMON: Thank you, Doctor. Really appreciate that. 
 
Still ahead, the loss of Stephen Twitch Boss, OK. He has -- it has opened, excuse me, opened up the conversation about mental health in America and pain that hides in plain sight. We're going to talk about that. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:52:50]
 
LEMON: So, the chancellor of Purdue University Northwest is apologizing for a racist remark he made during a commencement ceremony. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
THOMAS L. KEON, CHANCELLOR, PURDUE UNIVERSITY NORTHWEST: Well, all I can say is (Speaking in Foreign Language). That's sort of my Asian version of his -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: Yes, it was awkward. 
 
Well, Chancellor Thomas Keon called the remarks offensive and insensitive and wrote in a statement, I am truly sorry to my unplanned, off the cuff response to another speaker. I assure you, I did not intend to be hurtful, and my comments do not reflect my personal or our institutional values. 
 
Well, Keon says that he is directing an interdisciplinary team to address important issues to the Asian American Pacific Islander community at the University. 
 
HARLOW: Catastrophic damage in Louisiana. Tornados ripping through that state overnight, killing at least three people. We'll take you there. 
 
Also this. 
 
COLLINS: The French are heading to the World Cup final. Well, formidable French. We are live in Qatar. That's ahead.  
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:58:11]
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDRES CANTOR, CHIEF WORLD CUP COMMENTATOR, TELEMUNDO DEPORTES: Goal!
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
LEMON: You know how I love that. 
 
HARLOW: Well, it's our favorite thing on this show. 
 
COLLINS: (INAUDIBLE) is going to like bust a blood vessel.
 
HARLOW: And Don always does it. That is Telemundo broadcaster, Argentine American, Andres Cantor, letting the world know that Argentina had scored their third goal against Croatia on Tuesday to book its spot in the World Cup final. Argentina led by the legendary Lionel Messi in what will likely be his final game in an Argentina jersey. They will face France, lead by the rising star, 23-year-old Kylian Mbappe. 
 
Joining us now, Telemundo Deportes chief World Cup commentator Andres Cantor. 
 
They tell me we only have two minutes for this, you know, segment. So, I was thinking you could just say goal for two minutes, but I will not make you do this. 
 
Congratulations! What did it mean to you? How excited are you for Sunday? 
 
ANDRES CANTOR, CHIEF WORLD CUP COMMENTATOR, TELEMUNDO DEPORTES: I'm very excited to tell you the truth because Argentina made it to the final. But because it's going to be epic one way or the other. Will Lionel Messi lift the World Cup trophy in his fifth try in his last dance, or will France win this World Cup again, like they did four years ago? No matter what happens, history will be made Sunday. LEMON: Wow. Wow. 
 
So, are you saving your voice? I can't believe you're speaking with us. Are you saving your voice for the goal? 
 
CANTOR: I - I am saving my voice for the last goal of the final. Hopefully there won't be many, or maybe there will be many. But usually in a World Cup final there is not that many goals. But, believe me, I am saving my voice. I'm trying to rest from here until Sunday as much as I can. It ain't easy, but here I am. 
 
LEMON: And can I ask you something real quick, though. 
 <br>[07:00:00]
 
How - is there like a -- have you recorded it or timed it, excuse me, for the longest that you've actually said it? 
 
CANTOR: Never. Never, never .</pre>
