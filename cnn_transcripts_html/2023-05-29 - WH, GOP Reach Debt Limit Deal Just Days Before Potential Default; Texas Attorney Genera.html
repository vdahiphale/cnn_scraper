(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: The debt deal is done but the hard sell is far from over. Can lawmakers from both parties support the agreement their leaders hashed out? We'll take you live to Capitol Hill and the White House to bring you the very latest.
 
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: And swift retaliation. Ukraine's vow after Russia bombards the capital Kyiv with missile and drone strikes. We're falling these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.
 
SANCHEZ: How would you spend your holiday weekend? President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy spent theirs striking a deal to avoid a catastrophic U.S. default. Now, they have only a few days to lock down the votes necessary to pass it.
 
Some observers point out that the bill itself isn't especially game- changing. Still, hardliners from both parties are upset. First and foremost, the deal suspends the debt limit until 2025.
 
Republicans got certain new work requirements and cut the IRS funding. Democrats, meantime, protected recently passed climate provisions and ensured Social Security and Medicaid were untouched.
 
Let's get some perspective now from the White House with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. So, Jeremy, what is the president saying to convince some of these skeptical Democrats whose vote he needs to get this thing through?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Boris, President Biden often tells voters to compare me to the alternative, not to the Almighty. And he is frankly making a very similar case to House Democrats right now as it relates to this debt ceiling bill. Making the case that, look, this is a compromise, as he said yesterday, not everybody got what they wanted.
 
But ultimately, the White House is really focusing on not what's necessarily in the bill, what -- but what is not in the bill. In particular, protections to some of the key domestic policy programs from this administration. Here's the White House Communications Director Ben LaBolt addressing some concerns from progressives.

BEN LABOLT, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: For members of the Progressive Caucus who voted for all of this signature legislation of this administration over the past couple of years that has led to the creation of 12.7 million jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years things like the CHIPS and Science Act that will allow us to build a semiconductor industry in this country, the infrastructure law, the largest investment in clean energy ever in the Inflation Reduction Act. Those are protected and funded in this agreement. And so, if you voted for those items, you should vote for this as well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DIAMOND: And look, we do have a deal. But at this point, the White House and Speaker McCarthy both sides now racing against the clock to try and sell this deal to both of their caucuses. Because it is going to require both Democratic and Republican votes to pass.
 
We have one week until the U.S. government runs out of money. The White House for its part they've made it 60 plus one-on-one phone calls with Democratic lawmakers over the weekend. And they're going to continue that effort moving to the Senate after the House votes on Wednesday, Boris.
 <br>[14:05:08]
 
SANCHEZ: A full-court press. Jeremy Diamond from the White House, thank you so much. Let's take you now live to Capitol Hill with CNN's Lauren Fox. Lauren, should Speaker McCarthy be worried about a conservative revolt? Some Republicans using colorful language, let's say to describe this deal.
 
LAUREN FOX, CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I think it's clear he's going to lose some votes on the conservative side of his conference. But the reality is, he may not actually need them.
 
And the reason for that is this is always going to be a coalition of the members in the middle, both in the Democratic Party and in the Republican Party. We're going to see some of our first glimpses of the Republican drama playing out perhaps tomorrow. That's when the House Rules Committee meets.
 
Usually, the way it works in the Rules Committee is Republicans support the rule to get the bill to the floor. Already, you're starting to see some warnings from people like Chip Roy, a conservative, who's been arguing that this deal that was cut between Biden and McCarthy does not go far enough in terms of spending cuts and other items that he wanted to see. 
 
But the reality is, if this comes to the floor on Wednesday, the expectation right now is that both sides are doing everything they can to get the votes in the middle to pass this out of the House.
 
Once it goes through the House or if it passes the House, then it will go to the U.S. Senate. And that's when things could get tricky in terms of the timeline here because the Senate can move expeditiously when they want to. But sometimes what happens is one member -- one member can really slow this entire process down. Pushing you really to the brink of that June fifth deadline, Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: When they want to, is the key phrase there. Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill, thank you so much. Jim?
 
SCIUTTO: Well, in Ukraine, a rare daytime attack on the Capital, Kyiv. The air raid siren sent children running for shelter. Explosions across the city.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SCIUTTO: There's nothing more frightening than that. Today's attacks followed a massive barrage of Russian drones over the weekend. Officials described it as the biggest attack of this kind to date in the war.
 
Ukraine's air defenses say they shot down 77 of 89 drones and missiles fired by Russia. That's according to the Ukrainian military. This is the 16th time this month that the city has been the target of a Russian attack.
 
Sam Kiley is with us from Eastern Ukraine. Sam, a noticeable pickup in tempo in Russian air attacks across the country. Do Ukrainians believe this is in anticipation of the upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive?
 
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ukrainian officials, Jim, have said that much particularly with reference to the efforts being made by the Russians to try to get the Ukrainians to effectively waste as much of their air defenses as possible on cheap missiles or drones such as the Iranian-made Shahed, which is a slow- moving drone that only carries about 40 kilograms of high explosive in comparison to 10 times that from cruise missiles.
 
But last night, there were 40 cruise missiles among that inventory of destruction that the Russians tried to throw, particularly at Kyiv. And then following it up with the surface-to-surface and air-to- surface Iskander missiles which again, are capable of delivering a huge amount of high explosive. All of them -- almost all of them as you point out there, Jim, shot down.
 
But every time these get shot down, of course, that is a usage of anti-aircraft missiles or anti-aircraft cannons, which have to be replaced. And the Russian calculation is that clearly if they can get the Ukrainians to use up as much of this as possible, they'll be more able to fly their jets on the battlefield when the Ukrainians come to prosecute an offensive which increasingly is beginning to look imminent. 
 
Now, this may be part of a psychological operation being conducted by the Ukrainians against the Russians. But we are hearing increasingly broad hints from Ukrainian officials that an offensive of some kind is imminent. But, Jim, have you -- have you -- as you first reported some time ago now, the shaping operations for that offensive have been ongoing particularly recently with strikes against Mariupol and Berdiansk, both Ukrainian health cities on the coastline. They're very important logistics hubs for the Russians prosecuting their war up around where I am here.
 
SCIUTTO: No question. A lot of build-up to this counteroffensive including the addition of whole new weapon systems for Ukrainian forces. Sam Kiley, Eastern Ukraine, please be safe.
 
Joining us now, is U.S. Army Brigadier General Peter Zwack, former U.S. senior defense attache to the Russian Federation. Good to have you on. Thanks for taking the time today.
 <br>[14:10:05]
 
BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK (RET), U.S. ARMY: Good to be back.
 
SCIUTTO: First, you just returned from Ukraine. And I wonder in your visits there, do you believe that Ukraine has the capability now -- the military capability to take back significant proportions of Russian-held territory?
 
ZWACK: Yes. I was with nine participants in the delegation of the Renew Democracy Initiative, an NGO in the United States. It's focused on countering authoritarianism and autocracy.
 
The key point here -- and I -- several of us would saw this -- would see this. Ukrainians -- we were there the first night of the big, big Russian air rocket -- cruise missile onslaught with the Kinzhals. And we saw the Patriots -- we heard the Patriots knocking them down over the night skies.
 
That was just on the 16th. And there have been 16 attacks, drone attacks, cruise missile attacks over the last month. That's a lot.
 
I believe the Russians have several things. One, I think they're spooked. They see the Ukrainians taking bites and making moves and hitting, as you mentioned, Berdiansk and Mariupol, and fuel depots. And they had a train near Berdiansk. So, there's stuff going on. And sort of a softening, I think the air -- the missiles, Jim, and the drones are in part in their minds to preempt in any way they can -- 
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
ZWACK: -- this potential much, if you will, probably over touted counteroffensive.
 
SCIUTTO: Well -- 
 
ZWACK: We're just going to have to see but the Ukrainians are the last thing we saw. This is a society -- Ukrainian society is in an existential war.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes, for their survival.
 
ZWACK: And this is something the Russians I think never anticipated. And we sew -- 
 
SCIUTTO: Exactly.
 
ZWACK: Exactly, survival.
 
SCIUTTO: And that's contributed to their ability to defend. I mean, listen, we would show a video here of a missile dropping out of the sky on a busy intersection. That just gives you a sense of what people face there.
 
As you see the strikes from Ukraine, including behind Russian lines as far into Russian territory on the other side of the border. And you hear in a Telegram post just in the last hour, the Ukrainian president saying that the timing of this counteroffensive, the next phase of the war has been decided. Do you see that this -- we are on the eve of this counteroffensive most likely?
 
ZWACK: Well, I think if we just look at the macros, the ground is getting harder. They got through the spring, they call the rasputitsa, the mud. So, the ground is hardening.
 
The Russian line of contact, they're pretty exhausted. There are numerous. They got a lot of firepower, but they're not showing a lot of initiative on the ground. Ukrainians are beginning to poke and prod, the word we're all using, shake the battlefield, seems are going to go open up in opportunities.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
ZWACK: And it -- and with their newly trained brigades, they really been careful in husbanding them about over the prematurely committing. They're going to go when they're ready, and that probably is soon. Nobody knows the exact moment.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes. Newly trained, newly armed with new systems such as German Leopard tanks, and as well as the long-range as we reported, Storm Shadow drone -- rather a cruise missile supplied about -- supplied by the UK. We'll continue to follow closely. Brigadier General Peter Zwack, thanks so much.
 
ZWACK: God bless your Memorial Day.
 
SCIUTTO: Indeed. Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Suspended Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton now facing a trial in the State Senate after being impeached by the Republican-led House over corruption allegations. We have details on that. Next. Also, shocking video of a bus driver and a passenger pulling guns on each other during an altercation.
 
And later.

SANCHEZ: The legendary rock band Queen now far from their poor boy from a poor family days. We're going to tell you the staggering sum their music catalog may sell for. You're watching CNN NEWS CENTRAL where we're going to be singing this song during the break. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:18:26]
 
SANCHEZ: For the first time, the attorney general in Texas is going to face an impeachment trial. Saturday, the Republican-controlled House voted 121 to 23 to impeach Republican Ken Paxton on 20 articles. Among the allegations Paxton is accused of, using the power of the AG office to benefit a campaign donor.
 
The vote is a stunning rebuke of Paxton despite support from some of the biggest names in the Republican Party including former President Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. The historic vote lays bare how heated the read-on-read political infighting has gone.
 
Let's get an update now from CNN Senior National Correspondent Ed Lavandera who joins us live. So, Ed, what is next for Ken Paxton?
 
ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, now all of this moves to the Texas Senate -- State Senate side, it's not exactly clear when this trial will take place. But they are preparing for it over there on that side.
 
And that's where the math gets a little bit trickier. You talk about 121 House representatives that voted to impeach Ken Paxton over the weekend. The math on the Senate side is a little bit trickier, and many people trying to read the tea leaves as to what exactly might happen and how this might have unfolded.
 
31 state senators here in the state, 12 of them are Democrats so you need about nine. And also, you need to remember that one of those senators' Ken -- senators is Ken Paxton, his own wife. So, all of this adding to the drama that we're seeing unfold here. But there are 20 Articles of Impeachment in all that stemmed with charges that have to do with bribery, abuse of office powers, retaliation against whistleblowers, as well as obstructing justice.
 <br>[14:20:00]
 
Many of the people who voted -- the lawmakers who voted for these articles of impeachment say it is about time that Ken Paxton faces these charges. Ken Paxton has been calling this, a political sham, said -- saying that the vote that happened on Saturday was also an ugly event there happening in the Texas House. 
 
And the attorney general is essentially kind of wrapping himself in the blanket that he's been using so often over the course of his tenure about filing lawsuits against the Biden administration. But right now, he has been temporarily removed from office, Boris.
 
SANCHEZ: A major drama unfolding in the Lone Star State. Ed Lavandera, thanks so much for the update. Jim?
 
SCIUTTO: All right. So, nationally now, tomorrow kicks off a busy week for the 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls, including the ones who have already announced and those still waiting or seeming to wait for the right moment. CNN's Eva McKend joins us now. So, Iowa, of course, one of the early voting states, so one of the early stops right for GOP-hopefuls, how busy it's going to be there?
 
EVA MCKEND, NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, Governor DeSantis, a really busy week ahead. He is kicking off his great American comeback door with several stops in Iowa. This comes as at a pivotal time for him. We have seen his favorability ratings consistently drop in pools from the fall.
 
Former President Trump will also be in Iowa on Thursday. Senator Scott holding a town hall in Iowa on Friday. And then there's a big event on Saturday, Jim, and that is Senator Joni Ernst's annual roast and ride.
 
And that is an opportunity for these Iowa voters to see all of these candidates side by side. These are largely Christian evangelical voters making up the electorate in a Republican primary in Iowa. And these are the voters that these hopefuls need to capture.
 
SCIUTTO: All right, so you already got a few Republican governors in the race. CNN has new reporting about another possible governor to enter.
 
MCKEND: Right. Governor Sununu telling us that he has money lined up -- money lined up, support, and a pathway to victory. He is a Republican governor in a blue state who is popular among independents.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
MCKEND: Historically, that would have been checking all of the right boxes.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
MCKEND: But we have certainly seen the Republican Party evolve in recent years.
 
SCIUTTO: Yes.
 
MCKEND: But still, he is suggesting that he's still considering a bit. Let's take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): The one thing I'm looking at is where can I be most effective in both in terms of making sure I can be a good governor. I still have a 24/7 job. I'm one of the few people that I still very much focused on my state. I just want what's best for the party. It doesn't have to be the Chris Sununu show all the time. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND: So, you know, not everyone needs to be a candidate. That's not how they can always be most helpful. He clearly, I think, relishes this will he won't he conversation. But, Jim, it looks like we will get a definitive answer from him sometime next month.
 
SCIUTTO: And the question, of course, is, is there a pathway in the current Republican Party in the primary process for someone who is -- someone who trends a little bit towards the center. We'll see.
 
MCKEND: And who definitively says that Trump can't win in a general election.
 
SCIUTTO: Right. We've only seen very few go that far. Eva McKend, thanks so much. Boris?
 
SANCHEZ: Right now, there is a search for survivors underway in Davenport, Iowa. The six-story apartment building partially collapsed yesterday around dinnertime. You can see the clouds of smoke in the immediate aftermath.
 
Davenport's mayor said that teams have rescued eight people so far and they've helped more than a dozen others out of the building. One survivor said he was visiting a friend when suddenly everything went dark.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PAUL STEPHENSON, APARTMENT COLLAPSE SURVIVOR: I just thank God I was able to make it out of there. You know, it was like a big explosion -- like a bomb. And the bomb pushed me to the side. When it pushed me to the side, I just went in and grabbed him and get him out of there. Get him to safety.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SANCHEZ: CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is covering this story for us. Adrienne, it is incredible that no one was killed looking at some of these images. But officials have not yet said exactly what caused the collapse, right?
 
ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No, Boris. They haven't. That's an answer that will come later. And authorities are saying it is still too early to tell.
 
We do know there were permits in place for the exterior walls but determining what happened, the fire chief says is a lengthy process. Now, those canine dogs you mentioned are looking for signs of life. But the fire chief also said to their knowledge, no one is trapped inside of that building.
 
And that was news everyone had hoped for after there were at least eight people rescued. The eighth person, a male, was rescued overnight and transported to the hospital, according to the fire chief. Now, officials also told us they've done numerous inspections at that property based on complaints received by concerned tenants. Listen in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RICH OSWALD, DAVENPORT DEVELOPMENT &amp; NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES DIRECTOR: But there have been some complaints to the structure. We issued notice and orders to have those repaired. The building owner hired their own engineering firm to direct them when the repairs needed to be made.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 <br>[14:25:13]
 
BROADDUS: And the big concern right now is the stability of the structure. It's still unclear what will happen to that apartment building, Boris, moving forward.
 
SANCHEZ: Adrienne Broaddus from Chicago, thank you so much for that reporting. Jim?
 
SCIUTTO: Still to come. There is a virus which experts called the most important bug you've never heard of. We're going to tell you exactly what it is and what you may need to look for. That's next.
 
And the Catholic News Agency reports that thousands of people are now descending on a Missouri town to see a nun who passed away but whose body appears to show no signs of decay years after her death. A miracle? We're going to explain just ahead.
