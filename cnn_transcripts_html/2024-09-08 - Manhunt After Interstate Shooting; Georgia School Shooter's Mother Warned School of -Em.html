KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom.
 
A manhunt is underway after shots ring out near an interstate in Kentucky. The latest on what we know happened and the investigation.
 
On the campaign trail in a battleground state, Donald Trump floats an idea about changing the U.S. constitution. Hear what he said about the role of a vice president.
 
And a change in China's adoption policy leaves families hoping to grow stuck in limbo. We'll talk with one woman who for years has been trying to adopt a young boy she considers her son.
 
ANNOUNCER:  Live from Atlanta, this is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber.
 
BRUNHUBER:  A manhunt is underway in Kentucky at this hour for a gunman who opened fire on a busy interstate highway. Police are looking for this man, 32-year-old Joseph A. Couch of Woodbine, Kentucky. Couch is about 5-foot 10 and weighs approximately 154 pounds. Police say he is considered armed and dangerous.
 
Now, police say Couch started shooting late Saturday afternoon near Interstate 75 in Laurel County, just north of London, Kentucky. That's about 80 miles south of Lexington. One woman told CNN she and her friend heard a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot while they were driving and later saw several police cars speed by. When they tried to make it to their destination, Christina DiNoto noticed damage to her car and said her hands are still shaking. Here she is.

CHRISTINA DINOTO, SHOOTING WITNESS:  All of a sudden, we just heard this deafening loud sound and it sounded like a rock went through my back window. And our ears were ringing and we just looked at each other and we were like, was that a gunshot? And then we were like, that can't be a gunshot, you know, because we're driving down the highway.
 
And there was a white truck that was next to us in the right-hand lane, and all of a sudden, he slowed down and he pulled off to the shoulder and we thought maybe it was his tire had blown out or something, but it was much louder than a tire blowing out. And that was just so loud and so scary, you know, it's something very unexpected while you're just driving.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Police say at least nine vehicles had been hit on both north and southbound I-75 and five people were seriously injured. At last report all five were in stable condition.

JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  This kind of behavior, essentially going after cars is intended for two things. One is, of course, to go after a particular target, individuals, drivers, or passengers, but also to, in some ways, witness the response, which is cars out of control crop cars, trying to dodge the noise. We have testimonials about people hearing noises and wanting to get out of the way.
 
And so, there's a certain, I would say, performative aspect to it. Because it happened in the daytime, I think that explains how they know who it is. There were clearly enough eyewitnesses.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Now, once again, police are looking for this man, 32-year- old Joseph A. Couch of Woodbine, Kentucky. Police say he is considered armed and dangerous. On this, the mayor says authorities know the general area where the suspect is, but they're not releasing that information. He did have this to say to area residents.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
RANDALL WEDDLE, LONDON, KENTUCKY MAYOR:  We're asking people to, if you think you hear something outside of your home, please do not go outside shooting. Our officers could be in that area or first responders. Call 911.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  And stay with CNN. We'll bring you the latest updates as they happen. Well, we're getting more insight into what happened in the hours leading up to the recent school shooting here in Georgia, where two students and two teachers were killed. The mother of the accused gunman at Apalachee High School called a school counselor with a warning before the shooting. That's according to the woman's sister. The call was reportedly prompted by an alarming text message from her son in which he said, I'm sorry, Mom. Marcee Gray then spoke to the school of an extreme emergency involving her 14-year-old son Colt. She has now apologized for them, quote, "absolutely horrific shooting." Her son has been charged with four counts of felony murder.
 
Now, there's been a huge outpouring of sympathy and support from the communities surrounding Apalachee High School as people there continue to try to come to terms with Wednesday's shooting. CNN's Rafael Romo has this report.
 <br>[04:05:00]
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Residents, teachers, current and former students, police, people from neighboring towns, and even from outside Georgia, all of these people and others have stopped here at Apalachee High School in Winder to pay their respects.
 
And also on Saturday, a group of bikers showed up. They brought flowers they placed in the impromptu memorials. Set up around the flag flying at half-mast in honor of the deceased. Then they all made a big circle holding hands, and a minister said a prayer. Several men had previously carried a giant wooden cross into the circle. It's all an effort to tell this community that they are not alone in this moment of crisis, that they are loved and supported. Let's take a listen to what one of those people have to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  As a biker community, that's what we do. We rally around our neighbors, our kids go to school in this school system. We want to be here to support, you know, all the kids, families, first responders just to show up, you know, for them in this time.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO:  When we first arrived here, there were dozens of flowers around the memorial. Now, it's probably in the hundreds. Earlier, I spoke with a couple of former students who told us the reasons they felt they needed to be here.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
It's just crazy that anything like this could happen in like our town. Like there's no space for gun violence. And so, this happening at all is like -- it's just shocking. Our school doesn't stand for this and we don't accept gun violence in the school. Like there's no space for that.
 
We're just a loving community. We're small, man. We're all like -- just shouldn't have happened. I just really feel for everyone like -- and, you know, going to the school, you know, we went to school with no worry in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO:  There was supposed to be a football game here Friday night, but the game was canceled, and for the time being, classes are suspended as well here at Apalachee High School, although other Barrow County schools would resume classes on Tuesday. A community recovery center is set to open here in Barrow County on Monday to support those affected by the shooting.
 
Rafael Romo, CNN, Winder, Georgia.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRUNHUBER:  The University of Georgia football team observed a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Apalachee shooting. 90,000 fans at Sanford Stadium, located about 25 miles from Winder, joined the tribute before kickoff in the game between the number one ranked Bulldogs and the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles on Saturday.
 
There were two contrasting responses to the shooting from the vice- presidential nominees. Democrat Tim Walz speaking at the Human Rights Campaign's National Dinner on Saturday, objected to J. D. Vance saying that school shootings were, quote, a fact of life. Here's what both of them said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I don't like this. I don't like to admit this. I don't like that this is a fact of life. But if you're -- if you are a psycho and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets. And we have got to bolster security at our schools.
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  It's a fact of life, some people are gay. But you know what's not a fact of life? That our children need to be shot dead in schools. That's not a fact of life.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BRUNHUBER:  Walz also criticized Republicans for restricting books with LGBTQ plus themes because of the fear they would, quote, "turn your children gay." And while the vice-presidential nominee spoke on Saturday, demonstrators outside marched to protest the treatment of Palestinians.
 
Well, days ahead of his first debate with Kamala Harris, Donald Trump spent his Saturday at a rally in Wisconsin. He gave a lengthy speech touching on some familiar themes and some new ones. He lashed out at Democrats, saying the country is run by, quote, "stupid people." He promised to drain the swamp. He declared again he's been indicted more times than mobster Al Capone. And he called for a change to the 25th Amendment that would allow for the easier removal of vice presidents. A clear shot at Kamala Harris. Alayna Treene reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  Well, Donald Trump spoke for nearly two hours on Saturday in Mosinee, Wisconsin. And this is a key battleground state. There's a reason that Donald Trump has been coming to Wisconsin so often, that's because Donald Trump's campaign views it as being a key part of their pathway to achieving 270 electoral votes come November.
 
Now, look, they actually recognize it's perhaps even more important now that Kamala Harris is at the top of the Democratic ticket. Prior to Joe Biden ending his campaign, Trump's senior advisers had told me they were very confident about their chances here. But now, recent polling, including CNN's own polling, released last week shows that Harris has actually made up a lot of ground in this state. She is currently polling a little bit better than Donald Trump here, although it was incredibly close.
 
You're going to be seeing a lot more of him in Wisconsin in the next two months. But a big focus of Donald Trump's speech on Saturday was about the economy.
 <br>[04:10:00]
 
Now, we know that this is the most important issue for most voters across the country, but it's also an issue where Donald Trump is polling better than the vice president. And so, you're going to hear a lot more about that as well on Tuesday when he faces off with Harris on the debate stage.
 
And one other thing I think is very notable to point out is that he made some news on Saturday. He said for the first time that he would look into modifying the 25th Amendment if elected. Take a listen to what he said.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And finally, I will support modifying the 25th Amendment to make clear that if a vice president lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president of the United States, if you do that with a cover up of the President of the United States, it's grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
TREENE:  So, as you heard him say there is grounds for impeachment and removal from office. This is clearly in line with Donald Trump's language about Kamala Harris trying to cover up for Joe Biden. He's been saying that without evidence. But look, it all plays into his broader goal of trying to paint her as not being fit to serve, as being part of the Democratic establishment, and the overall D.C. establishment.
 
You saw signs on Saturday that said drain the swamp. That is going to be another key message that you'll hear him talk about on Tuesday in Philadelphia.

BRUNHUBER:  Kamala Harris has been in Pennsylvania doing some intense preparation for Tuesday's debate with Trump. On Saturday, she took a small break to visit a small local business to meet with supporters and talk about a surprising new endorsement. Eva McKend reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  The vice president's strategy largely seems to be to hunker down at her hotel with a small group of trusted advisers as she strenuously prepares for this debate. No doubt. Anticipating questions from the moderators and going through the former president's past statements.
 
Also, key to the campaign strategy is to anchor themselves here in Pittsburgh in this pivotal battleground State of Pennsylvania, so that in her downtime, which she doesn't have very much of, but in that time, she can get some face time with battleground voters. She spoke today at a spice shop about that recent endorsement from Liz and Dick Cheney. Let's listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Actually, I'm honored to have their endorsement and I think that what they both as leaders who are well respected are making an important statement that it's OK and, if not important, to put country above party. And I'm honored to have their support.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKEND:  And so, a bit unusual to hear a Democrat, the vice president, praising that endorsement. But it just gives you a sense of the campaign strategy. They have Republicans for Harris, for instance, as a part of the coalition. They are trying to appeal to every conceivable voter. As Pennsylvania was only narrowly won by President Biden in 2020 by about 80,000 votes.

BRUNHUBER:  And you can tune in for our special coverage of the ABC News Presidential Debate simulcast here on CNN. It'll air this Tuesday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time here in the U.S. That's 2:00 a.m. Wednesday in London, 5:00 a.m. in Abu Dhabi and 9:00 in the morning in Hong Kong.
 
Explosive wildfire in Southern California has the governor declaring a state of emergency. Thousands of people are being forced out of their homes. The so-called Line Fire in San Bernardino County has burned 17,000 acres or 7,000 hectares in just over 50 hours. That's up from just 3,000 hectares just a few hours earlier. The fire was 0 percent contained as of Saturday evening. It's burning so hot that the blaze is creating its own weather clouds and thunderstorms.
 
The Red Cross set up an evacuation shelter for residents, and FEMA is stepping in. Homeowners in the city of Highland and nearby areas face mandatory evacuation orders, and several other communities are facing precautionary evacuation warnings.
 
Animal shelter services and livestock pens were set up as well. A number of agencies are involved, including CAL FIRE, the U.S. Forest Service, as well as county fire and sheriff officials.
 
An extreme heat across the Western United States is prompting weather alerts, blazing temperatures spread across into the southwest, into Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa has the details.
 
ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  The heat goes on, the southwest continues to swelter with temperatures up in the triple digits from places like Fresno, Las Vegas, and Phoenix on Sunday. This is after many locations have already tied or broken daily records with temperatures in the triple digits. Downtown L.A. hitting 112 degrees, the airport hitting 102, even temperatures up in the upper 90s for some cities in Washington and Oregon tying and breaking records.
 <br>[04:15:00]
 
Will keep these temperatures of near 100 degrees or hotter through the next couple of days. Las Vegas continues to see that heat stretch through Tuesday. So, does Phoenix, temperatures up near 110 degrees. Palm Springs as well. We keep temperatures up near the triple digits in Los Angeles through Monday.
 
Now, downtown L.A. hit 112 degrees on Friday for just the third time on record since 1877. It was just one degree shy of that all-time record of 113 degrees that was set back in September of 2010. The forecast again is expected to be at 100 or hotter through Monday, but average for this time of year is 84 degrees. Again, this is kind of late in the season to be seeing heat like this.
 
Phoenix continues to plow through their records currently at 103 consecutive days at or hotter than 100 degrees, and that completely shatters the previous stretch of 76 days that was set back in 1993.
 
So, again, we're seeing this heat get more extreme and last longer. That is a sign, a symptom, a fingerprint of climate change. And our climate shift index from Climate Central tells us, you know, by how much, and we're seeing for a lot of this heat there in the southwest, for parts of Southern California, we're seeing that this heat was made four to five times more likely due to climate change as this heat, again, becomes more extreme and just last longer.
 
BRUNHUBER:  At least 14 people are dead in northern Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi made landfall on Saturday, that's according to Reuters. The tropical cyclone recorded maximum sustained winds that are equivalent of a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane.
 
Yagi uprooted thousands of trees and damaged countless houses across Northern Vietnam, that's according to authorities. And the storm has since been downgraded to a tropical depression, but the risk of flash floods and landslides remain.
 
And Yagi also bearing down on Laos. It's expected to bring significant wind damage along the coast and up to 12 inches of rain through Sunday.
 
The family of an American woman says they blame Israel for her death. We'll have the story of the 26-year-old shooting just ahead. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:20:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  Lebanon says Israel targeted an ambulance team for the second time in 12 hours, killing three emergency workers and wounding two others. The Lebanese public health ministry says the crew was trying to contain a fire in the town of Froun. The Israeli military says the strike eliminated terrorists.
 
Meanwhile, Israel says dozens of rockets were launched from Lebanon into Israel early Saturday. In a statement, Hezbollah said the rockets were a response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon and, quote, "especially the attack on Mikkel Cruz (ph) in the town of Froun."
 
Now, this comes as the family of an American woman who was shot and killed while protesting in the West Bank blames Israel for her death. Two witnesses say Aysenur Eygi was shot in the head by Israeli forces responding to a protest on Friday. The governor of Nablus tells CNN that an autopsy confirms that Eygi was killed by an Israeli sniper's bullet. Now, CNN can't independently verify the autopsy results. The Israeli military says its troops fired at an instigator of violent activity after rocks were thrown at them.
 
Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us live from London with more. So, Elliott, lots of anger obviously over the killing of the American activist. What's the latest?
 
ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  Very much so, Kim. And in particular, and perhaps understandably anger from the family of Eygi which has accused Israel of what it describes as the unlawful killing of Eygi. They've called for an independent investigation, saying that the investigation that Israel says it's carrying out, and which the United States has asked Israel to carry out, would not be sufficient.
 
As you noted, the governor of Nablus has said that an autopsy found that killing of Eygi occurred due to a sniper's bullet to the head. And as you say, we can't independently confirm that. There's also been comment from the Turkish president, President Erdogan, Eygi, although a U.S. citizen is of Turkish descent. So, Erdogan, whoever the last few weeks has been likening Israel's actions in Gaza to the Nazis, has decried and accused Israel of carrying out what he described as heinously murdering Eygi.
 
Now, the IDF perhaps mindful of the debacle surrounding the killing of Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh just over two years ago, has taken a somewhat cautious approach in its response. It has said that the IDF responded with fire towards a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. I should note that the International Solidarity organization that that Eygi was volunteering for has denied that any of their activists were hurling stones or rocks at forces. The IDF adding that it is looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area.
 
So, for now, Israel, neither accepting responsibility nor denying that it was responsible for Eygi's death, as I say, perhaps mindful of what happened in May 2022 when initially it denied that it was responsible for the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh before eventually backtracking and accepting responsibility. Initially, blamed Palestinian militants for her death. So, for now, the IDF being cautious. And we would expect that position to be clarified over the coming days. Kim.
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right. And switching gears now, Elliott, the latest phase of the polio vaccine -- vaccination campaign, it's concluding now. So, what's the assessment so far?
 
GOTKINE:  Well, as UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, described it, this is a rare bright spot in the sense that it seems to have gone off without a hitch. So, they concluded the first part was taking place in the Central Gaza Strip for three days, we're on the last day of vaccinations in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, and then there's going to be a three-day phase taking place in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.
 <br>[04:25:00]
 
So, so far, they have successfully inoculated 160,000 children under the age of 10 in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, and that followed almost 190,000 in the central part. The overall goal is to inoculate more than 640,000 children in the Gaza Strip under the age of 10 against polio, the first case of which was in some 25 years was discovered a few weeks ago. So, so far, it's gone out -- it's gone without a hitch.
 
But it's also worth remembering that this is a two-dose vaccination. In other words, that after this kind of three phases in central, southern, and Northern Gaza have been concluded that then have to wait four weeks and then go back and administer the second part, the second dose of this vaccination.
 
That said, if everything goes according to plan, which it has thus far, they will take the view that, look, if we've managed to vaccinate all of these children with the first dose in the first kind of three phases in the first part of this vaccination campaign, then there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to do so in the second half as well. So, as UNICEF says, Kim, a rare bright spot in the Gaza Strip.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, good to hear. All right. Elliott Gotkine in London. Thanks so much.
 
New protests in Tel Aviv one week after the bodies of six hostages were recovered in Gaza. Organizers say it was the largest in Israel's history. Anti-government protesters are demanding an immediate ceasefire and hostage release agreement. They lined the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday night, saying it's time to bring the hostages home.
 
All right. A developing story now. A crossing between Jordan and the West Bank. Israeli emergency services say three Israeli civilians were killed in a shooting at the Allenby Bridge Terminal. Israeli security officials say a terrorist opened fire on workers at the crossing and was neutralized. Paramedics say they tried to resuscitate the three men, but weren't successful.
 
All right. Coming up, China's announcement that it would stop all adoptions to foreigners has left thousands of families in the lurch. We'll speak to one mother who's hoping to bring a child to the U.S. That's next. Please stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[04:30:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  Welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom.
 
Right now, hundreds of families across the U.S. and beyond are stuck in a heartbreaking limbo. It follows a decision by China to stop allowing international adoption of Chinese children. The policy takes effect immediately.
 
Now, in a moment, I'll speak with one woman who was nearly four years into the process of bringing home a little boy she considers to be her son. But first, CNN's Steven Jiang reports from Beijing.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  This announcement didn't come as a total shock because the number of international adoptions from China had been in decline in recent years. The program, of course, came to a sudden halt during the pandemic and never really recovered even after COVID. But still, this marks a major change to a policy that has seen more than 160,000 Chinese children being adopted all over the world since the early 1990s. About half of them going to the United States.
 
But remember, this program began when China was dealing with an overpopulation problem. The government very much enforcing its draconian one child policy that basically limited most couples in cities to one child, forcing many families to abandon children, especially girls and disabled kids. Now, fast forward to today, they're dealing with the opposite problem, a shrinking labor force in a rapidly aging society. That's why, within the last decade, the authorities here have twice relaxed its one strict family planning policies, now allowing most couples to have up to three children. But none of that seems to have worked against this backdrop of a slowing economy and young people's changing attitudes towards marriage and parenthood. Now, the Chinese reaction to this policy change seemed to be mixed on social media, but those applauding this decision seem to be expressing a nationalistic sentiment, saying China is now rich and powerful enough to take care of its own abandoned children, and often citing rising tensions between China and the United States and other western nations as well.
 
But none of this economic, social, and political realities, of course, offer any real comfort to the hundreds of international families in the middle of adopting children from China, because the government here has reportedly indicated this ban goes into effect immediately, with very limited exceptions, leaving hundreds of Americans in limbo and potentially heartbroken.

BRUNHUBER:  All right. I want to bring in Debi Power, who is an American mother waiting to adopt a child in China, and she joins me from Sacramento, California. Thanks so much for being here. So, listen, as one of the parents the, you know, Steven was just speaking about there, you were well down the road towards adopting a little boy when you got this news from China, you'd already formed a bond with him.
 
I want to play some video now of the two of you. Explain sort of what we're seeing and how you've been forming that connection over the last four years.
 
DEBI POWER, MOTHER WAITING TO ADOPT IN CHINA:  Well, I -- my agency recommended during the pandemic to send a video each month of ourselves to our child, and I was lucky enough that as I sent these 41 videos that his really wonderful nannies would sometimes record him watching.
 
And so, over the years, we've managed to bond and now he can recognize my face and he can say, hi, mama. And I've sent him so many videos about our home, our family. I mean, I even fixed our dryer with -- together. So, we've -- 
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, we're just -- we just lost that little connection for the last sentence that you said there. But I want to -- you know, just hearing you talk about him calling you mom, I mean, it must be so heartbreaking to come so close. You've invested so much, you know, money, time, and especially emotion and to feel as though, you know, they're taking him out of your arms. I mean, describe the feeling right now.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
POWER:  The feeling is -- it can be -- it ranges. It's from despair to crazy hope. I mean, there, there's 300 waiting children that were promised families. And I really understand that China has this right to close down international adoptions. And even though our two countries have cooperated for so long to serve these vulnerable children and it's benefited both our countries, but 300 children have been waiting for families. My son's been waiting for me.
 
And they -- he knows about me. It's terrible to abandon him. And I just keep thinking that 300 is such a small number in the grand scheme of things, and it would provide -- if the children were allowed to be adopted, even at this moment, it would provide China with this opportunity to end this era of international adoption on this positive note because it would be this easily executable humanitarian method for them to keep their word and send these children to their families that love them.
 
BRUNHUBER:  You talk about hope. I mean, have you got any more clarification about where things stand? I mean, is -- do you know for sure that it will not happen?
 
POWER:  Well, you've heard the same announcement that we've heard. We are really hoping that our agencies would be able to communicate in order to clarify. We're hoping soon that we'll have clarification that they will, in fact, fulfill all these in process adoptions. That's my hope. I mean, what else can I cling to?
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes. We were hiding his identity. We sort of cover covered his face, and we're not going to use his name. But can you just tell me a bit about the boy and sort of what do you think will happen to him if you do not adopt him?
 
POWER:  Yes, I've known him since he was four and now, he's eight. And I've seen his likes and I've seen him lose his teeth. And I know over these past four years that he's had the -- as all the children, as far as I know, have had the opportunity to be adopted within China and that they have not been. And so, if these 300 children are not adopted by these international families, then their life is going to be remaining in the orphanages without families to advocate for them or to love them.
 
BRUNHUBER:  If the worst were to happen and they told you for sure, you know, it's a no. What will you do?
 
POWER:  I will learn to grieve a living son. And at some point, I'll move on, but I'm not ready for that yet.
 
BRUNHUBER:  I understand about a third of international adoptions are from China. So, there are alternatives out there. I mean, some might question why look abroad in the first place when there are American children who need homes.
 
POWER:  There are a lot of ways to adopt, and they're all complicated for different reasons. I mean, the reason I chose China myself is because I'm a single woman and China, at the time, had the most predictable, less prejudiced program out there that would provide me with someone that I can love and care for. And I can look at other countries, but I'm not ready for that yet, since he's still alive. It's hard.
 
BRUNHUBER:  Yes, I can sense the pain and conflict in your voice there, Debi. Listen, we wish you all the best and all the other families who are sort of caught in limbo, families across the world. Debi Power, thank you so much for speaking with us. Really appreciate it.
 
POWER:  Thank you.
 
BRUNHUBER:  All right. Still to come, disturbing video appears to show Ukrainian troops being killed after trying to surrender. What the U.N. is doing about it. That's next. Stay with us.

 <br>[04:40:00]
 
BRUNHUBER:  Ukraine and Russia launched deadly air attacks on their border regions overnight. Ukraine's military says at least two people were killed and four others injured in the country's northeastern Sumy region. The air force shot down a missile and more than a dozen attack drones launched from Russia. Russian media is reporting an attack in Belgorod wounded three people, and that includes two children who are in serious condition after suffering head injuries.
 
CNN has obtained exclusive drone video that appears to show Ukrainian soldiers being executed after they surrendered. It's one of several incidents being investigated by the U.N. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has the details. And we just want to warn you, some of the video in his report is disturbing.

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (VOICE-OVER):  A scene all too common on Ukraine's imperiled eastern front, smoke billowing, a position overrun. Ukrainian troops staggering out appearing to surrender to advancing Russians. A brief close-up on Ukrainian drone video seen here for the first time shows them on their knees.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  My friend, zoom in, we have to see them.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  The drone operators ask each other for a better view, and then seconds later, it is too late. The three fall to the ground. Dust nearby suggesting gunfire. Executed in cold blood, Ukrainian official familiar with the incident said, despite hoping to be taken prisoner by the Russians.
 
It is from near the besieged city of Pokrovsk in late August, the source said. The hottest spot on the front now where Russia is persistently advancing and follows a horrific pattern. Prosecutors say they're investigating a total of 28 cases in which 62 Ukrainian soldiers were killed after surrender on the battlefield.
 
ANDRIY KOSTIN, PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF UKRAINE: If prisoners of war surrender, if they show that they surrender, if they are without weapons in their hand -- in their hands, then summary execution is the war crime.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  It has worsened in the past 10 months. CNN obtaining from Ukrainian intelligence officials a detailed list of 15 incidents, most backed up by drone video or audio intercepts.
 
WALSH:  Now United Nations investigators have scrutinized many of these killings, and a U.N. investigative source said to me, quote, "There are many. There is a pattern, and the killings are war crimes individually," they said in their opinion. And together could amount to crimes against humanity.
 
WALSH (voice-over): And near Robotyne, the site of some of the fiercest fighting this year in Zaporizhzhia, another Ukrainian drone filmed in May, these images that are upsetting to watch. Ukrainian soldiers emerge one by one from the dugout. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence said they intercepted the Russian commander's order to execute or zero them, and gave us this transcript.
 
Take them -- down. And zero them. Take them. Zero them, the officer says. Got it, plus, comes the reply. Once you zero them, report back, he adds. Once they're all out, face down, the Russians fire.

Ukrainians we spoke to left asking why, to just terrify them or is it simply sport for the Russians?
 
PETRO YATSENKO, UKRAINIAN COORDINATOR CENTER FOR THE TREATMENT OF POW'S:  The main reason is to made Russian soldiers believe they -- it's very dangerous to surrender to Ukrainian forces because Ukrainian soldiers will kill them like Russians killing Ukrainian prisoners of war. This forced them not to surrender, but go forward to their death.
 
WALSH (voice-over):  A horror not always publicized or fully accounted for yet being felt steadily by Ukrainians as they struggle to hold the eastern line.
