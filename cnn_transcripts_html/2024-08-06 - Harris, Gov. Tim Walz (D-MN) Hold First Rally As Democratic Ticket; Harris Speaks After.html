KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Good evening, Philadelphia!
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Good evening. Good evening.
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS: Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So, let me say, on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- thank you for the warm welcome.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And let me just say, it's good to be here. All of the friends, all the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Senator Bob Casey, who we will re-elect this November.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Senator John Fetterman.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Mayor Cherelle Parker.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And Chairman Jaime Harrison. And it is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And I will say, Josh is a dear, dear friend, and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years. And I told Josh, look, I am so, so invested in our friendship and doing this together, because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We will win Pennsylvania. And I thank you, Josh. I thank you.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So -- so, Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the president of the United States a mere two weeks ago.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And it's been a bit of a whirlwind. And just last night the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting and so --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: I stand -- I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And so now we've got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And to all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race. But we have the momentum, and I know exactly what we are up against.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that elected district attorney.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
 
(APPLAUSE) HARRIS: Predators who abused women.
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: Fraudsters who scammed consumers.
 
(BOOING)
 <br>[18:05:00]
 
HARRIS: Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: So, hear me when I say --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- I know Donald Trump's type.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
 
HARRIS: So, but -- but --
 
AUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
 
HARRIS: Let me just say, let me say, hold on, hold on. Hold on. This campaign, our campaign, is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign, this campaign, is a fight for the future.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: It's a fight for the future. And, Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable health care, affordable child care, paid leave.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy, where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high, and lower the cost of living for America's families.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms, the freedom to vote --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- the freedom to be safe from gun violence.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body. Not having her government tell her what to do.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So -- I love you, too -- so, here's the thing, here's the thing, since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward, a fighter for the middle-class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: A promise, a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some, but for all.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So, Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota!
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So, to those who know him best, to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[18:10:00]
 
HARRIS: To the people -- to the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was congressman.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And to his former high school football players, he was coach.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Coach. Coach.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And, in 91 days --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- the nation will know Coach Walz by another name -- vice president of the United States.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So, America, for some folks, they're just getting to know Coach Walz's story.
 
And I will tell you, he is the proud product of a middle-class family in rural Nebraska.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades as a member of the Army National Guard.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And he went to college on the G.I. Bill.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: He is someone who long before he entered politics worked as a teacher.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: When Coach Walz's and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Coach Walz's taught social studies. Gwen taught English.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: After school, Tim was the linebackers coach for the football team --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- where I have heard the stories about he had a knack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn't even see it in themselves.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything. And, together, they defied the odds -- hear this now -- going from a winless record to the school's first ever state championship.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Coach. Coach.
 
And I will say and I will add, Tim wasn't only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a Gay- Straight Alliance.
 
At a time -- at a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So he signed up to be the group's faculty adviser.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And, as students have said, he made the school a safe place for everybody.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[18:15:00]
 
HARRIS: In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the, quote, most inspiring faculty member.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And, as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- and that every kid deserves. The kind of coach, because he's the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice president he will be.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And that's the kind of vice president America deserves.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So it was Coach Walz's students who actually helped him decide to run for office, and he served 12 years in Congress, representing a purple district, as he reached across the aisle to get things done.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: He was the highest-ranking -- he was the highest-ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee, and he was known as one of Capitol Hill's best marksmen, winning a bipartisan sharpshooting contest year after year.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum wage --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- to protect the freedom of workers to join a union.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And he pass one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- which of course gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans.
 
I'm going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We will win.
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS: Now, let's talk about what we're dealing with on the other side.
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: So on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets a chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act --
 
(BOOING) HARRIS: and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Do you remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.
 
Well Governor Walz and I will not let that happen.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Because we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: As Governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And he refused -- he refused, as Governor, to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[18:20:00]
 
HARRIS: And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things, including when our middle class is strong, America is strong.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal as I am president of the United States.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
So, Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class, and it is a fight for freedom.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: In this moment, we are witnessing a full on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. Take reproductive freedom. Now, think about this. Donald Trump said he wants to punish women.
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: And as a result of his actions today in America, one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban -- one out of three.
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: Some of these bans go back to the 1800s. (BOOING)
 
HARRIS: Even before women had a right to vote. Think about that. Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms -- we're not going back.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
AUDIENCE: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
 
HARRIS: We're not going back.
 
And so let me say about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am president of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will proudly sign it into law.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As governor -- As governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And with Governor Walz's help, when I am president, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We're going to get it done.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do, that we need reasonable gun safety laws in America.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales.
 
(APPLAUSE) HARRIS: And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Through his work, Tim, he, you know, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I'm telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one.
 <br>[18:25:01]
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: In fact -- in fact, when you compare his resume --
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
HARRIS: Shall we? To Trump's running mate --
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: -- well, well, some might say it's like --
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: It's like a matchup between the varsity team and the J.V. squad.
 
(CHEERING)
 
HARRIS: So, Pennsylvania, ultimately in this election, we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country, a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law?
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
 
(BOOING)
 
HARRIS: And here is the beauty of our democracy. We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people!
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: That -- that is how we preserve the promise of America. And after all, you know, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California -- (APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: -- who was raised by a working mother. The other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: It's the promise of America. Because only in America, only in America, is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Only in America. Only in America.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Only in America.
 
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
 
HARRIS: That's right. That's right. And so Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: He and I, we both know, the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: When we look at folks, we see in our fellow Americans, neighbors, not enemies. Not enemies.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: So my promise to you is this. Our campaign will reach out to everyone, from red states to blue states.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: From the heartland to the coast, in rural, urban, suburban, and tribal communities.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[18:30:00]
 
HARRIS: And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And so, with Tim Walz by my side, and with all of you at our side, let us fight for the promise of our future.
 
And with that, I ask Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard?
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: Do we believe in Freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it?
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
HARRIS: And when we fight, we win. And now, welcome the next vice president of the United States, Tim Walz.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Wow.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: Thank you. Wow. Thank you, Philadelphia.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: I'm thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug, this incredible journey. And Pennsylvania, I know you know this, but my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Holy hell. Can this guy bring the fire? He can bring the fire. This is a visionary leader. Also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And I think sometimes we forget and you see people a little one dimensional, but seeing a guy who cares so deeply about his family, a man with compassion, vision. And I'll have to tell you this, I know this from experience -- there is no one you would rather go to a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than him, than that guy.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
AUDIENCE: Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!
 
WALZ: Bruce.
 
And I can't wait for all of you and America to get to know my incredible wife, Gwen, a 29-year public school educator.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Don't ever underestimate teachers.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And our two beautiful kids, Hope and Gus. I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket, and to help Vice President Harris become what we all know is very, very good for us to think about -- the next president of the United States of America.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, attorney general of the great state of California, a United States senator and vice president of the United States --
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: -- Vice President Harris has fought on the side of the American people. She took on the predators. She took on the fraudsters. She took down the transnational gangs. She stood up against powerful corporate interests. And she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And I want all of you to hold this. And don't ever underestimate the power of this, she does it all with a sense of joy.
 <br>[18:35:03]
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived in Butte, a small town of 400, where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us, show generosity towards your neighbors and work for a common good.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: My dad served in the Army during the Korean War. With his encouragement, at 17, I joined the Army National Guard.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: The National Guard gave me purpose. It gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves.
 
And just as it did for my dad and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: My dad was a teacher. My brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps.
 
Three out of four of us married teachers.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: What we do.
 
For nearly 20 years, I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies and coaching football.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Including winning that state championship. Thank you.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Don't ever close the yearbook. Don't ever.
 
But it was my students. They encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them, a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference.
 
So in 2006 -- 2006, I took a leap and I ran for Congress.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And because high school teachers are super optimistic, I was running in a district that had one Democrat since 1892.
 
Well, my neighbors graced me with an opportunity to represent them in the United States House of Representatives.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: I'm proud of the work we did there together. I worked across the aisle on veterans issues, on agriculture, and on ways to grow rural economies.
 
I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And now as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I bring those experiences to bear in tackling the challenges that are facing our great state.
 
Minnesota's strength comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capital. And now, Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Now Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Again and again and again, trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division. And that's to say nothing of his record as president.
 
He froze in the face of the COVID crisis. He drove our economy into the ground. And make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 <br>[18:40:00]
 
WALZ: That's not even counting the crimes he committed.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: You know, some of us --
 
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
 
WALZ: Some of us --
 
AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
 
WALZ: Some of us -- some of us in here are old enough to remember -- I see you down there. I see those old white guys.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor's office.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there is a golden rule -- mind your own damn business.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: These guys are after my heart, chanting "mind your own damn business." That feels good, so thank you.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: Look, that includes IVF. And this gets personal for me and my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments. And I remember praying every night for a call for good news. The pit in my stomach when the phone rang and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked. So it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: When vice president and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And for our children to be free to go to school without worrying they'll be shot dead in their classrooms.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: By the way, as you heard, I was one of the best shots in Congress. But in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment. But we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: Vice President Harris' idea of freedom is a ticket for education to be that ticket to the middle class. Not crippling debt, air that's clean, water that's pure, communities that are safe.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: A place where we settle our political differences not through violence, but with our votes. And that is what this election is about, what direction will this country go in?
 
AUDIENCE: We're not going back!
 
WALZ: We're not going back. Well, Donald Trump would damn sure take us backwards, let's be clear about that.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: And don't believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict our freedoms.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: To rig the economy to help the super-rich.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: If Trump gets the chance to return, he's going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago. Only this time it will be much, much worse. Raising costs on the middle-class family. He will repeal the Affordable Care Act, no doubt about it.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: He'll will gut Social Security and Medicare.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: And when somebody tells you who they are, believe them. He said he'll ban abortion across this country, and he'll do it, whether or not Congress is there or not.
 
(BOOING)
 <br>[18:45:00]
 
WALZ: Donald Trump is not fighting for you or your family. He never -- he never sat at that kitchen table like the one I grew up at, wondering how we're going to pay the bills. He's at his country club up in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends.
 
And I've got to tell you, his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda for this country.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: J.D. Vance literally, literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda.
 
(BOOING)
 
WALZ: Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, J.D. studied at Yale...
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
WALZ: ...had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That's not what middle America is. And I've got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up, so.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: You see what I did there? Look, I got to tell you, pointing out just an observation of mine that I made, I just have to say it. You know it, you feel it -- these guys are creepy, and yes, just weird as hell. That's what you see.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: That's what you see.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: So, you know what's out there. So, say it with me, we aren't going back.
 
AUDIENCE: We're going back! We are not going back! We are not going back!
 
WALZ: So, we got 91 days. My God, that's easy. We'll sleep when we're dead.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: Over those next 91 days and every day in the White House, I'll have Vice President Harris' back. Every single day.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
WALZ: And we'll have yours.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: You know how this works; we can't do it alone. We need you, each and every one of you.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: Go over to KamalaHarris.com, get on board, because we need you. Freedom to make our own choices. This leader, this compassionate, careful, joyous leader, believes in each and every one of you.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: My God, you came here tonight to sit (ph) at the very top because you love this country, and you're not going back.
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: She believes in the opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. She believes in the promise of America. We just got to fight. We just got to fight. Because as soon-to-be President Harris says, when we fight, we win.
 
CROWD: We win!
 
(CHEERING)
 
WALZ: Thank you, Philadelphia. Thank you, Vice President. God bless America!

JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Tim and Gwen Walz, Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff, the Democratic residential and vice presidential ticket, and would-be first spouse and second spouse, and a packed arena here in north Philadelphia, the Liacouras Stadium.
 
Vice President Harris, introducing her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, to an ebullient crowd here in Philadelphia. And he came out swinging against Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, calling them weird and creepy. 
 
Harris kicking off their first joint rally calling Walz a leader and a fighter who will help move the country forward. We have been watching it all from inside the arena at this landmark moment in this roller coaster of a ride on the way to the White House.
 
Kasie Hunt, four weeks ago, who could have imagined that this was where we were going to be?
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: The voters were trying to tell us all along that something was going to happen. If the Biden Trump rematch could simply not be how this was going to go down in low and behold, they were right. And here we are today and I think you saw on display here why it was that Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate. 
 
He clearly -- the folksy charm was on display. You could really see how the crowd lit up, especially at his jabs at the Trump-Vance ticket. He and Harris both had to call him the crowd doubt a little bit when they started to chant "lock him up". Clearly, there were energized guys by the idea that Donald Trump is a convicted felon. 
 
Tim Walz went there and cracked a joke about the rumors that J.D. Vance inappropriately related to a couch, which I think caught a lot of eyes, raised a lot eyebrows, but in a campaign that's focused on Gen Z and trying to figure out how to break through a very difficult media environment, I think you saw why Walz is somebody that she chose. 
 
I also think you saw why it's Walz and not Shapiro. I mean, Shapiro clearly much more comfortable being number one. Walz seemed pretty comfortable being here as her number two in a way that seemed to lift her up, underscore the message she was making while not overshadowing her in any way. TAPPER: It's very interesting, Audie Cornish, right off the bat. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, taking the opportunity to introduce himself to the American people by laying out his autobiography, including his wife and his fertility struggles, where they had a daughter, Hope, through IVF, which his counterpart, Republican Senator J.D. Vance has expressed issues about. 
 
AUDIE CORNISH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think one of the things that's interesting is Tim Walz is trying to connect with people. You don't have to be a woman to be interested in the issue of IVF. You don't have to be a woman to be interested in a variety of caregiving issues of the campaign is about and he's interesting because he tries to find a way to connect with people look and sound like him.
 
I also want to bring up this idea we talked about Gen Z a lot. We maybe should think of it a little differently, like the Z is for zeitgeist, and this is a pair of people right now, this is a campaign that is seizing on culture, humor to make its voice. And usually can names leave that up to "SNL", right? They don't take that on themselves.
 
He made jokes, right? He had energy, was just like a completely different vibe than a Joe Biden or the way a Kamala Harris had to perform next to Joe Biden.
 
TAPPER: Dana Bash, we are here in Philly at the Liacouras Stadium and I have to say and I'm told that they give these out or you can buy them at like Taylor Swift concerts. I'm sure you see them on the screen, these glowing, alternatingly red and blue bracelets that people are wearing.
 
I know I sound 100 years old when I'm saying this, but I am. I am 100 years old. But let me just say, I've never been to a political rally where -- where they were giving out to people. So that the auditorium almost in as if it's planned -- 
 
HUNT: They light up in unison, right?
 
TAPPER: They light up in unison.
 <br>[18:55:00]
 
So it's all red and it's all blue, it's all red. It's all blue. It's very cool. 
 
Again, I'm 100 years old. I understand that, but I've never seen -- politics is as they say, downstream from culture, right? We're always the last ones just wants to get it and -- 
 
HUNT: Sometimes, yes.
 
TAPPER: And they don't have these at Dave Matthews concerts I'll say, but it's pretty interesting terms of how much this campaign as opposed to Biden-Harris, how much, Dana, Harris Walz is leaning into Gen Z culturally and you know, bracelet wise, also.
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Never mind the fact that Gen X was completely overlooked here. 
 
Jake, I -- my takeaway from your estimate, was that you and I have to go to a concert together because the last one I went to with was -- 
 
TAPPER: Presumably you -- 
 
BASH: -- with Coldplay and they had -- they had the bracelets. But let's -- let's stay focus on what we just saw there. Because I think your point is -- 
 
HUNT: -- dying over here, guys. 
 
BASH: Your point is -- 
 
TAPPER: I'm not sure about the Coldplay, but okay. Yes, yeah. OK.
 
BASH: OK. We're going to take that discussion offline. Look, what we just saw -- 
 
TAPPER: Yes. You could take me to Chumbawamba anytime you want, Dana. I appreciate it.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: What we just was there and you felt it, and you could feel it.
 
TAPPER: -- concert on air. It's very strange.
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
BASH: Well, we just saw aside from the conversation about the random concerts that we are going to go to is what Jake just talked about, which is the unmistakable energy in that arena and that is an energy that the Democratic Party has been desperate for the sense of relief that there are grass roots voters and not even grassroots voters, just people who want to get out and participate, who feel energized to be able to do that and that was extremely clear in what we just saw in that arena in Philadelphia, there. 
 
And as we talked to our terrific panel here, I just want to say that listening to it, Kamala Harris and listening to the way that she prosecuted the case, so to speak, in ways that we've heard before but then seeing her in the sort of front position with somebody taking the back seat to her the way she has been, the position that she has been in for four years -- 
 
DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. 
 
BASH: -- and having the woman in front which we have seen once before in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the first woman to be at the top of the ticket was imagery and a sensibility that I think we should take a moment to talk about.
 
AXELROD: Yeah, well, listen, there's no doubt about it. You know, we were talking earlier among ourselves about ease with which Kamala Harris has kind of taken up this role. We remember her as a candidate in the past, less so. She seems very comfortable playing the lead role here. 
 
I'm struck by how comfortable Tim Walz seen in this role. You know, being name to a national ticket is a little bit like getting shot out of a cannon. You really don't know what you're getting into. 
 
I mean, this wasn't small town Minnesota here. He's stepped into a maelstrom and its going to be a maelstrom from here on. But this was a value-laden event. 
 
The energy was incredible. That is obvious, and I'm sure if Donald Trump is watching, he's got crowd envy right now, and a little bit of concern.
 
But every speech and particularly Kamala Harris's speech and Tim Walz's speech was very much centered in economic, middle-class, economic issues. 
 
BASH: Yes.
 
AXELROD: And that is -- that is where they need to be and the sense of picking Walz was reflected in that he doesn't bring a state, but he brings a state of mind.
 
BASH: Yes. 
 
AXELROD: And he brings an experience -- 
 
BASH: And the kind of voter.
 
AXELROD: -- and that is very, very palpable. 
 
BASH: And, Ashley, I was talking to somebody who knows Tim Walz well, who spoke to him along the lines of what Ax was just saying about being shot out of a cannon, saying as much as you can, stay true to yourself. 
 
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah.
 
BASH: Be yourself, and don't let the thin oxygen where you're going to be up in the stratosphere, get to you.
 
ALLISON: And I think that's what you're seeing and why people are resonating with it. There's an authenticity -- authenticity nature to it.
 
To the bracelets that you got at the Renaissance tour or the Eras tour, that's the cultural reference, and Beyonce "Freedom" song that she walked out -- 
 
BASH: Right.
 
ALLISON: -- to some of the biggest pop culture icons in the world, helping to lift up this campaign, telling the story of self, a daughter of immigrants, but also a former teacher, and a climate when teachers or so under attack.</pre>
