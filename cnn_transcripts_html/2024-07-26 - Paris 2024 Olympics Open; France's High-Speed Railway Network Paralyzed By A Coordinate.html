PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: And a very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Paula Newton in for Isa Soares. Tonight, the 2024 Paris 
 
 Olympics now officially open, an amazing ceremony happening at this hour along the River Seine. But the big event is happening against the backdrop 
 
 of travel, chaos as France's high-speed rail network is paralyzed by a coordinated attack. 
 
And Israel's Prime Minister has made his way to Mar-a-Lago, meeting with former U.S. President Donald Trump, who just attacked Kamala Harris for 
 
 comments she made after their meeting with Netanyahu yesterday. Now, we do want to take you, in fact, straight to Florida where Donald Trump is 
 
 rolling out the red carpet for Israel's Prime Minister at Mar-a-Lago. 
 
Now, Benjamin Netanyahu is looking to rekindle his relationship with the Republican presidential nominee as the U.S. election quickly approaches in 
 
 the war in Gaza reaches a critical point. The two spoke to reporters after this war meeting. You see them beforehand along with Netanyahu's wife, 
 
 Sara. 
 
The next video you'll see is dark, but their words are quite clear. Both taking a dig at Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting her remarks 
 
 Thursday could hurt chances for a ceasefire deal. Listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL: We're trying to get one, and I think to the extent that Hamas understands that there's no red line between 
 
 Israel and United States. That expedites the deal, and I hope that those comments -- we'll check that. 
 
DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think her remarks were disrespectful. They weren't very nice, pertaining to Israel. I actually 
 
 don't know how a person who is Jewish can vote for her. But that's up to them. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: We want to get more now on all of this from CNN's Alex Marquardt, he is following this story from Washington. You've also been following 
 
 these ceasefire talks quite closely for months. I mean, how consequential is this meeting and those comments, quite frankly, not just from at least 
 
 politics, but of course, the presidential campaign.   
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think those are the two separate tracks we're really following closely here. So, 
 
 Netanyahu going down to Mar-a-Lago to speak with Trump, meet with his team, perhaps mend fences because that relationship has been a bit rocky.
 
Essentially, what Netanyahu is doing is hedging his bets about who may win the presidential race in November. And then, separately, of course, the 
 
 future of the war in Gaza, Trump and then the Biden administration have two very separate takes on this. Trump has said that he wants Israel to wrap it 
 
 up as soon as possible, get it all done. 
 
That Israel is suffering from a PR standpoint. What wrapping it up actually means, we don't know. Trump really hasn't laid out a vision for how he 
 
 would like Israel to end this war and Hamas to end this war. While the White House, the Biden-Harris administration, they would like this war to 
 
 end today. 
 
They would love for a ceasefire to go into effect immediately. And last night, after her meeting with Netanyahu, Vice President Harris came out and 
 
 spoke to reporters in a speech that was very forceful. It laid out the standard administration remarks about the ironclad support of Israel and 
 
 its right to defend itself. 
 
But then she's spoken in very moving terms about the plight of Palestinians and the suffering of Palestinians. And those remarks are clearly not going 
 
 over well with Netanyahu and his team. Earlier today, we heard a senior Israeli official anonymously say that they were problematic, and that they 
 
 could create daylight between the U.S. and Israel that Hamas would look to exploit. 
 
And that's exactly what Netanyahu just said there on the record, although he said it more questioning way, saying, I hope it doesn't have an impact. 
 
 But I think, Paula, this is a negotiating tactic, this is Israel playing hardball. We know that the U.S. has been -- or the administration has been 
 
 trying to get Netanyahu across the line to agree to a ceasefire. 
 <br>[14:05:00] 
 
And we've just confirmed that in the coming days, there will be a high- level meeting in Rome. The U.S. delegation led by the CIA director, this could happen as soon as Sunday to really try to finalize this deal, Paula.   
 
NEWTON: Yes, Alex, and if I hear you, you know, you're saying that this perhaps may not have a material effect on the talks as they stand right 
 
 now. I think it is worth replaying just what Kamala Harris said after her meeting with Netanyahu. Let's listen in for a moment.     
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. So, to everyone who 
 
 has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: You know, Alex, that issue here now though, is this campaign. And you know, hedging their bets is probably not a good foreign policy routine 
 
 for Benjamin Netanyahu. Right now, this election is far too close to call. No one would ever guess as to who will be the next president. And yet he 
 
 felt comfortable certainly taking a shot at Kamala Harris next to President Trump.   
 
MARQUARDT: Yes, and I think that's rather remarkable. I mean, we should just say it, Paula, that, you know, visiting the opposition in a country is 
 
 not unique to Netanyahu. We just saw Viktor Orban come through the U.S., he went down to Mar-a-Lago as well. And we know that President Zelenskyy has 
 
 spoken with Donald Trump as well. 
 
So, this is what other countries do. This is what the United States does. They speak with the opposition. But of course, this is extremely high-
 
 profile and it comes at a very important moment both in Israel and here in the United States because of this election. But I completely agree with 
 
 you, when you -- when you look at the anticipation for this Netanyahu trip to the United States, there was a lot of concern in the Biden 
 
 administration that he would take shots at the White House and be critical of them as he was back in 2015 when he spoke to Congress. 
 
That didn't really happen. It was -- he praised the Biden administration during that speech, during his meeting yesterday with President Biden, they 
 
 were all smiles and complementary of each other. The only thing that you could really point to is Netanyahu saying to Congress that he wishes that 
 
 the U.S. would fast-track the weapons so that they can -- you know, they can finish the job faster. 
 
But you're absolutely right that these are the most pointed comments towards the administration, and that's really because Harris decided to 
 
 ratchet it up, and she -- her team will say that these are things that she's said in the past, but she's saying -- in this context, right after a 
 
 meeting with Netanyahu at this moment in time when they want to get the ceasefire deal done, these were very forceful remarks. 
 
I would argue they are the most forceful remarks out of this administration since the war began. Now, we know what Netanyahu was like, he's certainly 
 
 not going to take this lying down. So, he is what we're seeing here is pushing back. And I would just note finally, you know, the U.S. really 
 
 wants to see this ceasefire deal accomplished, at the same time, Netanyahu in his speech, he didn't mention the words ceasefire deal. 
 
So, they're really not necessarily on the same page. And we've heard that criticism from the Israeli population and Israeli opposition leaders that 
 
 Netanyahu doesn't actually want a deal. So, we'll see what happens at that meeting in the coming days, whether this actually come to fruition, 
 
 whether, you know, a pause in the fighting can actually happen, those hostages get home to their families. Paula.   
 
NEWTON: It is certainly, caps a tumultuous visit by Benjamin Netanyahu, and I have to say, disheartening for the families of the hostages or those 
 
 people in Gaza right now who desperately need a ceasefire. Alex Marquardt for us, always appreciate you jumping on just to kind of parse what have 
 
 been extraordinary events this week. Really appreciate it. 
 
Now, as the world awaits for Vice President Kamala Harris to announce her running mate, two of the biggest names in U.S. politics are now officially 
 
 in her corner.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
HARRIS: Hey!
 
MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: Hey, there. 
 
HARRIS: Hi, you're both together, oh, it's good to hear you both.
 
M. OBAMA: I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.
 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We called to say -- Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we 
 
 can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: Yes, that was former U.S. President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama and joining a long list of top Democrats now endorsing 
 
 the Vice President's White House bid. The former President did not immediately announced his endorsement after President Joe Biden's 
 
 withdrawal. 
 
Instead, he waited until enough delegates gave their support, putting Harris on track in fact to clinch the party's nomination, and that is 
 
 likely to happen next month. OK, and later in the hour, CNN's Michael Smerconish will join the show to talk about those crucial swing state votes 
 
 and a historic week in U.S. politics. 
 
You don't want to miss that. Now, back to Paris, where heightened security along with some unexpected headaches for both spectators and athletes as 
 
 the Paris Summer games now officially are underway. The opening ceremony started a short time ago, although not long after a string of attacks on 
 
 railways that French authorities are describing as coordinated sabotage. 
 <br>[14:10:00]
 
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, which in fact included arson. The French state railway company says high-speed lines were 
 
 impacted and several of its facilities damaged. It estimated that a quarter of a million travelers could be affected on day one of the games alone. CNN 
 
 senior international correspondent Melissa Bell has more now from Paris.      
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything. But it was at 4:00 a.m. hours from 
 
 the opening ceremony that coordinated sabotage and arson caused chaos.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was deliberate, the simultaneous nature, everything 
 
 happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious. 
 
BELL: Security in Paris is tight, with authorities keeping to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out simultaneously 
 
 across the country that was impossible to imagine. No particular group has yet claimed responsibility.
 
(on camera): These are exactly the kinds of images that the organizers of Paris 2024 had hoped to avoid with French authorities warning that it is 
 
 250,000 travelers likely to be impacted this Friday, 800,000 over the course of the weekend.
 
(voice-over): The latest drama likely to dampen the spirits of the French, many of them heading off from family holidays even as Paris Mayor Anne 
 
 Hidalgo believe that enthusiasm for the games had finally gripped the country.   
 
MAYOR ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS, FRANCE (through translator): I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before during the passage of the flame in Paris 
 
 on July 14th and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris, and there were people everywhere, children, elderly people, all social classes. 
 
 Everyone was really happy. And I said to myself that it's the magic of the games working.   
 
BELL: The opening ceremony will still go ahead as planned tonight along the River Seine despite the train attack and the threat of rain, whether it 
 
 will further dampen spirits could depend more on the weather than the turnout. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NEWTON: And in fact, the fact that games are going on right now, Melissa, you join us now from Paris. I mean, I remember you speaking to the mayor in 
 
 that same interview who said she wanted these games to be a symbol of the resilience of Paris. Are they still confident that they can keep these 
 
 games safe?
 
BELL: Yes, absolutely. They said the opening ceremony began with no glitches. It's currently ongoing and pretty spectacular, but look at this 
 
 rain, Paula, this is exactly what the organizers had feared and something the mayor had alluded to only yesterday. 
 
So much of that opening ceremony involves dancers on rooftops. So, it's going to have to be slightly amended. In terms of the security of the 
 
 games, what authorities tell us is that they've heightened security along the railways to try and ensure that they keep a closer eye on what's 
 
 happening along those railway tracks that were so damaged overnight here in France with all of that chaos.   
 
And into now, here at the Gare Montparnasse in Paris, some trains are beginning to come in and beginning to leave again. What we've been hearing 
 
 throughout the day is that in the east where the sabotage attempts east of France, that is where the sabotage attempts were foiled, things got back on 
 
 track much quicker in the rest of France, particularly in the west and the northern part of France, it's been a bit slower, but they're working.   
 
They say round the clock and trying to get the lines up and running again, clearly, very much. The question is now, who could have been responsible 
 
 for this? It's not so much what the organizers of the Paris games might have done to prevent it. Because frankly, there wasn't much they could have 
 
 done in terms of foreseeing this particular series of attacks. 
 
But the question of who acted the way they did and why? Clearly, these were coordinated attacks in several, different, very strategic points by people 
 
 who had very good knowledge in France's railway system, who might be behind them is what we await from the investigation that's now underway, Paula.   
 
NEWTON: Yes, that investigation is so crucial. I know that there is rain, I hope it is not a downpour, and again, the athletes, they're participating 
 
 now in the opening ceremonies. Melissa Bell for us, thanks so much. Senior national security analyst Juliette Kayyem is also in Paris, she's a former 
 
 U.S. assistant Homeland Security Secretary. 
 
You have your umbrella. We are lucky to have you there -- 
 
JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Like to -- 
 
NEWTON: And I have to -- I have to ask you, Juliette, when this happened, what went through your mind -- 
 
KAYYEM: Yes -- 
 
NEWTON: And you know, do you think they should undermine the authorities confidence that they can keep these games safe, and if it doesn't undermine 
 
 that, why not? 
 
KAYYEM: Well, so, I went straight to July 7th in London. The sort of coordinated transportation attacks around a date that was an election there 
 
 or near an election, that was my first worry and the words that were being used, sabotage, I wasn't sure what that was. As we've learned more over the 
 
 course of the last 12 to 14 hours, it is clear that this was highly organized, but not exceptionally sophisticated.  
 <br>[14:15:00] 
 
And we'll get to that in a second. And the silver-lining here is whoever did the sabotage clearly did not want fatalities. It was far away from 
 
 train stations. It was in the early morning. There weren't crowds like there are right now. So that   is sort of the what happened in terms of the 
 
 confidence level. 
 
Look, I mean, there is so much focus on these opening ceremonies and what was happening at the -- on the -- on the river, on the Seine in terms of 
 
 who could get access, who could stay overnight close by, the closing of the bridges, the closing of whole neighborhoods, and then you had to have a QR 
 
 code, I mean, the whole thing has been focused on getting through the next couple of hours. 
 
I'm looking at snipers right now on several rooftops. And I think that, that focus because of the possibility that there would be fatalities was 
 
 probably correct. It's really hard to protect all rail lines. These sabotages were done in the middle of the night, of just sort of areas of 
 
 the railroad that were not necessarily close to station.   
 
So, it's not that this is excusable, but there are things that you really can't necessarily protect even in the midst of an Olympics. I'll tell you 
 
 this, Paula, once they get through tonight, everyone is going to be taking a sigh of relief. I've talked to enough officials here, an international 
 
 law enforcement that's here, this is the night they're worried about. And in a weird way, the rain may help because it's pretty quiet down there. 
 
NEWTON: Understood. And Julia, you've reminded us for so many years that you cannot protect for everything in free and democratic societies. 
 
 Obviously, from what you see and again, we're grateful that you're there. You think this is a pretty tight operation in this city? 
 
KAYYEM: It is. I mean, Olympics are really hard especially here in Paris or any Olympics, you're going to have facilities and venues throughout the 
 
 next two weeks, and then, remember the Paralympics are also -- Paralympics are very much attended. We may not pay as much attention to them. They're 
 
 wildly popular.   
 
So, you have basically a month of multiple venues, multiple threats, worries about everything from cyber to terrorism to the kind of thing that 
 
 we saw today. And so, the biggest worry during an Olympics isn't so much a particular event, it is just sort of, you know, there's so many different 
 
 opportunities in place and time. 
 
It's really hard to keep it secure. I've been impressed with Paris' planning. I've been involved and know about it through variety of means. I 
 
 would have never guessed or let's just say, it's quite vulnerable to have an opening ceremony on the Seine. And I've been impressed about how they've 
 
 protected it, and I was just down there, I went through the security.
 
I'll go back in a little bit, and it was -- it was incredibly strong with lots of police presence. So, I think they'll get tonight covered and then 
 
 the goal is over the next couple of weeks just keep your guard up, keep the threat -- understanding the threat environment and make sure that the city 
 
 can both function, but also hosting Olympics.
 
NEWTON: Yes, exactly. We are -- 
 
KAYYEM: And it's raining more, that's the greatest story. 
 
NEWTON: But we are hoping -- we are hoping for only sporting drama and nothing else at this point in time. And that includes from the weather, I 
 
 hope it behaves for the rest of the weeks of these games. Juliette Kayyem, so good to have you there -- 
 
KAYYEM: I do too -- 
 
NEWTON: I really appreciate it. Thank you.  
 
KAYYEM: Talk to you later, thank you. 
 
NEWTON: Still to come for us tonight in a major blow to Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel, it's alleged the leader is now in U.S. custody and has pleaded 
 
 not guilty. We'll bring you the latest on this dramatic arrest.   
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:21:29]
 
NEWTON: A critical election that could upend the geopolitics in the Americas. Venezuela is holding a presidential election this Sunday after 
 
 years of chronic shortages and one of the worst economic crashes in modern history. Voters will choose whether to keep the current strongman leader 
 
 Nicolas Maduro or one of his rivals including former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez. 
 
Now, despite the opposition building, a strong voter mobilization, questions remain about the fairness of the elections. Argentinean and 
 
 Brazilian observers have canceled their travel plans to be there. Nicolas Maduro said last week that Venezuela might face a bloodbath, in his words, 
 
 if he were not re-elected. 
 
The suspected Mexican drug lord known as El Mayo has pled not guilty in a U.S. federal court in El Paso, Texas. This after his stunning arrest on 
 
 Thursday. El Mayo's real name is Ismael Zambada, and a U.S. official says he thought he was flying to inspect some property, instead, he landed near 
 
 El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested by the FBI. 
 
Now, the video of a small plane guarded by law enforcement was shot near El Paso in New Mexico. El Mayo is the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa 
 
 cartel. He's less flashy than his former colleague Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. But he's been evading authorities for decades, allegedly funneling huge 
 
 quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to U.S. streets.
 
He's also accused of multiple murders, also arrested on Thursday, was walking with Guzman Lopez; the son of El Capo(ph) -- El Chapo, pardon me. 
 
 The operation conducted without involvement from the Mexican government, apparently, and it exploited what we know to be a rift within the Sinaloa 
 
 cartel with El Chapo's son reportedly helping U.S. authorities capture El Mayo. 
 
This case will be felt on both sides of the border. Mexico's President says the arrests are, in his words, progress, but he also wants answers as to 
 
 why he was kept in the dark. We want to bring in our correspondent, Polo Sandoval. We're just beginning to learn details of this, but can you give 
 
 us some perspective, how significant are these arrests? And how disruptive could they be in these drug cartels?  
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Paula, this story is just as significant as it is just truly incredible the way this all unfolded, no 
 
 mistake. This is a significant victory for the U.S. government up until yesterday when Mayo Zambada was detained by authorities near El Paso, he 
 
 was considered one of the most wanted narco bosses south of   the border, that the DEA, that the FBI, the Department of Justice wanted to get their 
 
 hands on these images released by Mexican authorities of both defendants in this case. 
 
You see Mayo Zambada as well as the other individual that was also detained by authorities, which is one of the sons of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. Both 
 
 of them on that plane that landed yesterday -- I'll tell you a little bit more about who Mayo is. He is in his mid 70s here, and often considered, 
 
 Paula, a sort of the elder narco of the situation south of the border here. 
 
It's really one of the last of his generation of narco bosses, very low- profile, just perhaps as powerful as Pablo Escobar during his -- during his day, but not as famous as his partner Joaquin Guzman, who he co-founded the 
 
 Sinaloa cartel with last night when we found out about this actually, re- read an interview that Mayo offered a Mexican publication way back in 2010. 
 <br>[14:25:00] 
 
And in it, he told the reporter that he lived in constant fear of actually getting caught. And went as far as to say that if he ever got caught, he 
 
 would potentially try to take his own life. So, really does speak to just how he lived his life for decades in the constant target of the U.S. 
 
 government and narcotics officers constantly looking over his shoulder. 
 
And now, this incredible development to find out that it was in fact the son of his partner, according to one law enforcement source speaking to 
 
 CNN, that likely gave him up to authorities, hand gave him to authorities, Paula, actually flew on that flight with him when he was still --  when he 
 
 told him that he was going to be -- when he was told that he was going to be visiting a property, but instead, he looked at his window, saw U.S. 
 
 authorities, and that's when he knew that he was about to be taken into custody. 
 
NEWTON: Yes, being flown into the United States if you could imagine.
 
SANDOVAL: Right -- 
 
NEWTON: I mean, the intrigue continues here though. Could this mean that there is already a plea deal in the works for El Chapo's son?
 
SANDOVAL: You know, covering Chapo Guzman' trial in late 2018, early 2019, we saw some of those government   witnesses of the fellow cartel members 
 
 take the stand against Chapo. So, you'll find that the prevailing theme of these cases is really betrayal, right?  
 
And that is what is certainly at play here according to what we're hearing from investigators that -- so, it won't be until this case potentially goes 
 
 to trial here after that, no guilty plea that was entered that we may potentially find out if the son of this man that you see here, which is 
 
 again the partner of the man that was just detained, if he actually worked out a deal with the authorities. 
 
It's certainly would not be surprising, but it is not. And I need to be clear, not something that the Department of Justice has confirmed yet, but 
 
 it certainly wouldn't be surprising given what we have seen and in other criminal proceedings in the past with many of these cartel members choosing 
 
 to actually work with authorities instead of getting chased by them.  
 
NEWTON: Yes, it is incredible really this story, and we won't know obviously as you say until these cases wind their way through now American 
 
 -- 
 
SANDOVAL: Right -- 
 
NEWTON: Courts. Polo, thanks so much, we know you'll stay on top of it, appreciate it -- 
 
SANDOVAL: Thanks, Paula. 
 
NEWTON: Now, hot dry weather is fueling wildfires in the western United States and parts of Canada. These scenes are from California where the Park 
 
 Wildfire rages. It's been scorching an area greater than the size of the city of Atlanta, if you can believe it. And firefighters in Oregon in the 
 
 meantime are battling the nation's largest blaze as dense smoke closes some roads. 
 
And then we go to Canada where a fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing from Jasper in Alberta, where flames 
 
 devastated nearly half of the town's buildings. Just devastating for all those who lived there and beyond. Still to come for us tonight -- 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
JOHN KING, CNN: Show of hands if you think Harris can win in Pennsylvania? So -- 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
NEWTON: I want to see this. Our John King sits down with older voters in one key swing state to get their view on Kamala Harris' rising to the top 
 
 of the Democratic ticket. Plus, security issues aren't stopping the opening of the Olympic games, we'll head back to Paris to get that.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:31:49]
 
NEWTON: You know, not an exaggeration to say it has been a truly historic week in U.S. politics, with Kamala Harris becoming the Democrats' likely 
 
 nominee for president. Her campaign has been re-energized. It's re- energized lawmakers in the party, top donors. But what do voters think? 
 
CNN's John King spoke with older Democratic voters in the key swing state of Pennsylvania to get their thoughts. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here we go.
 
JOHN KING, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mahjong requires focus, patience, a clear strategy to build matching sets of tiles. Changing course 
 
 deep into the game is risky, but sometimes even experienced players see no choice but to try. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I have your joker, please? Oh, OK. Heads up. 
 
KING: See how easy it is to swap out a candidate in the middle of the game? 
 
KING (voice-over): This game ends in a draw. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody wins.
 
KING (voice-over): And a visitor brings up another big change. 
 
KING: Show of hands if you think Harris can win Pennsylvania. So you're more optimistic now than you were with President Biden leading the ticket. 
 
 There's a head shake. 
 
PAMELA ALTA, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: No. 
 
KING: Tell me why.
 
ALTA: No. I don't think a lot of men will vote for Harris. I just don't. Whether you're Democrat, Republican, whatever, I just don't think the 
 
 majority of men are ready for a female president. 
 
KING: These three hands went up pretty quickly. So do you have more energy and enthusiasm about the campaign now? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my God, yes.
 
KING: One more time. Show of hands. Who wants to see them debate? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yes.
 
KING: Darrell Ann Murphy are bursting with energy. Suddenly, they see at least a chance to win battleground Pennsylvania and keep Donald Trump out 
 
 of the White House. 
 
DARRELL ANN MURPHY, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: I don't even like to hear the word Trump.
 
KING: What do you call him? 
 
MURPHY: The monster. 
 
KING (voice-over): At this same table five months ago, three of the four thought President Biden was up to the job and they called criticism of his 
 
 age unfair. But they began to see things that worried them. Biden's debate debacle left no doubt. 
 
MURPHY: From experience, I know how quickly things can go downhill when you are an older person. 
 
KING (voice-over): Now a new challenge.
 
MURPHY: You know, she -- she's at the perfect age. She's committed. She's vigorous. And I, overwhelmingly the women I talk to are let's go. Let's go.
 
KING (voice-over): Civil rights activist Marvin Boyer organized the black history display at this museum in downtown Easton. The debate changed his 
 
 mind, too. And in Harris, Boyer sees what was missing in Biden.
 
MARVIN BOYER, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: You have to be aggressive because he's coming after you. And I think she's up to the challenge in that regard. 
 
KING (voice-over): The winner here in Northampton County tends to be the winner statewide. Every vote matters. 
 
BOYER: It also reenergizes a strong constituency of the Democratic Party, meaning black females. So I think it's a good thing in that regard.
 
KING: Do you think America is ready to elect a woman of color its president? 
 
BOYER: There's still racism, misogyny in this country in 2024. No question. 
 <br>[14:35:00]
 
Well, can we overcome it with this election enough that she can be elected? I hope so.
 
KING (voice-over): Geology professor Lawrence Malinconico changed his mind after the debate, too. His wife donated to Harris as soon as the news 
 
 broke. And Malinconico believes students will be much more energized now.
 
LAWRENCE MALINCONICO, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: There's an acceptable choice now when before I think there was real skepticism about the viability of 
 
 President Biden for another four years.
 
KING: Do you think she could win Pennsylvania? 
 
MALINCONICO: I hope so. I think part of it will depend on her choice of vice president. 
 
KING: Do you think the country's ready for that? A woman of color as president? 
 
MALINCONICO: I hope so. I'm a little nervous about that. 
 
KING: Are you looking forward to Harris debating Trump? 
 
MALINCONICO: Absolutely. 
 
KING: Why? 
 
MALINCONICO: I'm hoping she'll just eat him alive.
 
KING (voice-over): Pat Levin became politically active in the 1940s during FDR's third term. 
 
PAT LEVIN, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: So, no, I've never seen anything like this. 
 
KING (voice-over): She's just a few weeks from 95. Performance, not age, is Levin's test. And she sadly came to see President Biden couldn't pass it 
 
 anymore. 
 
LEVIN: I love him. I think he has been just wonderful. But he is definitely impaired in terms of his thinking, in terms of his presentation, in terms 
 
 of his energy. 
 
KING (voice-over): Simple advice for Harris.
 
LEVIN: Get into those swing states and show her enthusiasm and her stamina and her strength and be able to communicate strongly. 
 
KING (voice-over): And one defining issue, if anyone, seeks her wisdom. 
 
LEVIN: It's democracy. It's our actual -- this might be our last free and fair election if we don't win it. We cannot afford to lose this election. 
 
 For the American people.
 
KING (voice-over): A big twist at crunch time. In what, for Pat Levin, will be presidential vote number 19. 
 
John King, CNN, Easton, Pennsylvania.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NEWTON: Now to take a closer look at how the race is shaping up in those crucial swing states in this unprecedented week, truly unprecedented in 
 
 U.S. politics. Michael Smerconish, we are so happy to have you with us. You are a CNN political commentator and, of course, host of CNN's Smerconish.
 
You do join me from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. So we're going to ask you, we're going to get right to business here. Looking at key battleground 
 
 states, Michael, we know the head-to-head contest is quite close.
 
But if we look at battleground states, do you believe Kamala Harris can make a difference in those states? And if so, which ones? 
 
MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: If she selects Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, I think that she's got a shot of winning 
 
 Pennsylvania. I thought that John King's report a moment ago was excellent. I can't improve on any of it.
 
I think her choice really is Mark Kelly in Arizona. I don't know if Kelly can give her what's necessary to close the gap in that state. I think that 
 
 Josh Shapiro probably can in Pennsylvania.
 
It's a more narrow margin. And I think it puts, Paula, added emphasis on those Rust Belt states among the battleground states. Georgia, which seemed 
 
 like it was moving beyond the reach of President Biden, could be in play.
 
North Carolina, again, because of the minority population of each of those states. Nevada, because of the Hispanic population. And Arizona, as I 
 
 referenced. So I'm thinking more emphasis on the Sun Belt states among those that you just put on the screen, and perhaps less emphasis on the 
 
 Mid-Atlantic states. 
 
NEWTON: So you've already skipped to my last question for you. And I'm going to put you on the spot then. Do you believe she should pick the 
 
 governor of Pennsylvania? Or do you believe she should pick Senator Mark Kelly or someone else? Who do you think she will pick? And who do you think 
 
 she should pick? 
 
SMERCONISH: As a pure political matter, if you're asking me what would most enhance the ticket, Shapiro. I think that Josh Shapiro brings a lot to the 
 
 table. And I think that my home state of Pennsylvania, it's kind of nice.
 
I feel like I'm living in Iowa or New Hampshire every four years, because there's such attention that's being heaped on us. But I think Shapiro is a 
 
 great pick for those reasons. Now, Shapiro would help in Pennsylvania.
 
The resume of Mark Kelly is like central casting. You don't do better than having an astronaut, you know, on your ticket. So I can also see the 
 
 argument for Kelly. But it's one or the other I would think that she'll select. 
 
NEWTON: So interesting. And apparently, we're going to find out quite soon, first week of August.
 
OK, you do polling of your own. Of course, it's not scientific. But you get impressive engagement. Three of four people believe that the enthusiasm for 
 
 Harris will continue. But I want your survey, Michael, your survey of one. I mean, you remember her campaign in the 2020 race was weak.
 
For years, she seemed to underperform even as vice president. What's changed? What do you think can keep this up? 
 <br>[14:40:02]
 
SMERCONISH: So I think people are seeing her as a fresh face. You know that the polling data for a long time has said that most Americans, roughly two 
 
 thirds, they didn't want either of these choices when it was Biden and when it was Trump.
 
So she benefits from being the new kid on the block, if you will. And the sea change of where we are today in comparison to one week ago today, one 
 
 week ago today, Trump had survived the assassination attempt.
 
I thought they had a near flawless convention. The Republicans, he spoke too long. But otherwise, I thought the convention was well, he was leading 
 
 in every battleground state and he was winning handily in the national surveys, which are important, but they aren't outcome determinative because 
 
 of the way we select our presidents.
 
And now the enthusiasm has completely shifted in the direction of the Democrats, but there's still so many things that are about to transpire, 
 
 not the least of which a debate. If there is one, I think there will be.
 
Donald Trump is going to get sentenced before this election runs its course in the New York case for which he's been convicted. Hunter Biden, less 
 
 important a figure without Joe, but I'm sure much will be made about that trial when it gets underway in September. And so many intangibles, as I 
 
 like to say to my radio audience, people whose names we don't know today, events that we could never imagine are about to unfold.
 
NEWTON: And I can't resist, Armando Iannucci, who is the producer of Veep, has an editorial in the New York Times today. And he had so much attention 
 
 placed on him. People remember that show from HBO. He - quoting him. "What worries me is that does that politics has become so much like entertainment 
 
 that the first thing we do to make sense of the moment is to test it against a sitcom." Michael, how do we make sense of these moments? It has 
 
 been a dizzying couple of weeks.
 
SMERCONISH: Our last president was a reality television star. I think that that assessment is accurate insofar as it says that there's a cultural 
 
 component to this. And to the extent that people are looking at the Julie Louis Dreyfus sitcom and saying that they like that show and Kamala Harris 
 
 reminds them of that individual.
 
It's not a bad thing for her. I mean, I'm constantly reminding myself that while I'm eating, sleeping and drinking all of this pertaining to the 
 
 election, most Americans are not. And frankly, they are just now starting to dial in.
 
NEWTON: And it is such a good point that we forget so many times as we continue to parse so many incredible developments. Michael Smerconish, come 
 
 back early and often. We always love to hear from you. And we'll continue to listen to your viewers that you pull so often as well. Thanks so much. 
 
SMERCONISH: Thank you for saying that. I'd be happy to. 
 
NEWTON: And still to come for us tonight, yes, let the games officially begin. The opening ceremony for the Summer Olympics happening now. We will 
 
 have a live report. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[14:45:40]
 
NEWTON: Fast fashion, which is produced quickly and inexpensively, has skyrocketed over the last two decades, but it comes, I'm going to have to 
 
 remind you, at a huge cost to the environment.
 
In New York, one fashion designer is paving the runway for a more sustainable future. Lynda Kinkade has our story. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
GABRIELA HEARST, FOUNDER &amp; CREATIVE DIRECTOR, GABRIELA HEARST: If I go to my childhood, my mother had a very small wardrobe. The idea of making 
 
 clothes was an art and something that takes time. And so really having few but special pieces is a part of the philosophy of what I believe in, which 
 
 is the opposite of fast fashion. 
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Luxury sustainable fashion designer Gabriela Hearst grew up on an off-grid ranch in Uruguay. Though 
 
 she didn't go into her family's farming business, she took everything she learned and applied it to her eponymous label. 
 
HEARST: A ranch is a circularity. You don't throw anything away. You have to see where you can put it, right? And you always find ways to repurpose 
 
 things. And I really decided that Gabriela Hearst, it had to be better made. It had to be conscious about who is making it and the materials that 
 
 we're using.
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Founded in 2015, her brand champions low-impact and recycled textiles. 
 
HEARST: And here you have a mix of wool with a bit of cashmere make it look like it's fur. I prefer wool. Wool is one of the most sustainable fibers 
 
 one can use. Wool can be knitted in the finest of microns. And it's one of the materials that we've used throughout our human history. So yes, 
 
 exploring natural materials, repurposing of materials. And then the second part is really who's making your product. 
 
One of the most proud and long-term collaboration has been with Manos del Uruguay, which is a co-op in my country. We know that empowering women 
 
 empower communities. 
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Beyond the clean fabrics and ethical sourcing, the brand's packaging is also sustainable. 
 
HEARST: We wanted to take all plastic out of our supply chain. And we did recycle hangers made out of cardboard. Then the other we use is TIPA, which 
 
 is biodegradable packaging. 
 
KINKADE (voice-over): And in 2019, she put on the world's first carbon neutral runway show.
 
HEARST: Just again, farming mentality of common sense. How can we reduce something? 
 
KINKADE (voice-over): Hearst says she has the conviction to keep moving the needle in sustainable fashion. But she says it will take a collective 
 
 effort.
 
HEARST: There's responsibility on the consumer, but there's a responsibility on government, in policy. And I think there's a conscious 
 
 change that's happening. So I'm hopeful because of that.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
NEWTON: Now, for more stories from this series, you can visit cnn.com/goinggreen. 
 
OK, still to come for us, the opening ceremony for the Summer Olympics now underway. We are live in Paris with the highlights.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 <br>[14:51:30]
 
NEWTON: Celebrities, spectators, and yes, even Snoop Dogg, they're all on hand right now for the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Paris. 
 
 Now, massive train delays have plagued travelers trying to get to the City of Light or out of the City of Light after what authorities are calling a 
 
 premeditated coordinated attack. 
 
There's also, of course, the bad weather to contend with. It has not dampened spirits, I can report, as thousands celebrate the world's top 
 
 athletes. Now, the opening ceremony is taking place, of course, along the River Seine. It's the first time the event has taken place outside of a 
 
 stadium.
 
Joining us now from Paris is Coy Wire. I mean, you got to give us the weather report first, but we are still enthusiastic despite that. And I 
 
 know you're good for it, Coy. You've paid football in far worse weather than this. I mean, the thing that I love about the Olympics is that mix of 
 
 seeing those pro athletes, the true superstars bringing it for their country, but also the new stars that are just about to be minted as these 
 
 games open. 
 
COY WIRE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes. And even the stars themselves are star struck by other stars. I talked to Coco Gauff and she couldn't believe she 
 
 was going to be a flag bearer alongside LeBron James. She's never met him before. But yes, great moments here so far at the opening ceremony, even 
 
 though it's pouring down rain.
 
No meteorologists, but yes, I think those are cats and dogs coming down. But Paris is still doing their best to try to pull off an Olympics opening 
 
 ceremony for the ages. You had Lady Gaga performing. She was rocking this black leather outfit. You can see those water cannons there shooting out 
 
 along bridges down that River Seine. But yes, that French cabaret extravaganza for Lady Gaga.
 
At one point, 80 artists from the Moulin Rouge performing the iconic dance that dates back to the 1820s. The bells of Notre Dame ringing for the first 
 
 time since the cathedral was gutted by fire. Angel-winged accordion players rocking berets on a bridge. 
 
It may seem over the top, but not for Paris. Celine Dion, battling a rare neurological condition, there's some big anticipation of seeing her at this 
 
 celebration.
 
85 boats carrying nearly 7,000 of the athletes competing in these games. From more than 200 delegations around the world, and because of the rain, 
 
 their beautiful bespoke opening ceremony uniforms have been reduced to mostly plastic ponchos, unfortunately.
 
First team out, as per tradition, is Greece, led by NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo. First modern day games were held in Athens way back in 1896. 
 
 The last team to float will be host nation France, of course.
 
They've been just awarded the 2030 Olympics this week, too. So this will end up being a decade worth of Olympics where France and the U.S. will be 
 
 holding a combined four Olympics between the two countries. Huge moments for these athletes. 
 
Paula, as you mentioned, even superstars like NBA sensation Steph Curry, it's his first ever Olympics. So I asked him and Sun star Kevin Durant what 
 
 they were going to be thinking about as they floated down that river Seine at the opening ceremony. But take a listen. 
 
STEPH CURRY, TEAM USA: You imagine the excitement of representing your country, being a part of the opening ceremony, you know, festivities. I 
 
 know it's very unique here being on the river and being a part of, you know, just the scene in Paris. So I'm excited about it all. 
 
KEVIN DURANT, TEAM USA: You get to see all the great athletes around the world represent their country. And the pride that you have for your country 
 
 just goes to another level.
 <br>[14:55:00]
 
We haven't done the river, the boat on the river yet. You know, we usually walk around the stadium. So it'll be a new experience for me. I'm looking 
 
 forward to it. 
 
WIRE: And a new experience, Paula, because I don't think they were counting on all of this rain coming down. Team USA will be one of the last teams to 
 
 go during the opening ceremony.
 
But nonetheless, the games have officially begun. The time is now. 
 
NEWTON: I only have about 30 seconds left. But in terms of the sports that we're going to see, marquee sports on the weekend. What are we to look 
 
 forward to here? 
 
WIRE: Well, most excited about the women's 400-meter freestyle. Australia's reigning Olympic champion, Ariarne Titmus. Canadian team sensation, Summer 
 
 McIntosh, your home nation, just 17 years old. She trains in Florida. She and the Australian have been duking it out, trading world record for world 
 
 record.
 
Also, by the way, in that event, Katie Ledecky, the most dominant female swimmer of all time, this will be one of the most highly anticipated events 
 
 of these games, Paula. Back to you.
 
NEWTON: We are all looking forward to it. Her name is Summer. These are the Summer Olympics with an assist from American coaches. But we'll take it. 
 
 We're rooting for her in the pool, for sure. 
 
Coy Wire, we will continue to check in with you throughout these Olympics. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. 
 
And I want to thank all of you for watching tonight. Stay with CNN. "NEWSROOM" with Jim Sciutto is up next.
