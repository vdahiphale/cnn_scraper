BASH (voice-over): We are live in Washington, D.C., on this "FOURTH IN AMERICA," where one of the largest fireworks displays, in the U.S., is about to begin.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Look at that stunning view, of the nation's capital, and its majestic monuments, an incredible backdrop, for the first light show, of the evening. And it begins, just moments from now.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): Meantime, look at this. In New York City, Lady Liberty, standing watch for fireworks to launch, over the East River, very soon. You're going to see it here, live.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): And Dana, it's going to be one firework show after another, this hour, tons of wonderful music to go with it.
 
BASH (on camera): Absolutely. And look, I mean, we had great music. We are going to continue to have great music. But it's the Fourth of July. This is the show, right, I mean?
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): This is the show, yes.
 
BASH (on camera): And, in D.C., where we are, I always feel so lucky, to be here.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): Absolutely.

SANCHEZ (voice-over): That was incredible. All the feels.
 
BASH (voice-over): Yes.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): My skin is tingling. The sky lit up. The bombs bursting in air. You could feel it in your chest.
 
BASH (voice-over): Yes.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): It gave proof that we're having a Fourth of July to remember
 
BASH (voice-over): And how lucky are we that we have the United States Air Force Band, right behind us. And we got to hear all of their spectacular music.

SANCHEZ (voice-over): There's something special about seeing the monuments lit up.
 
BASH (voice-over): Absolutely.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): In those colors. So many colors as we take a look at that New York skyline.
 
BASH (voice-over): OK. That's pretty awesome too.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): That is one of the most beautiful skylines, in the world. And it is going to get lit up. A mile wide's worth of fireworks, over the East River, as Lady Liberty looks on.

(FRANK SINATRA -- "(THEME FROM) NEW YORK, NEW YORK")
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): Wow. Who better than the Chairman of the Board, Frank Sinatra, to close out that incredible light show, as we look at the Manhattan skyline? A light show you will see nowhere else.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): That was incredible.
 
BASH (on camera): It is. And I think it's actually still going. The finale is ending. Maybe it will never end.
 
BASH (voice-over): How lucky are we that we get to be part of this incredible evening? These -- look at that. It actually is still going.
 
(FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS DISPLAY)
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): Beautiful.
 
BASH (voice-over): Let's listen a little bit more.
 
(FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS DISPLAY)
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): And it just keeps going. Look at that smoke, over the skyline, the colors just bouncing off the skyscrapers. If you don't feel patriotic, watching this, you may want to get something checked.
 
BASH (voice-over): It's true, you know? And there is kind of a rivalry, between New York, and Washington, whose fireworks are best? I'm going to call it a tie.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): It's got to be a tie.
 
BASH (voice-over): And a happy tie.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): Gladly, yes, a happy tie.
 
And there is something sentimental about watching the fireworks, and the monuments.
 
But this fireworks show is immense, a 1,000-plus feet in the air, a mile wide, and we're just watching it go on and on and on. It is incredible.
 
(FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS DISPLAY)
 
BASH (voice-over): It looks like it might finally be over. It was the finale before the finale before the real finale. But we'll take it all, right Boris?
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): That was so majestic, watching the Empire State Building, lit up in red, white and blue.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): And now, looking at Lady Liberty. That was something.
 <br>[21:55:00]
 
BASH (on camera): And, look, I mean, I've lived in Washington, for a very long time. I lived, well, in the New York area, before. It's also beautiful. And -- but there's really nothing like being out, like we are now, seeing the people walking around, people are out, and especially given the fact that we were in a pandemic, for several years.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): Yes, absolutely.
 
BASH (on camera): And you can actually feel that people are just excited, to be out and about, to be experiencing life again, to be experiencing these big moments, like the nation's birthday.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): Yes. There was a lot of pent-up desire, for activity, and fun. And what a better way to spend the Fourth of July than at a concert, or here in front of the U.S. Air Force Band, watching these amazing fireworks, all over the country?
 
BASH (on camera): And here's what's important. It's not over. We have a lot more fireworks, ahead, along with our star-studded lineup of musical entertainment, including performances by Post Malone, Brad Paisley, and the Zac Brown Band.
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): Yes.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): But now, we're going to go to some fireworks, in Atlanta, and a performance, by Grammy Award-winning rapper, and actor, and son of Atlanta, Luda, Ludacris, performing at the Welcome America Festival, in Philadelphia. Let's watch.
 
(LUDACRIS -- "MONEY MAKER")
 
LUDACRIS, AMERICAN RAPPER: This is the real day, when Ludacris fans (inaudible) along the road (ph).
 
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
 
LUDACRIS: Ludacris dance records for the ladies. What we got?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This right here.
 
LUDACRIS: OK.
 
(LUDACRIS -- "HOW LOW")
 
LUDACRIS: We'll make some noise. We're almost there.
 
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
 
SANCHEZ (on camera): How low can you go? How low can you go?
 
Dana Bash, do you like Ludacris, there?
 
BASH (on camera): Yes. I just wanted to keep hearing him. I wasn't going to interrupt that.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over): We've got two very exciting shows, to bring you, right now.
 
Rapper, singer and songwriter, Post Malone, is performing, in Napa, California.
 
And, for the first time, on CNN's "FOURTH IN AMERICA," fireworks, over Niagara Falls.
 
BASH (on camera): Can't wait.
