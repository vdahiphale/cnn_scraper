(THE SANCTUS)
 
(THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYER)
 
All glory be to thee, Almighty God, our heavenly Father, of thy tender mercy did give thine only son, Jesus Christ, to suffer death upon the cross for our redemption. Who made their, by his one ablation of himself once offered, a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world. And it institutes and in His gospel command us to continue a perpetual memory of that His precious death until His coming again.
 
Hear us, oh, merciful Father, we most humbly beseech thee, and grant that by the power of thy Holy Spirit, we receiving these creatures of bread and wine according to us, to thy son our savior, Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of His death and passion, may be partakers of His most blessed Body and Blood. Who in the same night that he was betrayed, took bread. 
 
And when he had given thanks to thee, he broke it and gave it to his disciples saying: "Take, eat, this is my body which is given for you, to this, in remembrance of me." 
 
Likewise, after supper, he took the cup. And when He had given thanks to thee, He gave it to them, saying, drink ye all of this. For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shared for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of Me.
 
Wherefore, Oh Lord and heavenly Father, we thy humble servants, having in remembrance the precious death and passion of thy dear Son. His mighty resurrection and glorious ascension, entirely desire thy fatherly goodness mercifully, to accept this, our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.
 
Most humbly beseeching thee to grant that by the merits and death of thy son, Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we and all thy whole Church may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of his passion.
 
And although we be unworthy through our manifold sins, to offer unto the sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to accept this, our bounden duty and service, not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offenses. And to grant that all we, who are partakers of this holy communion, may be fulfilled with a grace and heavenly benediction through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom and with whom, and in whom in the unity of the Holy Spirit.
 
All honor and glory be unto the Oh Father, almighty world without end. Amen.
 
Each in our own preferred language, let us pray with confidence as our Savior has taught us.
 
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
 
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
 
O Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. 
 
O Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.
 
O Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world, grant us thy peace.
 <br>[07:36:40]
 
Let us pray.
 
Almighty Lord and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify and govern both our hearts and bodies in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Make them to be numbered with thy saints in glory everlasting. Oh Lord, save thy people and bless thine heritage. Govern them and lift them up for ever. Day by day we magnify thee; and we worship thy name, ever world without end.
 
Vouchsafe, Oh Lord, to keep us this day without sin. O Lord, have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us. O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, as our trust is in thee.
 
Oh Lord, in thee have I trusted; let me never be confounded.
