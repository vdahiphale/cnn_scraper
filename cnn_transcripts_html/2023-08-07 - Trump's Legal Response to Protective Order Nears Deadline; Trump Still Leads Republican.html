ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead on "CNN Newsroom," Donald Trump faces a deadline in the hours ahead in connection to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Hear what one of his lawyers tells CNN about it. 
 
Meanwhile, a deadline for coup leaders in Niger comes and goes leaving questions about what the country's neighbors might do next. 
 
And a desperate situation in New York City. A steady stream of migrants amid record breaking temperatures leaves the city asking for help. 
 
Thanks for joining us. Well, the clock is ticking for Donald Trump's lawyers to respond to a legal filing in the case over his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Special Counsel Jack Smith has requested limitations on evidence provided to Trump's team. Specifically, they are asking the former president not to receive his own copies of sensitive material fearing he could use it to threaten witnesses. And the deadline to respond is just hours away. 
 
Smith filed the request in response to Trump's posts on social media, including this one which says, quote, "If you go after me, I'm coming after you." One of Trump's attorneys tells CNN he will fight the protective order. He also says the former president did not tell former Vice President Mike Pence to throw out key electoral votes. Trump simply asked.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN LAURO, ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP:  What President Trump did not do is direct Vice President Pence to do anything. He asked him in an aspirational way. Asking is covered by the First Amendment.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Trump said via his Truth social platform, his legal team will be asking for the federal judge overseeing the election subversion case for a recusal, quote, "on very powerful grounds." He added that his team may also seek a venue change out of Washington, D.C.
 
Well, amid the unprecedented nature of what Trump faces, consider this. We could see his former vice president and current opponent for the 2024 nomination be called to testify against him. CNN's Dana Bash put that scenario to Mike Pence earlier.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  I have no plans to testify, but look, we'll always comply with the law. But look, I want to tell you, I don't know what the path of this indictment will be. The president's entitled to a presumption of innocence. He's entitled to make his defense in court. There actually are profound issues around this pertaining to the First Amendment, freedom of speech, and the rest. I'm confident he and his lawyers will litigate all of those things.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Meantime, over the weekend, some of Trump's opponents for the Republican nomination were stumping in Iowa at a barbecue event hosted by a Republican House representative. While nailing home their own platforms, candidates did not miss an opportunity to acknowledge not only the lead Donald Trump holds going into primary season, but also the division among Americans. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN:  I know that this is an uphill battle. 
 
RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We as Republicans cannot be content with just managing this decline a little bit better. 
 
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have a country to save. And in order to save our country, that means we have got to stop all the distraction. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Ron Brownstein is a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor with "The Atlantic." He joins me now. Good to have you with us.
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Thanks for having me. 
 
CHURCH:  So, Ron, Donald Trump and his lawyers have until 5:00 p.m. today to respond to a legal filing related to his third indictment over his effort to overturn the 2020 election after Special Counsel Jack Smith requested a protective order. Smith wants the judge to limit Trump and his legal team from publicly discussing sensitive evidence, but Trump's legal team says they will fight the protective order as well as call for the recusal of the presiding judge and seek a change of venue. 
 <br>[02:05:05]
 
Now, only a few of his GOP presidential rivals have dared to speak out about any of this as the country faces an unprecedented and historic moment. So, what does it say about politics in this country right now and of course American democracy?
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Yeah, well, you know, this really is the culmination of what we have watched for eight years as Trump has barreled through a procession of norms about candidate behavior, about president -- presidential behavior, two impeachments, including the -- for instigating the January 6th riot. And we have seen time after time, the vast majority of Republican elected officials, virtually all of them in the current case, refusing to draw any lines.
 
And Trump has quite understandably taken from that the lesson that he has essentially broken the party to his will, and there is no point he can go to, at which a critical mass of Republicans will coalesce against him and try the admittedly difficult task of convincing their voters that this is unacceptable. 
 
But when you add all of this up, you see the challenge it creates for American democracy because we are now in a situation where the vast majority of Republican elected officials and voters are basically saying they do not believe his conduct after the 2020 election or on January 6th is disqualifying for him to be president again, and the legal system may have very different judgments about what he did in that period. 
 
CHURCH:  And we are seeing that reflected in the polls. The most recent New York Times--Sienna College poll shows 52 percent of Iowa Republicans back Trump and 47 percent are considering the other GOP candidates. It also shows Trump is 24 points ahead of his nearest rival Ron DeSantis, while the remaining hopefuls are way far behind with single-digit support. So, while this poll was conducted before Trump's third indictment, what are these numbers reveal to you ahead of the GOP primaries? 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Trump is the dominant figure in the Republican Party and that means the largest faction in one of our major parties, I think really for the first time since the Civil War, is signaling that it is okay with anti-democratic measures and means to pursue its end. 
 
The other Republicans candidates, Rosemary, as you know, have chosen a strategy so far, mostly like what we saw in 2016 of avoiding direct confrontation with Trump in the hope that events outside events, a meteor striking the earth or more prosaically, the accumulation of all these indictments will cause this support to crumble on its own and they will be there to pick up his base if they are not seen as someone who tried too hard to take him down themselves. 
 
That strategy didn't work in 2016. And the polls that you are citing show that it's not working again in 2020 -- 2024. If they want to beat him, they're going to have to give Republican voters a stronger reason to pass him over in this nomination fight. CHURCH:  Right. Of course, as we've reported, Trump has been indicted three times, with a fourth looming in Georgia. What happens if Trump wins the 2024 election but is convicted before his inauguration? What could that mean for Republicans and this country? 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  If Trump wins the election, he will certainly seek to dismiss the cases against him or pardon himself. I don't think that is available to him in the state-level charges that he's facing in New York and potentially Georgia. But obviously, that would take everything we are talking about to an entirely new level. 
 
We are already in a crisis of democracy. We have not seen the dominant faction in a major party accept and tolerate and even embrace anti- democratic measures to this extent, I think, since the years before the Civil War, when the slave-holding South had a strategy of trying to subvert majority rule in order to protect slavery. 
 
That alone is taking us into uncharted waters. If Trump wins the election while facing criminal convictions, we are kind of way beyond the last buoy. 
 
CHURCH:  Ron Brownstein, appreciate your political analysis. Many thanks. 
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Thank you.
 
CHURCH:  U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah this week to sell his economic policies ahead of next year's presidential election. His trip comes on the heels of the monthly employment report showing a gain of 187,000 jobs in July. It's an increase the president has touted as Bidenomics at work.
 <br>[02:09:57]
 
Despite this, the lates CNN poll shows nearly two-thirds of those surveyed disapprove of how Mr. Biden is handling the economy. CNN's Kevin Liptak has more.
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  President Biden is heading west this week to sell voters on his climate agenda. This is all part of a broader effort by the White House to sell the president's accomplishments and take credit for those accomplishments, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which you'll remember included $370 billion meant to combat climate change. 
 
Now, the president will visit Arizona first, and sources tell us that he is considering designating a new national monument around the Grand Canyon. This is something that native tribes have been lobbying for for years, and it would prevent new drilling in the area. So, the president really trying to bolster his climate agenda ahead of the 2024 election. 
 
Of course, this is a critical issue for key members of the democratic coalition, progressives, young voters, people who haven't necessarily been satisfied with the president in this area so far when it comes to drilling for fossil fuels, when it comes to cutting carbon emissions, the president really hoping to show voters that he is serious about combating climate change. 
 
Now, this is all part of a bigger effort by the Biden administration to take more credit for their economic agenda in the month of August. And you'll see the president, the vice president, members of the cabinet all out talking about their economic record. And they do believe that they have a good story to tell. Inflation is easing, consumer sentiment is ticking up, and certainly hiring remains strong.
 
But there does remain this disconnect with voters. In a poll last week by CNN, 75 percent said that they viewed economic conditions as poor and that is translating into political headwinds for President Biden when it comes to his approval rating. So certainly, the challenge for President Biden as he gears up for re-election is to close that gap and remind voters of all that he has accomplished when it comes to the economy. Kevin Liptak, CNN, Wilmington, Delaware.
 
CHURCH:  Coup leaders have announced the closure of Niger's airspace after ignoring demands from neighboring countries to reinstate the president. Even after warnings of a potential military intervention, the defiant junta held a large rally in the capital on Sunday, where thousands of people voiced their support for the coup. The junta also urged their supporters to stand up to any threats from outside forces.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
AMADOU ABDRAMANE, NIGER MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translation): Niger's Armed Forces and all our defense and security forces, backed by the unfailing support of our people, are ready to defend the integrity of our territory and the honor of our homeland. To this end, the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland launches a vibrant appeal to the youth, to the worthy daughters and sons of our country, to stand ready to defend the homeland. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  CNN's Stephanie Busari joins us now from neighboring Nigeria. Good to see you, Stephanie. So, the deadline for coup leaders in Niger has come and gone. What's expected to happen next?
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA:  So, yes, the expected intervention has not happened, Rosemary. And there are several reasons for that. And Nigeria is very key to what's -- all of these operations. Firstly, Nigeria's president, Bola Tinubu, is the head of -- the current head of ECOWAS, which is the regional bloc of heads of state, who decided to take military intervention against Niger.
 
But President Tinubu is hampered legally. His Senate has not approved the decision to take military action in Niger and they've asked him to go back to the table for a more diplomatic option. And also, Nigeria is bordered several states in the north with Niger. Very close links historically, ethnically. Many people in the north, parts of northern Nigeria considered Nigerians to be brothers. 
 
So, there is a very strong element pushing from Niger, the governor's forum, which is very powerful, telling the president, they actually met last night, on Sunday night, telling the president, we cannot allow this war. We need to find a peaceful solution. So, President Tinubu is caught between a rock and a hard place. He wants to be seen as a tough-talking leader, but he really must follow the due process before any intervention can happen, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH:  All right, Stephanie Busari joining us from Lagos. Many thanks.
 <br>[02:14:54] 
 
Well, coming up next, Ukraine targets critical transportation routes used by Russia as it pushes forward with its counter-offensive. We'll have the details just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  Ukraine's military is now confirming strikes on two key bridges between Crimea and Russian-occupied areas nearby. Ukraine says the two road bridges targeted on Sunday were the main transportation routes for Russia in those areas. But a Russia-appointed official in the Kherson region claims the bridges were used for civilian, not military traffic, and that a rupture to a gas pipeline running along one bridge cutoff supplies to 20,000 residents. CNN's Nick Paton Wash is following developments and has more now from Zaporizhzhia.
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Two bridges struck by missiles, British supply, Storm Shadows stealth missiles, according to some Russian officials. They run from the Crimean Peninsula that was taken by Russia in 2014, up through to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, parts of those that are held by Russia still after their last invasion. 
 <br>[02:19:53]
 
And I think the bid potentially here is for Ukraine to sever part of the resupply routes, the vital infrastructure for Russia's occupation, particularly in the west of Zaporizhzhia where so much of Ukraine's current counter-offensive strength is trying to focus on pushing down to cut Crimea off from the rest of Russian-occupied Ukraine. 
 
Quite how successful these strikes will be, we don't know. Russian officials playing it down and suggesting that these bridges will essentially be mostly running by the end of the day and that they have a third alternative off to the west of Crimea that they can still use. But it's the pinpoint nature that will surely have Russian officials concerned. 
 
Essentially, Kyiv suggesting they can switch on and off re-supply routes for Russia at will and sometimes these attacks do presage an uptick in Ukrainian activity. We simply don't know at this point how effective they have been. But they come after days of tit-for-tat missile exchanges between the two sides. 
 
Ukraine very effective in its use of waterborne drones against a Russian amphibious ship, against a Russian oil cargo tanker, even against Russian bridges into Crimea over the past two weeks, attacking things frankly that Russia would have thought were impregnable and at the same time too, Russia responding with hypersonic missiles over the past 24 hours, some of which Ukraine acknowledged hit military targets, including an aviation field and an aviation plant near where I'm standing here in Zaporizhzhia. 
 
So, an uptick certainly away from the intensity of the fight along the southern frontier where the counteroffensive is focused, but that is still where Ukraine is putting most of its efforts desperate for a breakthrough. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.
 
CHURCH:  Joining me now from the port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine is Maria Avdeeva, research director at the European Expert Association, where she focuses on international security. Appreciate you joining us. 
 
MARIA AVDEEVA, SECURITY EXPERT:  Thank you for having me. 
 
CHURCH:  So, Ukraine hit a Russian oil tanker with a sea drone on the weekend and we've been reporting on an increasing number of attacks by Ukraine inside Russia. How might this new strategy change the trajectory of the war and is it wise given Western concerns that Russia could escalate its response to attacks on Russian soil?
 
AVDEEVA:  Well, Ukraine has to do it, has to attack on Russian soil because this is the only way to defend Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian civilians. If we look at the cities like Kharkiv or Kherson, which lie as close as 10 miles to the Russian border, Russia attacks these cities from the occupied territory or from the territory of Russia itself.
 
If we take Kharkiv for example, where they launched S300 missiles from Belgorod. So, the only way to stop this, because there is no way how you can intercept these missiles, is to attack the stations on the territory of Russia. The other aim is to cut off the roots of supply, Russian supply roots, and also the Russian warehouses, ammunition depots, which are used for Russian troops to resupply its attacks on the territory of Ukraine. So, this is one thing.
 
The other thing that Russia is all the time threatening that it will do more, it will retaliate for Ukrainian attacks. This is nonsense because Russia already has used all kinds of weapons. It has included on civilian population in Ukraine. We have seen awful, terrible images of residential buildings being hit by Russian missiles, houses being destroyed, civilians, hospitals, maternity wards hit by Russian missiles. 
 
So, this is -- all Russia already is doing and they can't do anything more -- more terrible and --
 
CHURCH:  And as we've been reporting, Ukraine just targeted two bridges between Crimea and Russian occupied areas nearby. We've seen this before of course. What is the strategy here and is it working?
 
AVDEEVA:  The strategy is to cut off the supply routes for Russian troops in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk and Luhansk regions, because Russia turned Crimea into the military base. It's saturated with all kinds of weapons, all kinds of troops, and this is the way of supply of Russian troops.
 
So, this is Ukrainian tactics to cut all the supply routes and also Ukraine is using the high-precise weapons, high-precise long-range missiles it gets from the Western partners to hit Russian ammunition depots inside Crimea as well to slow down the Russian attacks and give Ukrainian troops opportunity to move forward. 
 <br>[02:24:56]
 
CHURCH:  And Russia says that Ukraine used U.K.-supplied long-range missiles in the bridge attack. Could that threaten future supplies of these types of weapons to Ukraine do you think?
 
AVDEEVA:  Well, Ukraine says and it's acknowledged by everyone in the international community that the territory of Crimea is Ukrainian territory and Ukraine has a full right to attack Crimean bridges or whatever it thinks is appropriate to stop Russian aggression on its own territory in Crimea. For this territory, Ukraine can use any Western weapons it has. For the attacks on the territory of Russia, Ukraine uses its own made weapons, which is said by Ukrainian officials. 
 
CHURCH:  Maria Avdeeva in Odessa, Ukraine, thank you so much for joining us. We do appreciate it. 
 
AVDEEVA:  Thank you. 
 
CHURCH:  And still to come, dozens were killed and many more injured after a train derailed in Pakistan. We will have the latest on the crash just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH:  In Pakistan, officials have launched a formal investigation into a deadly train derailment on Sunday. 
 <br>[02:30:03]
 
At least 30 people were killed and dozens injured when a passenger train crashed in Southern Sindh province. We want to go to CNN's Anna Coren in Hong Kong now. So Anna, what more are you learning about this deadly and tragic train derailment? 
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the death toll currently stands at 30, 67 injured. But what we are learning from authorities is that the death toll is expected to rise due to the severity of injuries. And looking at the pictures of the mangled wreckage Rosemary, it's not difficult to understand why. 
 
Yesterday, the Hazara Express left Karachi, which is Pakistan's largest city, at around 8:00 a.m. local time with 950 passengers onboard. It was heading to Abbottabad. More than five hours into the journey, just after 1:00 p.m., the train derailed near the town of Nawabshah in Sindh province. That's about 275km from Karachi. Now it was travelling at low to moderate speed, about 45km an hour according to officials, when it ran off the tracks. Ten passenger cars derailed. Now this is a remote farming area so the first people on the scene
 
 were local villagers trying to pull survivors from the wreckage. Let's have a listen now to one of the eyewitnesses. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASIF MIR, EYEWITNESS: We were standing here as soon as the accident happened. People started screaming. Everyone was running around in panic. People were totally distraught. Many were injured, many had died. Local people carried out the rescue operation for almost an hour before the rescue services arrived. We shifted people to local hospitals. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now as we heard from that eyewitness, it did take time, hours in fact for emergency crews to arrive on the scene, and then they had to bring in heavy machinery to free those who had been trapped for hours in this crushed, mangled wreckage. 
 
The injured were taken to local hospitals where an emergency was declared to deal with the influx of patients. I believe that these are new pictures that we are now receiving that show you the chaos that was going on. There's footage of dead bodies covered in plastic outside the hospital. 
 
The cause of the derailment, Rosemary, is unknown, but the railway minister said it could be a technical fault or an act of sabotage. No one has claimed responsibility, but you know a terrorist act cannot be ruled out, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: Anna Coren, joining us with the latest there from her vantage point in Hong Kong. Appreciate that report. 
 
Still to come, New York City says it needs federal help as it seeks to find shelter for thousands of asylum seekers in the city. We will have the latest on the migrant crisis in the United States. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: In the United States, New York City is racing to help thousands of migrants seeking asylum there. Nearly 100,000 asylum seekers have come through the city's intake centers since last spring, and nearly 200 sites have been open to shelter them, but city officials say, they need federal help. CNN Correspondent, Polo Sandoval, is in New York with more on the growing crisis.
 
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Still no end in sight for New York City's migrant crisis as New York City officials struggle to find housing for the increasing number of asylum seekers who have arrived here in the city since last spring. Close to 100,000 of those, about 56, 000 or more continue to be in the city's care. They have been placed at shelter facilities in and around the city. In the fact the Roosevelt Hotel that you see behind me here in Manhattan, that not only serves as a shelter, but also as that primary intake facility, where many of the newly arrived are directed to, so they can best be -- at least made contact with those resources that they need. It was as recent as last week that we saw dozens of asylum seekers, mostly men, actually forced to sleep on the sidewalk because of an influx in the numbers.
 
We should note, the New York City officials were later able to actually place them in temporary shelter facilities. So this weekend no signs of that kind of an issue. However, in Eric Adams's most recent remarks, the New York City Mayor, he's made very clear that that scene is bound to repeat itself if the city does not receive any further support at the state or at the federal level. 
 
Polo Sandoval, CNN New York. 
 
CHURCH: Some 80 million people in the United States will begin the work week under dangerous heat alerts. The south and the southwest will be hardest hit. Triple digit temperatures are forecast for much of those regions. 
 
The threat of severe weather also increases Monday with the potential for hail and damaging winds. It could impact more than 100 million people in the Eastern U.S. The threat is highest in the southeast from Georgia to Maryland. 
 
Well, a new report from UNICEF says 76% of children in South Asia are exposed to extremely high temperatures, the highest percentage in the world. It means children in the region, which includes countries like India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are living under extremely high temperatures, 83 or more days a year. 
 
The report emphasizes how these children are bearing the brunt of climate change through no fault of their own. And CNN's Vedika Sud is in the heart of South Asia right now, coming to us live from New Delhi. 
 
Good to see you Vedika. So what more can you tell us about this UNICEF report and of course the solutions it might offer.
 
VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONENT: Rosemary, if I were to describe this report in one line or perhaps the biggest headline or takeaway, it would be that children under the age of 18 in South Asia have been deeply impacted and most impacted by the high temperatures triggered by climate change, and that's exactly what this report talks about. 
 
It talks of more than 460 million children in South Asia being impacted by the high temperatures that have been escalated by climate change. And if we take a look at some of the key highlights from the analysis, it talks of 76% of children in South Asia exposed to high temperatures compared to 32% globally. 28% of children in South Asia were exposed to 4.5 or more heat waves per year compared to 24% globally. 800,000 children in flood affected areas were at risk of severe heat stress in June 2023. And three out of four children in South Asia are already exposed to high temperatures compared to one out of four globally. 
 <br>[02:40:00]
 
These are staggering figures. It talks to the plight of the most vulnerable children, adolescents and women who are being impacted by the high and extreme temperatures across South Asia.
 
Now, UNICEF does say that it's not in South Asia that countries are recording the highest temperatures, but it's the people living here. These children under the age of 18 that are being severely impacted and these could be life threatening conditions that they are experiencing in countries in South Asia. 
 
According to the UNICEF Regional Director, this is a concern and life threatening concern for these children, and if measures are not taken in-time, it could lead to severe concerns in the area. Back to you. 
 
CHURCH: All right, Vedika Sud joining us via live. I appreciate it. 
 
And thank you for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church. For our International Viewers, World Sport is coming up next. And for our viewers here in the United States and Canada, I'll be back with more CNN Newsroom after a short break. Do stay with us.

Well, a wall of black smoke could be seen rising from a plastics plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Sunday. The fire is now under control with no reports of injuries. But people who live near the plant, which manufactured and stored plastics, were asked to stay indoors while the fire raged.
 
Multiple agencies responded to the blaze, which spread to surrounding vegetation. Crews said they would remain on the scene through the night to make sure the fire is thoroughly extinguished.
 
A missing boater in northeast Florida is safely back on land. That's after being rescued by the Coast Guard about 12 miles, or 19 kilometers off the coast of St. Augustine. 25-year-old Charles Gregory was reported missing after failing to return for nearly two days. He was last seen Thursday night leaving shore in a small boat before he was found alive Saturday.
 
CNN's Camila Bernal has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is a fascinating story of survival. And I spoke to Raymond Gregory, who is the father of the 25- year-old who was lost at sea. His son, Charles Gregory, went out at 4:00 in the morning on Friday, according to his father. He went out fishing and he says he always did this and has done it for years. But this time around, according to his father, he didn't realize that the tide was going as fast as it was. And that's when a wave comes and hits the boat, it capsizes. And that's when he loses his throw cushion, his cell phone, his life jacket.
 
And the father saying that Charles had to remove the motor of the boat and then just tried to hang on to this boat for as long as he could. He says, of course, he's getting sunburned, severely getting sunburned, and of course also sees sharks and big fish and gets stung by jellyfish.
 
He says he actually did see other boats and saw airplanes and the helicopters. He took off his shorts and tried to wave them in the air to get people's attention. That did not work. And out of everything that happened to him, Charles told his father that the worst was the nighttime, because he says he was so sunburned that the wind at night was just making it freezing cold. So he would try to get in the water to warm up, but it was extremely difficult.
 
Thankfully, the Coast Guard rescued him on Saturday morning. His father saying that Charles is, of course, dehydrated, that he is weak, that his muscles or the muscle tissue was breaking down. So he does need some days to recover because of the sunburned and the bites.
 
He says it's very difficult to move. So he is in bed at the moment trying to drink Gatorade, trying to eat, but the father's saying he's really not eating a lot, not speaking a lot, and just trying to rest. The father's saying Charles is going to be OK. But the one thing he did tell me was that, at the end of the day, the moral of the story, in his opinion, is never give up.

CHURCH: Pope Francis is back at the Vatican after his whirlwind trip to Portugal, which included events for World Youth Day and an open-air Mass on his final day. It was the Pope's first major trip since his abdominal surgery in June, and the turnout for his visit was massive, as CNN's Antonia Mortensen reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANTONIA MORTENSEN, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Pope Francis arrived back at the Vatican Sunday after a jam-packed trip to Portugal for World Youth Day, where he was welcomed by over 1 million young Catholics from 200 countries. The event definitely felt more like a festival, and some compared it to the Catholic Woodstock, where Pope Francis was most definitely welcomed like a rock star.
 
Local authorities in Portugal said this was the largest event in the history of the nation. And during the closing Mass in front of 1.5 million people on Sunday, the Pope announced that the next World Youth Day would, in fact, take place in Seoul, South Korea in 2027.
 <br>[02:50:06]
 
The trip took place in the shadow of a clergy abuse scandal in Portugal when an independent commission found that Catholic clergy members in Portugal had abused more than 4,000 children over a 70-year period.
 
And on the flight back to Rome's Fiumicino Airport, the Pope said that he had a private meeting with some 13 victims of clergy abuse in Portugal and that this meeting was very painful to him. During that press conference, he also told journalists that he was in good health and feels really great after the trip.
 
It was definitely an intense five days for the octogenarian, but he was in great form despite recent surgery and mobility issues. His message to young Catholics on the trip was clear, there is room for everyone in the church. Be careful of the pitfalls of social media and the internet and look after your planet.
 
Next up for the Pope, a trip to Mongolia at the end of August, and then their trip to Marseille, France in September.

CHURCH: Well, just over 30 minutes from now, the Women's World Cup resume, with England taking on Nigeria in the knockout stage. The Nigerians are trying to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time, while the European champions, England, are hoping to avoid an upset.
 
Later, tournament co-hosts Australia will try to build on their emphatic performance against Canada when they take on Denmark, who are seeking their first ever victory in a knockout match. And for the first time ever, the quarterfinals will be played without Team USA in the mix. The defending champions were knocked out of the tournament on Sunday after a dramatic penalty shootout with Sweden.
 
CNN's Don Riddell has details.
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Penalty shootouts can be the most exhilarating thing in sports unless your team is involved in one, and then they can be a nightmare. The U.S. team are heading home after a dramatic loss to Sweden. And in the end, the difference here was about as thick as this piece of paper.
 
These two sides have often met on the world stage. Sweden usually come out on top, but the USA gave it everything. They just peppered the Swedish goal with 11 shots on target, but they couldn't find a way past their goalie, Zecira Musovic, who saved every single one of those shots. She was brilliant and deservedly won the Player of the Match award.
 
So, after 90 minutes and extra time, it was goalless. And that's when the drama really began. The first five penalties were all scored. Sweden's Nathalie Bjorn was the first to miss. The American legend, Megan Rapinoe had the chance to give her team a commanding lead, but she blazed her kick over the bar.
 
Normally, so composed and reliable, she could only laugh at the agony. But now everyone's nerves were jangling. Rebecka Blomqvist stepped up, only to be denied by a brilliant save from the U.S. Goalie Alyssa Naeher. And that meant Sophia Smith had a chance to win it for the Americans, but she missed as well. The pressure was now almost intolerable.
 
The U.S. team was hoping to win a third consecutive World Cup, but Kelly O'Hara's shot against the post was their third miss out of four kicks. And it was Lena Hurtig who won it for the Swedes in the end. But they had to wait to celebrate. It seemed as though, Naeher had saved her kick, but the goal line technology revealed that it had crossed the line, but only just.
 
It really couldn't have been any closer, could it? Everybody held their breath until the ref got word, the kick was good, the ball was over, the game was over, and for everyone involved, the emotions were just overwhelming.

MAGDALENA ERIKSSON, SWEDEN DEFENDER: They're ranked number one in the world for a reason. They're massive. They have so many good players to choose from. They're a massive football country and little Sweden has knocked them out. So I'm really happy about that and proud of everyone.
 
ZECIRA MUSOVIC, SWEDEN GOALKEEPER: I felt like, OK, we have everything to win. We're facing the number one in the world. They have all the pressure on them. So I felt extremely confident and felt like, let's go.

RIDDELL: The shocks enterprises keep on coming at this World Cup. Former champions Norway, Germany and the United States are all out already. So too are the Olympic champions, Canada. And for the U.S. team, they have never known pain quite like it. This is their earliest elimination ever at the World Cup. They've always made it to at least the semi-finals.
 
This is the first time the tournament's defending champions have gone out before the quarters, and Sweden are now officially their Kryptonite. Sweden have knocked out the U.S. of both the World Cup and the Olympics on penalties.

MEGAN RAPINOE, TWO-TIME WORLD CUP CHAMPION: It's tough to go out, obviously, like this. I mean, I just, like, obviously, you saw my smile after I missed that PK. Just like that's a sick joke. There's some dark, dark Becky Sauerbrunn humor in there somewhere. But that's the way that, you know, the game goes and that's the way that life goes.
 
And I feel grateful for this moment still to be able to have played in another one and had this experience. And -- yes, this is life.

RIDDELL: Sweden now play Japan in the quarterfinals while the Americans head home wondering what the future might hold for the four- time champions. Back to you.
 
CHURCH: Drivers in Oregon are now allowed to pump their own gas after the state lifted a ban on self-service dating back to 1951. The new law doesn't phase out full service completely, but stations cannot charge more for that service.
 
Despite the self-service ban, Oregon had allowed for exceptions in smaller communities and during the COVID pandemic. This leaves New Jersey as the only state where gas station customers can't pump their own fuel.
 
Animal experts in Alaska are caring for a rare walrus calf found wandering alone on Alaska's North Slope, 4 miles inland. It's unusual because this species is often found in the ocean or along the coastline and with their mothers. The Wayward calf is believed to be just a month old and has some medical issues.
 
He's now under 24 hours cuddle care at the Alaska SeaLife Center to mimic the maternal closeness these calves are used to. The center says he's eating well, remains alert, and is on the road to recovery. Good to hear.
