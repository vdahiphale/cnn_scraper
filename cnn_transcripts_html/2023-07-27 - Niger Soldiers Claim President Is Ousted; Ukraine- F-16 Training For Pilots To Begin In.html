ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. An apparent coup d'etat in Niger on state television. An army general announces the government has been overthrown and the constitution dissolved. We'll bring you the latest in a live report.
 
Plus. Lots of excitement of the Women's World Cup as Team USA meets the Netherlands in a rematch of the 2019 final. And.
 
We'll take a look at the life and legacy of Irish singer Sinead O'Connor
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH:  Thanks for joining us. Well, global condemnation following an attempted military coup that's apparently underway in Niger. The U.S., Britain, France, the U.N. and West African leaders all denouncing the move by the country's military. A group of officers appeared on national television Wednesday night, saying President Mohamed Bazoum was ousted. This his election two years ago was an historic first for Niger.
 
And concerns are growing that his removal could be a massive blow to the fight against Islamic insurgency in the region. Larry Madowo is monitoring those developments. He joins us now live from Nairobi. So Larry, what more are you learning about this apparent ouster of President Bazoum and of course the resulting fallout.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, still early days here. It's literally just a few hours since these men in military fatigues showed up on national television and declared that they had taken over power from President Mohamed Bazoum, dissolve the constitution and closed all land and air borders. Their reason is because the breakdown in security as well as social economic conditions there. And President Mohamed Bazoum was the first time that there was a peaceful democratic transfer of power in Niger since independence from France in 1960. This country has been a key part of the West's Security Strategy in the Sahel. It's surrounded by countries like Mali and Burkina Faso where the jihadist threat is at its peak. And this was a rare, peaceful, generally peaceful part of the neighborhood, even though it also does face the jihadist campaign with the groups affiliated to both ISIS and al Qaeda.
 
But now with this, it's a huge setback for democracy in the country. We've been seeing tweets a short while ago from the office of the presidency in Niger. One of those tweets said that the hard-won achievements will be safeguarded. All Nigerians who love democracy and freedom will see to it. This presidency account also did repost a tweet from the country's foreign minister Hassoumi Massoudou has said a coup attempt has been underway.
 
And history also go -- goes on to say that this act of (INAUDIBLE) officers aims as elsewhere to call into question our hard-won freedoms, our democracy and the progress made. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also made the statement about the ouster of President Bazoum. Listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANTONY BLINKEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We are very closely monitoring the situation and developments in Niger. I spoke with President Bazoum earlier this morning, and made clear that the United States resolutely supports him as the democratically elected president of Niger. We call for his immediate release. We condemn any effort to seize power by force.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: The U.N. Secretary General also spoke with President Bazoum on Wednesday. And he now says that he is concerned for his safety and well-being initiative released unconditionally. The -- this is another headache for the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, the regional body which have to figure out a way to deal with all these coups in his neighborhood.
 
West Africa used to be known as Africa's cobalt and you can see why this keeps reoccurring, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: And we'll continue to watch this of course and bring our viewers details. Larry Madowo, appreciate you covering this.
 
We're just getting word of a new Russian missile attack targeting port infrastructure in Ukraine's Odesa region.
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
Ukrainian officials say one person has been killed and this comes as Ukraine has been stepping up its counteroffensive with more troops and new pushers in critical areas. U.S. officials say combat power that had been held in reserve for weeks has now been deployed. In the fight for the battered city of Bakhmut, Ukraine claims it's advancing from the south. This video is set to show Ukrainian forces taking over Russian positions.
 
There's also been an uptick and fighting along the southern front with reports of Russian forces retreating from some areas. And Clare Sebastian is following developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to Clare. So, what is the latest on Ukraine committing more forces to its counteroffensive in the south east after nearly two months of slow progress?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Rosemary, it has been a while quite a few weeks since we've seen this kind -- these kinds of reports coming out gradually. Advancing the words of the deputy defense minister. It is slow but it is significant. They've spent weeks combing through these defenses, demining areas, crawling in the words of the Ukrainian foreign minister, you know, several 100 meters a day in some cases.
 
And now, I don't know if we can bring up the map to show the front lines but we're seeing advances in a number of areas too. In the southern region, in Zaporizhzhia, south of Orikhiv, both Russian or Russian mainly, Russian installed, officials and bloggers saying that Ukraine has started a major offensive just south of that town in Orikhiv towards Melitopol. They're trying to break through the Russian land corridor connecting Crimea and the Donbas.
 
Also, to the -- to the east of Velyka Novosylka, that's seen as sort of an access route to Berdyansk because they're pushing down along a river there and they are reportedly making a serious push around a town called Staromaryevka. A small village really. I think we can show you some video there which we have geolocated that shows what purports to be Russian forces leaving their positions as Ukrainians move in.
 
I think you really get a sense looking at this of the kind of terrain they're dealing with. These are, as I say, very small villages, quiet rural areas and heavily defended, heavily fortified of course by Russia. Also on the eastern front in Bakhmut, they are pushing a number of settlements to the south of the city to in particular as they tried to encircle it. So we're seeing a Ukrainian push in a couple of areas.
 
But alongside that, of course, Rosemary, they continue to have to deal with these missile barrages this morning. The regional military administration in Odesa saying one person was killed in those missile strike. They also dealt with an afternoon barrage yesterday involving a number of different kinds of missiles. The Air Force saying it shut down about 40 of them. So the Ukrainians having their air defenses tested even as they make these pushes along the front lines.
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Clare Sebastian for that live report from London. Joining me now is CNN military analyst, Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. He is also a former commanding general of the U.S. Army, Europe and Seventh Army. A pleasure to have you with us.
 
MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: And it's a pleasure to be with you, Rosemary. CHURCH: So I do want to start by getting your military assessment of Ukraine's counteroffensive and where things stand right now because on Monday, the country's defense minister told CNN the counter offensive is behind schedule, but going according to plan. Do you agree with that assessment?
 
HERTLING: I do, Rosemary. This has been a tough offensive operation against very reinforced and mind-defensive positions that the Russians had months to put into place. So truthfully, before the offensive started a few weeks ago, I was concerned about how tough it would be for the Ukrainians to continue to maneuver against some of these defensive positions enhanced by the Russians. So yes, it is going much slower.
 
It's the first time the Ukrainians have attempted something on this large of a scale and offensive operation with new equipment that they've just recently received. So I kind of thought it might go a little bit slower than anticipated, but it is going along the routes that they're looking to achieve and with a geared toward the major objectives that have always been a part of the campaign.
 
CHURCH: And General, what are Ukraine's military equipment needs at this time, and could the eventual delivery of F-16 fighter jets and associated training represent a game changer in this war do you think?
 
HERTLING: It could eventually, Rosemary. But I don't think that's the priority right now. There's a lot of people talking about the need for F-16s. And with an understanding of how long it takes to get pilots train, mechanics train, supply systems in place, airfields in place, I think Minister Reznikov and Secretary Austin have been very articulate in terms of what is being provided to Ukraine. 
 <br>[02:10:03]
 
It's things that can help them right now on the ground to achieve the most success. And whereas a combined arms force with aircraft and multiple roll aircraft and a lot more equipment would certainly be desirable. It's just near impossible to provide all of that. What Ukraine has asked for is a modern army and a modern air force while they're fighting a very intense campaign.
 
So whereas, it would be great if they had the capabilities to incorporate a fleet of F-16s. Those are not available and the supplies and the maintenance would be very difficult to provide at this stage.
 
CHURCH: And General, we have witnessed attacks on Russian soil that Ukraine has claimed responsibility for and more recently, the drone attacks in Moscow. But some analysts suggest those drones were only capable of coming from the local area. What do you make of those drone attacks? And how might Ukraine's targeting of Russian sights change the trajectory of this war?
 
HERTLING: Well, it actually -- it's -- it would suggest more of a great coordination between insurgents within the Russian territory, the territorial forces that are behind Russian lines, and the capability to have protesters within Russia, counter their government for this war that many Russian citizens think is also illegal. But they can't -- they can't actually describe that in the press or they'd be condemned by their leader for going against the war.
 
So, I think many of these drones that we're seeing hit within the Russian territory at fuel locations that ammo caches, in terms of government buildings, I think it's an attempt by Ukraine to use all of the resources at their disposal to attack Russia and help them not feel safe anywhere. What it also does, Rosemary, and this is critical. It draws some of the forces that are on the frontlines away from the frontlines back into Mother Russia.
 
So, when you have to defend not only against a potential Ukrainian assault, but also bring air defense equipment, as an example, back to some major buildings, like we saw in and around the ring in Moscow, then you know that you're affecting the ability for Russian to defend inside of Ukraine, and that's very important.
 
CHURCH: And generally, General, just finally, what will it take do you think to end the war? And how long do you expect this to take?
 
HERTLING: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy has basically stated there are three major objectives. Number one, to secure the Ukrainian people. Number two, to regain all the territory that Russia has basically captured. And in both those cases, I think he's succeeding. And the third objective is to get Mr. Putin charged with the many war crimes he has committed. And as long as we're mentioning that I think President Biden's approach at submitting evidence to the world court and the U.N. today was a big step in that direction of contributing to Ukraine and President Zelenskyy getting the Russian leaders criminally charged for some of the war crimes they've committed.
 
CHURCH: Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, we appreciate your military analysis. Thanks for joining us.
 
HERTLING: A pleasure, Mary -- Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH: African leaders are arriving in St. Petersburg, Russia for a summit with President Vladimir Putin. They're expected to ask for concrete promises on green supplies after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative earlier this month. Wheat prices have risen about 20 percent in less than two weeks. Some leaders also want clarity from the Russian president on the future of the Wagner Mercenary Group in Africa.
 
Now after its short live mutiny in Russia last month. Wagner provides security for a few African countries.
 
Well, dozens of new wildfires are cropping up across southern Europe. Fueled by an unrelenting heatwave. The Greek fire service reported 61 new fires in the past day alone. They're spreading in central Greece killing two people on Wednesday and threatening the country's main agricultural hub. Parts of the country reached 46 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. Fires are torching forests in southern Albania. Hundreds of firefighters are working to put them out. 
 
Albanian Police are investigating whether the fires were started by arsonists. Nada Bashir shows us the devastation caused by these fires in Europe.

NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (voiceover): Through Italy's blackened hills, the scorched remnants of charred land, as emergency teams continue to battle wildfires across the country southern regions. In Sicily on Tuesday, terrifying scenes as one resident race through fire-lined roads to Palermo airport which itself was brought to a standstill by the crisis.  
 <br>[02:15:05]
 
Authorities say the vast majority of evacuated residents on the island have now been able to return home. But in other parts of the country anxious locals look on as flames spread dangerously close to their homes. In Palermo, a local church sustained significant damage. Residents say they can only be thankful that no one was hurt.
 
REV. VINCENZO BRUCCOLERI, SANTA MARIA DE GESU CONVENT (through translator): The damage is enormous and we literally lost the church. But on the other hand, we are happy that there was no one injured.
 
BASHIR (voiceover): But Italy is not alone. Across the Mediterranean countries including Greece, Spain and Portugal are battling extreme weather from devastating fires to deadly stalls. In the Portuguese town of Cascais, more than 500 firefighters were drafted in to tackle a now contained wildfire.
 
Meanwhile, on the Greek island of Rhodes, emergency teams are still working tirelessly to tackle the blaze. Some residents here have been forced to evacuate their homes, but others have stayed to volunteer, desperate to save their communities.
 
STAVROS NIKITARAS, VOLUNTEER: We don't have any helping the island. You see all the people that are living here that come to help. I'm not from this village, but I have friends here. So I came to help.
 
MARIA PARDALOU, VOLUNTEER: Every year, they say we will do, the things will better. Nothing. Every summer the same. The same every summer.
 
BASHIR (voiceover): Beyond Europe, wildfires are also ravaging parts of Turkey and North Africa. In Algeria, authorities say they have managed to contain the deadly blaze, which has so far killed dozens. But some residents who sought shelter from the devastation say they came back to nothing.
 
TAVRUS TIMIZAR, ALGERIAN RESIDENT (through translator): When we returned home, we found everything was burned, and there was nothing left. No furniture, no money, everything was burned.
 
BASHIR (voiceover): The loss and devastation wrought by wildfires is becoming an all too familiar reality across this region. As experts warn that extreme heat events will only become more frequent and more severe over the coming years. Unless urgent changes are made. It is a troubling prospect for a region already in the depths of a climate crisis. Nada Bashir, CNN, Rome.

CHURCH: Music fans, the world over are mourning the death of Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, who passed away at the age of 56. She is best remembered for her cover of Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U which topped music charts all over the world. CNN's Stephanie Elam looks back on her life.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Sinead O'Connor obliterated the image of the female music star in the late 1980s with a shaved head, stirring performances and a mouthful of controversial opinions. O'Connor top the music charts in 1990 with her version of Nothing Compares 2 U written by Prince. She won MTV Video of the Year Award. Rollingstone named her Artists of the Year in 1991.
 
She earned four Grammy nominations for the song and the album It Was On. But accolades and awards seem to mean nothing compared to O'Connor's drive to provoke thought.
 
SINEAD O'CONNOR, IRISH SINGER: Fight the real enemy.
 
ELAM (voiceover): When O'Connor ripped up this photo of Pope John Paul II on national television, backlash reverberated around the globe. Weeks later, a New York crowd booed the singer loudly and incessantly when she took her turn on stage at a Bob Dylan tribute. O'Connor repeatedly defended herself calling herself Catholic and spiritual. And in 1999 she became the first priestess of a dissident Roman Catholic group, when the Catholic pre-sex abuse scandal exploded. O'Connor call for the Pope to tell the truth.
 
O'CONNOR: We have the documents and we have the proof to tell us that we're being lied to and we're being lied to by people who are supposed to represent Jesus Christ.
 
ELAM (voiceover): O'Connor lashed out at other celebrities. Once called U2's music bombastic, started a war of words with Miley Cyrus when O'Connor publicly urged the young performer not to "let the music business make a prostitute of you." And accused Arsenio Hall of being a drug supplier for Prince after the superstar's death. O'Connor's personal life was tabloid fodder, divorce, custody battles.
 
The singer married four times was mother to four children. Tormented, talented, O'Connor attempted suicide in the late 1990s. In early 2022, she checked into a hospital while grieving the death of her third son Shane. At 51, O'Connor converted to Islam, covering her trademark shaved head with a hijab. But she continued performing her music reflecting upon a lifetime of struggle.
 <br>[02:20:19]
 
CHURCH: Sinead O'Connor dead at the age of 56.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, the U.S. Federal Reserve is still not satisfied that inflation is under control, and on Wednesday raised its benchmark rate to the highest level in 22 years. It is the 11th time the Fed has raised the prime lending rate since March of last year. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation numbers have improved but not enough.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said meeting by meeting. And I'll close by saying we've raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022.
 
Monetary policy we believe is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Joining me now is CNN Global Economic Analyst Rana Foroohar. Ha she is also a global business columnist and associate editor at the Financial Times. Great to have you with us.
 
RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Great to be here.
 
CHURCH: So the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another quarter point on Wednesday, as it continues to try to reduce inflation taking rates to their highest level in 22 years. Was this the right call coming just one month after hitting the pause button. And of course, as inflation is showing that it is cooling a bit?
 
FOROOHAR: I think it was the right call, Rosemary. You know, we all know that one of the mistakes of the past and particularly the 1970s when we fight inflation hard for the last time was that folks let off the gas too early. And I think that that's a mistake that Jay Powell of the Fed does not want to repeat. We're in a very odd period right now though, it's hard to take the temperature of the American economy in part because the pandemic really changed a lot of vectors.
 
You know, you had a tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus, that's cushioned consumers in a way that we probably wouldn't be seeing at this point in a cycle now. You've also got a lot of worries still about supply chain disruptions, you know, trade tensions, not only with China but potential disruptions to other supply chains, perhaps due to the Ukraine war situation in Europe. And that's making companies I think less likely to want to lay people off.
 <br>[02:25:00]
 
So, it could be that you're seeing a brighter picture in some ways and perhaps a more inflationary picture than you might ordinarily in this portion of a cycle. So, it's just very, very difficult to read what's going to happen.
 
CHURCH: Yes. And the Fed now says a recession is unlikely. But isn't there always that risk that if they push rates too high to further reduce inflation, that could trigger a recession? How do they make that delicate calculation?
 
Oh, boy, it is. It's such delicate calculation. I mean, you know, if you think about why do you raise rates, it's because the economy is growing too strongly. I mean, we still have a very, very tight labor market. It's really quite unexpected, I would say, at this point in a recovery cycle, that we should be at the place that we're at. In some ways, I think that the U.S. continues to benefit from the fact that a lot of other parts of the world are in worse shape, you know, you've got really runaway inflation in the U.K., you've got a major slowdown in China.
 
You've got inflationary pressures in Europe. So, the U.S. is kind of a bright spot. I think that you're going to see the Fed pause now and probably hold for a little bit, maybe even go into fall and see what the picture is looking like then. I think we're not going to see another few rate hikes in any kind of a quick succession. I wouldn't say.
 
CHURCH: Right. Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did say that they are prepared to raise rates further in the future if it's deemed appropriate, which would clearly put considerable pressure on many struggling Americans. How reliable though are these old economic models being followed by the Federal Reserve on how to respond to high inflation, when the circumstances as you point out, are so very different compared to the past?
 
Aren't they? With a resilient economy, high employment levels, and consumers continuing to spend?
 
FOROOHAR: Absolutely. I mean, you know, I have thought and argued for some time, the models that the Fed were you -- it was using are out of date. They don't model a lot of financial implications of higher debt and, you know, just financial markets in general, they tend to be very linear, these models. And I think we're at a moment where the political economy is changing, geopolitics is changing, technology is changing, you've got A.I., you've got, you know, demographic shifts.
 
I mean, there's just almost every potential change vector in the economy is in play. So it really is a tough moment to be making call now. That said, if Jerome Powell and the Fed can land this plane without causing recession boy, he's going go down as one of the -- one of the greats in fed history, I have to say.
 
CHURCH: Right. I'm sure he and many of us are hoping that indeed does happen. Rana Foroohar, always a pleasure to get your analysis. Appreciate it.
 
FOROOHAR: Pleasure to be here. Thanks.
 
CHURCH: Still to come. A dangerous operation is underway off the coast of Yemen to avert a potential environmental catastrophe. We will have a progress report on that.

CHURCH: North Korea is giving a lavish welcome to key allies, Russia and China, who have sent high level delegations to Pyongyang. They're commemorating the 70th anniversary of the armistice agreement, which ended fighting on the Korean peninsula.
 
According to state media, leader Kim Jong-un has been discussing strategic cooperation with the Russian defense minister, who presented him with a signed letter from President Vladimir Putin. And state media reports Kim also received a personal letter from the Chinese president during a, quote, "warm and friendly talk" with the visiting member of China's Politburo.
 
North Korea says China wants to promote the North's development and work together on regional peace. More now from CNN's Will Ripley.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A massive show of force in the North Korean capital. Pyeongyang marking 70 years since the end of the Korean War. A time for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to project nuclear power with a powerful patron signaling support.
 
China sending its highest level delegation to North Korea since 2019, the first since COVID restrictions plunged the secretive state into near total isolation, led by a senior Communist Party official with close ties to President Xi Jinping.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin sending his defense minister to North Korea. A visit to strengthen Russian North Korean military ties, the ministry says. Two-high level visits by Russia and China coming at a crucial time for Kim's regime. Rapidly rising tensions with the U.S.
 
North Korea's longest ever ICBM test. A barrage of ballistic and cruise missile launches. A rare stopover in South Korea by a nuclear capable U.S. submarine. And one week ago, an American soldier's surprise sprint into North Korea. U.S. Army private Travis King, the first active duty U.S. service member to cross the heavily armed border in more than 40 years.
 
The Korean DMZ, the demilitarized zone, is one of the most heavily fortified border areas in the world. That's the reason why you have barricades and spike strips and all of these military checkpoints to try to prevent people from being able to go in or come out.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): I've made several trips to the North Korean side of the DMZ, including this visit in 2015.
 
RIPLEY: Is there a real danger here of something breaking out?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Yes. RIPLEY (voice-over): That ominous exchange with a North Korean soldier came true last week. A U.S. soldier sprinting across the military demarcation line during a tour of the heavily armed Joint Security Area.
 
GEN. ANDREW HARRISON, DEPUTY COMMANDER OF U.N. COMMAND: Clearly, we're in a very difficult and complex situation.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): A situation, some say, should never have happened. Private King was being sent home to be booted from the army. He spent almost 50 days in a South Korean jail for assault, but somehow managed to join a tour group visiting the DMZ. King's name on a passenger manifest approved by the United Nations Command.
 
How could that person's name, in any situation, be allowed to actually get so close where they can run across, you know, into North Korea?
 
HARRISON: That ongoing inquiry seeks to establish details such as those.
 
RIPLEY (voice-over): The State Department says North Korea acknowledged receiving a message from the U.N. Command last week. Radio silence ever since.
 
King's condition, his location, his future in North Korean captivity unknown.

CHURCH: The delegate operation to unload more than 1 million barrels of oil from a rusting tanker is off to a good start. That assessment from the U.N. official leading the effort off the coast of Yemen. And there's a lot at stake.
 
Details now from CNN's Eleni Giokos.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 <br>[02:35:05]
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Attempting to avert an environmental disaster, this United Nations team is offloading 1 million barrels of oil from a rusting super tanker.
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: The ship to ship transfer of oil, which has started today, is the critical next step in avoiding an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe on colossal scales.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): The FSO sapphire tanker has been murdered off the coast of Yemen for more than 30 years, but has not been maintained since 2015 when the war broke out. And the U.N. says that a massive spill from the sapphire would destroy pristine reefs, coastal mangroves, and other sea life across the Red Sea, expose millions of people to highly polluted air, and cut off food, fuel, and other lifesaving supplies to Yemen, where 17 million people already need food aid.
 
The U.N. chief warning that cleanup could cost $20 billion. Complicating matters is the ongoing conflict in Yemen, now under a ceasefire since April. The U.N. says getting permission from the warring parties to empty the tanker has taken two years of difficult negotiation.
 
Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been battling a Saudi Arabia led military coalition supporting the internationally recognized government. The U.N. salvage effort, which could take 19 days, has started positively.
 
DAVID GRESSLY, U.N. HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR IN YEMEN: We have over 120,000 barrels already transferred, but over the next two weeks, we hope to complete that. Then the next set of critical steps will take place. So the hard part, in many ways, technically, is over in getting the vessel stabilized, and that's what allowed us to start the pumping yesterday.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): What's still not clear is who will get to sell the oil once it's safely off the ship. It's mostly owned by SEPOC, a Yemeni state firm.
 
GRESSLY: The first thing we wanted to do was to get the oil off the old vessel so we're no longer worried about the spill happening. Getting it onto a new vessel gives us the time for all of the political and legal discussions that need to take place before the oil can be sold.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Talks with the U.N. about the fate of the oil continue. But for now, the priority remains to avert a calamity on an immense scale.

CHURCH: And still to come, two of the world's top teams go head to head in the Women's World Cup. How the defending champions fared? We're live with the highlights. Back in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHURCH: In the Women's World Cup, a hotly anticipated matchup between defending champions U.S. and the Netherlands. A rematch of the 2019 World Cup Final. The Americans got off to a rocky start, giving up an early goal in the 17th minute.
 <br>[02:40:09]
 
And CNN's Angus Watson joins us now live from Sydney. Good to see you, Angus. You, of course, have been following all the action. Take us through the highlights of this dramatic clash.
 
ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: Rosemary, not the start that Team USA would have wanted in this heavyweight clash between the team and the Netherlands. The two finalists from 2019. The Dutch going ahead with a well taken goal by Jill Roord. So at the half, it was one nil. Team USA came out with a fire in their bellies, though, looking for that equalizer, it came around the hour mark.
 
Lindsey Horan, the team captain, nodding at home with a well taken header from a corner, making it her second goal of the tournament so far. And Team USA then went hunting for the winner. It almost came moments later. Alex Morgan thought she'd scored, called back for offside.
 
So the team pressed on and on. But it wasn't to be 1-1, the final score. For that huge crowd in Wellington that came to watch, loads of excitement there, loads of excitement here, too, at the fan zone in Sydney, where hundreds turned out to watch the game. Here's what some of the fans had to say about the result.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I was terrified. I thought they were going to lose because the Americans seemed really like hyped up for this. And they were looking like they were going to kill us.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And of course, the Americans won last time against the Dutch also. So, yeah, it was a good match.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm hoping to see more of that fire from Horan. That response, a little bit of ticky-tacky in the middle. We love to hear that response, especially from, like, the strong women in the U.S.

WATSON: So much to look forward to as this tournament goes on. The Team USA side has Portugal up next. So many superlatives, so many records that Team USA holds. When they went one nil down in the first half, it was the first time that they'd trailed in a match since 2011. And leveling it up, 1-1 meant it was -- they haven't lost at all in the last 19 games, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: I know you're enjoying your work today. Angus Watson joining us live there from Sydney. Appreciate it.
 
I'm Rosemary Church. World Sport is up next, and I'll be back in 15 minutes with more CNN Newsroom. Hope you can stick around.
