THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Welcome to the show. I`m Coy. This is CNN 10. And I know it is a teacher`s appreciation week for a lot of 
 
 you out there. So let me just say that being part of your day is a privilege and honor that my team and I do not take for granted. Thank you 
 
 for all you do. Keep inspiring, uplifting, and uniting. 
 
Keep doing your thing, Mr. Elder, at Nordhoff Junior High and Ojai. Keep shining, Ms. Skillin at Elizabethtown High in PA, rise up. And happy Friday 
 
 Eve. 
 
Now to the news. We start today with an update on a story. We covered a few weeks ago, the potential ban of TikTok in the United States. Now, the 
 
 Chinese social media app is suing the U.S. government. 
 
President Biden signed a bill last month that would effectively ban the social media app in America if the company that owns it doesn`t find a new 
 
 owner in the next few months. 
 
Why is this happening? Because many American leaders say TikTok is a threat to U.S. national security. The app is owned by ByteDance, a privately owned 
 
 Chinese company. But in China, the authoritarian government often treats privately owned companies like they are government owned. That has some 
 
 U.S. security officials concerned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to try to influence Americans` opinions on certain topics or even 
 
 collect data on users. 
 
But don`t wave bye to TikTok just yet. The Chinese social media app`s lawsuit against the U.S. government argues that the new law is 
 
 unconstitutional. CNN`s Clare Duffy has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: The stakes here for TikTok are huge. This bill could lead to a ban of TikTok in the U.S., which is one of its biggest 
 
 markets, 170 million American users. And TikTok is claiming here that this bill infringes on the First Amendment speech rights of the platform and of 
 
 those American users.
 
Just as a reminder, this bill would force TikTok to find a new American owner, spin off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or face a ban in 
 
 the United States. But the company is claiming that this bill really is just a ban and that if it`s left to stand, left to stay in place, that it 
 
 will lead to TikTok being blocked in the United States starting in January of next year. 
 
The company claims in this lawsuit that the divestiture required by this law, and I`m quoting here now, "is simply not possible, not commercially, 
 
 not technically, not legally," and certainly not on the 270-day timeline required by this act.
 
TikTok is citing here, for example, the fact that the Chinese government has said that it wouldn`t allow TikTok to be sold with its recommendation 
 
 algorithm, which is really the thing that makes this platform so valuable. 
 
So TikTok saying it`s not possible for us to be divested from ByteDance. Therefore this is a ban and a ban is unconstitutional. And what`s 
 
 interesting about this is it`s really going to set up the court to have to weigh the U.S. lawmakers` national security concerns when it comes to 
 
 TikTok over or sort of against the First Amendment rights of this platform and of its U.S. users. 
 
So I expect that we`ll see this legislature, this litigation, I should say, drag on for quite some time.

WIRE: Now we head to Rafah, a city in southern Gaza. So far at least 50,000 people have evacuated as Israel conducts what it calls a limited military 
 
 operation in the city. The U.S. has now paused a shipment of 3,500 weapons to Israel amid fears they could be used in further attacks on Rafah. CNN`s 
 
 Jeremy Diamond has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Rafah border crossing with Egypt now firmly under Israeli control. For now, that means nothing in 
 
 or out at this critical crossing point for humanitarian aid, fuel, and medical evacuations.
 
As plumes of smoke rise over the area, the Israeli prime minister touting the operation as a play to bolster Israeli leverage in ceasefire talks with 
 
 Hamas, which put a new proposal on the table hours before Israeli tanks rolled into Rafah.
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Military pressure on Hamas is a necessary condition for the return of our hostages. 
 
 The Hamas proposal yesterday was intended to torpedo the entry of our forces into Rafah. It did not happen.
 
DIAMOND: Israeli air and artillery strikes began pummeling eastern Rafah late Monday night.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I`m 69 years old and I haven`t seen in my life shelling and bombing like this. I have witnessed many wars in my 
 
 life and I haven`t seen a war like this one. 
 
DIAMOND: Things could soon get worse. Israeli officials are threatening to expand military operations deeper into Rafah where more than a million 
 
 Palestinians currently live.
 
ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: A full scale assault on Rafah would be a human catastrophe. Countless more civilian casualties. 
 
 Countless more families forced to flee.
 
DIAMOND: Thousands are already fleeing what was once the last refuge in Gaza for this coastal area the Israeli military calls a humanitarian zone, 
 
 setting up makeshift shelters with tarp sheets and thin planks of wood.
 
Humanitarian aid officials warn this area isn`t equipped to handle the basic needs of hundreds of thousands of people who could soon be forced to 
 
 leave Rafah. After seven months of war, ceasefire negotiations offer the only hope of a way out.

WIRE: Pop quiz, hot shots. 
 
Black holes are created when which of these collapses? 
 
A planet, a star, a galaxy, or a universe?
 
If you said star, you deserve a constellation prize. Black holes are created when a massive star collapses after running out of fuel and falling 
 
 inward on its center. 
 
All right, buckle up, my friends. We`re about to travel almost the speed of light, or to be specific, almost 670 million miles per hour. Are you cool 
 
 with that? This new NASA simulation shows what it would be like to get drawn into a massive black hole.
 
Check it out.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This new NASA simulation takes you past the Earth`s atmosphere and into a supermassive black hole. The immersive visualization 
 
 was made on a supercomputer and moves viewers close to the speed of light. NASA created two different scenarios for viewers.
 
One shows a first-person perspective of an astronaut just missing the event horizon or point of no return of the black hole and slingshotted back out. 
 
 And another, where it crosses the boundary and plunges into the event horizon. According to NASA, the black hole is similar to the one at the 
 
 center of the Milky Way and its event horizon spans 16 million miles.

WIRE: Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10. Is it a wagon? Is it a car? Whatever it is, it`s completely legal to drive on the street and now it`s 
 
 for sale. CNN`s Jeanne Moos has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For sale. Not a station wagon, but a little red wagon that grew into a big red wagon that goes 60 miles an hour, 
 
 mileage just over 57,000, basic interior with two seats and a steering wheel made out of a garden cart wheel.
 
JUDY FOSTER, RADIO FLYER CAR SELLER: I`ll miss it and I`ll miss the fun of driving it. It`s just so much fun to take somebody for a ride and seeing 
 
 people`s reactions to you.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God, It`s amazing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love it. 
 
MOOS: Other cars sometimes even follow it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then we started yelling at our grandma to drive after it.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, you want to sell it?
 
MOOS: Now, owner Judy Foster does. Her husband built the Radio Flyer 14 years ago on the chassis of this 1976 Mazda pickup. When Judy`s husband 
 
 recently passed away, she decided it was time to pass on the wagon.
 
It`s up for auction at Alaska Premier Auctions. Co-owner Nick Cline says, why buy an expensive Ferrari?
 
NICK CLINE, CO-OWNER, ALASKA PREMIER AUCTIONS: This one will get you more eyeballs than any of those at a fraction of the price.
 
MOOS: They`re guesstimating $10,000 to $15,000, 8-foot handle included. Its four-cylinder Mazda engine runs on regular gas. In the movie Radio Flyer, 
 
 two brothers turn their wagon into an airplane.
 
In real life, at least a handful of fans have built their own Radio Flyer cars. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just riding in a Radio Flyer wagon makes me feel younger. 
 
MOOS: Judy was even invited to drive her flyer around the Charlotte Motor Speedway.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You made that?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.
 
FOSTER: I`ve laughed and said, you can`t be in the Witness Protection Program and ride in a car.
 
MOOS: If you`re craving attention, hitch your wagon to this star. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
WIRE: That thing is spoketacular. Takes station wagon to a whole new level. We hope you have a "wheelie," "wheelie" good day, superstars.
 
We`re going to give a shout-out now. Mr. Chassanoff`s class at Tolland Middle School in Tolland, Connecticut. Keep flying high, my Falcons.
 
And this shout-out goes to Mr. Ruggles` class at Sibley-Ocheyedan High School in Sibley, Iowa. March on, Generals. Hope you have a wonderful day.
 
I`ll see you right back here tomorrow. I`m Coy Wire. And we are CNN 10.
