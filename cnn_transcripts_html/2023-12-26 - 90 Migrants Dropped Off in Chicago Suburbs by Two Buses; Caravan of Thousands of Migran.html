(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Two busloads of migrants moved from Texas to a Chicago suburb over the weekend, and the city of Chicago has reported it has received roughly 26,000 migrants from Texas in the past 16 months, and there are potentially more to come.
 
The caravan of thousands of migrants is still on the move, headed through Mexico toward the U.S. border, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken is headed to Mexico tomorrow to try and hammer out new agreements to better control the flow of migrants.
 
CNN's Rosa Flores is in Eagle Pass, Texas, for us. And Rosa, you've been reporting from all across the southern U.S. border. What are you hearing and seeing there now?
 
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kate, the situation has significantly improved here in Eagle Pass, Texas. If you look behind me, you'll see an empty field. Last week when we talked, there were thousands of migrants who were there waiting to be transported for immigration processing. Now, according to a senior CBP official, don't be fooled by this. This agency is still not out of the woods yet because illicit organizations, smugglers continue to push migrants to cross all along the U.S. southern border illegally into the United States.
 
Now, we have video from just moments ago. There's very small groups of migrants who are crossing into the United States right now here in Eagle Pass, Texas. Those are the scenes here. But this illicit activity continues, and that is what has this agency worried about. Figuring out where the next large group of migrants is going to be crossing to.
 
Now, the federal government has been grappling with an increasing number of migrants crossing in -- illegally into the United States. And the federal government has surged resources all along the U.S. southern border. They have also suspended operations at several ports of entry in several states to reassign those agents to process migrants. And they are also using something called decompression, that's when they move migrants from an area that's overcapacity to an area that has space.
 
Now, from talking to nonprofit organizations all along the U.S. Southern border, I can tell you that here from Eagle Pass, some of the migrants are being taken to the Rio Grande Valley, to Laredo, to Del Rio to be processed. And a lot of them are being released into American communities.
 
Now, I want to take you to Del Rio. We have some video of this. A group of migrants celebrating Christmas mass yesterday. This is an open-air mass underneath the awning of a respite center. And the priest there tells us that on Friday, there were about 200 migrants. When we were there yesterday, there was about two dozen. And he celebrated mass with them. Take a listen.

FATHER MICHAEL CORONADO, ST. JOSEPH AND OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE CATHOLIC CHURCHES:  We had a few people come to our church to celebrate with us there, and we knew that there was a lot more here. So, we thought it would be best for them to have a moment to have mass here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FLORES:  And, Kate, just to give you an idea of what this decompression that we're seeing here, that Del Rio Respite Center told us that just last week, they assisted about 4,200 migrants. Just to give you an idea in August, they helped 5,800 in the entire month. So, that just gives you an idea of just the number of migrants who are being sent to other areas to make sure that they can be processed quickly. Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  That does show it. Rosa, thank you for your continued reporting on this. Really appreciate it.
 <br>[10:35:00]
 
SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  OK. This is just -- this is weird. The newest Apple watches are now banned in the United States. And just this morning the White House officially declined to issue emergency action to keep them on store shelves. A U.S. Trade tribunal is preventing Apple from selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and other newer models because Apple apparently violated a patent registered to another company.
 
Rahel, sort this out for us. Like, what is going on?
 
RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR:  Yes, this is pretty weird. I can tell you that there has been a flurry of statements this morning. So, fewer options for people right now if you're looking to buy a watch, but Apple just announced that they are appealing this decision. So, stay tuned. But I'm going to paraphrase here. Apple said that, we strongly disagree with this decision and they're taking all measures to return the items back to store shelves. That statement came after the U.S. Trade rep put out a statement essentially saying, yes, we decided not to intervene and we can put this statement up for you. Basically saying, after careful consultations, the ambassador decided not to reverse the determination.
 
Let's take a step back. Let's talk about how we got here.
 
SIDNER:  Yes.
 
SOLOMON:  So, Apple and this California based company, Masimo, have been locked in this trade dispute for years. It's all over the technology that Apple Watch uses to detect and read blood oxygen levels. It's a light-based technology. And this company, Masimo, says, hey, that's our technology. That is our intellectual property. Apple obviously disagrees. Fast forward to October of this year, that's when the U.S. Trade representative organization got involved, and basically sided with Masimo. 60 days later, here we are, and this is when the ruling takes effect.
 
So, again, Apple now saying, hey, we're going to appeal this. But in the meantime, if you go on Apple's website right now, it's temporarily unavailable. If you are going into a physical store, it is likely also not there. If you're looking, you can, however, find it at a big box retailer. Think a Target, for example. Think a Walmart, for example. For investors who may be watching this thinking, wait a minute --
 
SIDNER:  Yes, what's going on?
 
SOLOMON:  -- what does this mean?
 
SIDNER:  Yes.
 
SOLOMON:  What does this mean for Apple? I spoke to an analyst who's been covering the company for more than 15 years. He said that this is more of a P.R. nightmare. Dan Ives telling me that he expects this to be a hit of about $200 to $300 million dollars in lost revenue. Again, more of a P.R. black eye than a financial black eye. A few reasons why. More of a P.R. nightmare because who wants to be accused of stealing somebody's --
 
SIDNER:  Stealing somebody's patent.
 
SOLOMON:  Exactly.
 
SIDNER:  Right.
 
SOLOMON:  Especially a tech company.
 
SIDNER:  Right.
 
SOLOMON:  It's not a good look. Financially, not as much of a hit because if you think about this ruling going into effect today, the day after Christmas, people who wanted to buy --
 
SIDNER:  Right. SOLOMON:  -- the newest Apple watch have already bought it.
 
SIDNER:  They got it.
 
SOLOMON:  Exactly. And so, moving forward, he expects us to be wrapped up, perhaps with a software update, but regardless, Apple is saying we're not taking this. We're appealing. So, only time will tell.
 
SIDNER:  $200 to $300 million is a P.R. black -- I want a black eye like that.
 
SOLOMON:  OK.
 
SIDNER:  I mean --
 
SOLOMON:  We need that kind of black eye. I'll take it.
 
SIDNER:  Rahel Solomon, thank you so much for explaining all of that. I was so confused. Now, I get it.
 
Kate.
 
BOLDUAN:  A blackeye, we could all use.
 
Coming up for us, in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action in college admissions, now in debate among high school students. Should they put their race on their college applications? We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:40:00]
 
SIDNER:  Months after the Supreme Court's historic decision to end affirmative action in college admissions, black students now grappling with the real-life consequences of that and whether they should mention their race in college applications.
 
CNN's Gabe Cohen is joining us now. What did you learn as you're talking to some of these students about this dilemma, and what sort of stood out to be the big stressor to you the most?
 
GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Sara, I think it's the uncertainty. I mean, look, the college process has always been a bit mysterious, a bit ambiguous, but this takes it to a whole another level for these students who are just trying to figure out the right way to approach their applications. And as a result of that, the students I spoke with are taking starkly different approaches.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LYNIJAH RUSSELL, APPLYING TO COLLEGE:  Hi, Brown. My name is Lynijah, and I am a black girl in STEM.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  That's Lynijah Russell's application video for Brown University. She's among the millions of students applying to college six months after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, navigating how and even whether to include race in their pitch for admission.
 
COHEN:  What was your reaction to the decision?
 
RUSSELL:  At first, I was a little scared. I thought it was a bit unfair. It made me doubt myself a little bit, like, are my numbers good enough?
 
COHEN:  You actually took some schools off your list.
 
RUSSELL:  I thought, I felt like getting into those schools were almost impossible.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  But when she sat down to write her college essays, she decided it was more important than ever to discuss race as part of her life experience.
 
RUSSELL:  I believe it made me emphasize that I was black a bit more than I probably would have. I started expressing myself more through my photos, my hairstyles.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  Her main essay is about growing up in a rough part of Baltimore.
 
RUSSELL:  The thing that's important to me is my identity, who I am as a person, and race is a big part of that.
 
COHEN:  You think schools are still looking for that diversity?
 
RUSSELL:  Yes.
 
TRACY RAMOS, CO-FOUNDER, COLLEGE BOUND PARENTING:  Do not ignore such a crucial part of your identity.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  College advisors like Tracy Ramos are encouraging black students not to shy away from race in their applications, especially in their essays.
 
RAMOS:  It paints a holistic picture of who you are.
 
COHEN:  Do you think with outboxes to check it's even more important to write about these issues?
 
RAMOS:  I do. A lot of the elite colleges are looking for ways to identify these students. The key piece of advice is, make it easy for the colleges to know all of who you are.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  Many schools have added questions to their applications so students can discuss their life experience and how they'd add to campus diversity.
 
SEAN MANLEY, APPLYING TO COLLEGE:  As a student athlete, Vice President of the Black Student Union, and Vice President of the National Society of Black Engineers.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  Sean Manley's essays captured his unique experience as a black student in rural Maryland.
 <br>[10:45:00]
 
MANLEY:  I was scared at first that they wouldn't be able to see my race and see all the challenges that come with it. I'm very proud of, like, who I am and it's a very important part of why I'm here.
 
COHEN:  Do you think it will put you in a better spot?
 
MANLEY:  I don't know if writing it in my essay is good or bad yet because we're kind of, like, the experiment class.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  The Supreme Court decision has added a new level of stress to an already stressful college application process for students like Sean and Lynijah. Experts expect historically black colleges will see higher enrollment and more applications. And some students are taking a very different approach.
 
COHEN:  You took race out of most of your essays.
 
HARMONY MOORE, APPLYING TO COLLEGE:  Yes.
 
COHEN (voice-over):  Harmony Moore rewrote her essays about being a black student at a mostly white Houston school.
 
COHEN:  Why did you feel that was necessary?
 
MOORE:  I didn't want to have the admissions -- wrong admissions officer read it. And then they all of a sudden, like, don't want to let me into their school because they feel like I'm trying to, like, push my race on them. I think I stand out, like, on my own, like, with my extracurriculars and with my honors that I've received. I don't want to just, like, have the exact same story as hundreds of other black students.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
COHEN (on camera):  And another student told me she's looking at each college individually and only writing about her racial identity for the schools that she believes are more progressive, which again, Sara, speaks to the calculations that students are making right now. And it's going to be really interesting to see how all of this impacts the actual admissions numbers. We likely won't know that for at least a few months. But obviously already a lot of concern in the wake of the Supreme Court decision of what will diversity on college campuses look like in the next few years.
 
SIDNER:  Gabe Cohen, that was really illuminating. Thank you for doing that story. It was really well done. Appreciate it.
 
BOLDUAN:  Coming up for us, he has a long history of making antisemitic remarks. But now, Kanye West is issuing an apology to the Jewish community. Why he's putting this out now. We'll be right back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:50:00]
 
BOLDUAN:  Kanye West has issued an apology today to the Jewish community. The timing, good question. His apology for any, "Unintended outburst" caused by his, "Words or actions." And also, he says that he did not intend to, "Hurt or disrespect." He posted the message in Hebrew on Instagram. You well know he has a long history of antisemitic statements, including tweeting that he was going to go DEFCON 3 on Jewish people last year.
 
CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister joins us now. I'm confused by this, Elizabeth. And the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League, just put out a statement on this. Bring us up to speed, please.
 
ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning. So, a lot of confusion with the reaction to Kanye West's apology. You know, it is worth noting that he does have an album that is coming out next month. I don't know if a lot of people know that, but he has an album coming out. He has been promoting it. He has had listening parties for this album. And one of the lyrics in one of his songs from this upcoming album was perceived as highly antisemitic and misogynistic.
 
So, now for him to be coming out with this is in stark contrast to much of what he has said in the past. Now, we did just obtain a statement from the ADL, as you mentioned, Kate. So, I want to read that. What it says is, "After causing untold damage by using his vast influence and platform to poison countless minds with vicious antisemitism and hate, an apology in Hebrew may be the first step on a long journey towards making amends to the Jewish community and all of those he has hurt. Ultimately, actions speak louder than words, but this initial act of contrition is welcome."
 
BOLDUAN:  Actions for sure, but when you are in the business of words, that is also a part of it. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.
 
SIDNER:  All right. Just ahead, the U.S. striking back. President Biden orders rare airstrikes inside Iraq after an attack on U.S. troops. What is next in the Middle East as fighting intensifies? Is there worry that a regional war will break out? Stay with us. We'll talk about it coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:55:00]
 
ANNOUNCER:  This is "CNN", the world's news network.
 
SIDNER:  This morning, the U.S. Military carrying out airstrikes in Iraq. What we know about the retaliatory attacks ordered by President Biden.
 
BOLDUAN:  And the FBI is now getting involved investigating violent threats toward Colorado Supreme Court justices, the very same justices who just ruled that Donald Trump is disqualified from appearing on the state's primary ballot.
 
SIDNER:  And thinking of returning a holiday gift, watch out. It could cost you. We'll explain.
 
I'm Sara Sidner with Kate Bolduan. John Berman is working the night shift, but he'll be back with us next week. This is "CNN News Central."
 
BOLDUAN:  The U.S. striking back, carrying out retaliatory strikes in Iraq after American troops are attacked and wounded.
 
In Israel, the prime minister there is now laying out more detail of his plan to wipe out Hamas as one of his top advisors is in Washington today for some tough meetings likely with top Biden administration officials.
 
Let's start in Iraq this hour, where we are learning this morning that President Biden ordered a series of airstrikes targeting three facilities used by the Iranian backed militant group Kata'ib Hezbollah. That group claimed responsibility for a drone attack Monday at the Erbil Air Base.
