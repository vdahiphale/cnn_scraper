MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: More now from CNN's Jeremy Diamond.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Well, the first 15 minutes of that anticipated truce between Israel and Hamas certainly did not sound like a truce. In those first 15 minutes, we continued to hear the sounds of war coming from inside the Gaza Strip. We were hearing heavy weaponry being fired. We were hearing a small arms fire and about 15 minutes into that truce, rocket siren sounding into Israeli communities on the border with the Gaza Strip. 
 
But after that, things appeared to settle down. We did not hear any additional heavy weaponry being fired after around 7:18 a.m. local time. We did hear some sporadic gunfire apparently coming from inside the Gaza Strip. But we don't know of course the source of that gunfire. 
 
But for now at least, a truce appears to be settling in between Israel and Hamas. And that is obviously welcome news for the families of those 13 hostages who are expected to be released in the first batch of that deal between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and the United States government. 13 hostages women and children expected to leave the Gaza Strip at around 4:00 p.m. local time. 
 
We have been cautions that that timing could certainly change as there are a lot of variables, a lot of uncertainty still building around this initial release of hostages the first of the anticipated 50 hostages who are set to be released over the course of four days, a four-day truce has been established in order to allow for the release of those hostages. Israel also set to release three Palestinian prisoners for every one civilian hostage released by Hamas. Now, what we do know is that these first days are going to be critical
 
 to see the viability of this hostage release plan. Qatar, which has been mediating these negotiations has been very clear that they hope that these first 50 will be a proving ground in order to allow for the release of additional hostages. For every 10 additional hostages that Hamas releases after those first 50, Israel will agree to an additional one day of a pause in fighting. 
 
But one thing has been made very clear by Israeli officials. This is not a ceasefire. This is a temporary pause in fighting, and Israeli officials from the Prime Minister to the defense minister have made very clear that they will continue to carry out this war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after this pause and fighting ends. 
 
The defense minister saying that that fighting he expects will go on for at least two months beyond this point until they reach their goals of destroying Hamas and removing it from power in Gaza. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Sderot, Israel.

FOSTER: The Israeli government has notified the families the first group of hostages set to be released on Friday. Hundreds of families are waiting for word if their loved ones will be freed. Dani Engel is hoping his brother sister in law and nieces will return safely. 
 
Hamas is expected to release Israeli women and children hostages meaning Dani's brother could potentially be split up from the family if they're part of the initial exchange. Dani spoke with CNN about the situation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANI ENGEL, FAMILY HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: It's harder because when I thinking that my brother may not be coming now, if at all because my brother who I had -- my brother was with the weapon and on that Saturday morning and he tried, I think that he tried to defend his family. And we are not certain about what is happening with him with, not certain of anything but with him is hard.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well, Doctors in Gaza tell CNN they hope the truce will allow for hospital patients and staff to safely evacuate from North and Central Gaza. Information trickling in suggests the number of people killed in the Enclave continues to climb. That's according to Hamas authorities in Gaza who say the death toll from Israeli attacks now stands at more than 14,850. An injured Palestinian man evacuating of Gaza to Egypt describe life in the Enclave during the war.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We pray for martyrdom. But fear this fear. I can't describe it. We die every night in this war. You hear the sound about to strike and we don't know where it would hit. A missile destroys a block. So imagine what happens when we are hit with three missiles.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Well, the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah says disruptions to community networks in Gaza have made it difficult to collect the most up to date information from hospitals.
 <br>[04:35:04]
 
The nation of Qatar was instrumental in mediating the hostage release deal and experts say that's because they had contacts many others just don't. Just ahead, why Qatar has become a crucial mediator across the Middle East.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: More now on our top story, for the first time in seven weeks guns are silent in Gaza as a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas appears to be holding. A CNN team near the Israel-Gaza border reported artillery and rocket fire in the first few minutes of the pause in fighting but that subdued quickly. 
 
As part of the deal, Hamas is expected to free 13 Israeli hostages today or women and children while Israel is set to release 39 Palestinian women and teenagers held in Israeli jails. Egypt says at least 98 trucks have already entered Gaza this morning with more than 100 still expected to come. 
 
Qatar lead negotiator says it took very intense work to broker the hostage release deal. CNN's Brian Todd has more on how Qatar became an essential mediator in Prisoner deals.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A pivotal player in getting the hostages freed from Hamas captivity is a tiny emirate over 1,000 miles away from Gaza smaller than the state of Connecticut with about a quarter of the population of New York City, Qatar, an oil rich nation on a peninsula in the Persian Gulf ruled by a 43-year-old Sheikh named Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who took over when his father abdicated 10 years ago. 
 
Analysts say Qatar has been indispensable in brokering this hostage deal.
 
DAVID SCHENKER, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR EAST POLICY: Qatar is central. It has relationships with a broad range of terrorist groups throughout the region, and unsavory regimes. 
 
TODD (voice-over): Qatar was instrumental in getting four hostages, two Israelis and two Americans released about two weeks after the current war started and that wasn't Qatar's first go round with deals like that.
 <br>[04:40:07] PETER BERGEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Qatar has had a long role in these kinds of prisoner negotiations, most recently playing an important role in getting five American prisoners released from Iran. There was $6 billion of Iranian funds that were sent to Qatar. 
 
TODD (voice-over): That deal took place in September. Analysts say mediation has long been one of Qatar's most marketable skills. Specifically, its ability to be an interlocutor between international players who are at odds with one another.
 
BERGEN: They are seen as a sort of a fair player by many of the different actors in the region. They do have some leverage over Hamas. 
 
TODD (voice-over): For years, Qatar has given sanctuary to figures like Hamas's top political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Qatar's financial support for Hamas and Palestinian citizens in Gaza has been substantial.
 
SCHENKER: The State of Qatar funding Hamas for many years, underwriting the salaries of Hamas and Palestinian employees in Gaza.
 
TODD (voice-over): But Qatar has also been one of America's closest allies in the Middle East, not only supplying oil and gas, but also allowing the U.S. to maintain the Al Udeid Air Base, headquarters of U.S. Central Command. 
 
SCHENKER: We ran operations not only in Iraq, but in Afghanistan out of there. We continue to run operations.
 
TODD (voice-over): Qatar was crucial in facilitating America's 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan. It's maintained backchannel contacts with Israel, while at the same time having relationships with groups like the Taliban and al Qaeda, and sharing an enormous natural gas field with Iran, all of which allow Qatar to have dialogue with key players in the region like no one else can. And experts say Qatar is willing to do things in negotiations over hostages or captured militants that the U.S. and others want.
 
SCHENKER: The United States typically had in the past has not paid ransoms, but Qatar has no qualms about it.
 
TODD: Analysts say when tensions in the Middle East subside, Qatar will be under significant pressure, as it already has been from some members of the U.S. Congress to sever its relationship with Hamas and kick Hamas leaders out of Qatar. But they say it's an open question right now whether Qatari leaders will actually take that step. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

FOSTER: Now, some high profile men including the mayor of New York City and actor Jamie Foxx, and others are facing sexual assault accusations as the one year window closes for adult assault survivors to file lawsuits. Details after the break.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [041:45:37]
 
FOSTER: Water scarcity is an increasing problem with the U.N. estimating that 2.3 billion people live in water stressed countries. Scientists at UC Davis in California are making significant strides in water management by implanting microchips into almond and pistachio trees. 
 
With the aid of artificial intelligence these innovative chips can predict farmers water needs, up to 10 days in advance this pioneering development has the potential to revolutionize farming practices and ensure efficient water usage, particularly in regions prone to water scarcity. CNN's Eleni Giokos has more.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ISAYA KISEKKA, DIRECTOR OF UC DAVIS AGRICULTURAL WATER CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS: When you talk to farmers, they tell you one of the most the biggest threats to their operations is water. Without water they have no business.
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Isaya Kisekka is conducting research to see if he can assist farmers in better water management. He's turning to artificial intelligence in the hope that our farmers have a future. 
 
KISEKKA: We are the home of the artificial intelligence Institute for next generation food systems. Basically, how do you use AI in making sure people have enough food to eat and it's producing an environmentally sustainable way.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Some of California's farmers are increasingly buying the water needs from outside suppliers. It's adding to their costs. And it brings huge difficulties in predicting their water needs on a day to day basis. That's why they are turning to Isaya and his team with the AI research.
 
Out in the field, they instead microchips into pistachio and almond trees, taking the data and assessing it back in their labs where they are able to predict a farmers water needs up to 10 days in advance. 
 
KISEKKA: So we have used AI and some information on soil and weather to make this prediction. So the farmer now can say OK, this block is not -- this block is actually more stressed than this one. So I need to put a little bit more water than this blog. 
 
If you imagine in California, we will get about 9 million acres. So imagine if each farmer served two to three inches, that's a lot of water.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): It's through his research and breakthroughs in artificial intelligence that Isaya remains optimistic about our food and water security needs in the future.
 
KISEKKA: My vision is in the future we'll have autonomous irrigation systems, where you know there is as little human interaction. If we can trust these systems that will help not just with optimizing water but optimizing energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even level.

FOSTER: Now, we're residence near the site of a fiery train derailment in Kentucky of being given the all clear to return home. The train operator CSX says firefighters are put out ablaze the started after 16 cars jumped the tracks in Rockcastle County on Wednesday.
 <br>[04:50:03]
 
Residents were then asked to evacuate because two train cars spilled molten sulfur, which caught on fire. That led to a temporary release of the toxic sulfur dioxide gas according to the EPA, but CSX says the area is now deemed safe will cause the incident is still under investigation. 
 
Police in Ireland have arrested 34 people involved in violent riots in Dublin clashes broke out between police and protesters after three children and two adults were stabbed in the central part of the city. The video from Reuters shows a bus on fire and other videos posted on social media show a group of men clashing with officers and setting a police car on fire. Some protesters were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans. The police commissioner had strong words for those taking part in the clashes.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DREW HARRIS, NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well, I think there's disgraceful scenes in terms of major investigation, the maintenance of a scene, the gathering of evidence, and we have a complete, lunatic hooligan faction driven by far right ideology and also then this disruptive tendency here and engage them in serious violence. Now, we are drafting in resources to deal with that and that will be dealt with properly.
