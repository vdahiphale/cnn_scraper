BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR: Well, welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson coming to you live from our Middle East programming hub here in Abu Dhabi.
 
Israel now confirming it has occupied a village in southern Lebanon. This after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers an ominous warning. We are 
 
 live in Tel Aviv, in Tehran and in Washington, D.C. for you this hour.
 
First up, though, I want to get you to Florida, bracing for what forecasters say will be catastrophic impacts from Hurricane Milton. The now 
 
 Category 4 storm is on track to hit central Florida in the overnight hours. Ahead of that, Milton is expanding in size, as you can see here, and will 
 
 hit with life-threatening storm surge and devastating winds.
 
By the time it makes landfall, nearly the entire state of Florida will be experiencing some sort of impact.
 
Carlos Suarez is in Fort Myers in Florida, which could experience some of the most severe impacts once that storm reaches land. Just describe where 
 
 you are and what the expectations are at this point.
 
CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Becky, good morning from Fort Myers, Florida, where the wind has started to pick up and a quick look at 
 
 the radar shows that we'll start seeing some of the rain move through this part of southwest Florida in the next couple of hours. The big concern for 
 
 the folks that live here is the flooding that we're going to see because of Hurricane Milton. Right now, the forecast is calling for a storm surge of 
 
 anywhere between 8 to 12 feet.
 
Now, to give you a sense of that number, two years ago, Hurricane Ian made a direct landfall here in Lee County, and about 10 feet of storm surge 
 
 pushed off from the Caloosahatchee River here out into the mainland of Fort Myers. And so, everything that you're taking a look at here two years ago 
 
 was underwater. It was damaged, if not destroyed.
 
The amphitheater behind me was gone. It had to be rebuilt. The convention center to my right also had to be repaired because of what happened here 
 
 with Hurricane Ian.
 
And so, the folks out here have been preparing for the last couple of days because, again, Hurricane Ian two years ago was a direct hit, and this 
 
 place was leveled. The damage, the flooding was pretty bad. And now with the forecast that Milton is on, it's tracking a little bit north of where 
 
 we are.
 
It's supposed to make landfall north of where we are. But even, you know, that fact alone is not enough for these folks because they, again, believe 
 
 that the storm surge out here is either going to be at the same level, if not higher, than Hurricane Ian.
 
Becky?
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you. Thank you.
 
And we have a lot more for you later in the hour. You can, of course, follow all the very latest on Hurricane Milton on our website CNN Digital. 
 
 We'll keep you bang up to date with live updates from the places in Florida bracing for the most serious impact.
 
Well, I want to turn to Israel's expanding war in Lebanon now. Has it reached a turning point? An Israeli minister says his forces have now 
 
 occupied a southern Lebanese village for the first time since Israel launched its operation just a few weeks ago.
 
Now, the Israeli military said it had taken control of an Hezbollah compact -- combat compound. Israel's prime minister had this message for the 
 
 Lebanese people.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Stand up and take your country back. You have an opportunity that hasn't existed in decades, an 
 
 opportunity to take care of the future of your children and grandchildren. You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a 
 
 long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza.
 
I say to you, the people of Lebanon, free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, it is worth remembering that Hezbollah emerged to fight Israel following Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 that lasted nearly 
 
 two decades.
 
Well, last hour, I spoke with Firas Maksad, who is a Lebanese-American expert based in Washington. He is an expert on the Middle East. We talked 
 
 about Mr. Netanyahu's warning to Lebanon and about the raising of the Israeli flag inside Lebanese territory.
 
Have a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
FIRAS MAKSAD, SENIOR FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Very highly inflatable incidents yesterday where the Israelis raised their flag on Lebanese 
 
 territory in that village of Maroun al-Ras. This is not a flag that belongs on that land. And if anybody is trying to undermine Hezbollah's popularity 
 
 in Lebanon and amongst its support base, that's not the way to go about it. It's exactly how you breathe air into the lungs of Hezbollah and its 
 
 supporters who do not want to see a Lebanese land occupied by Israel.
 <br>[10:05:29]
 
And of course, this was then followed by the speech of Bibi Netanyahu, ostensibly addressed to the Lebanese people. There is no Lebanese as anti-
 
 Iranian or anti-Hezbollah as they can be, that wants to be seen as taking their guidelines and points from Bibi Netanyahu. That is only 
 
 counterproductive.
 
And so, Bibi is better off talking to his own audiences than trying to address the Lebanese in the way that would only backfire and only inflame 
 
 and strengthen Hezbollah's influence in that country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, Mr. Netanyahu is expected to hold a call shortly with U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss a response to Iran's missile attack a couple 
 
 of weeks ago on Israel.
 
Look, we've got a lot to unpack this hour. Jeremy Diamond back with us from Tel Aviv, Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon, and Fred Pleitgen is in 
 
 Tehran.
 
Jeremy, let me start with you. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant's trip was delayed to Washington to see the Lloyd Austin, the minister of defense 
 
 for the U.S., because it was delayed because Mr. Netanyahu wanted to speak to Joe Biden first. Why is that? What do we understand to be going on here?
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, I think there's a lot of different layers to this cancellation by the Israeli prime 
 
 minister. I mean, first of all, to state the obvious, Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have a very tumultuous relationship. And 
 
 part of that tumultuous relationship stems from policy disagreements between the two men. And Gallant really has become viewed as somewhat of a 
 
 reliable interlocutor by the United States for engaging in these kinds of discussions.
 
So personal politics may be at play here as part of it. But it goes beyond that, of course. The Israeli Prime Minister seems to have wanted to speak 
 
 directly with President Biden himself about these Iranian strike options, rather than having his defense minister engage with the U.S. defense 
 
 secretary and then go from there.
 
But he also, we understand, wants to have a vote in the Israeli cabinet on how Israel will retaliate against Iran before Yoav Gallant, the defense 
 
 minister, travels to the United States. And part of that may also stem from the fact that, ultimately, Netanyahu doesn't want to be swayed away from 
 
 certain options. And someone like Gallant, who has a close relationship with his U.S. counterpart, could potentially come back with a very 
 
 different message than one Netanyahu might want to hear.
 
Now, it is clear, ultimately, that Israel is consulting with the United States on this. They have clearly held off on actually carrying out that 
 
 response until they can at least attempt or show that they are attempting to get on the same page as the United States.
 
But ultimately, Israeli officials telling me that, look, Israel is an independent state. They're going to make their own decisions at the end of 
 
 the day about exactly what that strike option looks like against Iran.
 
ANDERSON: OK. Well, as we await to find out, you know, what exactly is said in that call between Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu, whether the options 
 
 that are on the table for a strike on Iran, if that is the case, are discussed and what is agreed upon.
 
Let's get to Tehran. What's the view there at this point, Fred?
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Hi there, Becky. Well, essentially, the Iranians right now continue with some 
 
 pretty tough rhetoric here, especially vis-a-vis the Israelis.
 
I think one of the things that we're seeing on the streets of Tehran, we spent really a lot of time there today, is there is a good deal of concern 
 
 among some of the citizens that we've been speaking to, not necessarily about that possible response to those Iranian strikes, but really whether 
 
 or not all this could then lead to a wider, larger conflict here in the Middle East that in the end could possibly pit Iran and the United States 
 
 directly against one another.
 
What we're hearing from a lot of people, though, is that no matter what that Israeli strike entails, they do believe that their own government, 
 
 that those in power here, that their military will then eventually strike back. And that's, of course, something that we've also heard from Iranian 
 
 politicians.
 
We heard from the Iranian foreign minister (INAUDIBLE). Right now, of course, as we've been talking about, is in Riyadh to speak there to 
 
 officials from Saudi Arabia. Obviously, the Iranians are trying to drum up support for themselves and against Israel, essentially, in this current 
 
 situation.
 <br>[10:10:01]
 
I managed to speak to the head of or the spokesman for the Foreign Relations and National Security Committee of Iran's parliament, and he was 
 
 also very tough on Israel. Here's what he had to say.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBRAHIM REZAEL, IRANIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER (through translation): We will certainly respond to Israel in a most recent attack on Israel, attack its 
 
 own military sites. Naturally, there are other targets that we could hit, and we have the capability to do so. We have so many missiles that we can, 
 
 one by one, hit these targets.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Yes, OK, Fred, thank you for that. And (INAUDIBLE) with Fred in Tehran are brilliant.
 
I want to bring in Natasha. Natasha, we've been discussing, you know, where the Israelis stand, why it is that this Gallant -- Yoav Gallant meeting has 
 
 been delayed, at least his trip to Washington.
 
And what might be the body of that conversation that Joe Biden and Bibi Netanyahu will have this evening? What are your sources telling you about 
 
 what happens next?
 
NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, look, obviously officials here at the Pentagon are not exactly pleased that 
 
 Yoav Gallant's visit was canceled because it was going to be a really key opportunity for Secretary of Defense Austin to speak with Gallant about 
 
 what their plans are for that retaliation against Iran.
 
And Secretary Austin and Gallant, they do have a good relationship. I mean, as Jeremy was saying, Gallant is seen as a generally reliable interlocutor 
 
 between the U.S. and the Israelis. However, I should note that Secretary Austin has not necessarily been very happy with the Israelis and with 
 
 Gallant in recent weeks, just given the fact that they have not always given the U.S. heads up ahead of major operations.
 
For example, when it came to the pager attack, when it came to the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the heads up that the Israelis gave to 
 
 the U.S. including to Secretary Austin was -- was a matter of minutes.
 
And so, I think that this would have been an opportunity for the Secretary of Defense to potentially kind of try to patch up the relationship with 
 
 Gallant, try to reestablish some of that trust before Israel moves forward with a potential retaliation in Iran that could cause things in the region 
 
 to get even more tense, which would then, of course, in turn, have the United States potentially get involved with its own forces to try to 
 
 protect U.S. troops in the region and, of course, also defend the Israelis. Becky.
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you. Thank you very much indeed.
 
Look, we are working two stories this hour. That, of course, that we've just been discussing and this storm headed right for Florida at this point. 
 
 And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been giving an update on preparations for Hurricane Milton and this is what he had to say just a short time ago.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Generators have been deployed at shelters and to support sheltering operations. Starlink internet has been deployed across 
 
 the entire state of Florida. We have surged an additional 600 ambulances and they are currently in operation helping in the effort.
 
The state of Florida has considerable fuel reserves ahead of Milton and it's staged and they will be utilized as needed following the storm. We've 
 
 already dispatched a lot of fuel in the lead up to this, but we still have on hand 1.6 million gallons of diesel and 1.1 million gallons of gasoline. 
 
 There is no right now fuel shortage. However, demand has been extraordinarily high, and some gas stations have run out to be able to help 
 
 ameliorate that.
 
The Florida Highway Patrol has facilitated 106 long distant fuel tanker escorts with sirens, getting through traffic totaling almost a million 
 
 gallons of gasoline from ports in Tampa, Jacksonville, Everglades and Manatee, and they are continuing with the fuel escorts as we speak. I've 
 
 been in contact with the ports on the west coast of Florida. We'll see how this storm impacts those. Clearly, there's an opportunity -- there's a 
 
 chance that you could have a major impact on Port Manatee as well as on Port Tampa Bay. That could interrupt their ability to receive fuel 
 
 shipments.
 
And so, we're working on contingencies to be able to keep fuel flowing throughout the state of Florida.
 
As we saw this new storm develop, it was clear that a lot of the hardest hit areas on the west coast of Florida from Hurricane Helene had not had 
 
 major robust debris removal contracts in place or operations in place. Some of these contractors were good. Some of them were not getting the job done. 
 
 So, you had a major hazard on barrier islands in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota County.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: All right. Well, that's Governor DeSantis in Florida just moments ago, updating on the provisions and emergency response ahead of what is 
 
 this huge storm barreling towards his state.
 <br>[10:15:11]
 
Meteorologist Derek Van Dam has been tracking that for us and joins us now. Derek?
 
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on-camera): Yes, Becky, I mean, this is we're facing the second major hurricane strike in the state of Florida in 
 
 less than two weeks. You can imagine the societal and economic impacts that this will have.
 
Right now, we're getting these hourly updates from the National Hurricane Center and we'll continue to do so on the hour as we approach landfall, 
 
 which we believe will be late tonight and into early Thursday morning local. Remember, we're on the eastern standard time.
 
Hundred and fifty-five mile per hour winds. That's roughly 245 kilometers per hour for our international viewers. That makes it a powerful Category 
 
 4, even though it was a Category 5 earlier this morning. We still expect the storm surge component to be consistent with a category -- a landfalling 
 
 Category 5 hurricane.
 
And that has a lot to do with the amount of energy that this storm has unleashed on the eastern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. As well as its 
 
 trajectory, it's moving at more of a perpendicular angle, whereas Helene two weeks ago ran parallel with the coastline. So, kind of a side swipe 
 
 with the Tampa Bay, for instance, and some of those outer barrier islands.
 
So here is the latest radar. This is coming out of Tampa Bay. You can see the eye on the radar right now, and that's concerning. So that means that 
 
 time is dwindling. Remember, once we reach hurricane or rather tropical storm force winds, that's 39 mile per hour winds or greater. They start to 
 
 close down the evacuation routes, meaning the bridges that connect some of these barrier islands along the west coast of Florida. And we are nearing 
 
 that very, very close. Some of the gusts here are roughly 35 to 40 miles per hour.
 
So, we expect conditions to go downhill substantially from this afternoon. Certainly, into this evening and then overnight tonight. That's when we 
 
 expect the brunt of the storm. This will not just be a catastrophic wind event for the coast. We expect a lot of wind damage as a large swath of 
 
 hurricane force winds will spread over the central portions of the Florida peninsula.
 
There's other threats to talk about, more immediate threats. Tornadoes have been spinning up within the past coming past 15 minutes. In fact, here's 
 
 some of the latest warnings. This is coming out of Fort Lauderdale. These tornado warnings are confirmed on the ground. There's the eye of the 
 
 hurricane.
 
So, a whole host of hazards outside of the typical storm surge and flash flooding that one would associate with a hurricane. Severe threats, the 
 
 tornadoes, the strong tornado or two within that area of orange. But this storm surge cannot be understated. They have lowered the totals in Tampa 
 
 Bay, 8 to 12 feet. You know, that's actually higher than the record values that were set two weeks ago with Hurricane Helene.
 
So that's significant. They're still cleaning up the trash on the roadways. And then some of our computer models honing in on Sarasota County for 
 
 potential landfall. That's where we would get that right front quadrant. Becky, that's the most powerful part of the storm. That's where we expect 
 
 the worst surge to be at this moment in time.
 
ANDERSON: It's good to have you, sir. Thank you. And again, folks, keep an eye on CNN Digital. We will keep you up to date on exactly what is going on 
 
 in the hours to come.
 
Well, coming up here, government officials are already anticipating the cost of this hurricane. We're going to talk about how man-made global 
 
 heating is making storms like this a whole lot worse.
 
That is after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:20:35]
 
ANDERSON: Well, our top story this hour, that powerful Category 4 storm in the Gulf of Mexico barreling towards Florida. Forecasters warning that 
 
 Hurricane Milton will cause catastrophic damage.
 
I want to turn to this emotional video for a moment from veteran meteorologist John Morales, as he was monitoring that storm earlier this 
 
 week. Have a look at this.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN MORALES, METEOROLOGIST: Just an incredible, incredible, incredible hurricane. It has dropped -- it has dropped 50 millibars in 10 hours. I 
 
 apologize. This is just horrific.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: That clip went viral. He spoke to my colleague Erin Burnett about what made him so emotional.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MORALES: In the United States, the frontline communities, communities of color in the United States and all over the world in countries that have 
 
 nothing to do with the injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. OK. That are suffering the worst consequences of this. And that's where the 
 
 empathy part came in.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ANDERSON: Well, my next guest is a meteorologist for Climate Central. According to their organization, sea surface temperatures where Hurricane 
 
 Milton developed are at or above record-breaking highs. Its analysis found those temperatures were made up to 400 to 800 times more likely by climate 
 
 change over the past two weeks.
 
Well, Shel Winkley joins me now from College Station in Texas. And I think it's just important to step back at this point and walk us through one how 
 
 you came to that conclusion. And what it really means to all of us.
 
SHEL WINKLEY, METEOROLOGIST, CLIMATE CENTRAL: So, when we look at the ocean temperatures, we can use what we call attribution science. I understand the 
 
 role of heating on both land temperatures and ocean. The land temperatures vary quite a bit. You get cold fronts, you get weather systems coming 
 
 through the oceans though. Those are the natural place that the earth stores carbon, right? That carbon transfer between the atmosphere and the 
 
 ocean is a natural process. But when we put this extra carbon pollution into the atmosphere, it then gets sunk into the ocean, which heats the 
 
 ocean itself.
 
So, what we can do with this attribution science, because the ocean has a very long memory, is understand just the temperatures that we're seeing, 
 
 how far above average they are, and then how much more likely those temperatures are because of that carbon pollution that humans have put into 
 
 the atmosphere.
 
So, like you said, what we know where Milton developed over the last two weeks has been kind of the hottest climate spot in the entire Gulf of 
 
 Mexico, and it just so happened that Milton formed right on top of it. And again, that's ocean temperatures that were made 400 (INAUDIBLE) 100 times 
 
 more likely, which more simply just means that those temperatures are virtually impossible in that part of the Gulf at this time in October 
 
 without the interference of human caused climate change.
 
ANDERSON: So, what do we -- what do we do with what you've just told us? I mean, first of all, are we suggesting that these storms are just going to 
 
 get a whole load worse going forward? Already these storms we're seeing are in the sort of, you know, top tier of biggest storms ever. So, what -- 
 
 where -- what do we do with that information?
 
WINKLEY: Sure. Great question. So really, what we know again, we're attributing the ocean temperatures, the sea surface temperatures 
 
 specifically. So, every storm is different. There are different things that are happening in the atmosphere to impact storms are like Milton to not 
 
 hinder it at all. But what we know is that the fuel that is powering these systems is excessive. It's above what is normal. It's kind of like a 
 
 baseball player on steroids, if you will.
 
So, when we look at this hurricane season and really hurricane seasons have passed, not every storm is going to be exactly like what we saw with Milton 
 
 or with Helene. But we know that these storms are getting more intense, they're becoming more frequent, and they're also getting wetter because 
 
 along with the warmer oceans, it's not only feeding the storm in terms of the strength. But it's allowing more of that rain making moisture in the 
 
 atmosphere to produce more rainfall as well.
 <br>[10:25:04]
 
So, what do we do with it? We have to understand that this is a reality that can continue in hurricane seasons to come until we start drawing down 
 
 that carbon pollution. And so, for, unfortunately, the places in Florida that are having to start again and rebuild, or as we look at our 
 
 communities for seasons in the future, these are the type of storms that we need to prepare for, that we need to build for, and that we need to 
 
 understand. What can come with them as they do make their way to the coast and like with Helene, even further inland.
 
ANDERSON: We've just been listening to one veteran meteorologist talking about the impact on communities in these coastal towns, oftentimes some of 
 
 the poorest communities, and we are seeing that, for example, around the world, who frankly, you know, have not done much to cause Climate change, 
 
 but are, you know, in the eye of the storm as it were. What -- what do we do to protect these communities going forward?
 
WINKLEY: What we have to look at the resilience of our communities. We have to figure out how we can mitigate some of these risks. You know, a lot of 
 
 attention's been put on Tampa and the hospital and that aqua wall that they have.
 
So, what can we do? You know, water's a very hard thing to control. We've tried many times over history and water typically always wins, but we know 
 
 that there are at least some things that we can do in either to try to protect our communities or do a better job of getting those that maybe 
 
 don't have the means to get away from these hazards from the storm search, from the hurricane, making sure that we can get them away.
 
You know, our most vulnerable communities also have an equal chance to evacuate if they don't have the means to at the time.
 
ANDERSON: Shel, it's good to have you. Really important stuff. Thank you very much indeed for breaking down, which is oftentimes, you know, pretty 
 
 comprehensive and -- and -- and sometimes, you know, confusing information.
 
It's really good to have your, your insight today. Thank you.
 
WINKLEY: Appreciate it.
 
ANDERSON: And with that context, I want to turn now to our big number of the day, $1 billion. That is the minimum of how much this disaster is 
 
 expected to cost, according to the government officials.
 
And unfortunately, in this new normal, it's joining a long list. The United States has already faced more than $20 billion worth of disasters this year 
 
 alone, and it underscores the cost of not moving fast enough, as we've just been discussing, to combat climate change.
 
One report found that the climate fueled damages will cost the world $38 trillion by 2049. That is six times the amount that it would take to fund 
 
 the mitigation efforts needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement. That of course wouldn't stop every storm. But as we are seeing play out before our 
 
 very eyes, it could go a long way to protecting vulnerable communities. Not just on that coastline, of course, in Florida, but around the world and 
 
 keeping this crisis from becoming even worse in the years to come.
 
You're watching "Connect the World." I'm Becky Anderson for you.
 
The escalating conflict in Lebanon has driven tens of thousands of refugees into neighboring Syria. My next guest just met with some of those 
 
 displaced. I want to ask him more about what he learned about their plight.
 
Up next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[10:31:02]
 
ANDERSON: Well, I'm Becky Anderson for you. Half past six here in the UAE.
 
The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of three hospitals in northern Gaza, including the only fully functioning medical facility in the 
 
 region. Palestinian healthcare workers say there is no safe way for patients to leave and nowhere to go.
 
Well, doctors without borders says parts of northern Gaza are turning into, a quote, unlivable wasteland as a result of the war. And now Israel's Prime 
 
 Minister is warning Lebanon could become another Gaza. And I quote him here, in a direct statement to the Lebanese people on Tuesday, Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu urged them to stand up to Hezbollah and take back their country before it, quote, falls into the abyss of a war.
 
Well, as the conflict intensifies, the UN says a quarter of a million refugees have fled Lebanon for neighboring Syria. Our next guest has just 
 
 returned from a three-day trip to both countries, meeting with those displaced by this bombardment. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says 
 
 families he spoke with there had run for their lives and have no idea what tomorrow may bring.
 
And Filippo Grandi joins us now live. It's good to have you. It's always good to have you. Thank you for coming to us immediately off the back of 
 
 this trip.
 
Tell us what you saw and what people are going through. What did they tell you?
 
FILIPPO GRANDI, UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES: Of course, you have a massive, really massive situation of displacement inside Lebanon. The Prime 
 
 Minister speaks of 1.2 million. You know, that's a small country. That means that a fourth of the country is displaced, mostly from the zones, 
 
 from the areas that are impacted by the Israeli airstrikes. And then, like you said, about a quarter of a million, probably more by now, people, both 
 
 Lebanese and Syrian refugees who used to be in Lebanon, crossing the border into Syria to seek refuge there.
 
So, people -- many of them are people that fled Syria because of the war in Syria and now are fleeing back from Lebanon to flee the war in Lebanon. 
 
 That's the paradox. That's the terrible, sad, tragic irony of this situation.
 
ANDERSON: Did you see this coming?
 
GRANDI: Of course, we have been worried. About an expansion of the conflict beyond Gaz for a long time and we've said many times we the humanitarians 
 
 have said many times, you know, we're stretched to capacity all around the world, including in the Middle East. We won't be able to -- to respond to 
 
 many more crisis and then it's happened.
 
And what you quote, you know, the -- the quote you made of the Israeli Prime Minister saying this could be a long war where is -- where is us a 
 
 lot because Lebanon is already on its knees because of its economic, social, political situation. It's a country that is really at the end of 
 
 what it can take from the human point of view, and it's very, very worrying that this war may last longer.
 
ANDERSON: And the UN has confirmed this week that airstrikes and ground incursions by the IDF targeted multiple areas across what is known as the 
 
 Blue Line. Israeli officials today talking about occupying a village or town in in southern Lebanon. This is pretty ominous stuff at this point. 
 
 What -- what, where do you see this going?
 
GRANDI: You see, this generates two problems. One is that there will be more displacement. There's a thousand schools in Lebanon, a thousand 
 
 schools that are already full of displaced people. Basically, the school year has ground to a halt because of this. But just to give you a sense of 
 
 the size of what's happening.
 <br>[10:35:06]
 
And then in those areas that are more heavily bombarded, like southern Lebanon that you mentioned, but also the southern suburbs of Beirut, the 
 
 Beqaa Valley at the border with Syria. It's in the areas that are under heavy bombardment, we cannot go and bring help to the people that cannot 
 
 even flee.
 
So, you have also that aspect of the crisis, people trapped, a bit like in Gaza, in areas where human -- even humanitarian relief cannot reach.
 
ANDERSON: You've been in the UN system for decades. You and I have talked about your frustration over the years, that things seem to get worse, not 
 
 better, despite the good work that agencies like yours put in. Things are spiraling at this point.
 
Realistically, what can be done to stop this current crisis, when Israel has the unconditional support of the most powerful country in the world 
 
 behind it?
 
GRANDI: Becky, we've discussed this many times, and unfortunately, I have always the same answer, which is you don't stop war with a divided 
 
 political spectrum. You know what I mean? Security Council can hardly agree on resolutions on humanitarian assistance. Imagine doing its job, which is 
 
 to stop conflict. They're unable to do it by now.
 
So, if we don't have that backing of political instances, we, the humanitarians are thrown in time after time trying to fix the pieces. And 
 
 never mind, we will do our job. We'll stretch our -- our capacity. We will continue to ask for funding, and that's become also very difficult because 
 
 there's so many crises. But what is really tragic and painful is that more and more people are affected.
 
What I saw, even in these last few days, sorry to be a bit emotional about this, but what I saw in Lebanon, what I saw those people, old people, women 
 
 with children, carrying their heavy luggage across the border from Lebanon into another very fragile country, Syria, because even the road between the 
 
 two countries has been bombed out by an Israeli airstrike, so they can't even flee easily because that's made difficult.
 
You know, what do you say about that?
 
ANDERSON: Well, the UN Secretary General has said, and I quote him here just hours ago, we will not give up on calls for an immediate ceasefire in 
 
 Gaza or in Lebanon, he says. But frankly, I mean, these calls are landing on deaf ears, not least the years, it seems at this point of the United 
 
 States.
 
You spoke, as I understand it, to the Lebanese Prime Minister, who is the leader of the Lebanese caretaker government, of course. There is, you know, 
 
 the international community stepping up we know that, but by no means is this enough. And there is no political stability, it seems, in Lebanon to 
 
 cope at the moment. What did he tell you? What was his appeal to you? What did you discuss with him?
 
GRANDI: Well, you understand back in most of the conversation was how do we organize the response? Because at the moment, you know, people need 
 
 shelter, need water, need food, need everything. So, a lot of the conversation with Prime Minister Mikati, with his government was about 
 
 that. They're trying their best, frankly, to organize themselves, but it's very difficult.
 
And, by the way, we do need those resources. We issued an appeal in Lebanon. We issued another appeal in Syria. And we desperately need from 
 
 all donors, including Gulf donors, we need more resources. But what Prime Minister Mikati and others are saying is also very important. Cease fires 
 
 first. We all agree. But then you need those political processes that allow the ceasefires to be durable, because otherwise the ceasefire lasts for 
 
 some time and then they break down again.
 
So, in Lebanon, for example, there is a Security Council Resolution 7, it's called 1701, that stipulates or, you know, indicates a system to -- to 
 
 oversee the situation at the border. That has to be also put in place. That's what my political colleagues are in the UN are negotiating. That's 
 
 not my job, but it's very important that ceasefire is followed by a political agreement.
 
In Gaza, it's even more complicated because that political agreement can only be the two state, two state solution that seems to be so far away now. 
 
 But without those political agreements, ceasefires will last less and less in a -- 
 <br>[10:40:05]
 
ANDERSON: Right.
 
GRANDI: -- in a -- in a -- in a region like the Middle East.
 
ANDERSON: Well, we know that there, there is help coming. I mean, not least from the Middle East. I know we've seen Qatar and France getting together 
 
 to -- to organize relief, the UAE four days ago, I think with a $100 million worth of aid promise and -- and around the region.
 
But as you say, it's not enough. We need more. You need more as an agency. It's good to have you on. Thank you for your work. We'll stick with you and 
 
 we'll have you back on. Thank you. Keep us updated.
 
We'll be right back.

ELENI GIOKOS, CNN HOST (voice-over): From smart cities to innovative strategies. This month we'll take a closer look at how the region's fastest 
 
 growing economy is betting big on AI.
 
GIOKOS: Welcome to "Marketplace Middle East." I'm Eleni Giokos here at the third edition of the Global AI Summit in Saudi Arabia. From government 
 
 officials to industry leaders, tens of thousands of people have converged here in Riyadh to discuss how this game changing technology is shaping the 
 
 future of business and driving innovation.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): From large language models to automated logistics and beyond, the region's tech revolution seems to be impacting every sector. 
 
 And here in Saudi Arabia, the shift is clear.
 
With the country's biggest revenue driver, oil giant Aramco, making big strides in its own digital transformation. Last year, the company announced 
 
 a $1.9 billion investment in digital technologies over the course of three years. And according to the CEO of Aramco's digital division, the company's 
 
 amplified focus on innovation could be key to unlocking even more profitable opportunities. 
 
TAREQ AMIN, CEO, ARAMCO DIGITAL: Aramco is the largest integrated energy company, 90 years of history. One would not imagine the amount of 
 
 artificial intelligence and products that the company has deployed to improve efficiency, drive sustainability. It is very, very impressive. It 
 
 improves productivity and it really addresses a lot of the sustainability goals that the company has.
 
GIOKOS: I want to talk about investment into Aramco Digital and how much Aramco is willing to spend on what you're doing.
 
AMIN: It's not little money.
 
GIOKOS: Yes.
 
AMIN: This is extremely critical to Aramco not only because it's a diversification strategy. Our business have very well recognized the 
 
 importance of digital platforms to its future and its targets. So, we are really well funded across six categories. Connectivity, cloud, data and AI, 
 
 sustainability.
 
GIOKOS: Is Aramco on par with other energy companies globally on digitalization? Or would you say it needs to catch up?
 
AMIN: You always hear a traditional energy company spinning off a digital business like let's say Aramco Digital. This will not work because of 
 
 culture and processes that will hinder this digital company to achieve its objective.
 
I'm really, really happy to see how this progressed and the commitment the company has shown to Aramco Digital is just remarkable.
 
GIOKOS: While Aramco's revenues make up about half of Saudi Arabia's economy, it seems that the kingdom is also keeping a close eye on its 
 
 international players that could help expand its digital footprint even further.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Back in March, the New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has been in talks with venture capital 
 
 giants Andreessen Horowitz to launch a $40 billion AI fund that would fuel innovation in Saudi Arabia and transform its post oil economy.
 
PWC estimates that at the international level, AI could boost the global economy by $15.7 trillion by 2030. That's more than China and India's 
 
 current output combined. And here in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom is putting AI at the heart of its post oil strategy, aiming for massive gains. By 
 
 2030, this innovative technology could add over $135 billion to the kingdom's economy. That's equivalent to about 12.4 percent of its GDP.
 
ABDULLAH SULAIMAN ALKHODAIRI, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, SDAIA: So, if you look at Vision 2030 and its pillars, we have seen and we've analyzed how AI 
 
 can contribute to these -- to these pillars, and especially as the technology evolves. And as data and AI becomes, you know, more and more 
 
 part of all of our daily lives we are, you know, the -- the -- the percentage of objectives or vision programs that AI contribute to keeps 
 
 increasing.
 <br>[10:50:09]
 
So -- so in fact, AI and data are becoming, you know, I -- I would say a very core ingredient and a core component and enabler to achieve Vision 
 
 2030.
 
GIOKOS: So, with massive investments flowing into tech and AI, experts believe that the region is poised to become a global AI hub, shifting its 
 
 focus away from traditional energy sectors.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): But looking at the bigger picture, investing in AI and other cutting-edge tech could also help drive sustainable economic growth, 
 
 according to the Secretary General of the Digital Corporation Organization.
 
GIOKOS: So how is AI going to influence, impact the region for sustainability, inclusivity, you know, what kind of trends are you 
 
 foreseeing for the region itself?
 
DEEMA ALYAHYA, SECRETARY GENERAL, DIGITAL COOPERATION ORGANISATION: Well, we see that what would really help in terms of the looking at the 
 
 infrastructure perspective, providing the right opportunities for youth and innovators to be producers to such kind of technology rather than 
 
 consumers. But there's a very big factor as well, which is that cross border.
 
If we don't have improbability in terms of data sharing and in terms of having standardization when it comes to policies and regulations, then it 
 
 will be a challenge to really foster and harness that 2 percent of that growth of Gen AI.
 
GIOKOS: So, in terms of the opportunities that Gen AI can unlock for the Middle East, what are you most excited about?
 
ALYAHYA: Well, what I'm really excited about is seeing the region being more a producer to these emerging technologies more than consumers for the 
 
 technology. We are -- if I'm going to talk about GCO, we are 800 million in population, 75 percent of them are youth under the age of 30. Very tech 
 
 savvy.
 
So, this gives a great opportunity for new applications, either in logistics or even in healthcare. And this is what really excites, which is 
 
 the opportunity to innovate and create local, local content.

GIOKOS: Welcome back to "Marketplace Middle East."
 
This region has long been known for oil and luxury, but it's rapidly evolving as cities from Riyadh to Dubai are heavily focused on diversifying 
 
 revenue streams and here in Abu Dhabi trade and logistics are key to that strategy and Khalifa Port is playing a big role in driving the capital's 
 
 future.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): It's one of the fastest growing ports in the world. Connecting major trade routes across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not only has 
 
 it become a critical link in global supply chains, it's also at the center of Abu Dhabi's ambitious vision to become an internationally recognized hub 
 
 for trade and logistics.
 
And according to the CEO of Economic Cities and Free Zones at Abu Dhabi Ports Group, it all plays a key role in the Emirates bigger plan to 
 
 diversify its economy and drive future growth.
 
GIOKOS: Where are you right now and why do you foresee this growth?
 
ABDULLAH AL HAMELI, CEO, ECONOMIC CITIES &amp; FREE ZONES CLUSTER AD PORTS: The port is growing in its operation and the number of containers are growing. 
 
 The strategy started by attracting big players into Khalifa Port. We don't operate container terminal. We oversee these terminals where we allow 
 
 foreign investors to come and invest in these terminals.
 <br>[10:55:05]
 
We started with the MSC and then it expanded to Costco. It's completely different than what you're seeing in the -- in this region. So, we've 
 
 introduced something new into our Abu Dhabi, into United Arab Emirates mainly to contribute to the economy of the United Arab Emirates.
 
GIOKOS: So, here's a number according to Oxford Economics that 80 ports groups activities across various sectors contributes 23 percent to the 
 
 Emirates non-oil-based GDP.
 
AL HAMELI: That's true.
 
GIOKOS: That's substantial.
 
AL HAMELI: It is.
 
GIOKOS: That's 23 percent of GDP.
 
AL HAMELI: It is substantial and it will be growing inshallah for what we are doing towards the you know, the industry and the economy in general.
 
Our leadership, you know, we have great support and special attention to the diversification of the economy.
 
GIOKOS: So, let me ask you this, what is the most profitable part of your business?
 
AL HAMELI: Our biggest, you know, cluster contributing to our revenue is the maritime and shipping. And again, it takes us back to, you know, us 
 
 deciding to own ships. We're now, you know, it is one of the biggest contributors to AD Ports Group.
 
GIOKOS: But there's more to the story here than just shipping. What's equally interesting is how this industrial powerhouse is linked to the 
 
 Emirates growing cruise tourism sector.
 
GIOKOS (voice-over): Abu Dhabi Ports Group operates two cruise terminals here in the UAE, including the award-winning Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal, 
 
 which welcomed more than half a million passengers just last year.
 
And now it seems the company is focused on a broader vision, which is to create infrastructure that could help boost both industry and tourism, 
 
 turning Abu Dhabi into a hotspot for trade and leisure. Experts consider both of these sectors as crucial for driving the Emirates economic 
 
 diversification strategy forward.
 
So as the UAE targets big moves in its post oil era, the group's wider impact on the capital's economy is expected to continue growing towards new 
 
 heights.
 
ANDRE MARTINS, HEAD OF TRANSPORTATION, OLIVER WYMAN TRANSPORTATION: Logistics and transportation sector is the backbone of an economy and 
 
 therefore as part of any diversification agenda and the needs to enable other sectors to grow and to continue the diversification of the economy 
 
 across the country and Abu Dhabi Emirates.
 
Logistics is extremely important and the vital sector to allow and to foster that growth to happen. It will help to connect the different parts 
 
 off the Abu Dhabi ecosystem. It will help to connect Abu Dhabi and UAE to the rest of the region and to the rest of the world. The more connectivity 
 
 that exists, ultimately, the more trade will happen throughout the region and throughout UAE.
 
GIOKOS: Thanks so much for joining us for this edition of "Marketplace Middle East." If you'd like to take a look at other stories we cover on the 
 
 program, you can visit cnn.com/marketplacemiddleeast.
 
From me, Eleni Giokos in Abu Dhabi. I'll see you next time.
