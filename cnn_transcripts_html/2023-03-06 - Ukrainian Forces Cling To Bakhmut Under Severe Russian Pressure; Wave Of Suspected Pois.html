LAILA HARRAK, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to all of our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Laila Harrak. Ahead on CNN Newsroom. Streets by streets, block by block Ukrainian forces fighting to hold control of the eastern city of Bakhmut, even as Russian troops seem to be closing in.
 
Fears rising in Iran amid reports that hundreds of school girls have been poisoned. And Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis deepens millions stuck in the grip of extreme poverty, relying on aid just to survive.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN Newsroom with Laila Harrak.
 
HARRAK: We begin in Ukraine where one commander says the situation on the Eastern Front Lines and around the city of Bakhmut is quote, very much like help. Ukrainian forces still holding on to a key highway in Bakhmut amid a fierce battle as officials dismissed speculation of a possible Ukrainian withdrawal.
 
One soldier describes a difficult situation inside the city where Russia's assault continues to cause destruction and losses for Ukraine. Despite that evacuation efforts press on as some civilians describe living in a war zone.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We are not fearless. We are also afraid. We are living people. We also want to live and I want it all to end faster. They must agree or this issue must be resolved somehow. It's just unbearable.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: To the West in Zaporizhzhia, the city has declared Monday a day of morning after 13 people were killed when a missile slammed into a high rise building late last week. CNN's Melissa Bell has more now on the battle fallback mode.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): What had felt for several days like the inevitable Russian advance onto the center of Bakhmut appears to have slowed. That's according to Ukrainian military commanders who claim that they are still holding one of the main highways in and out of Bakhmut and therefore able to protect those crucial supply lines to the Ukrainian defenders still doing all they can to hold a town that has been in the center of a siege now, for seven months.
 
We've been speaking to the deputy mayor of the town who says that the heavy artillery fire and mortar fire has only gotten worse with Russian forces really throwing everything they have at Bakhmut, explaining also that it is only about five to 10 civilians that they're managing to evacuate right now compared to six to 500 at the height of the evacuations at the end of February.
 
It is four and a half thousand civilians of course still trapped inside that town, and yet, according to Ukrainian commanders, a possibility that they have managed to hold the center and will continue to do so. One commander describing the scenes as hell and saying one day feels like an eternity. But it is necessary to hold on for every day that we can.
 
Melissa Bell, CNN, Kyiv.

HARRAK: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says any negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will only happen when Russian President Vladimir Putin understands he won't win. In an exclusive interview with CNN Fareed Zakaria, Scholz also spoke about possible peace plans to end the conflict, postwar security guarantees for Ukraine and its candidacy for the European Union.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: It was the idea of Russia that they would make the will conquer the whole country in a very short time, and they did not succeed. They had to regroup the troops back from Kyiv, where they started their invasion. Now they are doing this very ugly, aggressive war in the east of Ukraine.
 
And Russia never expected the strength of Ukraine of the people, the braveness how they defend their country. And he never expected that they are what he is not accepting a nation and all together.
 
And on the other hand, he misjudged the unity of Europe, of the United States, and all the friends of Ukraine and the permanent supply of weapons we give to the Ukraine, and so they were able to defend their country and they will be able to do it in the future.
 
It is very difficult to judge what will be the next things to happen in Ukraine but there is something which is absolutely clear, we will continue to support Ukraine with financial humanitarian aid with weapons.
 <br>[01:05:10]
 
FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: But if this continues of four years, Ukraine as a country will be destroyed, its economy is already down 40, 50 percent depending on what estimate you look at, is there a point at which you have to start negotiations? And is there a deal to be had where, you know, Ukraine get some kind of security guarantees from NATO, perhaps EU membership, and in return, it accepts the reality that it is not getting Crimea back, it is perhaps not getting some parts of the Donbas back.
 
SCHOLZ: There will be no decisions without the Ukrainians. We will not take decisions instead of them and we support them.
 
ZAKARIA: But should they -- would you encourage them to take these --
 
SCHOLZ: So we told them that they can go for membership in the European Union. And they are very -- they're working to make progress and all the criteria that are important for this. I think they know that we believe that we are ready to organize a certain way of security guarantee for the country in terms of peace to come that we are not there yet.
 
And to my view, it is necessary that Putin understands that he will not succeed with his invasion and his imperialistic aggression, and that he has to withdraw troops. This is the basis for talks. And if you look at the proposals of the Ukrainians, your -- it's easy to understand they're ready for peace, but there must be something done. And this has to be done by Putin.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: And that was German Chancellor Olaf Scholz speaking exclusively with CNN's Fareed Zakaria.
 
Well, as the war grinds on, we are seeing more signs of anti-war sentiment within Russia, even as Moscow continues to crack down on resistance. That was evident late last month when dozens of Russians were reportedly arrested for commemorating the one year anniversary of the invasion. Some were detained simply for placing flowers at monuments to prominent Ukrainians.
 
According to the human rights group OBD Info, Russian police arrested more than 4,300 people last year during nationwide protests against the invasion.
 
Well, joining me now is Jill Dougherty. She is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, a CNN contributor and a former CNN Moscow bureau chief. A very good day, Jill, so good to see you.
 
Talk to us about these makeshift memorials of Ukrainian victims of Russia's war. What is the danger of protesting and Russia's current repressive context?
 
JILL DOUGHERTY, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Well right now as we all know, it's extremely difficult for anyone to go on to the streets and even attempt to protest because they will be arrested. They will be fined or something will happen to them. So very few people really at this point will go on to the streets.
 
But there have been these scattered. They're usually small demonstrations. And they're really kind of I would say, a very traditional Russian way of protesting or showing the emotions, people coming up with flowers, and leaving flowers at significant places. And two of them that are located in Moscow. I actually know very well, because I used to live by both of them, and their statues to two poets, Ukrainian poets.
 
And so Russian people are coming out putting flowers, sometimes they put little stuffed animals at these memorials, at the statues. And it's a way I think of protesting the war, no question, but also trying to somehow, you know, make up for the damage and the death that the Russian troops have caused in Ukraine. So they have flowers.
 
And significantly, I was looking at pictures of those flowers. Red is very traditional color for, you know, the sign of patriotism and strong feelings. And then also you see yellow flowers, which is aggressive, Ukrainian, yellow and blue flag.
 
HARRAK: Jill, what does this all signal to you? I mean, how's the reality of Russia's war in Ukraine begun to set in? I mean, can these small but very symbolic events that you just told us about turn into something bigger? I mean, what's the likelihood of Russians actually, who are opposing the war that they organize mobilize stage public protests, and are there other examples of civil disobedience?
 
DOUGHERTY: I would have to say at this point, probably not. There are no indications that any mass movement is starting.
 <br>[01:10:03]
 
And if you look at the polling and the indications, you know, in the media, you do have to say we can't say precisely what percentage but the majority of Russians do seem to support this. And you have to ask yourself why? Well, we've been saying 24 hour propaganda, saying that this war is justified.
 
But also there's some deeper things that, you know, analyst experts and sociologists are looking at, which is some Russian people don't like this war, they wish it were not happening, but they're not going to demonstrate because they feel the danger actually is to them, to the Russians, because they're told by propaganda that Ukraine is going to attack them, that NATO is going to attack them. So you can see, you know, some of the effect of that propaganda.
 
HARRAK: In terms of activism, I'm hoping that you can just touch briefly on the fact obviously, Alexei Navalny is currently serving a nine-year jail term at a maximum security prison. What about his network of supporters? Are they still active in Russia?
 
DOUGHERTY: In Russia, it's very difficult. His staff are mainly outside of the country. There are probably people who support him. But again, any type of dissent, any type of, you know, going on to the streets activity, which we used to see quite a lot I was at many of those protests, they're never going to happen right now under these conditions. That doesn't mean that people don't, you know, privately support this. But at this point is I would say, there's very little chance you're going to get any type of big demonstrations.
 
HARRAK: I want to get your take on an interesting development. Obviously, all eyes are on Bakhmut were fierce fighting is raging, and in the midst of what's being described as the longest and deadliest battle in this war, Russia's defense minister made a rare visit to frontline troops. So what does that tell you?
 
DOUGHERTY: Well, I think it tells me that he felt what was more for political reasons, symbolic reasons, than any military reasons that he had to get out there onto the field, and really show that he's -- he cares that he's concerned, and that, you know, he's supporting the troops.
 
You've had a lot of give and take and a lot of criticism coming up from various groups. One of them would be the Wagner group, those private military contractors who have been criticizing the Defense Ministry for not providing weapons et cetera. So I think Shoigu felt under pressure to go out and really kind of show the flag and show his concern.
 
HARRAK: Jill Dougherty, thank you so very much. Always great getting your take. Thank you.
 
DOUGHERTY: Thank you.
 
HARRAK: And Pakistan, former Prime Minister Imran Khan's speeches are being banned on satellite TV channels. Regulators said on Sunday, Khan's speeches are spreading hate speech against state institutions. This the same day that authorities tried and failed to arrest Khan in Lahore. An arrest warrant says he should be taken into custody after not showing up for court.
 
The Pakistani Human Rights Commission has denounced a satellite ban and a spokesperson for Khan's party says the dozens of court cases against the former Prime Minister are a mockery of justice. They also called the current government fascist.
 
U.S. President Joe Biden called for new voting rights protections at an events marking the 58th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama. On that day, in 1965, state troopers attacked hundreds of civil rights marchers attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Dozens were injured and 17 people had to be hospitalized, and including the late Congressman John Lewis.
 
In his remarks, President Biden called for passage of a sweeping voting rights measure, named after Lewis arguing it's the right to vote that makes democracy possible.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Selma is a reckoning the right to vote, the right to vote to have your vote counted as the threshold of democracy and liberty. With it, anything's possible without it. Without that right, nothing is possible. And this fundamental right remains under assault. Conservative Supreme Court has gutted the Voting Rights Act over the years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Mr. Biden also took part in the annual walk across the bridge, but it's not the first time he's attended anniversary events in Selma. As the candidates he spoke at a historic church there in 2020.

Still to come, authorities attain a train station manager accused in last week's deadly head on collision in Greece as demonstrators angered by the tragedy, again clash with police. Plus, parents in Iran demand answers amid a wave of suspected poisonings of school girls. We'll have a detailed report ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: The station manager involved in Greece's deadly train collision is now in police custody. The 59-year-old was detained after Sunday's court appearance on charges connected to last week's head on crash between a passenger train and a freight train. At least 57 people were killed.
 
Well, it came as police once again clashed with protesters. This time outside the parliament building in Athens. They use tear gas on demonstrators angry over the collision and the country's poor railway safety record.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VASSILIKI SVARNA, RAILWAY WORKER (through translator): We feel unspeakable grief over the incident. It's tragic. We cannot sue the pain of the families who lost their kids nor can we bring them back. But we are here so that nothing remains in the darkness for everything to be revealed to the bone for those responsible to pay. Those who have left the railway to its fate. All the government's all these years.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARRAK: Thousands took part in Sunday's protests the crash is believed to have happened because one of the train drivers received instructions to ignore a red light.
 
In the U.S. state of Ohio Clark County officials say there were very minor amounts of residual material found in four cars of the freight train that derailed in the city of Springfield on Saturday.
 
However, an Ohio Environmental Protection Agency official says there was no release of any hazardous materials in the air, soil or water. It was the second train derailment Norfolk Southern experienced in Ohio and little over a month after the toxic crash in East Palestine. CNN's Polo Sandoval has the latest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, the general manager of Norfolk Southern the owner and operator of the train involved in Saturday's derailment saying that there were hazardous materials that were being transported on this train including ethanol and propane, but they were not on the train cars that actually left the tracks on Saturday, a total of 20 out of the 212 train cars actually left the tracks as this train was headed from northern Ohio down to Birmingham Alabama.
 
Authorities really shifted a lot of their focus on for tanker train cars. Two of them were Hollywood's been described as diesel exhaust fluid while the other two are hauling water soluble solution that's often used to treat wastewater, common industrial solutions as they described them.
 <br>[01:20:03]
 
However, authorities saying that those train cars did not experience any sort of spillage. So the head of the EPA and the state of Ohio said that there was no chemical release into the air, into the water, into the soil. So now a lot of the focus will certainly be on a massive cleanup process that is underway there in Springfield, Ohio, and also on the investigation as he tried to find out exactly what led to this derailment just a little over a month after the toxic tragedy that took place in his palace to Ohio with the same rail company in the same state.
 
However, at this point, the investigation certainly nothing to lead investigators to believe that they could potentially be linked but certainly a reminder that these kinds of derailments are happening according to the Federal Railroad Administration, roughly 1,000 derailments happening in the U.S. per year. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.

HARRAK: One month since a deadly earthquake rocked parts of Turkey and Syria recovery has been slow, but it's ongoing. Officials say the disaster has killed more than 51,000 people in both countries. One aid group has described the damage as extraordinary. More than 5,700 buildings destroyed in Turkey alone, with police carrying out dozens of arrests over alleged shoddy construction.
 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised new homes for those who have been displaced. He's up for reelection this year. And in the coming hours the opposition is expected to reveal his challenger in the race.
 
In Iran worried parents have held protests over a wave of suspected poison attacks, affecting hundreds of school girls. The unexplained illnesses have so far impacted more than 30 schools and at least 10 provinces. Some Iranian leaders have suggested the girls could have been targeted by hardline Islamist groups opposed to their education. CNN's Nima Elbagir spoke to some of those who were sickened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Desperation and chaos gripping Iranian cities for months. Terrified parents watch helplessly as their children fall prey to mysterious ailments. CNN communicated with witnesses and survivors of some of these incidents at mostly girls schools across the country.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It was a terrible situation. Girls had been falling on the floor and were crying. Some were unable to walk, really didn't want to leave one another. They wouldn't let us go home they forced us to stay inside.
 
It was a bitter smell. There was a smell outside too. Then I felt sick.
 
ELBAGIR: Many of the students who spoke to CNN reported smelling noxious odors. This as Iranian authorities explanation has been shifting, but state media is now referring to the incidents as poisonings.
 
Some parents worry these are targeted attacks on girls meant to prevent them from attending school. Many of the attacks have been in the religious heartland of Iran. Yet the Minister of Education has said that most of the cases were caused by rumor and there is no problem.
 
The reported poisonings began a month and a half after process erupted across Iran led by women demonstrating against the country's repressive conduct and clothing laws. CNN cross reference local media reporting with testimony from victims and eyewitnesses to tally the number of incidents. State media have reported incidents at nearly 60 schools since late November.
 
CNN has spoken with eyewitnesses in dozens of these cases. In one school in the regime heartland of Qom, at least three incidents were reported to CNN, the latest this week. And incidents continue to be reported into this week in the towns of Isfahan and Ardabil. Where medical sources tell us a student was admitted to the ICU suffering seizures after the latest incident. One of dozens who have been hospitalized another family joining the hundreds desperate for answers. Nima Elbagir, CNN, London.

HARRAK: As millions of Afghans endure a brutal and deadly winter humanitarian groups are urging the Taliban government to do more to help well when you sum the heartbreaking stories of loss just ahead.
 
Plus, the daughter of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny speaks out on his detention, as well as the war in Ukraine. We'll have more on that and a look back in Navalny story. Stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[01:26:58]
 
HARRAK: Welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak and you're watching CNN Newsroom.
 
It's been a deadly winter in Afghanistan the coldest in more than a decade according to the UN refugee agency, but the country's humanitarian problems won't disappear when spring arrives in a few weeks. Extreme poverty and hunger have only been made worse by Taliban policies limiting the assistance aid agencies can provide.
 
CNN's Anna Coren joins me now from Hong Kong with more. Anna, Afghanistan facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The Afghans, of course, have endured so much hardship and now this cutback in international aid.
 
ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's been absolutely devastating as you can imagine. Afghanistan may have fallen from the news headlines but the needs of its 40 million people are greater now than they have ever been.
 
As you say, Laila, they have endured the most brutal winter in 15 years in which countless Afghans have died. But the situation is not going to improve as the weather warms up with just a fraction of humanitarian aid reaching those whose lives depend upon it.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN (voiceover): Fresh snow blankets the hilltops of Ghor Province in central Afghanistan, creating the illusion of a winter wonderland. But for those who live here, there is no wonder let alone glimmer of hope. Simply staying alive is a daily struggle.
 
For this family, their young son lost that battle. Now they huddled around his hillside grave, offering prayers to six year old Wahid who just days ago froze to death.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I miss my brother and that is why I came to visit him at the graveyard, she says.
 
Abdul Zahir (ph) moved his family to the township of furrows in Ghor, looking for work as a laborer. Taliban controlled Afghanistan he wasn't able to make ends meet.
 
I had nothing to burn to keep the house warm, he explains. I checked on the children during the night and their bodies were numb. I realized my son had died of frostbite.
 
COREN: This is a photo of him last year, he says, and this is his dead body.
 
And unprecedentedly brutal winter has claimed countless Afghan lives this year, but so too has extreme poverty. This has been exacerbated by the repercussions of the Taliban government's dystopian gender policies. And the response by the international community.
 
Almost a year ago, the Taliban banned female secondary students from attending school that has morphed into a nationwide ban on all female education. But it was the Taliban decision in December banning women from working for non-governmental organizations that force humanitarian aid groups who abruptly halt or suspend operations.
 <br>[01:30:00] 
 
JAN EGELAND, SECRETARY GENERAL, NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL: There is 28 million Afghans in desperate need at the moment -- 28 million. And we're not even reaching a fraction of those. 
 
COREN: The Norwegian Refugee Council says they normally help 700,000 Afghans each year. But their operation has been drastically pared back. Its secretary general recently traveled to Kabul, pleading with the Taliban to allow female aid workers to return to work. 
 
EGELAND: It is at its worst hour. It's never been as bad as it is now. 
 
COREN: 35-year-old Sapuro (ph) wipes away her tears as she grieves for her husband who perished from the cold also in Ghor Province -- father and breadwinner for their eight children, the youngest just two. 
 
Now, she's wondering how to keep her family alive. 
 
COREN: "I have no education," she says. "My children need food, what should I do? Three of her children are girls, including 12-year-old Mamlika (ph) who knows all too well what happens to poor young Afghan girls who reach puberty. 
 
"I am worried that if we don't have food, my brothers will be forced to sell or marry me under pressure," she says. I don't want to get married. I'm a kid. I don't want a husband. 
 
U.S. charity Too Young To Wed says it's been able to provide emergency aid to the family and many others. But founder, Stephanie Sinclair, says the avalanche of need is overwhelming and they're unable to help everyone. 
 
STEPHANIE SINCLAIR, FOUNDER, TOO YOUNG TO WED: To me, it's unconscionable that the international community is not paying more attention to what's happening to women and girls in Afghanistan. It is simply just inexcusable that we are not doing everything in our power to try to change the course of what's happening there. We have to do better. 
 
COREN: And with the U.N. predicting two thirds of the population will require humanitarian aid this year, Afghan children like Mamlika can only hope the world is listening. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
COREN: Laila, the U.N. special rapporteur to Afghanistan Richard Bennett issued his report over the weekend saying that these humanitarian and economic crisis is now affecting almost the entire population. Now he took direct aim at the Taliban the fact their government that has been in power for the past 18 months specifically at its erasure of women and girls education, the work place and obviously society.
 
This is an enormous problem for the international community and one of the main reasons for international sanctions against the Taliban government and the freezing of billions of dollars in Afghan reserves.
 
The report said quote, "The denial of women and girls fundamental human rights may amount to gender persecution, a crime against humanity.
 
Laila, the Taliban is yet to response.
 
HARRAK: Anna Coren there reporting in Hong Kong. Thanks so much. 
 
After fleeing violence in Myanmar, thousands of people are now homeless again after a fire ripped through a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. The fire gutted around 2,000 huts in Cox's Bazar on Sunday. 
 
Refugee volunteers trained in firefighting eventually gained control of the flames. No deaths were reported, but around 12,000 people have been displaced. 
 
Authorities are working with humanitarian groups to provide food and shelter to those impacted. And officials are investigating what caused the blaze. 
 
And at least seven people are recovering from their injuries after a massive fire in the Bronx, New York. The five-alarm blaze began at a commercial building, and has been blamed on a lithium ion battery from an electric scooter.
 
The fire commissioner says, blazes caused by lithium iron batteries move quickly, and create a lot of damage. Why the battery burst into flames is still unknown. 
 
The daughter of jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny is calling for his release from prison and an end to the war in Ukraine. In a recent interview with CNN she voiced concerns about her private father's prison conditions saying he has limited access to both his family and his attorneys. 
 
He was transferred to a maximum security prison last June. And in November, he said on social media he'd been isolated from other prisoners.
 
CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward takes us through Navalny's story. Alexei Navalny in 2017, taken on Putin, and exposing corruption among issues leaves. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Alexei Navalny in 2017, taking on Putin and exposing corruption among Russia's elite. Alexei Navalny now, haggard and gaunt, in solitary confinement in one of Russia's most brutal penal colonies.
 <br>[01:34:58]
 
WARD: On Valentine's day this year, he posted a message to his wife Yulia. "I haven't see you Yuliashka for a terribly long time. But in my heart, there's a lot of you," it read.
 
As a couple they've endured much -- harassment, separation, death threats. But nothing prepared them for the attempt to kill Navalny with a deadly toxin. 
 
August 20th, 2020 on a flight from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow, a passenger captured Navalny's anguish. 
 
ALEXEI NAVALNY, RUSSIAN OPPOSITON LEADER: I turned over to the flight attendant and said I was poisoned. I'm going to die. And then I lay down under the (INAUDIBLE) seat then to die. 
 
WARD: The flight diverted. Two days later, a comatose Navalny was flown to Berlin. Germany soon disclosed he'd been poisoned with a Soviet era nerve agent Novichok. 
 
CNN joined investigative group Bellingcat to find out who was behind it, leading us to this building in Moscow. 
 
We're staying in the car, because we don't want to attract any attention, but this compound is part of the Institute of Criminalistics of the FSB, Russia's secretary service.
 
And beyond that fence an elite team of operatives have been tracking Navalny's every move for more than three years. 
 
CNN and Bellingcat examined phone records and flight manifests that revealed the communications and movements of the FSB group. And discovered it was activated just days after Navalny announced he would run for president in 2018. 
 
We presented the findings to Navalny in Germany, as he recovered from the poisoning. 
 
Would it surprise you to learn that some of these men went on more than 30 trips with you, over the course of three years.
 
NAVALNY: That is absolutely terrifying.
 
WARD: Four months after Navalny was poisoned, our search for the perpetrators took us to an apartment block on the edge of Moscow. The home of operative Oleg Tayakin (ph).
 
My name is Clarissa Ward. I work for CNN. Can I ask you a couple of questions? 
 
Was it your team that poisoned Navalny, please? Do you have any comments? He doesn't seem to want to talk to us. 
 
As we visited Tayakin, Navalny himself was calling another member the FSB team. Pretending to be a senior official in Putin's national security council. 
 
Konstantin Kudratsip (ph) was hesitant at first, but then revealed, his job was to ensure there was no Novichok left on a Navalny's clothes. (INAUDIBLE) 
 
WARD: In a 45-minute call, Kudtratsip also acknowledged that the pilot diverting the flight that day likely saved Navalny's life. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the flight was a little longer, I think (unreadable).
 
WARD: An explosive confession, days after President Putin himself had denied any attempt to poison Navalny. 
 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: You se, if we wanted to, we would have finished it.
 
WARD: Despite everything, Navalny insisted to us he would return to Russia. 
 
You are aware of the risks of going back? 
 
NAVALNY: Yes, but I'm a Russian politician. And I would never give Putin such a gift. 
 
WARD: On January 17th 2021, he arrived in Moscow and was immediately arrested. He's been behind bars ever since and has at least 8 years of a jail term yet to serve.

HARRAK: That was CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward reporting. 
 
Oceans cover more than half the surface of the planet, but they've gone largely unregulated until now. A historic treaty aims to protect marine life and the waters in which they live. Details next. 
 
Plus, some migrants are getting out of Tunisia as quickly as they can. We'll explain why many are blaming the exodus on the country's president. 
 <br>[01:39:38]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: After nearly two decades of talks, nearly 200 countries have agreed to a treaty aimed at helping to protect the world's oceans. It was a historic win for environmentalists that could bring 30 percent of the oceans under protection by the end of the decade. 
 
Well, oceans are the heart of our planet, covering about three quarters of the earth's surface and producing about half of the oxygen in the atmosphere. 
 
Well, they drive weather systems, and absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide. But all too often, the bodies of water that nourish our planet are treated like dumping grounds. The creatures living in the sea are overfished, and climate change has warmed waters around the globe and that melting polar ice caps bleaching coral reef and intensifying hurricanes. floods and droughts. Right now only about 1 percent of these areas are protected. 
 
But the treaty aims to limit fishing in certain waters, consolidate shipping lanes and require environmental checks on deep sea mining. There's also an agreement to share marine genetic resources which were the sticking point in negotiations since they have potentially lucrative pharmaceutical uses.
 
Activists have been lobbying for years to get more regulations on the high seas, because international waters go largely unregulated.
 
Joining me now to talk about it, Anna-Maria Hubert is assistant professor at the University of Calgary's faculty of law and an expert in international environmental law and the law of the sea. So good to have you with us. 
 
How significant is this? 
 
ANNA-MARIA HUBERT, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY FACULTY OF LAW: I would say that this is probably one of the most or the most significant achievement and protection of the marine environment, for decades. And it's really taken upwards of 15 years to get to this point. 
 
All the way up until last night, we weren't sure that a text would be realized, but I think there's a lot of optimism about what we can achieved with this new framework. 
 
HARRAK: Why did it take this long, what were some of the hurdles? 
 
HUBERT: I mean it's in -- I think there's a lot of interests at stake in the oceans already. And so up until this point, sort of the guiding principle for the use of the high seas has been the freedom of the high seas. 
 
And so this effectively allowed for the capture and abuse of the resources of the areas with minimal regulatory oversight and coordination. So it's essentially on a sector by sector basis. 
 <br>[01:44:41]
 
HUBERT: And it's clear that technological capacity and global interest and resources and so forth has really allowed us to outstrip what the marine environment and marine species could handle in terms of exploitation, and other kinds of activities. 
 
And so, the sort of the existing regime which is now showing its age, needed to be updated -- 
 
HARRAK: Right.
 
HUBERT: -- for these areas. HARRAK: Now, the treaty sets out a legal framework, it's an ambitious
 
 treaty, I'm told. Years in the making, as you've outlined. How will be enforced? 
 
HUBERT: Well, most we actually haven't seen the finalized text yet. The negotiations did include (INAUDIBLE) so that's one way but mostly what we see is an environmental nod or an accountability through transparency and reporting. And other measures to bring countries together to cooperate and coordinate to achieve the outcome, so there are multiple mechanisms. 
 
HARRAK: should we point out that this isn't only -- (INAUDIBLE) or instrument actually. There are a lot of sectoral agreements relating to fisheries and shipping and other area based on regional treaties that apply. 
 
So one of the big issues was coordinating existing law and creating a framework that could work with what already existed. 
 
HARRAK: But I understand, I mean the hard part probably starts now. Countries still have to ratify this treaty. 
 
HUBERT: Yes, so the next step is, the text is agreed but that hasn't been formally adopted, and after that, individual countries will have to agree, under their own legislative procedures and approved ratification of the treaty. 
 
And so once they do that, you need a sufficient number which is stated in the treaty itself, of ratification before the agreement comes into force. 
 
I think the other point that is really important here, is that we have many agreements that have been -- that relate to the environment, that have been widely ratified, and still they haven't proven to be effective at achieving their environmental outcomes. 
 
So strong implementation, once the agreement is enforced, is going to be really important. 
 
HARRAK: Anna-Maria Hubert, thank you so much for joining us. 
 
HUBERT: Thank you so much. 
 
HARRAK: Migrants in Tunisia are experiencing fear and turmoil, after the president made seemingly racist comments about illegal immigration. 
 
As we hear now from CNN's Larry Madowo, many of them are now fleeing the north African nation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: An unexpected return home, hundreds of people arrive in Mali from Tunisia what they say is no longer safe for them. 
 
ABRAMANE DOUMBIA, STUDENT: I didn't go out anymore. I stayed in my house. I didn't go to school anymore. I was s locked up at home. 
 
MADOWO: Almost two weeks ago, Tunisian President Kais Saied, sparked a backlash against migrants with his controversial remarks saying illegal immigration from sub-Saharan Africa was a conspiracy to change the racial make up of Tunisia. Saied also blamed illegal migrants for crime in the country and ordered security forces to crack down on them. 
 
Migrants with and without papers say they now live in fear in Tunisia. Incendiary remarks resulting in evictions, firings, and even attacks on some migrants. 
 
Many say they want to leave the country, lining up at their embassy for repatriation, rather than face prejudice or worse if they stay. 
 
WILFRID, IVORIAN IN TUNISIA: Landlords are kicking us out, we are beaten and mistreated. for more security, we prefer to come to our embassy, to register to return to Ivory Coast. 
 
MADOWO: Saied has since denied his comments WERE racist, saying legal migrants have nothing to fear, but reiterated his belief that illegal immigrants are causing the downfall of the country. 
 
KAIS SAIED, TUNISIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a matter for the state, it must take its responsibilities. There is no question of allowing anyone, in an illegal situation, to stay in Tunisia. There is a state and institution. 
 
MADOWO: Saied's remarks are causing shockwaves across the continent. The African Union calling them racist and shocking. 
 
Countries like Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea, and Gabon are now working to have their citizens leave the country. But some migrants say, they've got nothing to go back to in their home countries, even though some are living rough on the streets, after they say mobs ransacked their homes, fueled by the president's words. 
 <br>[01:49:54]
 
NATASHA, SIERRA LEONEAN IN TUNISIA: We need help, we will need help from all over the world, because we're really suffering here. Things are not even (INAUDIBLE) you can see the place that we were sleeping, this is not a place you want to sleep. We are suffering. 
 
MADOWO: Tunisia is home to about 20,000 migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. The country has visa free travel from many African countries and has become a transit point for many illegal migrants trying to cross to Europe. 
 
It's also country sliding away from democracy to one-man rule. In 2021 Saied suspended parliament making way for a new constitution but took away many of the government's checks and balances, consolidating power with himself.
 
On Sunday, Tunisian demonstrators gathered in the capital of Tunis, despite a ban on the rally, to protest against the president, and the recent arrests of opposition leaders. A crackdown on critics, and a purge of migrants, signs Tunisia's time as a democracy may be ticking away.

HARRAK: Still to come the guest is being finalized for the coronation of King Charles III, but did the Duke and Duchess of Sussex make the cut?
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
HARRAK: Fresh off of reports that they've been asked to leave their official U.K. residents at Frogmore Cottage, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been invited to the coronation of King Charles in May. 
 
This, according to a spokesperson for Prince Harry. But whether he will attend with his wife Meghan, is still up in the air. 
 
Charles and his wife Camilla will be crowned on May 6th, and the days of celebration and fanfare planned across the United Kingdom. Prince Harry has remained silent about whether his family will attend, especially while on tour, for his recent book.
 
Buckingham Palace says they won't be commenting on the matter. 
 
Well, we are less than five months away from the women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and the Canadian and French national teams are at odds with their soccer federations. The presidents of both governing bodies resigned from their post last week following disputes that highlight inequality in women's soccer.
 
CNN's Jade Kim Garcia has the details. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JADE KIM GARCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The road to this he summer's Women's World Cup looks bright for Team USA after winning a six-year battle for equal pay in 2022, their success paves the way for other national teams like Canada and France to fight for the same equal treatment. 
 
CHRISTINE SINCLAIR, CANADA NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: Very proud of what they were able to accomplish. Now it's our turn and we know that we have their support. 
 
GARCIA: Canada's team attempted to strike after the federation made budget cuts to their program. Canada (INAUDIBLE) says that the strike was illegal, so the players protested at a tournament last month, by hiding that national crest on their practice jersey, and spelling out their message. "Enough is enough." 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we made it pretty clear that we're operating under a protest at the minute. GARCIA: Canada soccer's president resigned fall following the public dispute. In his farewell, he said the men's and women's team have the potential to sign an agreement calling it a landmark bill that will set the nation apart. 
 
Both teams responded calling the change in leadership one necessary step but that a change in Canada soccer strategy is still needed. 
 
American players rallying behind their rivals. 
 
[01:55:01[
 
MEGAN RAPINOE, U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM: This is about just, you know, basic human rights and respect and getting what they deserve. I mean we're talking about the Olympic champions here. 
 
GARCIA: Disputes in France reached a tipping point when French team captain Wendie Renard and two other teammates stepped back from their national team in protest over enduring issues with the head coach Corrine Diacre.
 
Renard tweeted she needed to preserve her mental health, saying unfortunately, I won't be doing this World Cup in these conditions. 
 
The French federation's response is that no individual takes precedent over the institution. But Diacre's future is set to be decided in a board meeting on March 9.
 
Reuters reported that days after the three players stepped back, French federation president Noel Le Graet resigned following allegations of inappropriate behavior towards women which he denies. 
 
French football expert Christian Nourry (ph), says Le Graet's departure is a step in the right direction. 
 
CHRISTIAN NOURRY, FOOTBALL EXPERT: The atmosphere has been so low and so toxic for so many years that I don't think this is going to negatively impact France's chances at the World Cup. 
 
GARCIA: The tournament usually measures the progress of women's soccer around the world is instead spotlighting the lack of progress. 
 
ALEX MORGAN, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: All we're asking for the Canadian Federation and a lot of these other federations who have not treated and paid their women's team equally, they haven't done the right thing yet. 
 
GARCIA: Jade Garcia, CNN -- Atlanta.

HARRAK: World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from this week's BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells in California. The Serb exit comes after he said last month he had hoped for a positive result on U.S. Tennis tournament participation after applying for a special permission to play. The U.S. requires international visitors to be vaccinated against
 
 COVID-19. And Djokovic has said publicly, he remains unvaccinated. 
 
A U.S. bound passenger flight had to return to Cuba on Sunday after reportedly being hit by birds. This video captured the scene as smoke filled the cabin, Southwest Airlines says its flight was headed to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from Havana when birds hit the nose cone and one of the engines. 
 
Passengers used evacuations slides to evacuate the plane once it touched down in an emergency landing. There are no reports of injuries to humans and people were being re-booked on to other flights. Scary.
