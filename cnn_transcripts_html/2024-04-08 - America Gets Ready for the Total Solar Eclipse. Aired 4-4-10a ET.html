COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, sunshine. It`s time to shine. Today is the day, Monday, April 8th, we have a special abbreviated version of CNN 10 
 
 dedicated to the great celestial event, the solar eclipse. 
 
Today, millions of people in North America will witness one of the world`s most extraordinary events when the moon passes between the Earth and the 
 
 sun. For the lucky ones right in the heart of the action in the so-called path of totality, you`re in for a treat that lasts up to four minutes, 
 
 according to NASA.
 
For those outside of the direct path, a crescent-shaped partial eclipse will be the main event, weather permitting, of course. CNN has a special 
 
 digital live stream of the event from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern today. We`ll share how you can view that in just a minute.
 
But first, let`s break down what`s happening in the sky above. A total solar eclipse, it happens when the moon passes between the Earth and the 
 
 sun, completely blocking out the light.
 
More than 32 million people across Mexico, the United States, and Canada could see the sun completely darkened by the moon`s shadow. And that moment 
 
 of total darkness could last more than four minutes in some places. It`s also going to be the last one for quite some time. A total solar eclipse 
 
 won`t happen again in the United States for about another 20 years. 
 
Location is key. The total eclipse is only visible inside a very narrow track known as the path of totality. It stretches more than 10 U.S. states 
 
 from Texas through Maine. And the timing changes depending on where you are within that path. 
 
People outside that narrow band will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse. That`s when the moon only blocks part of the sun`s face. That 
 
 should be visible in all 48 contiguous U.S. states. 
 
Now, if you`re planning on peeking at a total or partial eclipse, remember to get you some certified eclipse glasses. Regular sunglasses, not strong 
 
 enough to protect your eyes. Otherwise, severe eye damage can occur. A solar retina burn can permanently injure your eyes and you might not even 
 
 feel it until it`s too late. 
 
All right, to view CNN`s special live stream event of Monday`s total solar eclipse as it crosses over North America, head to CNN.com/eclipse or click 
 
 on the link below this video. That live presentation will be from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern today. 
 
And CNN 10 will return to regular programming tomorrow. I`ll see you then, and no matter what gets in your way, keep shining.
