ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM. U.S. House Republicans narrowly passed a bill to raise the country's debt limit. But the fight with Democrats and the White House is far from over.
 
Explicit and dramatic testimony as the woman accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault takes the stand.
 
Plus, prosecutors now say the classified Intel stolen by that 21-year- old Air National Guardsmen far exceeds what's been reported.
 
And the human side of the conflict in Sudan. We will hear from a man whose mother died in his father's arms through a mortar attack.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN NEWSROOM with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Well, Republicans in the U.S. House claiming a major victory passing a bill to raise the nation's debt limit, potentially avoiding economic catastrophe. But their celebration will be short lived. The measure is dead on arrival in the Senate where Democrats object to huge cuts in federal spending. The bill passed by only two votes but Republicans hope it will strengthen their hand in negotiations with Democrats and the White House.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We just passed the bill. It's not our job to modify it. We're the only ones to lift the debt limit to make sure this economy is not in jeopardy.
 
MITCH LANDRIEU, SENIOR ADVISER TO U.S. PRESIDENT BIDEN: With the Speaker of the House with whether to vote margin did today was actually put the nation at risk. And the cuts that they're going to put in place are going to damage economic growth.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Without an agreement, the U.S. government could default on its debt by early June with a downgrade and its credit rating shorter follow up.
 
More now from CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju.
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: After months of internal deliberations and round the clock negotiations Speaker McCarthy achieved the biggest legislative accomplishment of his young speakership. Pushing through a bill along straight party lines to raise the national debt limit by $1.5 trillion. And getting that done on Republican votes alone. The bill passed 217 to 215.
 
Four Republicans voting against it. Four conservative members of the conference. McCarthy lost one more Republican, that would have been enough to sync the measure. But behind the scenes, McCarthy has tried to assuage concerns from the right trying to -- putting in a whole slew of provisions in his package, Republican priorities, efforts to go after the Biden agenda, as well as across the board spending cuts like domestic discretionary programs, as well as new work requirements for beneficiaries of the Medicaid entitlement program.
 
All of which had been supported by most members of the Republican conference. But given the narrow majority, McCarthy had very little margin for error, but didn't convince everybody in the conference including Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee who argued that the bill should have went further.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Yes. I'm a hard no. I just can't get past $32 trillion in debt. If people in Tennessee work too hard and they manage their money, and we just do a terrible job of it here.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RAJU: Now what happens next is anyone's guess. McCarthy is using the pass to this bill to point out that it is only the House that has passed any legislation to raise the debt ceiling. The Democratic-led Senate has not done that. And the White House has been calling on Congress to simply raise the debt limit without any conditions, without any spending cuts and to avoid the potential of the first debt default which could occur as soon as June.
 
That is a position that McCarthy rejects. He says, there needs to be negotiation, there need to be spending cuts attached to it. So, which side will blink first? That is the major question. McCarthy says he is not going to blink. He says they have passed a bill. The Senate needs to act. The Senate Democrats say McCarthy needs to change course. What will happen?
 
Major question as Congress and the White House are staring at the prospects of the first default in the nation's history. Some is a real fiscal scare, probably the biggest fiscal scare since 2011 when the United States saw its credit rating downgraded amid a standoff over lifting the debt ceiling.
 
Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.
 <br>[02:05:01]
 
CHURCH: Joining me now from New York is CNN Global Economic Analyst Rana Foroohar. She is also a global business columnist and associate editor at The Financial Times. Great to have you with us.
 
RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Great to be here.
 
CHURCH: So, the House of Representatives very narrowly voted to pass a Republican bill Wednesday. That would raise the debt limit in exchange for far-reaching spending cuts. And while it's being viewed as a big win for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. This bill won't pass in the Senate and President Biden continues to refuse to negotiate on this. So, what's in that bill that he finds so unacceptable?
 
FOROOHAR: Well, Rosemary, you're absolutely right. I mean, even though this is in some ways, a victory for Republicans, it was unclear whether even they would be able to come together around any kind of an agreement. It's not going to do anything to help Republicans and Democrats get together on raising the debt. And in large part, because there is a toxic list of demands from Republicans. 
 
Things like overturning Biden's efforts to forgive student debt, for example. Pulling back parts of the Inflation Reduction Act climate subsidies. I mean, these are things that have been really the cornerstone of what the President believes in, what he feels his work, the last two years have been -- has been. And there's no way Democrats are going to let this pass. So really, we haven't moved the ball forward at all yet.
 
CHURCH: So, Rana, if Republicans refuse to lift the debt limit, right up until the deadline around early June, what is that going to mean in terms of perhaps forcing Biden to negotiate, to come up with some sort of compromise?
 
FOROOHAR: Well, it's interesting. You can already see a little bit of movement, not in Congress, but in, you know, within interest groups outside. Interestingly, a kind of an odd mix of bedfellows, certain fossil fuel lobbying interests are teaming up with clean energy advocates to say, look, is there anything we can do to make sure that we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater here?
 
And one thing that's being discussed is whether or not there could be an agreement to speed up permitting of all kinds of energy projects that would help fossil fuel companies to, you know, get things going from there. And it would also help clean energy folks to be assured that the Inflation Reduction Act is not going to get thrown out if we can't get to a debt agreement. 
 
That's just one of the pieces in play here. I expect that we are going to see a lot more wrangling over the next few weeks. And I expect that this is going to go right up until the deadline. CHURCH: And of course, every year debate over the lifting of the debt limit brings this country to the brink. How do we avoid that annual crisis that this country goes through? And what would a default on the U.S. debt look like? What would be the consequences of that if it happens?
 
FOROOHAR: Well, you know, I think it would really throw the U.S. into recession. No question. I think it would rock global markets. You know, Rosemary, the damage that's being done by American politicians, allowing the country to walk up to this limit every so often, every few years is cumulative. You know, we've never gotten to the place where we've actually defaulted on government debt and had to face the ramifications of that.
 
But there's been such a loss of trust in just the ability of the U.S. to govern. I mean, there's been a loss of trust in the dollar in some ways as a global reserve currency. I think if we were to get at and beyond the debt ceiling limit this time around, I really do think that the implications would be pretty substantial for the world.
 
CHURCH: Yes., That is a big concern. Of course. We don't get to that point. Rana Foroohar, thank you so much for joining us.
 
FOROOHAR: Thanks, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: The woman who accuses Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her decades ago in a department store dressing room is expected back on the witness stand in the hours ahead. E. Jean Carroll is suing the former president for battery and defamation in a civil case. And on Wednesday, she began her dramatic testimony describing in chilling detail the alleged rape. CNN's Paul Reid is following developments from New York.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Writer E. Jean Carroll taking the stand in the second day of her civil battery and defamation case against former President Donald Trump.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you looking forward to testifying today?
 
REID: The first question, her attorney asked, why she finally took her case to court? I'm here because Donald Trump raped me. And when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen. He lied and shattered my reputation. And I'm here to try to get my life back.
 
Carroll alleges Trump raped her in a department store in the 1990s.
 
E. JEAN CARROLL, SUING DONALD TRUMP: It was a fight. It was just -- I want women to know that I did not stand there, I did not freeze, I was not paralyzed. It was over very quickly. It was against my will 100 percent and I ran away.
 <br>[02:10:11]
 
REID: She spent hours Wednesday testifying on the alleged assault, which Trump denies. She told the jury she didn't picture anything about what was about to happen. When the pair were shopping in the New York Bergdorf Goodman. Through tears, she said the open dressing room door they entered plagued me for years because I just walked into it. Walked in. She told the jury, Trump shoved her against the wall and then the assault began.
 
I always think of why I walked in there to get myself in that situation. But I'm proud to say I did get out. I got my knee up and pushed him back.
 
She is now suing Trump for unspecified monetary damages and to get him to retract this October 2022 social media post reading in part, I don't know this woman, this woman is not my type. But in 2019 Trump acknowledged this photo from the 1980s showing the two chatting.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have absolutely no idea who she is.  There's some picture where we're shaking hands. It looks like at some kind of event.
 
REID: Trump who isn't expected to appear at the trial unless called to testify hosted Wednesday calling the case a "made-up scam." The judge in this case reacting strongly to Trump's public statement telling his lawyer that it opens up the client to a "potential liability."
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHURCH: And now, thanks to Paula Reid for that report.
 
Well, disturbing new details are emerging about the Air National Guardsmen accused of stealing U.S. classified documents and posting them on social media. Prosecutor say the information Jack Teixeira talk far exceeds what's been reported and releasing him from jail could pose a huge threat to national security. Teixeira is due in court in the coming hours for a hearing on whether he will have to remain behind bars while awaiting trial.
 
He has not yet entered a formal plea. Prosecutors say Teixeira viewed hundreds of documents and conducted keyword searches in what appears to be a deliberate effort to disseminate American secrets. We're also told he has a history of making violent threats and had access to an arsenal of weapons at his Massachusetts home.
 
Well, clashes in and around the Sudanese capital keep undermining the 72-hour ceasefire between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. But the head of the army has signaled his willingness to extend the truce by another three days and is calling for talks in neighboring South Sudan. The rapid support forces have not responded to the proposal yet. The current ceasefire is due to expire late Thursday, local time.
 
Each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement. The fighting now in its second week, has already claimed more than 500 lives according to the health ministry and wounded nearly 4200 people. Many Sudanese civilians from old to young are feeling a growing sense of despair.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I am afraid this war will continue, resulting in the deaths of more innocent people and the destruction of Sudan. I hope this war will end.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: So, let's bring in CNN Senior Africa Editors Stephanie Busari who joins us live from Lagos. So, Stephanie, what more are you learning about efforts to evacuate more people out of Sudan amid this conflict and of course, growing humanitarian crisis?
 
STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR AFRICA EDITOR: Good morning, Rosemary. So, India is the latest country to evacuate its citizens. Some thousand citizens were evacuated overnight, but many Sudanese and also U.S. citizens who was stuck there because the U.S. government has said that the conditions are not conducive to an evacuation of citizens. Many are being forced to make what they say are life and death choices to try to get to borders.
 
These borders are now filling up with people and conditions that these borders are now becoming quite dire. In Egypt, for example, men under 50 we're told are being turned back from a -- been denied access into the country because there's been a prison break in the country and there's just a sense of lawlessness. And people are telling us that the Egyptians don't know who they're letting in. They don't know who they're letting into the country.
 
So, men of a certain age or not being allowed into the country. And against this backdrop is a looming, humanitarian disaster, lack of food, lack of water, no electricity. So, that situation has not changed much. Still looking very, very desperate. Rosemary. 
 <br>[02:15:06]
 
CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Stephanie Busari joining us live from Lagos.
 
We now want to show you one of the faces of the tragedy that's unfolding in Sudan and talk about the price many families are paying after losing their loved ones. Nagwa Khalid Hamad, a doctor was killed in a mortar strike on her home in Khartoum earlier this month. Her son, Khalid Osman who's also in that picture, you're looking out there along with his father joins us now from Muscat in Oman. 
 
Thank you so much for talking with us at this difficult and tragic time and our deepest condolences to you and your family for the loss of your mother.
 
KHALID OSMAN, MOTHER DIED DURING FIGHTING: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
 
CHURCH: So, talk to us about what happened to your mother who was also a doctor as we mentioned, like your father. What were the circumstances surrounding her death? OSMAN: My mom was just sitting at her living room in our house in Khartoum north in Kobar. They were hearing -- just started hearing the gunshots and the loud explosions in the background. And they just -- so it kind of got used to like these gunshots by now, but everything was multiplied twice and everything was louder. Everything was closer. And I remember the last thing my mom was sending us through WhatsApp group chat is she was recording the -- she was recording the loud explosions and the gunfire so we can hear it.
 
And it was so loud I felt like I'm living there. I felt -- I felt like I'm in there. I felt like I'm with them. One minute my mom was recording those gun fires. And then less than half an hour later she wasn't. So, what happened was a mortar hit right outside of our house or right on the fence and one of the sharp nails got in through the windows, shattered the windows and got to my mom. My mom was -- my mom and my brother were in the living room together.
 
They ran away to my dad's room. And she ran away. She got up, she ran away. And then she realized later she was like I have something on my neck. I think I have blood on my neck. And she had so few blood in the neck and she didn't even realize anything. And then suddenly she collapsed. My dad tried to perform CPR on her. But it was -- it was just too late. In less than two minutes, she was -- she was she was dead already.
 
CHURCH: I am so, so sorry for your loss. And I know you have talked previously about what a kind doctor she was. You've spoken about sometimes many of her patients couldn't even afford her services as a doctor. And they gave her food and various other items to pay for her service to them as a doctor. Talk to us about what happens now to your brother, your sister and of course your father, will they remain in Sudan or do they plan to get out and join you they're in Oman?
 
OSMAN: For the past week, I've been -- I wasn't -- I'm not able to sleep, I'm not able to rest. I'm unable to read properly. I feel like something is -- something is pressuring through my heart because I can't grip properly or -- on my mom and I cannot feel safe for my parent -- for my dad and my brother and my sister. They were stuck at their house for -- I think for over 50 hours. I guess when we threw in or trying to withstand those gun fires and those explosions because it was not safe to get out.
 
Luckily, they were -- they were -- they were -- they were lucky enough to find enough time to bury my mom and come back. But they were stuck in the house for more than 50 hours. Then my dad took my brother and my sister to -- I think the northern side of Khartoum where it's a little bit safer. And he'd stayed with some relatives over there. But I heard --
 
CHURCH: I know -- I know it's particularly difficult for you because you're watching from afar, which makes it all the more hard to know what's going on with your family. I'd be interested to get your reaction to this conflict and this very shaky ceasefire that appears to be holding in some parts of the country at least. But what do you say to the two military leaders who are battling out for control of the country? [02:20:06]
 
OSMAN: I guess what to say, I'm not a political person at all. I don't -- I don't belong to any political party. I don't -- I don't care for any political party. But what I care is for the innocent people that are dying from this conflict. I don't belong to any of them. I just want them to stop because I feel like the only -- the only -- the only people that are suffering from this is the innocent civilians in the middle that are caught up in the crossfire.
 
And sometimes not even caught up in the crossfire. Sometimes they are targeted like some doctors, some innocent families that are trying to escape, they got shot in the middle of the crossfire. They got shot -- they got shot right in their cars trying to escape. I was lucky enough to have my parent -- my dad and my brother, my sister escaped this morning into the northern side of the country.
 
But that was -- that was -- that was a very scary journey for them. And I just felt like I can barely breathe again, you know.
 
CHURCH: Yes. I sense that you speak for most people there in Sudan. And again, I'm so sorry. Our deepest sympathies to you and your family for the loss of your mother. Khalid Osman, thank you so much.
 
OSMAN: Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate it.
 
CHURCH: And still to come. From diplomacy to deterrence, the U.S. and South Korea announced a new security deal, marking a shift in their strategy for handling North Korea. Those details just ahead.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:25:13]
 
CHURCH: There was plenty of pomp and pageantry in Washington as U.S. President Joe Biden hosted South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the second state visit of Biden's presidency. The leaders use the occasion to announce a strengthening of their alliances to deter North Korea. They attended a glitzy state dinner just a few hours ago with the event and menu highlighting the deep ties between the two countries.
 
Earlier, the U.S. agreed to deploy a nuclear armed submarine to South Korea. And CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie. So, talk to us. The South Korean president will soon be addressing the U.S. Congress. How will he likely frame that alliance?
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. It's happening 11:00 am Eastern time. President Yoon will address the U.S. Congress to mark 70 years of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. And his address will come shortly after this key New Deal aimed at deterring North Korea. The U.S. has pledged to give South Korea more insight into his nuclear planning, as well as a new U.S. commitment to deploy nuclear armed submarines in South Korea for the first time since the early 80s. In return, South Korea has agreed not to pursue its own nuclear arsenal. Here's the South Korean president.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOON SUK YEOL, PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA (through translator): President Biden has reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to extended deterrence toward the Republic of Korea. Our two countries have agreed to immediate Bilateral Presidential consultations in the event of North Korea's nuclear attack and a promise to respond swiftly, overwhelmingly and decisively using the full force of the alliance including the United States nuclear weapons.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: But the key question is this. Will the deal actually determine North Korea? Last year North Korea fired a record number of rockets and missiles. It's continued to fire more including recently that new solid fuel ICBM. Biden, he repeated the US offer to North Korea to have talks about its weapons program but he also offered a very stark warning to North Korea, and we are awaiting response from Pyongyang. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: Indeed. And Kristie, there was an unexpected moment in the state dinner when the South Korean President sang for everyone. How was that received?
 
SOUT: Yes. Look, it was quite the evening of entertainment at the White House state dinner on Wednesday. You had the Broadway stars out in force. They were singing hit show tunes. The highlight though was when the South Korean president took to the mic. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: You recognize it. And Yoon, he received a standing ovation for his rendition of American Pie and the U.S. president. He presented him with a guitar signed from the great Don McLean. Back to you, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: Oh, that's awesome. He actually has a voice very good voice.
 
STOUT: Yes, very good.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
CHURCH: Kristie Lu Stout joining us live from Hong Kong. Many thanks.
 
SOUT: Thank you.
 
CHURCH: Well, China is trying its hand as peacemaker in Ukraine. Details on the first phone call between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Xi Jinping since Russia invaded. We'll have that in a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:30:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: The Ukrainian and Chinese Presidents have spoken for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine as Beijing aims to portray itself as an objective and fair peacemaker, despite its close ties to Moscow. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Xi Jinping spoke for an hour by phone on Wednesday. President Zelenskyy said he made it clear Ukraine would not give up territory to Russia to end the fighting. So, let's bring in CNN's Beijing Bureau Chief, Steven Jiang. Steven, how significant is this call between the leaders of China and Ukraine? And what might come of this?
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Rosemary, it is significant symbolically. It had long been rumored that this would take place, but especially after Xi came back from Moscow after he visited with Putin last month. And especially after the recent flurry of diplomatic visits to Beijing by European leaders like Macron and the Von Der Leyen. And then, of course, the E.U. juxtapose that China's growing desire to be seen as a global peacemaker after that deal they brokered between the Saudis and Iranians.
 
So, it was in this broader context that we finally saw this highly anticipated call take place. And some observers see this as a reward from Beijing to Europe's willingness to engage with China on this issue. But let's not forget what happened just in the past few days. That is the Chinese ambassador to France caused an uproar across Europe by questioning the legality of the sovereignty of former Soviet State. And that, of course, has caused a lot of damage, even though China has since distanced itself from those remarks, the need for damage control, according to some observers, may finally tip the scales in favor of this rather modest gesture in the form of this call.
 
Now, Xi Jinping, of course, reiterated a lot of China's longstanding talking points. But he did pledge to send a special envoy to Ukraine and other regional countries to discuss, quote unquote, a political settlement. But even the state media here has acknowledged, it's very unlikely anything would change in the short term given the chasm between Ukraine and Russia on their positions. And also, a lot of people have pointed out it's going to take a lot more than a phone call to convince China's critics and skeptics in Europe that it is serious to play an unbiased role. And, of course, as you know, all of this is taking place when Europe is increasingly a battleground in the strategic rivalry between the United States and China, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: Steven Jiang, joining us live from Beijing, many thanks. And we'll be right back.

CHURCH: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is in Israel right now. The latest stop on the likely Republican Presidential Contenders World Tour. His visit to Jerusalem comes as his yearlong battle with Disney has taken a new turn, while Disney parks and resorts filed a lawsuit against DeSantis on Wednesday. The case is centered on an oversight board made up of members handpicked by the Governor, which recently ended Disney's decades long control of a special tax district. Steve Contorno has more now on what's behind the sued.
 
STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Walt Disney parks and resorts filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in federal court against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The 77 Page lawsuit alleges that DeSantis engaged in a yearlong effort to punish the company for its opposition to a state law that bans the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools. According to the lawsuit, the company's First Amendment rights were violated by Governor DeSantis.
 <br>[02:40:20]
 
And there was, quote, "A targeted campaign of government retaliation, orchestrated every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech." In a statement to CNN, DeSantis his office criticized Disney and said quote, "We are unaware of any legal rights that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in this state." The lawsuit is the latest escalation in a yearlong fight between DeSantis and Disney, one of his state's largest companies. And now, heads to federal court where a judge will decide who is the victor. For CNN in St. Petersburg, Florida, I'm Steve Contorno.
 
CHURCH: I'm Rosemary Church, for our international viewers, "WORLD SPORT" is next. And for those of you here in North America, I'll be back in just a moment.

CHURCH: Severe storms stretched out across the southern U.S. on Wednesday affecting people and animals from Florida to Texas. Large hailstones the size of tennis balls hit the small town of Dublin, Texas, even forcing a bull to head for cover from the storm. Some areas could see continued thunderstorms until morning. On Thursday, the storms will push East putting parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast at risk for more severe weather. And flooding along the Mississippi River is expected to get worse as melting snow causes waters to swell. Upper Midwest states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, we'll see the worst of it. CNN's Emily Schmidt reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
EMILY SCHMIDT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): There's a real time math equation playing out along the upper Mississippi River. Take spring water and winter snow melt, you get a massive problem.
 
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): People say it's the storm of the century, the year that we've never seen a blizzard like this. And then Mother Nature says hold my beer. GWEN KATULA, WISCONSIN MAYOR (voiceover): We try to keep as much water on the other side of the barrier as we can but it's going to be a constant work in progress.
 
SCHMIDT (voiceover): It's not as if these towns along the river haven't dealt with flooding before, they were prepared with systems and sandbags. But in Fountain City, Wisconsin, the water found another way in.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That as the morning progressed yesterday morning, it started coming up through the road. And at that point, we had kind of lost the battle.
 
BRIAN JANEZICH COCHRANE, FOUNTAIN CITY, SCHOOL TEACHER: People need help. So, we're glad to -- glad to get down here and lend a hand.
 
SCHMIDT (voiceover): Students filled sandbags there, while in Prairie du Chien. Officials say 16,000 sandbags came from a different area.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have great cooperation with a correctional facility here in town. Where inmates have been filling sandbags around the clock for us.
 
SCHMIDT (voiceover): The water is expected to continue to rise. The County Emergency Management Director says they've had so many offers to help. They've turned away volunteers. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'll be in this stage until it's time to crest and then clean up and determine our damages.
 
SCHMIDT (voiceover): Minnesota's governor says the state has seen most of the crusting there with no significant damage. But there are still more than 400 miles with flood warnings along the Mississippi. I'm Emily Schmidt reporting.

CHURCH: Authorities in Mississippi say one of four inmates who escaped from prison has died after a standoff with police. Investigators say they tracked him to a home, and he opened fire when confronted hours later, a fire started in that home. Inside authorities found one body believed to be Dylan Arrington, but they say it will take time to make a positive identification.

TYREE JONES, HINDS COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI SHERIFF: We're just not able at this particular time to confirm if it's Dylan Arrington, but there was someone inside of the residence that we believe to be him at the time of the fire and at the time of the exchange of gunfire between the individual inside of the residence and law enforcement.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Investigators say Arrington and three other inmates broke out of a detention center over the weekend. It's believed he killed a local pastor and stole his truck. Another is believed to have travelled to Texas in another stolen vehicle. Police in Colorado have arrested three teenagers in connection with the death of a 20-year-old woman who was killed when a rock was thrown through her car's windshield. The three suspects are all 18 and face charges including first degree murder. They're expected to make their first court appearance in the coming hours. Investigators say the woman who was killed was one of at least seven people hit by rocks as they were driving last week.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JACKI KELLEY, JEFFERSON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: It was important for us not just to identify these suspects for the for Alexa Bartell's family and all of the victims, but we were also concerned that this was a crime series that can potentially happen again if they weren't identified. This case touched a lot of people deeply. This was a beautiful young woman with her whole life in front of her who was simply driving home, and her life was ended as a result of these acts.

CHURCH: Authorities say the family of 20-year-old Alexa Bartell are suffering greatly as they mourn her death, but they say they are grateful for the arrests.

SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Once, a symbol of Beijing's goodwill, now the center of angry to be in China. This panda in Memphis, Tennessee has become the latest victim in worsening U.S.-China tensions. Yaya arrived in America with her playmate Lele two decades ago, as an emblem of growing bilateral friendship. But recent videos showing the ones fluffy panda, now looking skinny with scraggly fur has sparked outrage in China. Many Chinese people in some animal advocates accusing the zoo of mistreatment.
 
Videos on Chinese social media claiming the pandas are being abused quickly went viral against the backdrop of growing anti-American sentiment. The rumors, often fanned by state propaganda. And meanwhile, Chinese social media users are praising these viral videos of this panda in Russia, Ruyi claiming videos of the active and playful panda prove Russia is taking excellent care of the Chinese bear. State T.V. saying the pandas are helping the Russia-China relationship.
 
Chinese and American scientists launched a joint investigation concluding that Yaya has a genetic fur and skin condition, that does not impact your quality of life and has received excellent care. But that message is not getting through. Outside the panda exhibit at the Beijing Zoo. I asked people if they've heard of Yaya panda. This man says yes, she's abused in America. An 11-year-old boy tells me, I heard the U.S. is treating the panda poorly. This man says isn't Russia taking good care of pandas. Pandas are happy over there, not like in the U.S. And this man with his granddaughter tells me, pandas in Russia are very happy, why Russians and Chinese are friends. At least Russia is not sanctioning China.
 
(on camera) Yaya will soon settle in Beijing Zoo. Now, China has long used its pandas as a diplomatic tool. Currently, it's pandas on loan to about 20 countries. The United States has not received one since Yaya and Lele 20 years ago. Now, these pandas are normally loaned on these 10-year leases, and they cost a million dollars annually.
 
(voiceover) The Memphis Zoo had already planned to send Yaya and Lele back to Beijing this spring because their lease is expiring, but Lele died of heart disease two months ago, at the age of 24. The average lifespan for pandas is usually under 30 years. Yet, that didn't stop rampant speculation and led to an explosion of accusations about Yaya's treatment to accelerating costs to bring Yaya back to China. The message even featured on billboards from New York City to major cities across China. In 1972, during U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, his wife visited pandas in Beijing.
