JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNNI HOST: A warm welcome to "First Move" as always, and welcome to a special Helping Hands edition of the program today. The 
 
 devastating earthquake across Turkey and Syria and, of course, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has reminded us not only how connected and 
 
 interconnected the world truly is?
 
But also how urgently and swiftly we can respond as global citizens from families opening their homes and their hearts to Ukrainian refugees. To the 
 
 millions of dollars already pledged for earthquake relief. So many of us are stepping up to do our part but of course, far more must be done.
 
In the next hour, you'll hear from a whole array of guests who are making a true humanitarian difference across the world. In an exclusive interview, 
 
 we will speak to a Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, a leading light in the fight for girls' education. She'll be joined by the Co-Founder 
 
 of Airbnb Joe Gebbia, as he makes a personal donation of $25 million to the Malala Fund.
 
It's actually the largest private donation the fund has ever received. And their combined message to fight to ensure access to girls' education in 
 
 nations around the world such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Lebanon, just to name a few and the need of course, has never been greater.
 
Also, this hour, we'll hear from the Chobani Yogurt CEO and Founder of the tent partnership for refugees. He's a Turkish born businessman who's just 
 
 pledged $2 million for earthquake relief. And he remains a fierce advocate for increased hiring of refugee was workers.
 
The tent partnership holding a vigil for Ukrainian refugees in London's Trafalgar Square and around three-hours-time, ahead of the one-year 
 
 anniversary of the Russian invasion. So we have a lot to discuss ahead. Of course Friday's somber anniversary ceremonies.
 
Security in Kyiv is extremely tight. With another world leader Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also making a surprise visit to Kyiv as you 
 
 can see here and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen today urging G-20 nations to up for financial support to Ukraine as well.
 
The U.S. readying some $10 billion in fresh economic assistance to the nation too and on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's war in 
 
 Ukraine we take you to the battered town of Vuhledar in the Southeast of the country. The town has been under heavy Russian attack for weeks as Alex 
 
 Marquardt reports.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This fight for Vuhledar right now is one of the most important and 
 
 difficult in the country. While the fight for a Bakhmut is largely symbolic. This is a very strategic fight for both sides. Vuhledar is unique 
 
 in that it sits at the intersection of the two main active fronts in Ukraine, the Southern and the Eastern Front.
 
That is why Russia wants to try to push through here to launch an offensive into Donbas. It is believed that this is one of their shaping operations, 
 
 the beginning of a larger offensive to come in the next few weeks. But they are struggling very badly right now.
 
They've lost a huge amount of men and armored vehicles as they tried to cross open fields, including minefields, where the Ukrainians have been 
 
 able to inflict a huge amount of damage on their troops. At the same time, the Russians are absolutely pummeling this town.
 
You can see all around me, these are Soviet era, apartment blocks now largely empty, the residents have fled, and almost every single one 
 
 destroyed in varying degrees. All of the windows have been blown out. Craters here in the ground where children used to play.
 
Ukrainians have the benefit of the higher ground here and these buildings to use in the fighting. But as with so many of the battles here in Eastern 
 
 Ukraine, it is a fight of attrition, who can hold out the longest and Ukrainian side saying they need more ammunition to be able to keep the 
 
 Russians at bay to keep them from advancing. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Vuhledar in Eastern Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
CHATTERLEY: And to Russia now President Vladimir Putin pays tribute to fallen soldiers on Fatherland Day. It's an annual national holiday that 
 
 honors the nation's military. To commemorate the event, he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin wall.
 
It follows a commitment by the President to further strengthen the country's nuclear arsenal. Fred Pleitgen joins us now from Moscow that 
 
 commitment coming just a day or so after the suspension of the participation by Russia in the New START nuclear control accord. Fred, what 
 
 more did you have to say about boosting those nuclear weaponry?
 <br>[09:05:00]
 
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, he said that he will boost to the nuclear triad as he put it obviously meaning 
 
 the nuclear weapons that Russia has some of them ballistic missile strategic bombers but then also those Sea launch, Torpedo launch - as well 
 
 coming from submarines, the Russians, obviously, not really taking a lot of great pride in their nuclear triad that they have.
 
But it certainly is the backbone, if you will the last line of defense of this country, and certainly something that the Russians have been talking 
 
 about a great deal and you're absolutely right. Of course, the key thing that Vladimir Putin said in that main address to the Federal Assembly is 
 
 that Russians were pulling out of the New START treaty or not pulling out.
 
They were suspending their participation in the New START treaty, saying that for now, there would be no inspections on sites here in Russia. Later, 
 
 the Russian Foreign Ministry came out and said, look, all of that can be reversed. Again, if there are concessions from the United States, or right 
 
 now we're going to wait and see how all of that plays out.
 
But certainly, Vladimir Putin then one upping that last night in an address that he put out very late at night here in Moscow, where he said that 
 
 Russia would continue to bolster those weapons that they have, specifically the modern ones that they're starting to feel just now, like, for instance, 
 
 the SARMAT missile, that's a new generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles that the Russians have, which they obviously are extremely 
 
 effective and will continue to be the backbone of their nuclear deterrent, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: And to some degree, what we've seen this week, drawing attention away from what seems at least from our perspective, to be quite 
 
 high profile public spat between the private Russian military group, the Wagner group and the Defense Ministry.
 
I believe they call the Defense Ministry treasonous, or accusing them of treason for failing to provide significant ammunition and weaponry. Do we 
 
 have any sense of the where the mission or the ammunition that they're now providing is coming from?
 
PLEITGEN: Well, actually, it's on the way now from the Defense Ministry, but you're absolutely right. It's a big public spat. It's really one that's 
 
 been going on for an extended period of time. This is between the Wagner private military company and its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin and essentially 
 
 the leadership of Russia's Defense Ministry.
 
There's been back and forth between them going on the entire time. Essentially, the Yevgeny Prigozhin is will has been trying to portray that 
 
 he's really the one who's effectively fighting for Vladimir Putin, fighting for Russia, especially around the town of Bakhmut. But of course, uses some 
 
 pretty brutal tactics.
 
They're using people recruited from Russian jails to charge Ukrainian positions. But he's essentially had for a very long time been saying that 
 
 he's the one who is really effective on the battlefield. So essentially, what he's saying now, or what he was saying that there was no more 
 
 ammunition coming from Russia's Defense Ministry.
 
And so therefore, his troops were starved of ammunition and that's why a lot of them were dying on the battlefield. He circulated a really gruesome 
 
 photo of corpses of Wagner fighters, alleged Wagner fighters lying on the snow covered ground allegedly outside of Bakhmut.
 
The Russian Defense Ministry by the way refuted those allegations. They said that look, there had been gains made around Bakhmut there were assault 
 
 groups working there. And so therefore saying that there was no ammunition available simply was not true.
 
As of this morning, Yevgeny Prigozhin has come out and said he believes that the issue has been solved that a train with ammunition seemed to have 
 
 pulled out of a depot. He said none of that is there yet there seems as though right now. They're sort of trying to downplay that back and forth 
 
 that was going on.
 
But this is an ongoing spat that has been going on for a very, very long time between the Russian Defense Ministry and the Wagner private military 
 
 company and the I was on the ground near Bakhmut just a couple of weeks ago.
 
Julia, you could really see it play out there where all of a sudden both sides both the Russian Defense Ministry and Wagner were claiming that they 
 
 were the ones who were on the offensive and charging Bakhmut. Obviously trying to take that place they had hoped before the anniversary clearly 
 
 that didn't work out though, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, Fred Pleitgen there, thank you so much for your context and insight vital to open it enabling us to understand this. Fred thank 
 
 you! OK, airstrikes by Israel today to targeting what it says was a weapon manufacturing sites in Gaza operated by Hamas militants.
 
Earlier six rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel. The strikes come after the Israeli Military carried out a raid in the West Bank on 
 
 Wednesday. Israel says it was targeting Palestinian militants in Nablus. Palestinian Authorities say at least 11 people were killed and nearly 500 
 
 others were wounded.
 
Hadas Gold joins us now from Jerusalem. Hadas, this is exactly what you predicted on the show yesterday, you were expecting more activity. What are 
 
 the Authorities saying about these latest offensives? And what's your sense on what we're seeing here?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we did expect some sort of response from militants in Gaza. And that's because several of 
 
 those killed in that military operation in Nablus in the occupied West Bank, war members of Hamas and also two commanders of Islamic Jihad, the 
 
 two main militant groups in Gaza. So it was only essentially a matter of time before they responded in some way.
 <br>[09:10:00]
 
GOLD: Although I do have to say it, at least for now, didn't spiral into something even bigger could have easily it spiraled into something much 
 
 larger. Six rockets fired most of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome. One fell in open areas and then is all responded with airstrikes targeting 
 
 what it says was a weapons manufacturing site.
 
And we have no injuries reported on either side. So it's still much of the attention here is on Nablus and on the aftermath of what we saw in Nablus 
 
 yesterday, which just the sheer numbers that we saw coming out of that Israeli military operation, a very rare one mid-days. Witnesses said it 
 
 started around 10 am.
 
This is a time when the old city which is a very compact area full of like narrow alleyways and compact houses was full. People were at the market, 
 
 people were milling about and then there was this raid that started off. We have more than 10 killed and 500 injuries according to Palestinian health 
 
 officials, 100 of them from live ammunition.
 
Julia, these are numbers that many here have said they haven't seen since the days of the Second Intifada, just to give you a sense of the scale of 
 
 just the number of people who were involved. And when we're looking at images that we're seeing from the aftermath and also footage from when this 
 
 raid took place.
 
You can just see the amount of people right there that were out on the street, getting involved the Israeli Military saying that they went after 
 
 militants that they blame partly for both the shooting death of an Israeli soldier a few months ago. But also they say that we're about to carry out 
 
 imminent attacks.
 
They say that they came under heavy fire not only from the house where the militants were housed, but also from people around the streets. But clearly 
 
 the injuries I mean, when you just look at the numbers, obviously we do know that militant groups have claimed some of those killed as their 
 
 members but there are definitely bystander's civilians who were caught up in this as well.
 
And we're hearing reports of some at least two elderly people who were killed as well as 16-year-old who was killed. And just the sheer number of 
 
 injuries, the Head of the Red Crescent Society at Nablus, saying that the bullets were everywhere and then even the Israeli military, their 
 
 spokesperson acknowledging that it was a messy situation.
 
People there still so many injured getting treatments. We do know that after those rockets were fired overnight, the U.N. mid-east envoy Tor 
 
 Wennesland went to Gaza ostensibly to speak with militant leaders there trying to keep some sort of sense of calm. We understand he was there for a 
 
 short amount of time, and then left.
 
And then Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister in a statement before a meeting just in the last few hours or so, essentially saying that 
 
 the people that the IDF went after shot and murdered, he said an Israeli soldier and that they were about to carry out additional attacks.
 
He's saying that they will the Israel will always settle accounts with those who tried to attack Israeli civilians and the idea but of course, a 
 
 lot of concerns right now about where we go from here. Most of the Palestinian territories are on strike today, there is very much a sense of 
 
 tension in the air as the Israeli authorities are prepared for even potentially.
 
A further response from Gaza are also what their Israeli Police are being are preparing for potentially attacks against Israelis. Keep in mind just a 
 
 few weeks ago, after a raid in Jenin that also killed 10 Palestinians. Just the next day, the next night was that shooting outside of a synagogue in 
 
 Northeast Jerusalem?
 
So people are sort of getting ready for anything here and then I always mentioned this, but you got to look at the calendar, what's coming in the 
 
 next few weeks Ramadan and then pass over. So there is no sense the calendar is not helping any sort of sense of calm here a lot of worries 
 
 about what could come next, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, we'll continue to watch it very closely. Hadas Gold thank you for that! OK, straight ahead here on "First Move", the most loyal 
 
 workforce you've ever seen. Chobani CEO says employing refugees is the right thing to do, but it also is the best thing to do for your business 
 
 too.
 
We'll talk about his latest efforts and later, a CNN exclusive Malala Yousafzai on her fight to empower women and young girls with a better 
 
 education and news of a major donation to her fund. Stay with CNN, that's all coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[09:15:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move", more than two weeks since a massive earthquake struck Turkey and Syria and there continues to be 
 
 desperate need for more tents and temporary housing. Nearly 900,000 people in Turkey are living in camps like the one you see before you after losing 
 
 their homes.
 
On Wednesday the death toll passed 49,000 across both nations. Nada Bashir joins us now. Nada, under the desperate requirement for shelter requiring 
 
 some novel solutions just explain where you are?
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Novel solutions indeed, Julia, I mean we are on a ship at the port of Iskenderun. This is - it was among the hardest hit 
 
 areas following that earthquake two weeks ago and indeed to get off an aftershock on Monday. And this ship is now housing more than 1000 people 
 
 have been displaced as a result of that earthquake.
 
Their homes either completely destroyed or damaged or going to simply to unsafe to return I just show you behind me many of those people here right 
 
 now are people that have been displaced. They've been put up in this cruise ship. There are 400 cabins onboard this ship housing people.
 
And this is one of the ways in which volunteers here are trying to help them with the authority. They're trying to help those who have lost 
 
 absolutely everything. You mentioned that figure variable, the 900,000 people currently living in tents and we've seen these tents. Cities now 
 
 scattered around Iskenderun in parts of Antakya, they are across Southeast Turkey.
 
And this is of course, some more robust way of providing support to those made home as they each have their own cabins, there are activities for the 
 
 children, regular meals, as well as medical support on board. But of course, this isn't a reality for the vast majority of people who have been 
 
 displaced.
 
We're in fact at a camp just a little, just a few hours ago, just nearby here and the majority of the people out their camp work. Syrians people who 
 
 have been displaced already, by the conflict now displaced once again, as a result of this earthquake many of the families that we spoke to there has 
 
 said that they've been waiting for more than two weeks to be offered a 10 layoff.
 
They are still sleeping on the streets and at nighttime, it is particularly cold, many of them with young children. So this is quite a novel way of 
 
 providing support for people. And this is one of two shifts currently in this area providing that support providing that shelter for people 
 
 displaced.
 
This isn't a reality for so many who are currently living in IDP camps across Southeast Turkey and of course, for many who are now homeless. And 
 
 there has been some backlash against the government calls for them to do more. The government says they are sending 6000 more tents to the affected 
 
 areas.
 
They've said that, you know, they consider this is an issue they are working on it. This is a catastrophe that they have never faced before at 
 
 this scale. But look, the reality is people here are frustrated, some are angry and there is real pressure mounting on the government now to take 
 
 further action to provide that support for those most in need, Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, and such signs of resilience too. You know, as you began speaking, there was a young man over your right shoulder who gave us a 
 
 thumbs up and a big smile in a red sweater if you go and find him. So our thoughts with him and all those of course impacted too. Nada thank you. 
 
 Nada Bashir there from Turkey!
 <br>[09:20:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Now as Turkey grapples with a mounting refugee crisis, the number of people fleeing Ukraine to neighboring nations has been exceeded 8 
 
 million people according to the United Nations. And someone who understands the importance of helping these people will live their lives is our next 
 
 guest the Turkish born immigrant who founded Chobani, a multimillion dollar food company where at one stage, around a third of the workforce were 
 
 either immigrants or refugees.
 
Hamdi Ulukaya is the CEO and he's also the Founder of the tent partnership for refugees. That's a global business network of now over 300 firms who 
 
 have committed to hire, train and support refugees in the workplace. And tonight tent who see vigil for Ukrainian refugees in London's Trafalgar 
 
 Square, where the actress Helen Mirren is expected to appear among many others.
 
And Hamdi Ulukaya is also offering assistance to victims of the Turkey- Syria earthquake, and he joins us now. Hamdi, it's always a pleasure to have you on the show. I remember the last time you and me are just been to 
 
 Ukraine and fast forward a year later. Talk to us about the importance of this spiritual but also the importance of the contribution that these 
 
 displaced people and refugees can make to their new societies.
 
HAMDI ULUKAYA, FOUNDER OF THE TENT PARTNERSHIP FOR REFUGEES: So good to be with you again, Julia, as you said, last time we spoke, I was just visiting 
 
 the border. And it's been a long, long year. But it's been a year and the difference between a year ago and now. And we know you know some of the 
 
 unknown, we know. But we didn't know back then, is how long this is going to last, right?
 
So what I was impressed when I was at the border, is how governments, European governments, how individual citizens, and most importantly, how 
 
 companies were right there at the gate at the border and participating helping people. I think there's so many things that we can be proud of.
 
But one of the things that I am so proud is the act of businesses, how they come together and help their employees, their customers, their consumers 
 
 but most importantly, humanity. Today, as you said, we have close to 6 million people still, you know, outside of Ukraine as refugees, and they're 
 
 in communities, we are hearing U.K., they are in Germany, they are in Poland, they are in France, they're all over the Europe.
 
And as we look at the second year is the most important thing that we can do today is make sure that Ukrainians mostly women and children, who are 
 
 away from their home. So they can stand on their own feet and provide for their families as this world goes on.
 
CHATTERLEY: You've also created a film. Hamdi, talk to us about this, it's a 62nd film to highlight female artists because it goes to the heart of 
 
 what you were saying there about. I think around 90 percent of the displaced people are refugees from Ukraine are women and children.
 
And they can also be a crucial beneficial part to work, places, but also societies wherever they are in the world. And even when they you know yet 
 
 to return to their home nations. They should also be hired and utilized.
 
ULUKAYA: So true and that short film is also made by a Ukrainian creative, amazing woman. You know, all refugees, including Ukrainians. What you see, 
 
 you know, always is they're ready to participate, the resilience that they have, and the trouble that they have gone through does not bring so much 
 
 you know with them.
 
And I have seen it in my own experience at Chobani. And later on when I started tent, and I often hear from my CEO, friends and the companies and 
 
 the colleagues is the minute they start working, that's the minute they stop being a refugee, that's the minute they stand on their own feet.
 
And being idle and away from society or community or in the companies is not something is a benefit to anyone. So the smartest thing we can do not 
 
 just help the refugees of course, when they have an access to work immediately helps them to provide them - for their families, but the minute 
 
 they participate in job they also participate the community and society in a very, very high level.
 
So these women highly educated numerous amounts of skills. But most importantly, as I said before, Julia, is this common in all refugees is the 
 
 willingness and to participate and do their best and what you see and when you remove certain hurdles in the beginning, like language should come in 
 
 is maybe transportation, the simple things that you can think of those are short time investment that we can make to remove those obstacles.
 <br>[09:25:00]
 
ULUKAYA: But what we see in a very short time after, they shine and brings enormous amount of energy to the company and community.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, that's how you originally built your business and your story in this regard is so much so important. And I know this is also 
 
 a rallying cry to European companies that are already stepping up but for more to hire these individuals and get them in the workplace.
 
And it was actually the message; the strongest message of our last conversation was what you just said there that you don't stop being a 
 
 refugee simply because you move to a safer place. It's when you have stability of a job and being able to take care of your family that 
 
 something changes, which I think is vitally important.
 
But there is a business reason here too. I mean, your survey data shows this that consumers want to buy from businesses that are not just providing 
 
 money in terms of charity, but they are also being practical about this and hiring people like this, and really helping them rebuild their lives.
 
ULUKAYA: And we just announced that that survey all across to Europe, including America, and here in U.K., consumers do want companies to 
 
 participate and hire displaced people and refugees. And what happens is also the people who work for these companies, when a company open, you 
 
 know, program for employees to participate.
 
I often hear always, that one of the most popular program is when they have, you know, employee training, refugee hiring, or some kind of, you 
 
 know, mentorship, a skill upgrading in internal work for long time, is one of the most popular programs within the companies is the work that they do 
 
 for refugees.
 
So you have consumer highly interested and absolutely support and you have internal employee's population of these companies highly engaged and 
 
 supporting. And there's a, you know, an endless amount of business case to make it here when it comes to return on these investments and how we help 
 
 the company's culture, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit and often we hear these.
 
And again, the unknown is in the beginning of little bit of obstacles, simple things like languages and transportation, like mentioned, can be 
 
 removed very, very quickly. So from any dimension that you look for is it is good for refugees, it's good for business, it's good for the community, 
 
 but we didn't know a year ago how long this war was going to last and here we are.
 
And I think the people and the companies and the governments have done so much. And one of the best responses we've ever seen, and we have so much to 
 
 be thankful of, but this might last longer. And we have to be united for the Ukrainian people and say, we were here all year.
 
And we're going to continue to be here for you, and support you going as long as it will take. And I think the visual tonight, this evening is going 
 
 to be a representation of that is saying, we are all here for you, Ukraine and hold all the Ukrainian refugees.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, we want them to be able to go home as soon as possible. But for now, you're welcome in whichever society you've ended up in, and 
 
 we're going to help you participate. And you have about a minute left. But I do want to very briefly talk about the support you've provided to Turkey 
 
 as well. I believe it's now $2 million in donation.
 
It's clearly very personal for you, you were born there. But you also in the city that you were born in experienced an earthquake, I believe back in 
 
 1992. So you saw the devastation, explain the importance of support for Turkish people too and Syrians.
 
ULUKAYA: I'm far away my heart is there with people in the Southeastern region of Turkey. I'm from the Northeast, you know, the people of Turkey 
 
 have lived through earthquakes, you know, periods of times. The early days are extremely important from relief efforts. You know, providing food 
 
 shelters, and the earth is still shaking.
 
And, and I'm still connected everyday with the region. I think what we need right now is those urgent needs. And I try to do my best and I reach out to 
 
 a lot of businesses and my CEO friends and companies. I'm so proud how much have been done and continue to be done.
 
And individual citizens right from all across the world and U.S. participate and I think one of the most important works, Julia, as we 
 
 talked about refugees, the same is rebuilding it. You know, Turkish people are very resilient. You know, the amazing gather ness is happening within 
 
 the country, between government and NGOs, international communities.
 <br>[09:30:00]
 
ULUKAYA: You know, these are the times you know, in Turkish we say, your friends show your true face in the dark days and we see a lot of friends 
 
 and other people, friends of Turkey are showing up not only the relief efforts but I am very certain in weeks and months to come continue to be 
 
 with people and rebuilding their lives.
 
CHATTERLEY: Your friends show their true face in dark days. We prefer greater light and more support. Hamdi, always a pleasure! Thank you so 
 
 much, the CEO of Chobani and Founder of the Tent Partnership for Refugees. Thank you. We're back after this, stay with "First Move".
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move". Presidential candidates in Nigeria making their final pitches ahead of Saturday's election in Africa's 
 
 largest economy the crucial voting comes as the country faces a number of challenges including inflation, high unemployment and people looking 
 
 outside of Nigeria for more opportunity.
 
Larry Madowo joins us now from Lagos. Larry, great to have you on the show! Clearly much at stake in this election and not the usual candidate list for 
 
 this election either.
 
LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's not the usual and also for the first time it's a three-horse race so there is no one clear favorite to win this 
 
 election anyone of the three men whose favorite to be in the top the incumbent party's candidate, Bola Tinubu.
 
Or the opposition candidate, Atiku Abubakar from the PDP who's running for the sixth time or the third fourth candidate in this case, Labour Party's 
 
 Peter Obi, who's very fond, who's very popular among the youth, any one of them could be the winner of this presidential election on Saturday.
 
And, in fact, the third time that there could be a runoff in Nigeria for the first time since the return to multiparty democracy in 1999 we've been 
 
 talking to people around the streets and they tell us insane corruption and the economy are the top issues for them go into this election, even though 
 
 a lot of elections in this country determined by ethnicity and religion.
 
But one of the major problems across the city is what it's called --. It's an exodus out of the country to North America to Europe for many who can. 
 
 They're getting jobs in the NHS in Canada and broke into those who can leave are leaving.
 <br>[09:35:00]
 
MADOWO: And one of the worst effects of sectors, the health sector where you see doctors, medical professionals, pharmacists, nurses, nurses all 
 
 drooping out of the country. For instance, the Nigerian Medical Association says they lose about 50 Doctors every week, Julia. I want to; I want you to 
 
 listen to one official from the health sector here.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. KEMI ABILOYE, PRESIDENT, LAGOS ASSOCIATION OF RESIDENT DOCTORS: If nothing is done to reduce the rate at which people, doctors, medical 
 
 professionals, health care workers are leaving the shores of this country, it's just a matter of the years. I'm not sure whether any doctor will be 
 
 left in this country.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MADOWO: So, some of those who are leaving are well educated, they have decent jobs. But there's a saying here in Nigeria that Nigeria will happen 
 
 to you, which means that all your money cannot insulate you from some of the systemic challenges that happen all the time. And the best bet for you 
 
 is to go somewhere else safer and more predictable Julia.
 
CHATTERLEY: Wow that is a mind-blowing statistic, 50 doctors a week. Wow. Larry, great to have you with us! As always, thank you. All right still to 
 
 come here on "First Move", a partnership to improve access to education for girls all around the world an exclusive interview with Nobel Peace Prize 
 
 Laureate Malala Yousafzai and Airbnb Co-Founder Joe Gebbia on leading the charge for a more equal world.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move" and the fight to improve access to education especially for young women around the world. On the forefront of 
 
 this battle is activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. If you remember back in 2012, Malala was targeted by the Taliban after 
 
 speaking out about women's right to learn.
 
After surviving and thriving following a devastating attack, she created Malala Fund with her father to advocate for girls that face the greatest 
 
 challenges in accessing basic education. The organization works in 10 countries including countries like Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan, and 
 
 so far, has invested $28 million, but of course more work needs to be done.
 
And the World Economic Forum notes we are still 100 years away from education for all girls. Now back in 2016 Malala and Airbnb Co-Founder Joe 
 
 Gebbia traveled to Kenya and Rwanda alongside the Malala Fund to work on girl's education in refugee camps. That trip began a multi-year partnership 
 
 between the two.
 <br>[09:40:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: And now Joe Gebbia has announced a $25 million donation to the fund its largest donation to date. Joining us now for an exclusive 
 
 interview with Malala Yousafzai, Co-Founder and Board Chair of Malala Fund, Andrew Jebi, Co-Founder of Airbnb, who's also a member of the Malala Fund 
 
 Leadership Council both Malala Joe, welcome.
 
I sent you in the break. I'm awestruck. And I truly am. Thank you for joining us on the show. Malala you're an inspiration. Joe, this is an 
 
 inspirational personal donation. Let me begin with you; just explain why you're making this donation to this fund, and why you're doing it now?
 
JOE GEBBIA, CO-FOUNDER, AIRBNB: Well, thanks, Julie, it's great to be with you both. I first met Malala back in 2015, at the screening of her 
 
 documentary in San Francisco, and I was completely enamored both by her and her organization, and her mission to make sure every girl has access to 12 
 
 years of free, safe and quality education.
 
And the more game came to know them all the fun, the more the scale of the problem started to become clear. Imagine 130 million girls around the world 
 
 without access to education. I want to invest more time to understand the problems. So, we did traveled Africa together back in 2016. I joined the 
 
 Leadership Council even had team members at Airbnb who volunteered to redesign the website from Malala Fund @malala.org.
 
CHATTERLEY: I've seen you mentioned that statistic before, by the way, and I think you called it outdated, which I think is a polite term and a 
 
 diplomatic term for it, which is the crucial part of the fight and the efforts that you're both making.
 
Malala, I think most people watching this will remember will know your story, will understand why this fight is so personal to you. Thank you for 
 
 the work that you're doing first and foremost, but just explain how important this donation is and what the money is going to go towards.
 
MALALA YOUSAFZAI, CO-FOUNDER AND BOARD CHAIR, MALALA FUND: First of all, I am just so grateful for this opportunity that Joe has given to Malala Fund; 
 
 I cannot tell you how excited I was when I received the call from Joe. And he asked me about the vision of Malala Fund. And I said I like we need to 
 
 do more for girls, there are still more than 100 million girls who do not have access to education.
 
Girls are not learning quality education in their schools; girls are missing on the opportunity. But it's not just a loss for girls; it's a loss 
 
 for the world. It's an economic loss. It's a political and social loss as well. So, I was sharing all of my ambitious plans, and Joe said, you know, 
 
 I will support you. And when I heard about his generous contribution to Malala Fund, I was just so grateful.
 
And when you hear about the support of people, it helps you to believe even more in the mission that you fight for. We have been fighting for girl's 
 
 education, through Malala Fund for the past 10 years. And to know that Joe has been with us consistently from the very beginning has helped us do so 
 
 much work already. And it will - his support will help us to do the work for many years ahead.
 
Our goal is to ensure that we create a world where all girls can learn and lead where they have access to 12 years of free quality and safe education. 
 
 I was one of those, those who could not go to school. So I know how important it is for every girl, even that one last girl to have access to 
 
 education.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, it's going to help you virtually double the amount that you've invested just to give people again, a reminder of the scale of 
 
 the investment that we're talking about. Joe, as you said, this is not just a one off as enormous. I think mind blowing is the term I would use.
 
And I think we're hearing that from Malala in the excitement that she's expressing with what she's going to be able to do and what the fund is 
 
 going to be able to do with this money. But why join the Leadership Council, just explain that decision, because this is multi years that we're 
 
 talking about of working together. Just finding innovative ways I think of helping women, young girls access education that as Malala quite rightly 
 
 said, and it's an economic benefit to all to society to allow this to take place.
 
GEBBIA: That's right, Julia. Along the way, I had a big aha moment, which was that educating girls has a massive ripple effect on other global 
 
 topics. If you care about economic development, you should get involved. If you care about climate change, you should get involved. If you care about 
 
 extreme poverty, you should get involved.
 
Education equality is one of the most powerful ways to address these global topics. And so, if you invest in girl's education, you're actually 
 
 investing in a better planet for all of us, which is why I decided to step up my efforts here.
 
CHATTERLEY: It's fantastic. Malala, talk to me about some specific examples if you can because I was looking on your website and we can show this of 
 
 what was going on in the different countries.
 <br>[09:45:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: I mean, I saw the work obviously, that you're doing in Afghanistan, the statistics there, I think now 3.7 million people out of 
 
 school 60 percent of those are girls. And obviously that's, that's worsening Lebanon; I believe a third of girls at school in Lebanon now are 
 
 Syrian refugees. I mean the need, the requirements, the investment that is required at this moment sort of overwhelming. Talk about specific projects.
 
YOUSAFZAI: So, the situation for girl's education is alarming because there are human made disasters that we have faced, including the wars and 
 
 conflicts. And then there are, you know, other natural disasters, or still, you know, climate related disasters that are impacting, including the 
 
 recent floods in Pakistan, or the current situation in Afghanistan, where girl's education is completely banned.
 
Girls don't have access to secondary schools or universities, women cannot do jobs. The situation is alarming in many parts of the world. And we have 
 
 been taught this idea of progress being linear, and that it will happen with time. But what we are witnessing right now is that we not only need to 
 
 achieve these, these moments of progress, but we need to maintain them.
 
We are just - we are living in a very vulnerable society, we do not know for when our rights can be taken away from us, when laws can change and 
 
 when the situation can, you know when we are moving towards an unequal society. So, for me, it's just even more critical right now to ensure that 
 
 we are investing in girl's education through Malala Fund.
 
We work with local education activists in the countries that you mentioned, including Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia. They are the people who are 
 
 doing the research, they are doing advocacy, change policies, they are engaging with the local communities, parents, teachers, religious leaders, 
 
 community leaders, to advocate for girls access to education.
 
We are working directly with girls as well; we have a platform called assembly, which is a digital newsletter through which girls are sharing 
 
 their stories of how they are addressing the problems that they're facing. They're not just talking about the problems, but how they're becoming the 
 
 change makers and fighting them, including climate change, or mental health or the quality of education in school, or the discrimination that they face 
 
 or the racism that they face.
 
So we believe in girls being the activist who can, you know, who need to be heard. And we help girls to be present at the platforms where decisions 
 
 about their future are made, including the UN or, or the climate conferences, like these are the girls whose future is directly impacted by 
 
 the decisions that leaders made.
 
When they are not present in the rooms, their voices are not heard; the issues that they face are not taken into consideration. So, our priority is 
 
 to ensure that girls get the opportunity to raise their voice, and then they need to be heard in the key rooms as well. And access to education for 
 
 girls is the human right. But it's also an economic opportunity as well. And for so many reasons this has to be a priority for everyone.
 
CHATTERLEY: You know, you said something really important, which was some of the crisis that we see around the world is as a result of just 
 
 devastating accidents, things like earthquakes that we've seen. But some of them are human made tragedies war, for example.
 
And what we've seen and, on your website, where you talk about your history and your background, one of the things that you say is, it's not just about 
 
 allowing girls to learn, it's also about allowing them to lead.
 
And I think when you look at the leadership around the world, the importance of getting women to a standard where they are educated enough to 
 
 lead nations and perhaps make better decisions is also vital. Malala would you agree? We need more female leadership around the world.
 
YOUSAFZAI: No doubt, I, 100 percent support female leadership and I support education because education creates access for women to so many 
 
 opportunities that they may not have, especially in patriarchal societies, in challenging environments, so education becomes like a beacon of hope for 
 
 them. And that's the only light that they see.
 
Think about the girls in Afghanistan right now, who do not have access to secondary education. They do not see a future for themselves and they are 
 
 fighting every day for the right to education. They are protesting on the streets. They are there globally as well. Those who have succeeded in the 
 
 evacuation, they are raising their voices.
 
So, when you look at their dedication, it tells you that they do not take education for granted. Education is future for them. And I often tell 
 
 people that if you are ever in doubt about the importance of education, go ask a girl.
 <br>[09:50:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: Go ask a girl, anything quite frankly, Joe, I have to bring you in on this point, I have about 30 seconds left. I think the importance of 
 
 the gift that you've provided and the importance of female education and leadership, you've already said it really the beneficial aspects. But would 
 
 you agree more female leadership perhaps around the world, and we may be in a better place?
 
GEBBIA: I think Malala said it perfectly. You know, education, education is a right. It's fundamental right for boys and for girls. And there are many, 
 
 many girls around the world who don't have that right, right now. And Malala, I think it'd be great if he shared that statistic of the 
 
 opportunity cost of not doing this economically.
 
YOUSAFZAI: If all girls receive 12 years of free quality in education, it would add up to $30 trillion to the world economy, there is the economic 
 
 benefit. And you know, I think Joe and I would - on this, like with all the benefits, you know, it's a human right, it's the right of a child to have 
 
 access to learning, they should be able to read and write and access knowledge, they should be able to achieve their goals in their life.
 
So we need to respect this right. And we need to give it to them. It's our responsibility. It's the leader's responsibility. And I hope that people 
 
 will do more for it. It is a collective, complex issue. And it's important that we all play a role in our record that leaders become more ambitious. 
 
 And they make it their top priority.
 
CHATTERLEY: Yes. And more female, it's a conversation that we shouldn't have to be having. But we will and Wow-zers a $30 trillion opportunity. If 
 
 that doesn't smack these people around the head to understand the importance of doing this, I didn't think anything well. Huge heart to you 
 
 both thank you so much for the work for the personal donation, Joe.
 
YOUSAFZAI: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: I look forward to speaking to you soon and hearing about more progress and how you're putting this money to work. Thank you both really, 
 
 truly honored to talk to you.
 
GEBBIA: Thank you.
 
CHATTERLEY: Thank you, Malala and Joe there, we're back after this.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to "First Move". New criminal charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried have been filed. U.S. prosecutors have just 
 
 announced four additional criminal charges including conspiracy to commit bank fraud and securities fraud.
 
In December he was charged in an eight-count indictment. Bankman-Fried who was released on a $250 million bond has pleaded not guilty to the charges 
 
 announced back in December. And let me give you a quick look at what we're seeing for stock markets at this moment.
 
In the United States trading higher in early part of the session, the S&amp;P 500 trying to break a four-session losing streak, so far this week amid 
 
 higher interest rate concerns. Chip giant Nvidia helping turn things around to with better-than-expected earnings. It's predicting strong AI related 
 
 chip demand too.
 <br>[09:55:00]
 
CHATTERLEY: And finally, all we can say about this next story is oh boy, take a look at this, large metallic orb that is washed up on a Japanese 
 
 beach. The unidentified definitely not flying object has been nicknamed Godzilla's egg, how about that. And Dragon Ball, the bomb squad fortunately 
 
 says its harmless.
 
It's probably some kind of boy get it for boats that get loose. Authority say one thing it is surely not is a Chinese surveillance device. Naughty, 
 
 yes, that's it for the show. If you've missed any of our interviews today, they will be on my Twitter and Instagram pages. You can search for
