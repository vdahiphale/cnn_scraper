ANDY SCHOLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They were booing in Chicago. The Nuggets would end up, actually, winning that game, 114-106. But Kasie, Jokic joked after the game, a good thing this game was actually not in Serbia, because all of the Serbian fans may have handled it a little differently if that was the case. 
 <br>[06:00:17]
 
KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR: Yikes. Yes. OK. 
 
Andy, thank you very much for all that. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 
Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I'm Kasie Hunt. Don't go anywhere. CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.

GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm the only one running that can beat Trump. The Trump administration under Trump, Donald Trump. 
 
Trump said at the time they would do that. 
 
Trump -- Donald Trump. 
 
Donald Trump. 
 
Donald Trump. So he's -- when he gets off the teleprompter now, you don't know what he's going to say. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: So a whole lot of Trumps from Ron DeSantis. 
 
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: He knows he's the No. 1 competitor right now, the front-runner. 
 
HARLOW: Do you think? Ron DeSantis goes after -- you guessed it -- Donald Trump. Why the Florida governor showed new urgency in attacking the Republican frontrunner after months of pulling his punches. 
 
MATTINGLY: Plus, President Biden says Israel is starting to lose international support over its, quote, "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza. How the Israeli prime minister is reacting this morning as we learn the IDF has started flooding some Hamas tunnels. 
 
And breaking overnight, it's a done deal. Nearly 200 countries sign on to an historic climate deal to move away from fossil fuels. Hear what happens next. 
 
CNN THIS MORNING starts right now. 
 
HARLOW: Here's where we begin. Witnessing a very tenuous moment in the history of U.S./Israel relations. 
 
The public rift over the war in Gaza is growing, with President Biden delivering his sharpest public criticism yet of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hardline right government. 
 
Biden told donors at a fund-raiser that Israel is losing international support because of the indiscriminate bombings. More than 18,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. 
 
MATTINGLY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now openly admitting he has disagreements with Biden over what should be done with the Gaza Strip once the war is over and, as Israel wants, Hamas is wiped out. 
 
Several of Americans' closest allies broke with the United States at the United Nations General Assembly in a vote that overwhelmingly demanded an immediate ceasefire. 
 
Canada, Australia and Japan were among the 153 nations to vote yes after previously abstaining. 
 
HARLOW: Meanwhile, in Gaza, the Israeli military suffered one of its biggest losses yet in their ground offensive. At least nine Israeli soldiers, including a commander, killed in a single incident in Northern Gaza. 
 
And this now is a firsthand look at how intense the urban combat has been in the Gaza Strip. This is new video released by the Israeli military, and it was released this morning. And it is troops sprinting to the ruins as gunfire rings out. 
 
Let's begin with Alex Marquardt. He joins us in Tel Aviv. Let's begin on that news of the nine IDF soldiers who were killed. Is that an indication that this battle is more challenging or at least different than what was expected? 
 
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Poppy and Phil, I really think it's an indication of how there are still these Hamas and other militant strongholds in the North, of how fierce the fighting really  is in the Northern part of the Gaza Strip as the IDF tries to focus and move into the South. But they still haven't secured the North. And so we saw one of the deadliest days for the IDF since this war
 
 began back on October 7th. There were actually ten soldiers killed on Tuesday. One was by himself and then nine, as you mentioned, in that single incident. 
 
Those nine were from the famed Golani Brigade. One of the nine was a young battalion commander who was a lieutenant colonel. 
 
So this brings the IDF death toll to 115. And, Phil and Poppy, there have been some fairly notable deaths among those 115, including the son and the nephew of a current minister who is -- who used to run -- who used to be the top general in the IDF. 
 
In terms of a bit more context, the IDF says that they have killed some 7,000 militants overall, but, as you noted, Poppy, at the top of the show, the staggering death toll in Gaza continues to grow, the Hamas-controlled health ministry saying some 18,400 Palestinians have now been killed in Gaza. 
 
MATTINGLY: Alex, for weeks you and our security team have been reporting the behind-the-scenes differences between U.S. officials and Israeli officials. Those differences now spilling very much into public view. 
 
Candid assessments from President Biden, Prime minister Netanyahu firing back a little bit on his position. The question right now is, given Israel's reliance on the U.S. on just about all fronts of this war, how does this impact the war? 
 <br>[06:05:03]
 
MARQUARDT: Well, Phil, you're still seeing the Biden administration's full-throated support for what they call Israel's right to defend itself. But you are -- really are hearing growing discomfort from Biden and his top officials about how Israel is prosecuting this war, how they're carrying out this war in Gaza.
 
And Netanyahu, who's also admitting that there are disagreements with the U.S. So you have these very pointed comments. I would say some of the starkest yet from President Biden yesterday to donors, in which he said that Prime Minister Netanyahu needs to change, insinuating he needs to change tactics.
 
But it's difficult, he said, because of the far-right government that -- that he is in control of. 
 
He also went on to say that Israel is losing this international support because of what he called the indiscriminate bombing campaign in Gaza. 
 
At the same time Netanyahu, while thanking the U.S. for their support, said that there are disagreements with the Biden administration over the question of governance for Palestinians, who and how Palestinians are going to be governed both in Gaza and -- and the West Bank going forward. But I think it's really interesting to see the U.S. becoming
 
 increasingly isolated on the international stage. They really are, we saw the U.N. Security Council last week, now the only ones rejecting the calls for an immediate ceasefire.
 
And now you have this growing list of very close U.S. allies who are calling for a ceasefire while the U.S. continues to reject that -- Phil, Poppy.
 
HARLOW: Just very quickly, Alex, what the U.S. has said is that we want language directly in these U.N. resolutions condemning Hamas, but is it clear that, if that was in there, the U.S. would sign it? 
 
MARQUARDT: No, it's certainly not clear, but you're absolutely right that that is the excuse, essentially, that they're making for rejecting this that is cause for a ceasefire. 
 
What the U.S. is saying is essentially what we're hearing from Israel, is that -- that Hamas needs to be eradicated, that their infrastructure and their fighters and leadership need to be taken out, and that that is not done yet. 
 
And so Biden and his officials say we will continue to support both politically and militarily until that mission has been completed. 
 
What is not clear, however, what exactly that means. What does eradicating and getting rid of Hamas actually look like? 
 
MATTINGLY: Alex Marquardt for us in Tel Aviv, thank you. 
 
HARLOW: So this morning, some negotiators report progress is being made on a deal that would include border security and then aid to Ukraine and Israel.
 
But this is far from a done deal. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he was in Washington for an in-person plea for President Biden and congressional leaders yesterday. Some Republicans seemed unmoved by the visit, and Biden seemed to acknowledge the current climate in Congress. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The American people can be and should be incredibly proud of the part they've played in supporting Ukraine's success. We'll continue to supply Ukraine with critical weapons and equipment as long as we can. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: "As long as we can," not "as long as it takes," which is what he was saying before, and that is a big difference. 
 
MATTINGLY: As it currently stands, overnight the mayor of Kyiv says at least 34 people were injured this morning in what's being called a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian capital, most of the injuries coming from falling glass and from blown-out windows triggered by the blast. We'll keep you updated on the talks as they continue. 
 
Well, also this morning, Ron DeSantis changing his tactics and his tone on the campaign trail and throwing just about everything at Teflon Donald Trump to see if it will stick. 
 
At CNN's town hall in Iowa, DeSantis turned questions about issues into a straight rebuke of Trump. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DESANTIS: Donald Trump, so he's -- when he gets off the teleprompter now, you don't know what he's going to say. 
 
Donald Trump has refused to debate throughout this campaign. 
 
When Donald Trump ran in '16, that he was going to repeal and replace Obama care. 
 
I'm the only one running that can beat Trump one-on-one. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HARLOW: But the newest poll shows this. Trump with a 32-point lead over DeSantis in Iowa, where the caucuses will happen almost exactly a month from today. 
 
Congressional correspondent Jessica Dean joins us again this morning in Des Moines at Grand View University. Quite a night. Quite a night, quite a tone change from Ron DeSantis on a number of fronts. I thought it was really interesting. What's your read? 
 
JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Poppy and Phil. 
 
Look, when I was talking to people close to the campaign, they were very excited for him to have this opportunity to talk directly to Iowan voters. This has been their message. This has been their strategy, to go all in on Iowa. 
 
So they really saw this as a big platform at a time when a lot of people are tuning in. 
 
And what we heard, to Poppy's point, from the Florida governor was a much more direct attack on the front-runner, former President Donald Trump. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DESANTIS: Thank you. 
 
DEAN (voice-over): Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis answering questions from Iowa voters and taking aim at the GOP front- runner. 
 
DESANTIS: Donald Trump, so he's -- when he gets off the teleprompter now, you don't know what he's going to say. I went to the rallies with Donald Trump. He said he was going to build
 
 a wall and have Mexico pay for it. And that didn't happen. 
 <br>[06:10:06]
 
That last year with COVID, I think was mishandled dramatically. Shutting down the country was a huge mistake. 
 
One thing in this race that I think is important to point out is Donald Trump flip-flopping on the right to life. 
 
Trump tweeting and attacking people, I think that created division we didn't need. 
 
DEAN (voice-over): DeSantis, feeling the pressure to gain support in Iowa after disappointing poll numbers from the "Des Moines Register" earlier this week showed Trump still has a commanding lead in the state. 
 
He downplayed the polls, though, touting his ground organization in the Hawkeye State. 
 
DESANTIS: Iowa voters will choose, not pundits and polls. We've got the best organization anyone's ever had in Iowa. We've got tens of thousands of Iowans who have already committed to caucus for us. 
 
DEAN (voice-over): DeSantis fielding many questions on foreign policy, saying he feels Israel over Ukraine has the most need for U.S. assistance. 
 
DESANTIS: It's the state of Israel, because they are our strongest ally in the Middle East. We have a relationship with them that's like no other.
 
And they have the whole world against us. They require the United States to be there, to stand with them as a friend. You know, Ukraine has all of Europe. These European countries need to start pulling their weight. 
 
DEAN (voice-over): He's also supporting congressional Republicans who are refusing to authorize further military aid to Ukraine unless more is done to secure the U.S. Southern border. 
 
DESANTIS: What they are seeing is you've got to defend our own country's borders before you start sending money all across this world. 
 
As president, I'll do the border on day one. Day one, we're going to declare it a national emergency. I'm sending the military to the Southern border. We're going to stop the invasion.
 
DEAN (voice-over): California Governor Gavin Newsom, a surrogate for President Biden's reelection campaign, criticizing DeSantis's performance calling it, quote, "his signature rant and scare tactics that offer no solutions to the real issues that matter to Americans across the country. GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): We are all in on Nikki Haley! 
 
DEAN (voice-over): Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley winning out against DeSantis and others to get a highly-sought endorsement from that state's governor, Chris Sununu. 
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It doesn't get any better than this. To go and get endorsed by the Live Free or Die governor is about as rock-solid of an endorsement as we could hope for. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
DEAN: So we are now in the last sprint until voting begins. That's going to happen January 15th. It starts here in Iowa, of course, with the Iowa caucuses.
 
And back here in the Hawkeye State today, former President Donald Trump will be here giving some remarks. And also, Phil and Poppy, just a note for everyone, another town hall right behind me. Vivek Ramaswamy will be taking the stage with Abby Philip at 9 p.m. 
 
MATTINGLY: Here we go. The sprint -- the sprint is right. You can all feel. Jessica Dean, thanks so much.
 
HARLOW: And you're going to get a chance to hear directly from Nikki Haley and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. They will join Dana Bash today on her show, "INSIDE POLITICS." That is 12 noon, Eastern Time. 
 
Meantime, overnight, a landmark moment in the fight against climate change, a really big deal, the United Nations climate summit ended with a call to transition away from fossil fuels. Critics say, though, it has cavernous loopholes. 
 
MATTINGLY: And we are just hours away from a possible vote to formalize the House GOP impeachment inquiry into President Biden. We're going to walk through what to expect on Capitol Hill. That's next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:17:17]
 
MATTINGLY: There is the U.S. Capitol. A very big day in the U.S. Capitol today, as we are just a few hours away from a possible vote to formalize the House Republican impeachment inquiry into President Biden. 
 
Democrats have been repeatedly calling the inquiry baseless as committees' investigations have, to this point, yielded zero evidence of any crime from the current president. 
 
Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. Good morning, Lauren. 
 
Speaker Johnson continuing to say Republicans are just taking the next step, but do we even know about what Hunter Biden, for example, is going to do today? Just set the stage for what's going to happen today. 
 
LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a major day for Republicans as they move forward with their pledge to move forward with this impeachment inquiry. 
 
We expect a possible vote today on the floor, and leadership has been working really hard to ensure that they have Republican unity later today. 
 
But we should point out that there had been some skeptical Republicans over the course of the last several months. And the argument the leadership is making at this point is that, just because we formally vote on an impeachment inquiry, does not mean we have to move forward. It's not inevitable that we have to do an impeachment of the current president, Joe Biden. 
 
In fact, you heard from Mike Johnson yesterday that his argument is just about getting more information, bolstering your case in court. 
 
Meanwhile, the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees, they have requested a deposition today with the president's son, Hunter Biden. They are also threatening that, if he doesn't show up, they may hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress. 
 
What we know right now from our justice team is that Hunter Biden is in Washington, D.C., we know, however, his lawyer has made crystal clear to these committees that they want to ensure that, if Hunter Biden testified, that he does so publicly. 
 
What they don't want to happen is him go in a closed=door meeting with these Republicans and then have selective pieces of this leak to the public without the full transcript, without the full testimony being released at one time. 
 
So that is why they've argued that should be public. We're going to be watching, obviously, on the Hill today to see whether or not Hunter Biden shows up. 
 
But again, that threat of potentially holding him in contempt of Congress is a real threat from House Republicans. We're going to be watching very closely today. 
 
But obviously this is a momentous day for the House Republican conference. And it also is a day that matters, because they are about to go on their holiday break. And this is sort of the last opportunity that they're going to have to talk about this for the next several weeks -- Phil, Poppy.
 
HARLOW: Lauren Fox, I hope you get a holiday break, too. You've been working around the clock. Thank you, my friend. 
 
MATTINGLY: Well, the racist, vile and threatening voicemail sent to election workers in Georgia, they've been revealed in court. How those messages, real people, real impact. Two women who are now suing Rudy Giuliani for defamation. How they affected them.
 <br>[06:20:07]
 
HARLOW: Also Coast Guard cadets opening up after being assaulted. This all comes after CNN first uncovered how their reports were completely mishandled. What those survivors want to see changed, next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[06:24:16]
 
HARLOW: Really big deal for the world, planet, you know, the fate of our environment. This morning, we're all waking up to a landmark agreement that could curb the use of fossil fuels that science proves contribute to the climate crisis. 
 
This new deal was hammered out overnight in Dubai at the United Nations climate summit. Those are cheers from attendees. There's already pushback, though, about whether it will actually work. 
 
MATTINGLY: CNN's David McKenzie has been covering COP28, the conference where this all happened. He's live for us now in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
 
David, I think there's a lot of skepticism that they could actually reach an outcome here. They've reached that outcome. What does this all mean? 
 
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Phil and Poppy. 
 
You know, this is a big deal. It's an historic, say many people, because they have managed to explicitly put in this climate deal a transitioning away from fossil fuels. 
 <br>[06:25:04]
 
Now that means oil, gas, coal. For many years, that was never part of these agreements explicitly. 
 
You know, this is important, because the world is heating up. This will be the hottest year on record. If you look at some of these achievements that this deal came through, they're looking to have net- zero by 2050, triple the renewables capacity by 2030, and crucially, help poorer nations, including developing nations like where I'm sitting, to finance all of it. 
 
The issue here is that these are not concrete goals necessarily, and there are many loopholes, say critics. But the U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, said it's important, particularly with the other crises that are going on in the world right now. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY: Everybody here should be pleased that in a world of Ukraine and the Middle East, war and all the other challenges of a planet that is floundering, this is a moment where multilateralism has actually come together, and people have taken individual interests and attempted to find the common good. (END VIDEO CLIP)
 
MCKENZIE: Well, almost 200 countries have to -- have a consensus on this deal, so it is important that they come up with this language. The question is whether people will put their money and their actions where they words have gone -- Phil, Poppy. 
 
HARLOW: Yes. A big step, for sure. But you're right, what's the action to follow? David, thanks so much for the reporting. 
 
MATTINGLY: Israel's strongest ally says it's losing international support for its war against Hamas. How U.S./Israeli relations could be impacted as President Biden ramps up his criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government. 
 
HARLOW: Also, abortion rights and the race for the White House. Ron DeSantis says Donald Trump is flip-flopping on the issue. We'll take a look at whether his new attack line will work for GOP voters.
