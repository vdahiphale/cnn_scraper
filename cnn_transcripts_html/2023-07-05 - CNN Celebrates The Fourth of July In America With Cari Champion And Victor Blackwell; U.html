THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
CARI CHAMPION, CNN ANCHOR: Riding their bikes. They're enjoying themselves. This is actually a perfect -- a perfect scenario for what we're trying to celebrate tonight. 
 <br>[00:00:06]
 
What in terms of fireworks, when you think about the fireworks and you look at this beautiful skyline, what does that represent for you? 
 
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: You know what, I remember as a kid going to the Inner Harbor in Baltimore with my family and being a kid and feeling the fireworks. I've said, you know, people like the drone shows and that's great, but I like -- you can feel it in your chest. And you can feel that boom and we're starting to -- we're expecting to see the fireworks pretty soon from barges here across the bay. 
 
This is the perfect setting, it's chilled a little bit which is why we have jackets on out here on the water.
 
CHAMPION: Just a scooch.
 
BLACKWELL: We've been here during the day. The families out enjoying each other here along the water. It's been a great evening here and we've had some great performances and more performances coming.
 
CHAMPION: We had Demi Lovato, that was amazing. Zac Brown band, that was amazing. We can -- people are starting a little at a time.
 
BLACKWELL: Here we go.
 
CHAMPION: Are we getting ready? I see it is time, guys.
 
BLACKWELL: The big day boom.
 
CHAMPION: Here we are right now. Fireworks San Diego style and music from country star Darius Rucker performing on his Starting Fires tour.

 <br>[00:10:28]
 
CHAMPION: The San Diego fireworks continue. What a special show and Darius Rucker, what a special performer. He will give us another song, we're going to take a quick break and we will be right back from Coronado Island.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
CHAMPION: Happy Fourth of July, still Fourth of July here on the West Coast. We're back in San Diego where the fireworks are still popping and the music is still playing and of course, it is all live right here on CNN. 
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, we've got some great performances. As we watched the fireworks, we have another song from Darius Rucker performing a classic Only Wanna Be with You.
 <br>[00:15:18]
 
(DARIUS RUCKER PERFORMING ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU)
 
BLACKWELL: All right, Darius Rucker performing there on his Starting Fires tour and what a show here in San Diego. 
 <br>[00:20:06]
 
CHAMPION: I hear you, barge, I hear you. 
 
BLACKWELL: I mean, everybody's blowing their horns here, the families are cheering. And you know what, this is what I love about firework shows, is I was hearing the families cheer, not just the kids, but the families is that this is a moment that the wonderment is shared by kids and adults and all ages.
 
CHAMPION: Yes, of all ages. 
 
BLACKWELL: So, that's what I really love about these firework shows is that the awe the kids feel, it's one of those few moments where you share that with adults. 
 
CHAMPION: Yes, and I want to -- I want to focus on that, the kids feel because it makes the kid in us remember what Fourth of July meant for us. 
 
When I was a kid, I didn't do the big -- I didn't have the moment where I can go to the bay like you did or the area in Baltimore. But we would get these fireworks and we do them safely in front yard and at home. And it was something that was to behold, it was a special moment. And that's how you are describing what we're watching right now. And it's very special. 
 
BLACKWELL: I mean, San Diego did not disappoint. 
 
CHAMPION: It did not.
 
BLACKWELL: They build themselves as the biggest on the West Coast, one of the biggest and best in the country. And they live up to it tonight. A fantastic show here. 
 
Listen, more music coming and more fireworks.
 
Coming up, Duran Duran performs Hungry Like the Wolf and other hits and fireworks in Houston. And for the first time, Alaska on this show. What a Fourth in America. It is not over yet. 
 
CHAMPION: It's not over. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:25:11]
 
CHAMPION: Happy Fourth of July everyone and they say -- they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas but not tonight. 
 
BLACKWELL: Not tonight.
 
CHAMPION: That is called the Sphere, it's a new attraction on the Vegas Strip and this is the first time that you can see that it is fully lit. How beautiful is that? 
 
And listen to this. I want you to understand, Vegas doesn't normally do this. This is a moment for us. There are a lot of lights there, right? What do you think?
 
BLACKWELL: Yes, they deemed everything to show that. You know if you have a national party and we're focusing on the West Coast, you've got to go and focus on what Vegas has to offer. And we're seeing for the first time the Sphere illuminated.
 
CHAMPION: It's beautiful.
 
BLACKWELL: It's beautiful.
 
CHAMPION: It's gorgeous. There it is again, you guys. That's a special site to be hold. I'm actually going to Vegas, I know you didn't asked. I'm going to Vegas on Friday. I'll see if they can run this back for me.
 
BLACKWELL: Just for you?
 
CHAMPION: Yes, just to see if they want to.
 
BLACKWELL: Just for you.
 
Listen, we got more music for you now. Classic rock from the legendary band Duran Duran.

CHAMPION: It's a beautiful sight to behold. And I also want to talk to about what we're going to do next, because it's never been done before. 
 
BLACKWELL: I'm looking forward to this. 
 
CHAMPION: OK. Have you been to Alaska before, ever? 
 
BLACKWELL: No. 
 
CHAMPION: For work, on assignment, for fun?
 
BLACKWELL: No, no. I've not been.

BLACKWELL: Live look at San Francisco, fireworks still going in Northern California and Alaska. 
 
Let's go back to Seward. This is the first year that Alaskan fireworks show has been part of FOURTH IN AMERICA. You know, they say, Hey, all coming out to the West Coast -- CHAMPION: Yes.
 
BLACKWELL: -- you need to come a little farther West. 
 
CHAMPION: Come farther West.
 
BLACKWELL: Come see what we have.
 
CHAMPION: What a great idea, and it was beautiful. I'm glad we did that. That was something special.
 
I'll tell you what. We have a party boat out here in San Diego. We just missed it. We showed it to them for just a moment. 
 
BLACKWELL: Just a second. 
 
CHAMPION: They have the right idea, because it's still pretty early here. There we go. Well, that's not the boat, per se. There's a few of them out here. But people are enjoying themselves, and the celebration continues. 
 
BLACKWELL: Although the fireworks ended here in San Diego, the party is still going on. There have been a few boats that have passed by with people dancing and singing. So the celebration of America's birthday does not end.
 
CHAMPION: Does not end. Still ongoing. What do we have next 
 
BLACKWELL: Coming up, our July the 4th coverage continues with another look at fireworks across the nation.

BLACKWELL: This was fun.
 
CHAMPION: It was really a lot of fun. 
 
BLACKWELL: We have seen some unforgettable fireworks and musical celebrations from coast to coast and beyond. First time, Alaska joining the show.
