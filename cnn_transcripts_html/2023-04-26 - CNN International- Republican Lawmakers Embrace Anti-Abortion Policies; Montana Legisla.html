BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. 
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour. 
 
A crucial vote to raise the U.S. national debt limit could come as soon as today. But Republican leaders are struggling to get the votes to push the plan through the House. 
 
The woman is suing Donald Trump for battery and defamation in the civil trial is expected to take the stand in New York in the coming hours. E. Jean Carroll claims the former president raped her in a luxury department store dressing room in the 1990s. 
 
NOBILO: Abortion is emerging as a central issue among 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls, especially those who want to attract voters who favor strict anti-abortion policies without alienating more moderate voters. 
 
FOSTER: And although Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has always emphasized, she is unapologetic and unhesitant about her anti- abortion views. She is now calling for constructive conversation on the issue. CNN's Kylie Atwood reports. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nikki Haley calling for national consensus on abortion.
 
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we want to protect more moms and save more babies, we need more Americans to join with us.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): The sole female Republican presidential contender making a pitch aimed at attracting more moderate Republicans and swing voters and turning the issue personal.
 
HALEY: I am prolife, not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but for very personal reasons. My husband was adopted. And I am reminded of that blessing every single day.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): She also spoke about having troubles conceiving her own children, a friend who was raped and back to federal role on abortions. But her speech didn't define a specific national abortion limit that she would put forth as president.
 
HALEY: They've turned a sensitive issue that has long divided people into a kind of gotcha bidding war.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): Republicans secured a decade long goal last year when the Supreme Court overturned Roe, but the decision ultimately helped Democrats defy expectations in the midterm elections. Still many Republican led states have moved forward with new abortion restrictions, and GOP hopefuls have embraced those policies.
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I'm pro-life.
 
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): I'm 100 percent pro-life.
 
ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: I'm pro-life.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): The president of the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America Group, the anti-abortion group that hosted Haley on Tuesday, has drawn a clear line in the sand.
 
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER, PRESIDENT, SUSAN B. ANTHONY PRO-LIFE AMERICA: We can only support candidates that know that they have a role if they're in the Oval Office to advocate for a federal minimum standard of 15 weeks.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): The group told CNN that Haley had assured them that she will commit to 15 weeks, even though she didn't say that publicly. 
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We recently signed the heartbeat bill to protect life.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week ban in his state earlier this month, though he did so behind closed doors.
 <br>[04:35:00]
 
Senator Tim Scott voiced support for a 20-week ban only to say this a day later.
 
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): If I were president of the United States, I would literally sign the most conservative pro-life legislation that they can get through Congress.
 
ATWOOD (voice-over): And former President Donald Trump wavering on whether or not the issue should be handled by states or the federal government.
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: From my first day in office, I took historic action to protect the unborn. ATWOOD (voice-over): Former Vice President Mike Pence, who has said he would support a six-week federal ban, drawing a contrast with Trump.
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with the former president who says this is the state's only issue. I mean, we've been given a new beginning for life in this country.
 
ATWOOD: Now we should note that when asked about those comments from the Susan B. Anthony president, that Nikki Haley gave assurances that she will back a 15 week ban on abortions. A spokesperson for the Nikki Haley campaign reiterated that she does want to find consensus on a ban for late term abortions. But essentially indicated that she didn't give any promises as to where that consensus would land. It's worth noting, however, that Nikki Haley is leading into the sensitive and controversial issue, while other Republican contenders for the presidency aren't seeking out forums in which to do so. 
 
Kylie Atwood, CNN, Washington.

NOBILO: The Republican led Montana statehouses considering disciplinary action for lawmaker over her comments on transgender rights.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The side of the chambers, members, please go to the side of the chambers. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: Protesters chanted, let her speak, on Monday after Zooey Zephyr's microphone was cut off. 
 
FOSTER: Last week, she said lawmakers who voted to ban gender affirming care for minors would see blood on their hands. Republicans called that inappropriate and uncalled for. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ZOOEY ZEPHYR, MONTANA STATEHOUSES DEMOCRAT: When I spoke on Senate Bill 99. I spoke about the very real harm that these bills cause. For example, there was a young trans teen who attempted suicide and when her mother found her, she had one of the hearings, one of these anti- trans hearings up on her computer. I see the real harm these bills -- these bills bring and the dust that could potentially lead to and I stand by holding Republicans accountable for their policies. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: Seven people were arrested during Monday's protest. Republicans called it a riot. Zephyr says she's not being allowed to represent her constituents. 
 
NOBILO: Washington's Democratic governor has now signed into law a ban on most sales of assault style weapons. The legislation prohibits the manufacture, importation, distribution and sale of these weapons and includes the popular AR-15 rifle under its ban. On Tuesday, Governor James Inslee said that those weapons should not be idolized. They should be prohibited. There is an exception for sales made to armed forces and law enforcement. 
 
The state's Republican Party says the law is poised to face legal challenges. The band makes Washington the 10th state to enact restrictions on assault style weapons. 
 
FOSTER: We are learning new details about the shooting that left four people dead and 32 injured in Alabama. The details were revealed during a hearing for the suspects. According to authorities, at least seven guns were used in the shooting, and more than 80 shell casings were found at the scene. As many as 60 people were inside the dark studio for a sweet 16 party earlier this month. Investigators say one of the deceased victims may have fired first. 
 
NOBILO: The father in Florida is facing charges after authorities say they found a gun in his second-grade child's backpack at school. Sheriff's deputies say the entire school was put on lockdown after the discovery, but no staff or students were injured -- thankfully. The school's principal says no threats were involved here. Instead, the father apparently told authorities that he put the gun in his child's bag accidentally. He's now accused of unsafe storage of a firearm, among other charges. 
 
FOSTER: A Michigan man was arrested after DNA from a coffee cup linked to him -- linked him to two rapes from more than 20 years ago. Court documents show Alan Kurt Rillema was arrested last week and is facing felony charges in Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Sheriff says Rillema is accused of raping an employee at a golf course in Michigan in 1999. The 51-year-old is also accused of another rape on a golf course at Penn State University in the year 2000. 
 
NOBILO: Still ahead, President Biden is set to host a key ally at the White House today. South Korea's president makes a state visit to Washington amid heightened tensions with North Korea. We'll have details in a live report. 
 
Plus, pop star Ed Sheeran testifies in a high-profile copyright infringement case. We'll have the details from the first day of the trial. 
 <br>[04:40:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
FOSTER: The U.S. President Joe Biden will welcome South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to the White House in the coming hours for a state visit. They're scheduled to hold bilateral talks, followed by a joint news conference and the state dinner Wednesday night. 
 
NOBILO: On Tuesday, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris hosted President Yoon at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where they talked up their alliance on a range of issues. FOSTER: Our CNN's Kristie Lu Stout will be watching closely from Hong
 
 Kong. What are you hoping to hear in the press conference, Kristie? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, a lot that we're looking out for, but some interesting comments and non-comments that we have received in the run up to the state visit from the White House. Because the White House declined to comment about those recent leaks and whether those recent leaks would be a topic of discussion between the presidents of the United States and South Korea. 
 
I'm referring to those leaked online Pentagon documents. Because one of them described in detail this conversation that took place between two South Korean security officials discussing their concerns over a U.S. request for artillery for ammunition for Ukraine. The White House instead in a run up to this state visit, they are reinforcing this ironclad alliance with South Korea. And today it' happening. 
 
It marks the first state visit to the United States by a South Korean leader since 2011. And there will be a welcoming ceremony at the White House, then the bilateral talks, the summit, followed by a state banquet. 
 
Now on Tuesday we heard from the South Korean -- president of the United States. He talked about the alliance, he said. It should leap into a new phase. I want you to listen to what President Yoon said. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I believe that the U.S. alliance must leap into a new phase of alliance to overcome such complex crisis together. What started as a military and security alliance should evolve into a supply chain and future oriented, innovative, technology alliance. One in which our two countries grow and act together. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
STOUT: That when the summit kicks off its -- the focus is going to be on security because of North Korea. Look, last year North Korea fired a record number of missiles this year. 
 <br>[04:45:00]
 
It continues to conduct these nonstop weapons tests, including this new, solid fueled ICBM. You also heard that tough nuclear readiness rhetoric from the North Korean leader. So, the South Korean president is expected to raise concerns about the U.S. nuclear umbrella. In fact, opinion polls in his country showed that a majority of South Koreans want their country to have their own nuclear weapons. 
 
So that is one thing to watch for when the summit kicks off. That's due to begin about 10:45, 8:00 Eastern time. Max and Bianca back to you guys. 
 
FOSTER: Ok, we'll be watching Kristie. Thank you. 
 
STOUT: You got it.
 
NOBILO: What would have been the world's first private moon landing, appears to have failed. The Japanese company behind the Hakuto-R lander says it likely crashed into the lunar surface after running out of fuel space. Ispace made that determination after mission control lost contact with the vehicle during its landing attempt early Wednesday morning, Japan time. 
 
The lander was carrying a rover built in Dubai, which was the first Arab built lunar spacecraft. 
 
FOSTER: Still to come, what's being held as a huge step forward for inclusion. We'll show you the latest Barbie in Mattel's growing push for doll diversity.

HARRY BELAFONTE, SINGER: Day-o, day-o Daylight come and we want go home
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: The king of calypso, known for his trademark "banana boat" song, Harry Belafonte has died. But he was so much more than a singer. Belafonte was the son of poor Caribbean immigrants but built a sparkling career winning an Emmy, a Tony and three Grammys. 
 
FOSTER: His biggest contributions came in the fight for civil rights though, as he became close friends with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Belafonte fought against apartheid in South Africa, the HIV AIDS epidemic and racial injustice in the United States. Former U.S. president Barack Obama called Belafonte a barrier breaking legend. He used his platform to lift others up. 
 
Obama tweeted: He lived a good life, transforming the arts whilst also standing up for civil rights and did it all with his signature smile and style. 
 
He was really ahead of his time, wasn't he, using the platform that he created. 
 
NOBILO: Absolutely. Popstar Ed Sheeran took to the stand in New York on Tuesday in a high-profile copyright infringement case. He's accused of copying Marvin Gaye's 1973 soul hit, "Let's Get It on." The Sheeran song "Thinking Out Loud." The suit was brought by the heirs of Ed Townsend, coauthor of that song with Gaye. 
 
FOSTER: I want to play you both songs so you can make up your own mind. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ED SHEERAN, SINGER: And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70. 
 
MARVIN GAYE, SINGER: Let's get it on Ah, baby, let's get it on Let's love, baby ...
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: I mean, it does make you think, doesn't it? But in his last case -- he had a case in the U.K., where he was called -- accused of copyright infringement. Very pleased that he won. And arguing that there are only a certain number of chords that you actually use in pop music. So, having these arguments can be quite academic, he thinks. 
 
NOBILO: Yes, I mean, it does sound similar as someone who can only play five chords on the piano. I feel like I'm slightly limited in how I can respond to this. 
 
FOSTER: Now in his opening statement, an attorney representing Townsend's family said Sheeran played his ballot and Gaye song back- to-back at the concert, calling the moment a smoking gun. 
 
NOBILO: The singer denies that allegation, saying if he had copied the song, then he obviously wouldn't have played it, quote, on stage in front of 20,000 people. 
 
FOSTER: Good point. 
 
NOBILO: Investors on Wall Street are looking to recoup some of their losses when trading gets underway today. The futures markets, giving us an indication of how things are looking, and currently they're looking pretty promising. 
 
FOSTER: Certainly are.
 
NOBILO: Meanwhile, alarming news from First Republic has investors fearing the banking crisis from earlier this year may not be over. The Dow fell more than 340 points on Tuesday, the Nasdaq was down 2 percent and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.5 percent. 
 
FOSTER: Barnes &amp; Noble plans to open 30 new bookstores this year. It will be the largest expansion for the chain and over a decade. Barnes &amp; Noble says each location will be unique. The idea is to mimic the experience of going to an independent bookstore. Barnes &amp; Noble also plans to revamp 90 existing stores. 
 
Is that honest, do you think when you're a chain pretending not to be? 
 
NOBILO: Well, there's something very unique about Barnes &amp; Noble. Because when I was growing up, sometimes in Florida, people would actually hang out there. Like you go to a mall to hang out. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
FOSTER: It says a lot about you and your friends. I wasn't in the library. 
 
NOBILO: It's difficult to say. 
 
In the NBA playoffs, the Atlanta Hawks beat the Boston Celtics in dramatic fashion to keep their championship hopes alive. Atlanta star player, Trae Young, made this three-point shot with just 1.8 seconds remaining to give the Hawks the victory. That is amazing. He led the teams come from behind rallies, scoring the final 14 points for Atlanta. Game six will be played in Atlanta on Thursday night. 
 
FOSTER: Great stadium that one. 
 
Meanwhile, the Denver Nuggets advanced to the next round after beating the Minnesota Timberwolves and the NDP contender Nicola Jokic powered Denver to a victory with his triple double performance. The top seeded Nuggets are going to the Western Conference Semifinals, and the fourth time in five seasons. Final score, Denver 112, Minnesota 109. 
 
The Denver Nuggets will meet the Phoenix Suns in the semifinals after the Sun's blotted out the Los Angeles Clippers. Devin Booker led the Suns to victory, scoring 47 points. He set a new franchise record for the player with the most 40 plus postseason games in Phoenix history. Final score, Suns 136, Clippers 130. 
 
FOSTER: Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is opening up about the trade that will see him leave the only NFL team he's ever played for. The deal that will send Rodgers from Green Bay to the New York Jets was announced on Monday. 
 <br>[04:55:00]
 
On Tuesday, Rodgers posted on Instagram, his gratitude to Packers fans, his teammates and the state of Wisconsin for the 18 years he spent with that franchise. 
 
NOBILO: Meanwhile the Jets general manager called the trade historic for his team. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOE DOUGLAS, GENERAL MANAGER, NEW YORK JETS: Aaron is one of the one of the best quarterbacks to ever play this game. And to have an opportunity to add a player of that caliber, you're always going to you're always -- you're always going to look into it. We're all excited to add someone of his character and his ability. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
NOBILO: Details of the trade is still being worked out, but it will involve swapping multiple draft picks. 
 
Finally, this hour, what's being called a huge step forward for inclusion. Toymaker Mattel has introduced its first ever Barbie Doll representing a person with down syndrome. Mattel said it worked with the U.S. National Down Syndrome Society on the doll's shape, features, clothing, accessories and packaging to ensure that there's this depiction is accurate. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
ELLIE GOLDSTEIN, BRITISH MODEL: I love it. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: That's a great reaction, isn't it? Barbie fans already appear thrilled with the new doll. Mattel says it wants to enable all children to see themselves in Barbie whilst encouraging kids to play with dolls that look different than they do. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLDSTEIN: I've never had any Barbie (INAUDIBLE)  and i's like me, and it's beautiful and I love it to pieces.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
FOSTER: The new doll comes from Mattel's Barbie Fashionistas line, which has featured other Barbies with disabilities or conditions that together represent a fuller range of human diversity. 
 
NOBILO: And it's got real attention to detail as well, the pendant, apparently, but the necklace has three chevrons, which are meant to indicate the three copies of the 21st chromosome, which is what provides the characteristics. 
 
FOSTER: I think that says it all, doesn't it when you see that reflected in the Barbie doll? That's pretty cool. 
 
NOBILO: Yes, absolutely. 
 
FOSTER: Thanks for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. 
 
NOBILO: And I'm Bianca Nobilo. "EARLY START" is up next right here on CNN.
