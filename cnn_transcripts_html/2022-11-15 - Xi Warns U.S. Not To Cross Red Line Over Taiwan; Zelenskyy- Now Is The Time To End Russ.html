ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shares his plan for peace with G20 leaders as they gather in Bali to address Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine.
 
Meanwhile, Ukrainians are struggling to pick up the pieces and a newly liberated Kherson that's been heavily damaged by Russian troops. And Republicans are one seat closer to taking the House. But tensions within the party remain higher. Some members call for a change of course in leadership.
 
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center. This is CNN Newsroom with Rosemary Church.
 
CHURCH: Good to have you with us. Well, the G20 Summit is underway in Bali, Indonesia with the focus now shifting to the war in Ukraine. It's the first time the group has gathered in person since Russia invaded its neighbor back in February. Earlier delegates heard a plea from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to end the fighting.
 
And U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to rally world leaders against the war. Diplomats have been working for months on a formal condemnation, although it's not clear exactly which countries will sign on. Earlier French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the war with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. State media in Beijing report China is calling for a ceasefire and peace talks.
 
And British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a statement saying Russia will never have a legitimate seat at the table until the war in Ukraine ends. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not attending the G20. Summit.
 
Well, presidents Biden and Xi focused on multiple key topics including Taiwan during their three-hour meeting. The Chinese leader warned the U.S. not to cross the red line when it comes to Taiwan. The White House says Mr. Biden raised concerns about human rights in China and emphasized agreements on climate change. President Biden added that he expects competition with China but not conflict.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've absolutely believe there need not be a new Cold War. We -- I've met many times with Xi Jinping and we were candid and clear with one another across the board.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: So let's bring in our CNN team, Ivan Watson and Kevin Liptak are in Bali, Indonesia. And Steven Jiang joins us live from Beijing. Good to see you all. So Ivan, let's start with you, G20 members listen to President Zelenskyy's address and some are expected to sign that statement condemning Russia's war on Ukraine. What were you learning about all of this?
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, the war is in fact, kind of in the opening statements of this summit, the host, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo. He immediately talked about global challenges, soaring food prices, shortages of fertilizer, all exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and called for an immediate end to the war. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JOKO WIDODO, PRESIDENT OF INDONESIA: If the war does not end it will be difficult for the world to move forward. If the war does not end, it will be difficult for us to take responsibility for the future of current generation and future generations.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WATSON: There are 17 heads of state from G20 countries that are in attendance here in Bali. You know, who's not here, Rosemary is the Russian President Vladimir Putin who the Indonesian president personally invited during a trip to Moscow last summer. The last time that Putin attended an international summit was in Uzbekistan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in September.
 
And at that meeting he was not swaggering around, he was conceding to the Chinese and Indian leaders that they had concerns and questions about this deadly war in Ukraine. So perhaps that is why Putin sent his foreign minister instead. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president addressed the assembly virtually fresh from his appearance yesterday at the newly liberated Ukrainian city of Kherson.
 
He compared Russia's withdrawal of surrender of that city to the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II and he had a tough speech where called the G20, the G19 in an obvious dig at Russia.
 <br>[02:05:06]
 
He said that Ukraine should not be forced to compromise give up any land whatsoever and said that Russia should not be engaging in nuclear threats, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: All right. Kevin, let's turn to you now. President Biden met with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for three hours. What all did the U.S. achieve that get out of that high stakes meeting?
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, I think what President Biden went into this meeting, hoping to accomplish was a commitment that neither side wanted conflict. And it does seem like he accomplished that. He accomplished his objective once this meeting ended. Both sides seemed ready to take down the temperature to resume discussions after they had been somewhat stalled for months.
 
Now, President Biden was clear that the issues, the disputes that they had going into this meeting, issues over Taiwan, issues over restrictions on technology, certainly human rights, that's a big one. Those remain disputes after the meeting ended. The President said this was not a kumbaya moment. There were moments of tension, when they were sitting across from each other for the three-hour meeting.
 
But what they did agree with that they would start talking again, and they tasked officials to speak with their counterparts, high-ranking officials, potentially cabinet members to go over this litany of issues where they think that they can accomplish something and really kind of get to the business of diplomacy. One of those big issues is of course, climate change. You can't really solve the climate crisis without the U.S. and China talking to each other.
 
They're the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gas. So that's one of the biggest things that they will resume talks on. The secretary of state Antony Blinken will also visit China in the New Year. Now President Biden said that he found Xi Jinping to be sort of the same person that he's always been. He's been open. He's been straightforward. He didn't find him to be confrontational.
 
And that did allow them to have a candid discussion about areas that they disagree. But interestingly, the president said they also talked about areas that they didn't necessarily understand each other. Places where they weren't sure where the red lines were. Afterwards, the president said that there were no misunderstandings. That he was able to get a sense of where she stands.
 
And one of those key areas is, of course, Taiwan. And the president said at that news conference last night that he does not see a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as imminent. So that was one of the big takeaways. One of the other things they wanted to talk about was North Korea, the president sort of cast doubt on how much influence she has in Pyongyang. So that was an interesting takeaway as well.
 
But certainly, this was really the beginning. Now, the real work of diplomacy will begin as these officials begin their talks with each other. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: Of course. And Steven, let's turn to you now. What all did China's president get out of his meeting with President Biden and his other bilateral meeting with the French president? STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Yes, Rosemary, you know, what both of those bilateral meetings in a way Xi Jinping was trying to ease the concerns of the western leaders about where he stands on major issues and where China's headed. Now the country is very much under his one-man rule. And one of those major issues, of course, is Ukraine. And he discussed that with both Biden and Macron.
 
But he made a specific point to Biden that China opposes the threat or use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. That is a point that he had previously made with the visiting German chancellor in Beijing. But still, the fact that he told Biden this was very telling, given Mr. Putin's recent nuclear posturing and given Mr. Xi is supposed no Limits friendship with the Russian leader. But it's also a very interesting that this point was not included in the Chinese government read out about the Biden Xi meeting.
 
It did later appear in a separate foreign ministry statement. So there still seems to be some hesitation on the part of the Chinese in terms of how to address this very sensitive issue while maintaining their close ties with Russia. But when it comes to U.S.-China ties of course, the most contentious issue remains to be Taiwan. You heard Kevin say that the U.S. president coming out of the meeting, having a more optimistic assessment of the situation.
 
And as far as the Chinese are concerned, Mr. Biden has also said all the right things opposing Taiwan independence and also sticking to a One China policy, but the situation remains very precarious, especially with domestic U.S. politics thrown in. With the Republicans are still very much favored to win the control of the House. A leading candidate for the new speaker's job is Kevin McCarthy who has previously said he would visit Taiwan as the speaker.
 
So if that happens, it could really plunge this relationship back to where it was before the meeting. So, potentially making all the smiles on the leaders faces just a fleeting moment, Rosemary?
 
CHURCH: Yes. Indeed. Our thanks to Kevin Liptak, Ivan Watson and of course Steven Jiang. Appreciate it.

Well after being bombarded with Russian missiles and self-detonating drone for nearly a month, Ukraine is starting to see a lull in those attacks. The Ukrainian Air Force says Moscow is now incapable of launching a high number of strikes because it's running low on cruise missiles. And now it's Russia which appears to be on the defensive. Ukraine says it carried out its own strikes against Russian positions on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
 
Moscow's troops were forced to relocate there after retreating from the city of Kherson on the western side. Before they left, the soldiers destroyed all of the city's critical infrastructure including power lines. That is according to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy who warns that residents of Kherson are facing a difficult situation.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is what the Russian flag means, complete desolation. There is no electricity, no communication, no internet and no television. The occupiers destroyed everything themselves on purpose. This is their special operation. Before winter, the Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure. Absolutely all important facilities in the city in the region are mined.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Well, despite the long road to recovery, Mr. Zelenskyy says Kherson's liberation is the beginning of the end of the war. Earlier on Monday, he visited the city to celebrate its freedom. CNNs Nic Robertson is there and has details.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Flanked by troops who helped liberate the city, President Zelenskyy made a lightning trip to Kherson Monday, the nation's most significant victory in months.
 
ZELENSKYY: This is the beginning of the end of the war. You see our strong army, we are step by step coming to our country to all the temporary and occupied territories.
 
ROBERTSON: A morale boost for the country and president alike.
 
Zelenskyy pledging peace on Ukraine's, not Russia's terms and vowing to reconnect Kherson's residents to the rest of the country.
 
To make them feel that were' not only talking about it, he says but we're really returning, really raising our flag.
 
ROBERTSON: Today's flags, a much needed temporary cell phone tower erected, reconnecting residents to loved ones, cut off since the retreating Russians destroyed the phone and Internet services.
 
And a truck full of humanitarian aid, the fist to arrive since liberation 72 hours ago, candles, bread, water handed out to eager residents who have been without electricity and water since the Russian retreat.
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): How much is this needed here?
 
SVEYATOSLAV YRASH, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Desperately, I was thinking about people what was lacking, what they have lost, and basically the supermarkets don't work, shops are crazy expensive or don't work.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): In the city's neighborhoods, poorly stocked street markets hint at how much more help is needed. Some goods like drinking water nearly impossible to find.
 
What help do you need from the government now here? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Electricity, water, and very cold in the home -- very cold.
 
ROBERTSON: Within hours of Zelenskyy's visit, Russian artillery destroyed a house in the north of the city, a reminder Russian troops are not far away.
 
Where they retreated Friday, the pontoon they used to flee across now partially sunk. The once mighty bridge crippled by U.S. made HIMARS that helped trigger the Russian collapse in tatters too.
 
But the Russians didn't go far. 
 
ROBERTSON (on camera): And that's where the danger is for Kherson just on the other side of the bridge, that's where the Russian positions are. They've dug in within easy shelling range of the city.
 
ROBERTSON (voice over): Zelenskyy's visit perhaps the closest to the front line since the war began.
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
CHURCH: The Kremlin took notice of Mr. Zelenskyy's visit to Kherson and offered a terse response. It spokesman simply said "No comment. This is Russian territory." The Kremlin also responded to a different matter regarding Ukraine and security. It confirmed that Russia's intelligence chief met with the director of the CIA in Turkey on Monday. 
 <br>[02:15:04]
 
The U.S. says they discussed Ukraine and that Russia was warned against using new nuclear weapons. CNN's Scott McLean joins us now with more on all of this. So good to see you, Scott. As we just said, CIA Director Bill Burns met with his Russian intelligence counterpart Sergei Naryshkin in Ankara on Monday. What all came out of that meeting?
 
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So Rosemary, given that this was a meeting between two spies, we will probably never truly know what was discussed inside of that room. We can only go based on what each side has told us. In the U.S. side at least officially says the Bill Burns was there in Ankara, the capital of Turkey to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergei Naryshkin to essentially talk about risk and managing risk, especially nuclear risk and the risk of strategic stability.
 
So you can draw your own conclusions based about what exactly that may mean, precisely, but it seems to indicate that the U.S. was there to give Russia a warning about the risk of using nuclear weapons and the consequences that would come if they were ever to be used. You'll remember back in September that Russian President Vladimir Putin seem to give a not so veiled threat about using nuclear weapons, though last month, thankfully, he seemed to back off of that somewhat. The U.S. says that it was not in Turkey, though, that Bill Burns was not in Turkey to negotiate any kind of settlement or any kind of ending to this conflict in Ukraine because it says that its policy is that anything involving Ukraine should actually have Ukraine there at the table. And obviously, the Ukrainians were not there, though they say that they were given a heads up. The Kremlin for its part at first refused to confirm or deny that this meeting took place at all. 
 
Then later, they confirmed that it did take place, but said that this was at the invitation of the United States and the Kremlin declined to say anything specific about what exactly was discussed. Turkey obviously was the host here. And they confirmed that the meeting took place and said that this is just one more example of Turkey contributing to brokering dialogue for peace between the Ukrainians and the Russians.
 
This is something that President Erdogan has really tried to make it one of his primary focuses, of course, the Turks are in a pretty unique position having maintained pretty good relations with both the West and with Russia as well. And with Ukrainians and the Russians as well. They've previously hosted peace talks and President Erdogan who is at the G20 right now says that it is still very much his goal to try to coax both sides back to the negotiating table though at this point. It was odd seem pretty long, Rosemary.
 
CHURCH: All right. Scott McLean joining us live there. Many thanks for bringing us up to date. 
 
Well, congressional republicans head back to Washington for the first time since the midterm elections that tough road to the party's leadership elections. That's next here on CNN. Do stay with us.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:20:11]
 
CHURCH: Another 2020 election denier has lost her bid for office. CNN projects Democrat Katie Hobbs will win the Arizona governor's race. Defeating Trump favored Kari Lake. Hobbs, who currently serves as Arizona's secretary of state tweeted her thanks to voters saying democracy is worth the wait. Appearing on Fox News shortly before the race was called Kari Lake baselessly called the state's election botched.
 
And once the call was made, she opted not to acknowledge Hobbs' when tweeting Arizonans no B.S. when they see it.
 
Well, another Arizona Republican is celebrating his victory. CNN is calling Arizona's sixth district congressional seat for Juan Ciscomani. That is another Republican pick up in the House giving them a projected 215 seats. The Democrats currently all 204 seats with 16 races still undecided, with control of the House still up for grabs.
 
Congressional Republicans returned to Washington Monday first time since the midterms, and as they move toward choosing new leadership the blame game for last week's election is already starting. Our Manu Rau reports from Capitol Hill.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
 
MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): As Republicans move closer to securing a razor thin House majority they are confronting this question.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That we have the wrong strategy.
 
RAJU: Republicans are likely stuck with a narrow House Majority which would make governing difficult and complicated House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy's path to the speakership. Democrats like Michigan's Hillary Scholten who picked up a GOP seat says voters sent a message.
 
HILLARY SCHOLTEN, U.S. HOUSE-ELECT DEMOCRAT: Three people are tired of the divisiveness and the extremism that today's Republican Party embodies.
 
RAJU: As the incoming freshmen gathered in the capitol today, McCarthy was behind closed doors, trying to lock down the votes to become speaker and wielding the support former President Donald Trump. Also winning the backing of the (INAUDIBLE) Trump ally and controversial conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene.
 
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): It's very, very risky right now to produce a leadership challenge especially for Speaker of the House.
 
RAJU: Also Becky McCarthy, incoming Republican Mike Lawler, who won one of four key GOP races in New York, likely enough to secure the majority.
 
MIKE LAWLER, U.S. HOUSE-ELECT REPUBLICAN: I think ultimately, you know, you can always quibble about margins, but a majority is the majority. I fully support Kevin McCarthy and we'll support him for speaker.
 
RAJU: Yet McCarthy can only afford to lose a handful of GOP votes to win the 218 he needs in January to become speaker. And Arizona's Andy Biggs is considering a challenge to deny him the votes.
 
MATT GAETZ, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Would rather be waterboarded by Liz Cheney than vote for Kevin McCarthy.
 
RAJU: In the senate, an even bigger GOP debacle after democrats retain the majority following victories by Arizona's Mark Kelly and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and could add a seat after next month's run off in Georgia.
 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The red wave proved to be a red mirage.
 
RAJU: Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell facing backlash from some conservatives who want to hit the brakes on this Wednesday's leadership elections.
 
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): It would be insane if we reelect the same leadership two days from now. RAJU (on camera): Trump is blaming McConnell. Is that fair?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, that's not fair at all.
 
RAJU (voice over): All as Democrats are prepared for their own shakeup once Speaker Nancy Pelosi decides whether to step aside.
 
NANCY PELOSI, U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT: My decision will then be rooted in what the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus.
 
RAJU: New members of Congress, including the First Gen Z member, 25- year-old Maxwell Frost are watching closely.
 
RAJU (on camera): Do you think that your leadership team should reflect this younger -- the younger class of members?
 
MAXWELL FROST, U.S. HOUSE-ELECT DEMOCRAT: Yes. I think generally we need younger people in office across this country and in Congress. I do think we should have gotten people represented in leadership as well.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
RAJU: Now, Republicans met behind closed doors for the first time since the midterms in which each of the members of the leadership team made their pitch to their members ahead of tomorrow's leadership election, which Kevin McCarthy needs to get just a simple majority of his conference to get nominated as speaker. His bigger challenge will come in January where he needed to get 218 votes of the full house in order to lock down the speakership.
 
Meaning he cannot afford to lose potentially more than a handful of republican defectors. Now, no candidate came forward at the closed- door meeting but it's very likely if not certain that someone will come forward ultimately during the leadership election on the senate side. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has the votes locked up to become speaker but he could face a long shot bid on Wednesday to his own leadership perch if Senator Rick Scott decides to mount a challenge against him.
 <br>[02:25:10]
 
And I asked him if he would, he said he had not decided whether to challenge McConnell. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.
 
CHURCH: An advisor to Donald Trump says he will announce his third presidential bid in the coming hours. Even as a growing number of republicans say it's time to move on from the former president. Many in the GOP blame Trump for the party's lackluster results in the midterms and say he doesn't have the same magnetism that swept him into the White House six years ago.
 
If Trump does run, he will have to do it without some of the support he has long enjoyed from conservative media. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WINSOME SEARS, VIRGINIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The voters have spoken and they have said that they want a different leader.
 
STUART VARNEY FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I believe that Trump should step off the stage. 
 
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: The populist movement is about ideas. It is not about any one person. If the voters conclude that you're putting your own ego or your own grudges ahead of what's good for the country, they're going to look elsewhere.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: Well, despite the backlash, Trump appears eager to launch his 2024 campaign early for a variety of reasons, including his desire to get ahead of other contenders like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and perhaps to insulate himself from his growing legal problems. 
 
Meantime, Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence is hinting at his own presidential run in 2024. And he says Trump is not the best choice to lead the country again. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DAVID MUIR, ABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT ANCHOR: Do you believe that Donald Trump should ever be president again?
 
MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: David, I think that's up to the American people. But I think we'll have better choices in the future.
 
MUIR: Better choices than Donald Trump.
 
PENCE: And for me and my family, we will be reflecting about what our role is in that.
 
MUIR:  Will you run for president in 2024?
 
PENCE: We're giving a consideration in our house, careful consideration.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH: And you can hear more from Mike Pence when CNN hosts a town hall with the former vice president. He will take questions from Jake Tapper and a live studio audience. That is Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. in New York, 10:00 a.m. Thursday in Hong Kong.
 
And just ahead. An exclusive CNN interview with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos who shares his thoughts on philanthropy, space travel, and his plans to give away his vast fortune. Back with that in just a moment.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:30:00] CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Joe Biden is trying to put a positive spin on his first face-to-face meeting as U.S. president with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. They met for three hours at the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, discussing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, China's red lines on Taiwan, and ways to cooperate with climate change and the global economy.
 
Mr. Biden says that the talks were open and candid. But he is not suggesting this is kumbaya. Joining me now from Washington, Josh Rogin is a CNN political analyst, a columnist for the "Washington Post," and the author of "Chaos Under Heaven: Trump, Xi and the Battle for the 21st Century." Always great to have you with us.
 
JOSH ROGIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST, AUTHOR, "CHAOS UNDER HEAVEN":  Great to be with you.
 
CHURCH:  So, President Joe Biden met face-to-face Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, for the first time since taking office on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali. They talked for three hours, and that was more than expected. What all was achieved and what were the deliverables?
 
ROGIN:  Well, frankly, Rosemary, I do not think there are any deliverables and I don't think much was achieved at all. And, of course, the White House told us that there weren't going to be any achievements or deliverables, because they realize that the U.S. China relationship was at a point where there is not much they can agree on and not much the two sides can cooperate on.
 
Now, of course, having the meeting itself is a positive sign that President Biden and President Xi Jinping are able to talk to each other about a range of topics. And, of course, both sides said that they were able to communicate their positions clearly and feel like they were understood by their interlocutors. However, if you just think about it, to talk for three and a half hours and to not find any areas of agreement or progress at all just shows you how far apart the two sides are.
 
So, I think talking is always a good thing. I think this will be the beginning -- if you wanted to find a deliverable, it will be the beginning of a new series of conversations between high-level U.S. and Chinese officials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to go to China to follow up on today's meeting. That is a deliverable of sorts. But at the same time, we have to say that on key issues like Taiwan, Iran, North Korea, nuclear missiles, human rights, trade, technology, zero progress was made. That is the reality.
 
CHURCH:  So, let's look at the issues of Taiwan, that will, of course, always be the sticking point in this tense relationship between the United States and China. Where did those talks end and what comes next in those discussions?
 
ROGIN:  Right. To be clear there, are no U.S. China direct talks about Taiwan. What each side did was present their positions. The U.S. position is that they want the United States does not want to see either side trying to -- or Taiwan unilaterally change the status quote and China's position is at Taiwan is ours and stay out of it. And that is not a negotiation, that's not a discussion. That's just two sides defining their positions and increasingly, it seems clear that those positions are at odds with each other.
 
President Biden was very clear that he is not changing U.S. policy. He did not repeat his statements that he intends to send U.S. troops to defend Taiwan, statements that he has made four times probably in the past. At the same time, it was very clear that Xi Jinping's message was that Taiwan is a core issue to China, that any U.S. interference would be frowned upon and because the U.S. is not going to stop helping Taiwan because China is not going to stop being angry about that help, I think the U.S. China tensions over Taiwan are destined to only going to increase.
 
CHURCH:  So, as you say, not much achieved. But did these bilateral talks result at least in the lowering of the temperature between the two nations and, of course, as you mentioned, keeping the channels of communication open, or do you fear that the two nations are still on a collision course here?
 
ROGIN:  Well, I think both. I think it lowered the temperature, but only for such a short time because the collision course is still set. So, you can lower the temperature, but if you're still on the collision course, what good did it really do in the end? And, you know, there is some value in having open lines of communication so that we do not have misunderstandings, because misunderstandings can lead to mistakes and that can lead to conflict. But the courses that the two countries are on might also lead to conflict.
 
And if -- we just have to wait if Xi Jinping is going to take his third term as president and use it to be nicer and open up and reform and to play better with the International Community, or if he is going to take it the other way and become more aggressive and more reckless. And the pattern of history shows that as totalitarian aggressive dictators get more powerful, they usually get more aggressive and more reckless. They usually don't get nicer, but I guess we don't know for sure yet.
 <br>[02:35:00]
 
But the bottom line is that the temperature is down, for the moment, but none of the fundamentals have changed.
 
CHURCH:  Josh Rogin, always a pleasure to get your analysis. Many thanks.
 
ROGIN:  Anytime.
 
CHURCH:  One of the world's richest man, Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, says that he plans to give away most of his $125 billion fortune to charity during his lifetime. He sat down for an exclusive interview with our interview our entertainment reporter, Chloe Melas, to talk about that as well as the future of space travel.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  I sat down with Jeff Bezos and his partner Lauren Sanchez for a wide-ranging interview at their Washington, D.C. home over the weekend. And in it, we spoke about what he plans to do with the majority of his wealth.
 
You know, when you go and you look at your net worth, it is too much money to even spend in a lifetime. Do you plan to give away the majority of your wealth in your lifetime?
 
JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER, AMAZON:  Yes, I do. And the hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way. It's not easy. You know, building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, and I'm finding, and I think Lauren find the same thing, that philanthropy is very similar. It's not easy. It's really hard. And there are bunch of ways that you -- I think that you could do ineffective things, too. So, we're building the capacity to be able to give away this money.
 
MELAS:  And of course, we had to talk about Blue Origin and his plans for space travel. And he believes that, yes, it could be attainable for everyone sooner than you think.
 
Do you believe in our lifetime, that space travel is going to be attainable for everyone?
 
BEZOS:  I do. Let me give you an example. It was only a little more than 100 years ago, the Wright Brothers flew this tiny little plane, just a couple 100 feet. And if you told the Wright Brothers, you know, a 100 years from now, there's going to be like a 787, carries 400 people.
 
LAUREN SANCHEZ:  You'd laugh.
 
MELAS:  You've yet to go. There's been a lot of first?
 
SANCHEZ:  Yes.
 
BEZOS:  She's a future astronaut.
 
SANCHEZ:  I'm yet to go.
 
BEZOS:  she is ready. She wants to go.
 
SANCHEZ:  I'm ready.
 
MELAS:  Are we talking in 2022 or are we talking --?
 
SANCHEZ:  Well, that's pretty quick, not by the end of 2022 but 2023.
 
BEZOS:  Soon.
 
MELAS:  Together?
 
SANCHEZ:  No, he's already been it.
 
BEZOS:  We'll see. She -- I think she has some ideas about who she wants to go with? We'll see.
 
SANCHEZ:  I think it'd be a great group of females.
 
MELAS:  The interview lasted for over 20 minutes. We talked about his plans to potentially buy the NFL team, The Washington Commanders and we talked about their dynamic together as a couple, and what they do on a Saturday night. You can find more of that interview on cnn.com.

CHURCH:  And still to come, maybe the third time is the charm. NASA will try once again to launch its Artemis Moon Rocket just days after it took a direct hit from the hurricane. We'll be back with that and more in just a moment.

CHURCH:  NASA will try again on Wednesday to launch the Artemis Moon Rocket. This will be the third launch attempt, and it comes just days after the rocket took a direct hit from a hurricane. CNN's Lynda Kinkade reports.
 
LYNDA KINKADE, CNN HOST (voiceover):  NASA says it's on track for the Artemis 1 mission to launch Wednesday. That could pave the way for U.S. astronauts to return to the moon. The launch of NASA's most powerful rocket ever, which is carrying the un-crewed Orion spacecraft, is targeting a two-hour window for lift off. Beginning at 1:04 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday. That's if all goes to plan. Previous launches have been scrubbed because of bad weather and technical issues.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Launch, Rector Charlie, Blackwell, Thompson has called a scrub.
 
KINKADE (voiceover):  NASA says the mission is still ready to go, even though the mega rocket sustained some minor damage after Hurricane Nicole swept across Florida last week. Artemis 1 was already on the launchpad one the storm unexpectedly strengthened. NASA says it was with designed to withstand high winds and needed minimal repairs, but the launch date was pushed back by two days. It is a latest in a series of delays for the Artemis 1 launch, which was initially set for late August. The first two attempts were scrapped after issues with a full leak.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The team now going into the cut off procedure after being unable to resolve a hydrogen leak.
 
KINKADE (voiceover):  The third scuttled by the threat of an Ilia (ph) hurricane, which had forced NASA to roll the rocket back to the hangar for safety. If and when Artemis gets off the ground, it has some lofty goals. The first mission is expected to be a 25-day journey to the moon's orbit and back. Artemis 2 repeats the trip, including astronauts and a lunar fly by. Artemis 3 plans to put astronauts back on the moon's surface.

CHURCH:  And we have this just into CNN, a source with direct knowledge of the matter says that Australia will overturn a three-year ban on tennis player Novak Djokovic entering the country. Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after the immigration minister ruled he did not have sufficient grounds to enter the country since he was not vaccinated for COVID. The world number one tennis player is hoping to compete in the 2023 Australian open.
 
And hats off to Paris for making a Cap, the mascot of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Many cities, of course, choose animals as their mascots, but the organizers of the Paris event says they picked hats because they represent the French identity and the symbols of freedom during the French revolution. There will be two versions of the hats for the games, one for the Olympics, and another for the Paralympics.
 
And thanks so much for joining us. I am Rosemary Church. World Sport is coming up next. And I'll be back in 15 minutes with more "CNN Newsroom." Do stick around.

FISCHER:  -- center very similar to Dr. Fisher over here in California.
 
COATES:  I mean, just thinking about that, the idea of the road ahead for recovery possibly, and he says a week or so back in his feet. But how common are injuries like this? I mean, you know, he is known, as you've mentioned, Sara, for his extensive car collection. He is an aficionado to say the least. But the idea of some of the older cars he's working with, the injuries that may have come from a gasoline fire, I mean, how common is something like this to happen?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're remarkably common, actually. We have about 1,000 admissions a year in Maryland, you know, for the state that -- and so, I found myself working on patients like this every day.
 
COATES:  Now, what's common, the idea of people having the injuries to the face and hands or to the body? Is it kept having it at gas stations or inside? I mean, where is this happening normally?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, some of the more common things, you know, it can be working on cars. But also, just setting leaves on fire. We see that pretty often. And then, you know, sadly, tougher circumstances at home with working with stoves and the like, can have explosions. It's remarkably common.
 
COATES:  It's really unfortunate. We are hearing though from the variety statement that he made and beyond that, he might be OK and we'll look for more. Thank you to both of you for join us this evening. Shocking to think of how common it really is.
 
Also shocking, how common even gun violence can be in this country. And tonight, three people are dead. Three students, three young men in yet another shooting on a college campus. The suspect, also a student at the university and he is now in custody. So, just what happened at the University of Virginia? Next.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[02:50:00]
 
COATES:  The community of Charlottesville is in mourning tonight. People are gathering on the University of Virginia's campus after a shooting there claimed the lives of three students, and wounded two others. The victims, Lavel Davis Jr., Devin Chandler and D'Sean Perry. They were all current members of the universities football team and they were on a bus returning from a class trip to right here in Washington D.C. when the attack took place.
 
Just look at these three young men. This is devastating to think about. And this one on the screen is the suspect. Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. who is then in police custody tonight. He is a current student and ex-UVA football player. He now faces three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony.
 
Joining me now is CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. John, I mean, just looking at the picture of those three young men who have been killed, it's just so unbelievably tragic and sad, it just really is to think about. And as a mother, to think when you send your kids to school, they're going on a bus to a field trip, I think, to see a play here in Washington, D.C. and the next phone call, the parents receive is that their children having been killed by another student?
 
John, tell me, when you heard about this, you've been following this case all along, what has surprised you about this? Tell me your insight.
 
JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, I think, you know, when I was with the FBI, the Virginia Tech Shooting happened. That was 33 people killed, numerous others shot and injured. That was 2007. And, you know, Mary Ellen O'Toole, one of our top FBI profilers and the team from the Secret Service got together and they looked at school shootings and what they came up with was an 85 to 95 percent of these cases, Laura, is what they call leakage. The person is giving hence, is telling others that something is about to happen.
 
So, one of the first things, you know, you look for in a case like this is that. And it was very interesting in the police press conference that they actually came forward without being asked and volunteered that this person had been on their threat assessment radar at the school prior to the shooting. So, there's going to be a lot of questions to go back over how that was done and what was done and what the limits are. COATES:  Yes. And thinking about that, just what would that entail? I mean, if somebody had been -- and there's been -- obviously, you mentioned, the evolution of how these cases are handled, how threat assessments might be weighed and considered on via school campus, what would that look like?
 
MILLER:  So, really interesting question, Laura, because what that would look like is an amalgam between Chief Longo, who is the head of that infrastructure. Tim Longo is the chief of police at the university. Ed Murkowski, who actually runs the threat assessment team. But there is a medical component, and there's a dean of student's component and they assess the cases.
 
Here is the problems about the threat assessment business and the limits of it. Which is, he allegedly told the student he had a gun. That student passed it on to the school. The school passed it on to the threat assessment team. The threat assessment team interviewed the person who reported who and said, well, he mentioned he had a gun but he didn't say he was going to do anything with it. So, there was no threat attached to it. They interviewed his roommate who said, I've been, you know, in the same room with him here at the school. Never saw a gun. He hasn't shown me a gun or brandished a gun.
 
And presumably, and we don't know this Laura, and we will, you wouldn't close a case like that out in a proper way without interviewing the subject.
 
COATES:  Right.
 <br>[02:55:00]`
 
MILLER:  You know, Mr. Jones, about, did you have a gun? Did you make the statement? So, we still have to go back through that. But the point is, there's not much you could do on that, which is, it doesn't come attached to a threat. Even if you look at the Buffalo shooting in the supermarket by a racist white supremacist, barely more than a teenager, he made threatening statements, he was put into the 72 hours observation. Given a prescription and sent home, because he said, well, I wasn't going to do anything. I made it up. Which turned out, obviously, not to be true. This is a difficult field.
 
COATES:  I mean, just as you describe it, thinking about the hook, right, what needs to happen in order to move it along. We hear so often talking about mass shootings, talking about school shootings, talking about what where the red flags, what where the signs, what could've been done differently to prevent? But it goes back to it.
 
And, you know, I both know this in law enforcement and prosecution, what you would need to do something more, which is not a satisfying response by any touch of the imagination tonight for these families who are undoubtedly grieving and an entire campus as well. But you are right to point out the initial transparency that came from this press conference. I do wonder, John Miller, if it will continue. Thank you so much for joining us this evening.
 
MILLER:  Thanks, Laura. COATES:  Again, just thinking about those three young men, it's just heartbreaking.
 
Well, not good for the party. Says one Republican. Still? As another, not entitled to it, says one more. And those are just some of the comments from Republicans on Capitol Hill about an impending Trump 2024 announcement. Stay with us.
