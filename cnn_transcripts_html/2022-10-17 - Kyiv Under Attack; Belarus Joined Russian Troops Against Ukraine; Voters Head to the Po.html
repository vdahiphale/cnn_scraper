(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. You are watching CNN Newsroom. And I'm Rosemary Church. 
 
We are following developments out of Ukraine where explosions continue to be heard in central Kyiv. The first blast came just hours ago, and one official says Russia is now attacking the capital with kamikaze drones. 
 
CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward joins me now from central Kyiv. So, Clarissa, what is the latest on this? 
 
CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So, essentially, Rosemary, people here woke up to the sound of air-raid sirens followed by two loud explosions. Then there were at least another two explosions, and we're right in the center of the city at the location or right next to the location of the impact of one of those blasts. You can probably see behind me there's still a lot of smoke in the air from that explosion. We don't know yet how many people may have been injured or possibly killed in this series of blasts here in the capital. 
 
We did speak to the paramedics who were on the scene. They said five ambulances took wounded away from the scene. But, again, we don't know what exactly was hit or how many people may have been injured or killed as a result, but we do know Russia that has been stepping up its attacks particularly on civilian infrastructure. 
 
And I think what makes today's attack or attacks I should say so notable is that we are hearing from Ukrainian authorities that the weapon of choice here were these so-called kamikaze drones, these Iranian Shahed drones that have been used more and more on the battlefield in the last month or so. 
 
And actually, as we arrived on the scene here, we saw emergency workers carrying away a part of the fin or the wing of one of those drones. And there have been other spotting of sort of remnants or detritus from the drones in different parts of the city. And really what happens in these scenarios where they're using these drones is that you are forced if you're the Ukrainian authorities to expend a lot of air defense in trying to prevent them from landing. 
 
There were small arms fires as people were literally trying to shoot down the drone from the sky before it was able to make impact. But, again, just to recap those main points for you, Rosemary, so far at least four explosions here in Kyiv this morning, more being reported nationwide with the Ukrainian air force saying that they have intercepted more than a dozen of these kamikaze drones so far this morning. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  All right, Clarissa Ward bringing us up-to-date on the situation there, those explosions in Kyiv. We appreciate that report, and of course we'll come back to you when there's more to reveal to our viewers. I appreciate it. 
 
Well, joining me now from Brisbane with his perspective is Mick Ryan, a retired major general with the Australian army. Thank you, sir, for talking with us. 
 
MICK RYAN, RETIRED AUSTRALIAN ARMY:  Thanks, Rosemary. 
 
CHURCH:  I do want to start with these explosions. We heard Clarissa Ward reporting there from Ukraine's capital Kyiv, apparently kamikaze drones. What can you tell us about the capability of these type of drones, and why is Russia attacking Kyiv, a nonmilitary target far from the current front line? 
 
RYAN:  Well, firstly, these are small so they're difficult to detect. They're not very sophisticated drones, and generally of limited utility against military targets that require precision. So, the Russians are using these fairly unsophisticated suicide drives against large targets, large cities. 
 
As you mention, there is no military utility in today's attacks. This is about Putin satisfying the hard liners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones. And it's also about Putin's economic warfare against Ukraine. He thinks that if he does these attacks, he may coerce potential investors from investing in Ukraine because of these attacks. 
 
CHURCH:  And Russian attacks have also been reported in Kherson to the south and to the east with each side making only incremental gains. What do you make of the strategy on each side here? 
 <br>[03:05:07]
 
RYAN:  Well, the Ukrainians clearly have a design where they are hitting Russia with one-two punches. They did so in the east, and then in the south, and then have continued their advances in the east. They certainly haven't gone as quickly as we saw in the last month, but that's pretty natural for this kind of large campaigns. Temporary varies as they resupply and hit more resistance.
 
We've seen more Ukrainian attacks in northern Kherson over the weekend. I expect that will continue. And the Russians at the moment really have lost the initiatives and the momentum. They can only respond to what the Ukrainians are doing, too. 
 
CHURCH:  And in the wake of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko announcing a joint Belarus and Russia regional group of troops. So, we are now seeing increased fears of a deepening of military cooperation between these two allies. How might this change the direction of the war, do you think? 
 
RYAN:  Well, it quite changes significantly, right from before the invasion Belarus hosted Russian forces. Throughout the invasion Belarus has been giving the Russians lots of ammunition particularly artillery ammunition, and they've just provided them with dozens of T72 tanks. 
 
Belarus doesn't have a large military. There are some Christians that had its loyalty to the president under such circumstances. It's unlikely in the short or medium term with this might become another front in the rule (Ph). 
 
CHURCH:  And of course, the big concern right now is the possibility that President Putin will feel cornered, will feel humiliated given the direction of this war and will resort to nuclear weapons. How concerned are you that that might be something that he would do? 
 
RYAN:  Well, just because of the impact that we can always be concerned about these weapons and we should. It's still a fairly low probability at this point in time. I mean, Putin can leave Ukraine without having to use nuclear weapons, but at the end of the day this is about the solidity of his rule of Russia, and I think that will be a large determinant in the use of nuclear weapons even if the probability remains light. 
 
CHURCH:  All right. Mick Ryan, thank you so much for your analysis and for joining us. I appreciate it. 
 
RYAN:  Thank you. 
 
CHURCH:  Well, the U.S. is just 21 days away from the crucial midterm elections in November. Early in-person voting is starting in several states and polling places will open hours from now in Georgia, a state where there are two highly anticipated and heated races. 
 
First in a race that could decide which party controls the Senate, the Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is trying to hold onto his seat against Donald Trump's Republican pick, Herschel Walker. 
 
In the Georgia governor's race, Democrat Stacey Abrams is challenging Republican Governor Brian Kemp in a repeat of their battle four years ago. And a CNN poll of polls finds Americans are almost evenly divided over which party, Democrats or Republicans, should control Congress. 
 
But before any votes are counted some candidates are already casting doubts about the integrity of the upcoming elections. Take a listen to the Republican candidate for governor in Arizona. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  My question is will you accept the results of your election in November? 
 
KARI LAKE (R), ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm going to win the election and I'm going to accept that result. 
 
BASH:  If you lose will you accept that? 
 
LAKE:  I'm going to win the election and I will accept that result. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHURCH:  Well, earlier I spoke with CNN's senior political analyst Ron Brownstein about the upcoming election and how it will affect the battle for democracy in the U.S. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  The magnitude of the threat we are facing to American democracy and its basic functioning is the greatest it has been since the Civil War and maybe ever. I mean, Kari Lake is hardly alone. The analysis by different media organizations have concluded there are literally hundreds -- hundreds of Republican candidates running for office up and down the ballot in November who deny the realities of the 2020 election and parrot Trump's lies about widespread voter fraud. 
 
And there's been a great deal of focus on avoid, you know, on the question of how much threat we face in the 2024 election of a full- scale constitutional crisis. Kari Lake's remarks today were a reminder that those challenges may come as soon as next month if in fact in some of these close races these election deniers refuse to accept the results and try to rally their supporters against him. 
 
CHURCH:  And Ron, meantime President Biden is back in his home state of Delaware after a four-day tour out west in Florida, Oregon, and Colorado. But he didn't include the critical battleground states of Arizona and Nevada. Why not? 
 <br>[03:10:04]
 
BROWNSTEIN:  Well, because President Biden's approval rating in those states is probably too low to be of much help to the Democratic candidates or at least they decided. You know, this, one month out, three weeks out from the election we are in extraordinary circumstance. 
 
Democratic candidates in the statewide races for governor and senator in many cases are levitating above low approval ratings for Biden to a much greater extent that we've seen candidates do for presidents in their own party really for the last 20 to 30 years. 
 
I mean, Arizona and Nevada, Colorado even, Pennsylvania, Georgia, all of these states, Wisconsin, Michigan with critical Senate and governor races, President Biden's approval rating is at 40 percent or below. We just don't have a lot of examples in recent political American history of candidates from the president's party winning midterm election in states where his approval rating is that low. For example, in 2018 Republican Senate candidates lost every state
 
 with Trump's approval rating was at 48 percent or below, much less 40 percent. And the fact that these Democrats are still competing in any cases ahead, in other cases basically even is a testament to how many voters are uneasy about the values of the modern Republican Party. 
 
But it is an open question whether they continue -- whether they continue to escape this undertow for another three weeks, and it remains a, you know, a real challenge for Democrats trying to avoid the worst in November.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
 
CHURCH:  CNN's senior political analyst Ron Brownstein talking to me last hour. 
 
Well, CNN has obtained new video from the January 6th capitol riot that was subpoenaed by the House select committee from British documentary filmmaker Alex Holder. The video you're about to see was never released to the public until Sunday, and you will hear Donald Trump's supporters rallying behind the former president. A warning some of this footage includes graphic language.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNKNOWN:  I've never in my life been so angry at 534 pieces of shit up here. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes.
 
UNKNOWN:  They're the roaches in the capitol. We've got to get the roaches out. All of them, every one of them. They have turned against us. 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNKNOWN:  Exterminate. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Exterminate. And I never thought I would be this mad at a country that I was so proud of.
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes. 
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes.
 
UNKNOWN:  It pisses me off, but I'm proud to be here. I'm so happy everybody is here. 
 
UNKNOWN:  This is unity. 
 
UNKNOWN:  That's right. 
 
UNKNOWN:  And I'm proud to call him my president. He's the best thing that ever happened to this country. And you know what? I'm going to stand by him to the end. 
 
UNKNOWN:  That's right.
 
UNKNOWN:  You go, girl. 
 
UNKNOWN:  That's right.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
UNKNOWN:  That's -- 
 
UNKNOWN:  I'll tell you these are demon possessed men up here. They're trying to take over our country with --
 
UNKNOWN:  Yes.
 
UNKNOWN:  -- communist China. 
 
UNKNOWN:  We won't bite them. They say --
 
(CROSSTALK) 
 
UNKNOWN:  You know Pence is bad, right? 
 
CROWD:  USA! USA!
 
UNKNOWN:  Pence is bad.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
 
CHURCH:  And this new video rounds out a week that saw the last public hearing of the January 6th committee before the midterm elections. That hearing on Thursday ended with a dramatic flourish, a unanimous vote subpoena Donald Trump. The question now of course will he comply? Listen as two members of the committee weigh in.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  We haven't decided that. You know, we're -- we expect him to come in because he has a legal obligation to come in. Of course, he also had a legal obligation to see that the laws were faithfully executed, which he completely ignored on January 6th. So, we'll see. 
 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF ANCHOR, ABC NEWS:  You say he's obligated to respond to the subpoena. Do you believe that the Justice Department if the president refuses should hold him in criminal contempt? 
 
REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL):  Look, that's a -- that's a bridge we cross if we have to get there. You know, look, we will recognize the fact that because of the committee only being able to exist until the end of this congressional year because that was the mandate. We're in a bit of a time limit here, and as we're wrapping up the investigation, we're also pursuing new leads, in fact, and we want to speak to the president.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH:  Closing arguments begin today in the trial about the infamous
 
 Trump-Russia dossier. It is a case that hasn't delivered the kind of Watergate level bombshells that former President Donald Trump insisted would be revealed. On Friday, a federal judge threw out one of five charges against the primary source for the dossier. 
 
The latest now from CNN's Marshall Cohen. 
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER:  The trial against the primary source for the Trump-Russia dossier continues Monday with closing arguments and likely jury deliberations. This case has been brought by special counsel John Durham who, for the past three and half years has been looking for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. 
 <br>[03:15:06]
 
He hasn't brought many indictments on that front, but he did charge the primary source of the dossier, a Russian expat and former think tank analyst named Igor Danchenko. Now, Durham originally charged Danchenko with five counts of lying to the FBI during interviews in 2017 when FBI agents were trying to corroborate that infamous and explosive Trump-Russia dossier, which was put together by a former a British spy in Christopher Steele. 
 
Durham alleges that Danchenko lied during those interviews which formed the basis of his prosecution today. However, on Friday, a federal judge threw out one of the five counts against Danchenko saying that Durham had not presented enough evidence to convict Dandencho and that it would be wrong to let that part of the case move forward to the jury. 
 
What that means there are four charges left. The jury will likely will begin its deliberations on Monday. The stakes are very high. There have only been three prosecutions to come out of the three yearlong Durham investigation. One of them was a guilty plea of a low-level FBI attorney who avoided jail. The second trial ended in an acquittal earlier nice year, which is a pretty rare feat where prosecution where conviction rates are very high. 
 
So, it's all up to this jury to see how the Durham investigation is going to come to a close. CNN has previously reported that Durham is winding down his work, preparing a final report which will be submitted to the attorney general for review and public release. 
 
Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington. 
 
CHURCH:  The British treasury says the public will learn more about the government's medium term fiscal plan in the coming hours. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt is expected to make a statement and address the House of Commons later today. 
 
This follows conversations over the weekend between the chancellor and the prime minister about the U.K.'s struggling economy and high cost of living. The treasury says the chancellor meshed with the governor of the Bank of England and the head of the debt management office Sunday night. The full medium term fiscal plan is due to be released two weeks from today. 
 
And still to come, we are learning much more about a fire that killed at least four prisoners inside a prison in Iran. We'll have the details just ahead. 
 <br>[03:20:00]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH:  It's been one month since anti-government protesters stormed the streets of Iran after the death of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. Mahsa Amini died last month after being detained by Iran's so-called morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code for women. Her death has ignited one of the biggest uprisings towards Iran's Islamist regime in years, and Tehran has responded by unleashing a brutal and deadly crackdown on demonstrators. 
 
At the same time, we are learning more about a fire inside an Iranian prison. Iran's state media says eight prisoners died and dozens of others were injured in Saturday's blaze. 
 
For more on this we want to bring in CNN's Nada Bashir, she joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Nada. So what new details are you learning about the fire? 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  Look, Rosemary, as you see that the death toll from this fire over the weekend is still rising. We know that dozens of others were also injured in the fire, and we are now learning a few more details from pro-reform outlets and organizations about what may have taken place at Evin prison, that notorious complex in Tehran which has been known to hold hundreds of political prisoners. 
 
We're talking about journalists, human rights activists, political activists, professors, writers and even film directors and producers who have been detained in this brutal complex by the Iranian regime often for their defiance against the regime.
 
But of course, that fire, the videos of the black plumes of smoke emerging from the prison complex of the weekend has been a huge concern to many. We have learned from the pro-reform outlet IranWire which has been speaking to sources within the prison over the weekend that they were told that a revolt had taken place in part of the complex and that a fire had later ensued. Although we did also hear from the Iranian authorities over the weekend who blamed the blaze on rioters and said that this had been quickly brought under control and that the fire had taken place at a clothing warehouse on the complex. 
 
But numerous human rights organizations have raised concerns. We've heard from those pro-reform organizations who have been in touch with people within the prison as well as family members of notable detainees who have been detailing what they have been hearing from their relative and loved ones who are still held in the prison complex. Many of them detailing the use of tear gas within the prison complex
 
 on prisoners, many of them having to break their windows just to be able to breathe, and there was real, you know, shows of real devastation within the prison, real concern detailed by those still detained in the complex.
 
Now, of course this does come off the back of weeks and weeks of protests in Iran. We did hear from the Iranian authorities and from the security officials who was careful to say that this was not in connection to those protests, although the details are still very much unclear. 
 
But of course, there has been a brutal and deadly crackdown by the Iranian regime on any sign of dissent. And we heard over the weekend from the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi blaming the unrest that we've seen on the U.S. Take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  It is our belief that America is behind the majority of destruction, terror, riots, and chaos in the region and the world. 
 <br>[03:25:02]
 
It affirms our belief and the world's beliefs that Americans are angered and upset by every innovation, every happiness or good that happens to Iran. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
BASHIR:  And look, we've heard widespread condemnation from members of the international community. Over the weekend we've heard from President Biden, from the U.S. State Department spokesperson, Ned Price as well as the E.U.'s chief diplomat Josep Borrell all saying they are monitoring what has taken place at the Evin prison with a sense of urgency and also reminding the Iranian regime that they are responsible for those detained within that complex, and in particular those foreign nationals detained within the prison complex. 
 
So, there is still rising concern, and we are, of course, still waiting for more details on what exactly caused that fire. 
 
CHURCH:  All right. Nada Bashir, joining us live from London with that update. Many thanks. 
 
And still to come, 10 years in power and no end in sight, Xi Jinping's plan to make China great again has setup the authoritarian ruler to tighten his grip on power. We'll have more on the other side of the break. Stay with us. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. We are continuing to follow developments out of Ukraine where at least four explosions have rocked the capital and officials report the attacks are ongoing. The first blast in Kyiv was heard just hours ago, and one official
 
 says Russia is attacking the capital with kamikaze drones. The Kyiv city military administration says a residential building in a central district was hit. So far there's no word on any casualties. 
 <br>[03:30:01]
 
And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us live now from London with more on this. So, Clare, what are you learning about these kamikaze drone strikes on the Ukrainian capital this morning?
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Rosemary, kamikaze drone has become increasingly part of Russia's playbook in recent weeks, particularly over the past week as we saw this uptick in deadly attacks on various cities across the country. These are suicide drones. They are disposable. They essentially sort of go behind enemy lines and then destroyed in the attack.
 
One Ukrainian military official last week described (INAUDIBLE) operating like a match. They said (INAUDIBLE) start a fire where they hit. They've been used by Russia in the past week and earlier than that to target critical infrastructures, things like the electricity grid and those types of things. So, that was what they've been used for.
 
U.S. Intelligence revealed, of course, over the summer that Russia had started to look at and buy and even have its forces trained in using this Iranian Shahed drones, which Ukraine has said this morning is what was used in this attack on Kyiv.
 
But, of course, this is partly why Ukraine is now calling so much for new air defense systems to be provided. They're also working on their own technology to combat these drones. They are having some success. Ukrainian air force this morning said that overnight, Sunday into Monday, it has shut down 26 of these Iranian Shahed drones in the south of the country. Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  And Clare, meantime, NATO and Russia intend to hold separate long-planned exercises with their nuclear forces despite increased tensions as the war in Ukraine grinds on. What more are you learning about that?
 
SEBASTIAN:  Yeah, (INAUDIBLE) is going ahead with these exercises, as we understand it. NATO is to kick off Monday with what is known as steadfast noon, its exercises are called. They are to involve 14 countries, around 60 aircrafts, including (INAUDIBLE) bombers from the United States.
 
And defense officials in the U.S. believe that Russia's own exercises known as Grom, which roughly translates as Thunder, will happen before the end of the month. These are also long-planned and set to go ahead. But this, of course, comes at a very delicate moment, much more delicate than usual when it comes to this nuclear deterrence because of the saber-rattling that we've heard from Russia over its own nuclear capabilities. President Putin, of course, while annexing or announcing the
 
 annexation of those four territories in Ukraine, pledging to defend them with all means just a week or so ago. You know, this is something that the U.S. officials have been addressing.
 
The National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is saying that there is no gray area when it comes to a nuclear strike. There is no usage or type of nuclear weapon that is considered more or less dangerous. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  The use of the nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine is the use of a nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, and we are not going to slice the salami. So, the notion that somehow there are differences in use here, I think, is a dangerous notion from our perspective.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
SEBASTIAN:  The U.S. and NATO allies are, of course, will be closely monitoring these exercises when they happen in Russia for any deviation from the normal course of things. Rosemary?
 
CHURCH:  All right, Clare Sebastian joining us live from London, many thanks for that update.
 
Well, China's communist leaders and political elite have gathered for day two of the 20th Party Congress. Xi Jinping opened this event on Sunday, like he has in the past, laying out his nationalistic vision for the country's future. But this year is unlike any other because after 10 years in power, Xi Jinping is poised to be selected for an unprecedented third term as party leader.
 
Well, this is a watershed moment for China. By the time the Communist Party Congress ends on Saturday, Xi Jinping is expected to hold the tightest grip on power since the days of Mao Zedong.
 
Now, CNN's Ivan Watson explores how these two leaders shaped modern China.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Throughout the 73-year history of Communist China, two strongman leaders stand above everyone else. Founding father Mao Zedong ruled with an iron it's until his death. And now, Xi Jinping is expected to give himself that same right. Two unflinching authoritarians bookending years of tremendous change.
 
In his decade on top, Xi has worked to reshape the Communist Party in his own image and reassert its dominance and every facet of Chinese society just like Mao did after 1949.
 
After winning China's brutal civil war, Mao wasted no time with his revolutionary overhaul of the world's most populous nation. [03:35:03]
 
WATSON (voice-over):  But his new regime wasn't capable of creating a promised socialist utopia. Instead, the poorly planned greatly forward (ph) led to three years of famine. Beijing ordered farmers off their fields and into factories and yet industrial modernization did not follow.
 
Millions more died in the years after 1966 when Mao launched the cultural revolution, sending the People's Liberation Army and brainwash mobs against anyone perceived to be a political enemy.
 
Mao's death drove the country into a political, economic, and ideological U-turn. Deng Xiaoping, a peer of Mao, emerged as the new paramount leader, and he changed course for China. To get rich is glorious, he said. Deng (INAUDIBLE) planned economy for a more open market, inviting the world to invest. Deng unshackled China's economy, but not the Chinese people.
 
In 1989, when thousands protested in and around Tiananmen Square for democracy, Deng's troops crushed them. It is a history still denied by Beijing and one which Deng's successor, Jiang Zemin, struggled to live down. The flamboyant Jiang maintained Deng's economic reforms, ushering an age of breakneck growth and joining the World Trade Organization. Jiang also weathered criticism on China's human rights record.
 
China's coming out party is a global power and economic juggernaut took place during the tenure of China's next ruler, Hu Jintao, usually stoic, welcomed the world to Beijing in 2008 for the Olympic games. Hu oversaw China's continuing economic success while many around the world hoped that with greater wealth would come greater freedom.
 
But as Xi Jinping's China hosted his own Beijing Olympics earlier this year, the opened China many had hoped for now all but forgotten. Son of economist dynasty, Xi and his brand of nationalism pitched China once again against the west with tensions running especially high across the Taiwan Strait.
 
The Chinese economy gasping for air as it's once vibrant private sector sputters under constant government threat. The Chinese people increasingly censored and monitored, with millions placed under sudden lockdown for weeks or even months in the name of zero tolerance for COVID infections.
 
Xi also oversees the arbitrary detention of over one million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the past few years in China's far west where the United States say a genocide is happening. China denies this. It says that they are at vocational training centers.
 
Among Xi Jinping's favorite slogans, the realization of the Chinese dream. But many fear his vision and policies may bring more nightmares in the coming years.

CHURCH:  Well, crowds gathered in the West Bank Sunday for a funeral procession to bury a Palestinian man reportedly killed by Israeli soldiers last week. CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now from Jerusalem with more on the latest clashes. So, Hadas, over the weekend, we also saw Palestine's prime minister make a very rare visit to Jenin. Who did he meet and what was the significance of this?
 
HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Rosemary, first, I want to give a sense of the situation right now on the ground. Jerusalem has actually been quiet over the last day or so after a very tense week last week where we saw clashes erupting almost nightly in east Jerusalem and in the West Bank, although we continue to see Israeli military raids to
 
 target militants.
 
This is a continuation of a policy we've seen now for months where these Israeli military is going into militant hot spots like Jenin and Nablus on almost a daily basis. This has been the most violent year, the most deadly year for both Palestinians and Israelis since 2015.
 
Just to give you an idea of what we're dealing with, it's only October and there are still few months left in the year and there's a lot of fears that this is just going to continue and grow and become the deadliest year and beat the 2015 record.
 
In terms of the Palestinian authority, Prime Mohammed Shtayyeh, it was very unusual to see him in Jenin. Jenin is a town in the northern West Bank, really known as a militant hot spot where the Palestinian authority essentially feels as though they have no control, no influence. And what we saw when Mohammed Shtayyeh was there, he was standing next to the families of Palestinians who have been killed by the Israeli military.
 <br>[03:39:55]
 
GOLD:  Some of these are known militants, including one of them, he was standing next to the father of the man who carried out an attack on a very popular Tel-Aviv bar in April, killing three people. This was seen as very significant.
 
We see Palestinian authority which has a security cooperation agreement with Israel where they are supposed to be working together to help target militants standing in a militant stronghold and expressing support for them.
 
He said, as part of a speech, he said that Israel does not want and finances its electoral campaign with Palestinian blood every day, and saying that their lives -- and saying that the Palestinian blood is not cheap and that their lives are cheap when the homeland is the title (ph).
 
So, Mohammed Shtayyeh, the Palestinian authority prime minister being there, seen as a big snub to Israel but also seen as a way to try to garner support from the Palestinians in the street by showing support for honestly some people who in Palestinian society are more popular than the Palestinian authority.
 
The Palestinian authority in recent years, according to polling, is becoming increasingly unpopular. Palestinian authority President Mahmoud Abbas is being seen as increasingly unpopular. People want him to step aside. There have not been elections in the Palestinian territories for more than 10 years.
 
Now, on the Israeli side, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid reportedly held a security cabinet meeting where they're debating, taking on a bigger operation in the west to try to target some of these militant groups, including some of the new militant groups that are popping up that have no formal affiliation with the well-known ones like Hamas or the (INAUDIBLE). Rosemary? 
 
CHURCH:  All right, Hadas Gold joining us live from Jerusalem, many thanks.
 
And just ahead, as prices go up, so the concerns about food insecurity. We will show you how a food pantry at a local church is helping families cope with the constant price hikes. Back with that in just a moment.

CHURCH:  Residents of Jackson, Mississippi are being hit with massive water bills in the middle of a months-long water crisis. One woman tells CNN she was shocked when the city sent her a bill for nearly $4,000. She says the tap water is still brown and the pressure low, a problem many families in the city are facing since the water plant underwent repairs.
 
The Jackson City Council president says water billing -- quote -- "has been a shortcoming of the city for way too long" and is asking residents to reach out to the city if they believe their bill is incorrect.
 
Another issue Americans are facing nationwide is food insecurity. It's a problem that gets worse as inflation keeps rising. CNN's Nadia Romero spent the day at a church that operates a food panty outside of Atlanta. They're now seeing thousands more cars than they used to.

NADIA ROMERO, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hundreds of families lined up for help. Some of them for hours before this drive- through food pantry started at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in a suburb of Atlanta over the weekend. 
 
DR. JAMAL BRYANT, SENIOR PASTOR, NEW BIRTH MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH: You have absolutely no idea how many people are suffering in silence, having no clue as to how they're going to feed and take care of their families. 
 
ROMERO (voice-over):  Every Saturday since January 2020, back then, just 30 cars per week. But now, up to 3,000 cars a week. The pandemic and rising inflation providing a one-two punch on people's wallets.
 
UNKNOWN:  It is the pandemic and everything is going up.
 
UNKNOWN:  Double and triple. I paid 85 cents a dozen for eggs, and now they're $3. It's crazy.
 
UNKNOWN:  Really ridiculous, you know? You go to the supermarket and things get expensive.
 
ROMERO (voice-over):  Food prices are more than alarming, especially for families living paycheck to paycheck. Last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing just how much staple goods will cost you this year compared to 2021. Bread jumped 16%. Milk up 17%. Flour 23% more expensive. And egg prices with the most dramatic increase, up nearly 40%. Inflation a big talking point on the campaign trail as we near the midterm elections.
 
UNKNOWN:  Had a budget in a way that doesn't run away -- create runaway inflation.
 
SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  The out of control inflation --
 
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Inflation is a global problem.
 
ROMERO (voice-over):  Off the campaign trail and back to the food line, Priscilla Ward and her sister, Brenda Billings, getting the surprise of a lifetime. The sisters are the one-million family who came to drive-through pantry at this church since January 2020.
 
Ward her sister will take home healthy produce, small appliances, and a $1,000 cash prize for helping the church hit this mark. Ward says she has several growing grandchildren she helps feed.
 
PRISCILLA WARD, FOOD PANTY RECIPIENT:  They walk in the door, grandma, I'm hungry. So, I'll say, well, let me see what grandma got. They always say, grandma, you already have something.
 
ROMERO (voice-over):  For her sister, it has been a rough few years.
 
BRENDA BILLINGS, FOOD PANTY RECIPIENT:  I had cancer, twice. Colon cancer and breast cancer. I'm a cancer survivor. And right now, God brought me a whole lot.
 
ROMERO (voice-over):  Tears and cheers as these two special recipients and others get the help they need from this church and partners like World Vision.
 
BRYANT:  My grandmother taught me a principle that when it's family, it's not charity.
 
ROMERO (on camera):  When it comes to inflation on the campaign trail for Republicans, it's very simple. Their message is that the rising inflation issue is to blame President Biden and Democrats. But when Democrats are asked about inflation on the campaign trail, many of them say it's a problem with supply chain issues and corporate greed. But we now from a recent CNN poll that this is a very important issue for voters.

CHURCH:  A new type of "cold war" may be making waves in the Arctic. Boris Sanchez will tell us why the melting ice cap could heat up international tensions. You're watching "CNN Newsroom."

CHURCH:  A new type of "cold war" may be on the horizon, as we hear from CNN's Boris Sanchez. This time, the issue is the melting Arctic. Which nations will control what could become the world's newest ocean?
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
SEN. ANGUS KING, U.S. SENATE INDEPENDENT:  This new ocean is appearing on our maps and it has all kinds of different implications, and we've been slow to pick up on it, frankly.
 
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Maine Senator Angus King says climate change is unlocking a new crossroads and potential center of conflict, the Arctic, where irreversible trends are leading to a global rush, with world powers seeking untapped energy supplies: oil and natural gas, minerals, fishing, recreation, and highly-coveted shipping routes. 
 
KING:  And if you think about the Mediterranean Sea, there were thousand years of war to determine the relationships of those countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The question is, can we open the arctic and avoid the conflict?
 
SANCHEZ (on camera):  By some estimates, 75% of Arctic ice has disappeared in the last quarter century. In fact, some scientists believe we could see summers without any ice blocking the north pole within the next dozen years.
 
All that extra space means more shipping lanes and faster shipping times. We could see some shipping routes reduce by up to 15 days. That is a huge economic advantage. Keep in mind, though, Russia owns more than half of the coastline in the Arctic. According to this graphic by the American Security Project, they have been steadily building it up militarily for years with dozens of new bases and old retrofitted Soviet ones, as well.
 <br>[03:55:04] 
 
ANGUS:  If there is a conflict with Russia, it's one of the ways that Russia would come at us. I believe, unfortunately, we need to have some response to that, not in a complex situation but just in a defensive situation.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over):  CNN got a firsthand look at Russia's northernmost outpost in 2021. Although the Kremlin insisted its intentions for the region were peaceful at the time, that was before the invasion of Ukraine.
 
UNKNOWN:  There has been speculation that Vladimir Putin might resort to using a nuclear weapon to reassert dominance.
 
KING:  And one of the possibilities is exploding it over the Arctic Ocean as a demonstration.
 
UNKNOWN:  The Arctic is crucial to the America's foreign policy and national security.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over):  Well King applauds the Biden administration's new national strategy for the region, the co-chair of the Arctic Caucus says more will need to be done. 
 
UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Russia has like 40 icebreakers, not one.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over):  As other nations, not even geographically close to the Arctic like China and India, lay out their ambitions, Senator King wants a stronger naval presence there, more robust military infrastructure, and a commitment to international treaties like the U.N. Law of the Sea, steps, he believes, that could deter a possible war. 
 
KING:  I don't know. I think the jury is out on that. But it's at least possible. I think it would be positive for America and the whole world.
 
SANCHEZ (voice-over):  Boris Sanchez, CNN, Washington.
