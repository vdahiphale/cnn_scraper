ZAIN ASHER, CNN HOST: All right. Coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher.
 
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN HOST: And I'm Bianna Golodryga. You are watching ONE WORLD.
 
Well, in just a matter of hours, the U.S. president will step onto the national stage and into the history books and deliver the most 
 
 consequential speech of her political career.
 
ASHER: That's right. Kamala Harris will formally accept her party's nomination for the president on the final night of the Democratic National 
 
 Convention in Chicago, becoming the first woman of color ever to do so.
 
In her pitch to America, Harris expected to offer the country a new vision and a new beginning one filled with hope, optimism and freedom for all.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. It's no small task for a woman who has only been a presidential candidate for one month. It's hard to believe one month it has 
 
 been, what a year it has been.
 
Energy, enthusiasm and excitement to have dominated this year's DNC and Wednesday was no exception.
 
ASHER: Yes. The night belonged to Tim Walz, but there was one overriding theme that was really difficult to miss, I think.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joy.
 
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Joy. Joy. Joy.
 
ORPAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: Joy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Walz formally accepted the vice presidential nomination for his party. And at one point, during his keynote speech, he praised his family. 
 
 That resulted in this really emotional moment when his 17-year-old son, Gus, stood up and with tears in his eyes and mouth.
 
Oh, there you see it. That's my dad. That's my dad. Oh.
 
GOLODRYGA: This is like the 20th time I've watched that and I'm still tearing up. It was Walz's first big opportunity to really introduce himself 
 
 to America and he did it very effectively in about --
 
ASHER: Right.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- 15 minutes, a rather short speech.
 
During his speech, the former football coach gave the crowd a pep talk and used this sport's metaphor to convey a real sense of urgency.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's the fourth quarter. We're down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the 
 
 ball. We're driving down the field.
 
And boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced and Kamala Harris is ready.
 
Our job. Our job. Our job. Our job for everyone watching is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling.
 
(MUSIC)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. The third night of the DNC also saw heavy hitters in the entertainment industry show up and force and demonstrate their support for 
 
 the Harris-Walz ticket, including one of the world's most famous women.
 
Oprah Winfrey made a passionate plea to Americans and stressed the need to move forward, not backwards.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WINFREY: We won't be set back, pushed back, bullied back, kicked back, we're not going back.
 
Together, let's all choose Kamala Harris.
 
(CROWD CHEERING)
 
Thank you, Chicago. Thank you.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: CNN's Kevin Liptak joins us live now from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
 
You know, aside from that really memorable moment between Tim Walz and, of course, his son, Gus, mouthing, that's my dad. You said you watched it 
 
 multiple times. It makes everybody teary-eyed.
 
I think the other memorable moment was, of course, that clip from Oprah Winfrey. And, of course, when she said -- 
 
KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes.
 
ASHER: -- we have to choose common sense over nonsense. I'm sure we're going to see that on bumper stickers across America.
 
But just -- 
 
LIPTAK: Yes.
 
ASHER: -- in terms of the speakers, you know, a lot of people came close, and there were a lot of great speakers last night, but nobody quite managed 
 
 to light up the crowd, Kevin, as well as Oprah Winfrey did. Although that shouldn't be any surprise to no one.
 
LIPTAK: I thought you -- I thought we were going to hear you say, and you get a vote, and you get a vote. Everyone look under their seat. She didn't 
 
 say that, but I could have easily imagined her say that here in her the city that really propelled her to television stardom here in Chicago.
 
Yes. No one got a reception quite like Oprah. And it was a surprise, even to a lot of people in the audience.
 <br>[12:05:01]
 
And I thought it was funny. They tried to keep her so under wraps. She came in to do her practice yesterday, and she was wearing a hat, sunglasses, and 
 
 a mask, and she went up to Nancy Pelosi to say hi and Nancy Pelosi had no idea who she was. So they really tried to keep an element of surprise to 
 
 this whole event.
 
But it was -- it was Tim Walz, I think, that also kind of stole the show, kind of really trying to act as an envoy from the Democratic Party to all 
 
 these disillusioned voters who just may not see a place for themselves within the democratic ranks.
 
He's trying to say, you know, I'm a guy who hunts, I'm a guy who fishes, I wear flannel, I coach football. If I can be a part of this party, so can 
 
 you. And I think that is what Democrats are really looking for him to do, as they try and gain steam with some of these people who have just been 
 
 fleeing the party over the last couple of elections, you know, white, rural, particularly men, voters who they think that he can really appeal 
 
 to.
 
You know, that moment with his son Gus was, you know, that vision of filial pride that so many people can relate to. And he is really trying to use his 
 
 biography. We didn't hear much from him about his time in Congress or his time as governor. It was really his biography that they're essentially 
 
 trying to use to appeal to democratic voters.
 
But tonight, it's -- it is really all about Kamala Harris, really making the most important speech of her entire political career.
 
And we do know that she's been preparing behind the scenes. She has been working on the speech essentially from the moment that Joe Biden stepped 
 
 down as the democratic nominee.
 
She's actually probably been preparing before that. She was going to deliver a speech at this convention no matter what.
 
She is going to strike three big themes. One is obviously to introduce herself to American voters. She also wants to draw the contrast with Donald 
 
 Trump present a forward-looking vision compared to the darker one that he has espoused. And she wants to talk about patriotism, talk about being a 
 
 president for all Americans.
 
The goal really is to turn the swell of momentum that she came into this convention with and turn it into a movement that will propel her into 
 
 November.
 
And I think that does kind of get at the undercurrent to this entire convention. And when you talk to delegates, and particularly when you talk 
 
 to Democratic officials who are here this week, there is a question about what happens next.
 
At the end of the day, what Democrats are doing here is totally impressive. And there is no playbook for replacing your nominee 100 days before the 
 
 election going on to win.
 
And so, you know, when the balloons drop tonight, and I can see the balloons behind me. Tomorrow morning whenever everyone is at O'Hare flying 
 
 home. That is a question of how this election moves forward.
 
Certainly, they've gotten off to a great start. This has been a euphoric convention, but there is some real work for them to do ahead.
 
ASHER: Yes. That's what a lot of people are saying that, yes, of course there is so much enthusiasm, but how do you translate that into actual 
 
 votes?
 
Michelle Obama saying, listen, stop scrolling and just get to the polls. You need to do something. 
 
LIPTAK: Yes.
 
ASHER: That was the message there.
 
Kevin Liptak live for us there. Thanks so much.
 
ASHER: All right. There were several other highlights at the DNC Wednesday night.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. As you've seen, Oprah Winfrey, who often avoids politics, urged independent voters to back Kamala Harris.
 
And former president Bill Clinton, who left office almost 25 years ago. Listen, when he spoke, the whole audience was quiet and he spoke longer.
 
ASHER: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: His anticipated speech, which he typically does. He pointed out that he is younger today than Donald Trump.
 
And the top Democrat in the House said America needs to treat Trump like a bad ex-boyfriend.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JEFFRIES: Donald Trump is like an old boyfriend, who you broke up with, but he just won't go away. He has spent the last four years spinning the block, 
 
 trying to get back into a relationship with the American people.
 
Bro, we broke up with you for a reason.
 
We broke up with you for a reason. Donald Trump can spin the block all he wants, but there's no reason for us to ever get back together. Been there, 
 
 done that, we're not going back.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: That's a side of a Hakeem Jeffries I don't think we've ever seen before.
 
ASHER: That theme of not going back -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
ASHER: -- continuing throughout the DNC. The convention also heard from some unlikely attendees, Republicans, who say they're breaking with their 
 
 party and that they are instead backing Kamala Harris. Take a listen.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
OLIVIA TROYE, FORMER ADVISER TO MIKE PENCE: So to my fellow Republicans, you aren't voting for a Democrat, you're voting for democracy.
 
GEOFF DUNCAN, FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you're not a Democrat. You're a patriot.
 <br>[12:10:01]
 
To my fellow Republicans at home that want to pivot back towards policy, empathy and tone, you know the right thing to do. 
 
Now let's have the courage to do it in November.
 
(CROWD CHEERING)
 
GOLODRYGA: So let's now bring in another Republican who says he simply cannot vote for Donald Trump. We're joined by our friend, former 
 
 Congressman and CNN senior political commentator Adam Kinzinger.
 
It is worth noting that Adam will have a prominent speaking role tonight at the Democratic Convention.
 
Adam, goes without saying the bar is very high, my friend, after what we've heard -- 
 
ADAM KINZINGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I know.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- from Geoff Duncan yesterday.
 
KINZINGER: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: I mean, listen, I don't know why you're talking to us and not preparing because he really blew the crowd away. And what he was able to do 
 
 was really personalized and humanize his decision to step away from his party, for now, in order to save it.
 
I know the same applies for you. And in terms of what we're expected to hear from you tonight, you've spoken for years now about what a threat you 
 
 think Donald Trump is for the party, for democracy, for the country.
 
But just on that personal note, as Geoff referenced a coaster that he received from his son telling him that he was doing the right thing.
 
For you, I know you said after you voted for Trump in 2020, you felt dirty. And then you went on to say, it was not something that I can square away in 
 
 my soul fully.
 
And I'm wondering if that's still with you, that feeling of squaring that vote away in your soul fully and if we'll hear some of that tonight.
 
KINZINGER: No. Look, I wish I wouldn't have voted for him, but I also recognize that immediately after I did. I didn't vote for him in '16. I'm 
 
 literally the only guy in America that like didn't vote for him in '16 and did in '20.
 
And so, you know, yes, it was kind of strange, right, especially after everything we knew.
 
But, for me, it's just really this burning passion in my soul, not only to try to save the GOP. That's a secondary move for me. I'd love to see the 
 
 GOP come back to the party that we all kind of remember that actually stood for something, but mainly because of this country.
 
I mean, look, I just had a month ago, somebody that I had known since I was 19 years old that texted me, blaming me for the attempted assassination on 
 
 Donald Trump because I'm out talking bad about Donald Trump.
 
I mean, the damage that Donald Trump has done not just to our politics but to our families, to our friendships. This is a cancer that has to go away. 
 
 And I'm -- I feel that burning passion to continue to fight to just destroy this cancer in our country and the politics of our country.
 
ASHER: Adam, Zain here. We've come a long way since Hillary Clinton's basket of deplorables comment eight years ago. And when you think about the 
 
 sort of theme that we've seen this week, there has been this conscious effort among Democrats, I think, this week to really separate Donald Trump 
 
 from his supporters.
 
And specifically when talking about his supporters saying things like, listen, they might not think the way you do, they might not vote the way 
 
 you do, they might not worship the way you do, but let's get rid of the separation and division in this country. Obviously, this is something that 
 
 has been really thought out by Democrats.
 
Is it a message do you think that's really going to resonate with the other side, especially among independents?
 
KINZINGER: I think you -- look, I think it's going to resonate among parts of the other side.
 
Look, there is -- you know, I know Republicans well. A significant amount of them are actually sold, you know, heart and soul on Donald Trump, so 
 
 they're not the audience.
 
But the audience is the 20 percent of Republicans that continue to vote for Nikki Haley even after she dropped out, the independence that may be 
 
 conservative but a little uncomfortable with the GOP.
 
And I think to, frankly, the Democratic Party this week has sent a strong message. I got to tell you, first off, I was shocked to find out I would be 
 
 speaking Thursday night before Kamala, right? That's a good deal, OK?
 
ASHER: I was a little surprised too, if I'm honest.
 
KINZINGER: Yes. I was like, did you -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: Got a typo, Adam?
 
KINZINGER: I was like, are there two Adam Kinzingers or what?
 
ASHER: And I mean that with love. I mean that with love, Adam.
 
KINZINGER: I am too. I was like -- I was like, wait, is there another Adam Kinzinger or something? Because I'm probably speaking at noon on Monday, 
 
 but no.
 
And then you look at the fact that every night there's been Republican speakers. So it's not just -- you know, typically in these in the past, 
 
 they jam all the GOP speakers into one night to kind of get it out of the way.
 
This has been a conscious effort. And look, we're not here expecting the Democrats to become Republicans, but we're here to say, look, there are 
 
 bigger issues in front of us. And one of those just support for freedom and democracy and getting rid of the division in this country.
 
I think they've done an awesome job. And again, I'm sad to have to go after Geoff, but hopefully I can live up to that.
 
ASHER: Yes.
 
GOLODRYGA: I'm telling you, once again, Adam, that bar is very high.
 
KINZINGER: I know.
 
GOLODRYGA: We know and the Trump campaign knows and they've said as much that following these conventions, the candidate and the campaign get a 
 
 bump, right? They're still at sugar high riding.
 
And we have seen Kamala Harris actually close the gaps in a lot of those swing state polls and then some of them actually now lead Donald Trump. She 
 
 says though that she is still the candidate who is coming from behind.
 <br>[12:15:05]
 
I'm wondering now for the -- how many? Seventy-plus days that are remaining to sort of paraphrase what we heard from Coach Walz that, you know, you can 
 
 rest when you're dead.
 
What will you be doing to energize those voters, to reach out to those voters who are not happy with Donald Trump but aren't really confident yet 
 
 or don't know much about Kamala Harris or feel that they just can't vote for a Democrat? What will you be doing these next three months to change 
 
 their mind?
 
KINZINGER: Yes. Look, I mean, I'm sure I'll be doing some traveling. I, you know, I don't intend to do this full-time. But when there's really 
 
 important things that I may be able to show up for to kind of help, I'll do that.
 
I'll continue obviously through just, you know, when I do media and when I do my own social outreach to talk about this stuff, I have an organization, 
 
 Country First, that works on this kind of stuff as well. So that'll be my focus.
 
And I think it's very smart for the Democrats to understand they are still the underdogs. Because of our weird Electoral College system, a Democrat 
 
 has to win the popular vote by two or three percent, which is about where Kamala is in the polls today to have a shot at winning the Electoral 
 
 College.
 
And so this is by no means over. I think certainly Kamala is in a much better position than we've seen the Democrats in in a long time.
 
And I'll just be part of whatever that process is to just tell people, look -- and the other thing, if you can't stomach voting for Kamala, I get it. 
 
 Just, you know, you -- it's OK to write somebody in on a presidential line, if you feel your country hasn't given you options to support. I think 
 
 that's at least half a victory.
 
Because we just can't continue to tolerate the kind of, frankly, divisive stuff that Donald Trump has brought here.
 
GOLODRYGA: Adam, you know I'm just kidding with you, and I tell you the bar is very high. Every time we have you on this show -- 
 
KINZINGER: Oh, it is high.
 
GOLODRYGA: Every time we have you on this show, Zain and I say to each other how wonderful you are and how impressive -- 
 
KINZINGER: Oh, thank you.
 
GOLODRYGA: -- your contributions are to our segment. So I know you'll knock it out of the park.
 
ASHER: I bet one thing you never thought that you'd be doing in your life is speaking at the DNC right before Kamala Harris.
 
KINZINGER: You know, if you quantum leaped me back -- 
 
ASHER: Ain't that funny?
 
KINZINGER: -- for years and interviewed me, it would be like, what do you mean the DNC? You mean the RNC? Nope. Quantum leap three years forward. 
 
 Here I am.
 
ASHER: Oh, my gosh.
 
GOLODRYGA: And we'll be watching.
 
ASHER: Yes. I can't -- I can't -- 
 
KINZINGER: Awesome.
 
ASHER: -- wait to see. I can't wait to watch your speech.
 
KINZINGER: Awesome.
 
Adam Kinzinger live for us there. Thank you so much.
 
KINZINGER: Thank you. You bet. See you guys.
 
ASHER: All right. There was another really emotional moment from the DNC. The parents of an American Israeli hostage shared their anguish at the 
 
 convention.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. They spoke about their son, 23-year-old, Hersh Goldberg- Polin, who was wounded in kidnapped by Hamas from an Israeli music festival on October 7th.
 
They also acknowledged the deaths of civilians in Gaza, saying there is a surplus of agony on all sides.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JON POLIN, FATHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN: In an inflamed Middle East, we know the one thing that can most immediately release pressure and bring 
 
 calm to the entire region. A deal that brings this diverse group of 109 hostages home and ends the suffering of the innocent civilians in Gaza.
 
(CROWD CHANTING)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: It's just impossible to imagine what they've been through. What they've been through over the past 10 months.
 
Meantime back in Israel, the families of some hostages are voicing their frustration. Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum says it will 
 
 boycott the country's official memorial event on October 7th.
 
The group is condemning the Israeli government for what it calls its glaring inability to secure the hostages' return.
 
GOLODRYGA: Meanwhile, mediators are continuing to work and push for a Gaza ceasefire and a hostage release deal.
 
CIA Director Bill Burns is expected to arrive in Cairo Friday for high- level talks. And the White House's co-coordinator for the Middle East official is in the Egyptian capital right now as well, that is Brett 
 
 McGurk. This as Israel keeps up its attacks across Gaza.
 
In Northern Gaza, an overnight strike on a house triggered a fire. A local hospital says 12 people were killed, including six children.
 
ASHER: CNN's Nic Robertson looks back at some Israeli strikes over the past few days, and the increasing desperation in Gaza.
 
I want to warn you that his report does contain some really graphic images.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): As peace talks stall, an overnight Israeli airstrike in Northern Gaza.
 
Pulled from the rubble, charred children, images too horrific to broadcast. Twelve dead, no injured, no survivors, according to Palestinian officials. 
 
 Israel's military says they're looking into the incident.
 <br>[12:20:04]
 
In the past few days, strikes killing families in the north, center, and Southern Gaza.
 
As diplomacy fails, desperation in Gaza increases. In parallel with the renewed push for peace, Israel's military is pushing into previously 
 
 declared safe zones.
 
Over the past month, CNN has tracked a more than one-third reduction in the areas supposedly safe from Israeli strikes. Less than 11 percent of Gaza 
 
 technically safe.
 
But even the shrunken safe zone, no protection for Mahmoud Abu Tiyor's (ph) three-year-old niece killed in a tent in the safe area, he says.
 
They attacked us by surprise. All of a sudden, a quadcopter came on us and started shooting. We ran away towards the beach, but my niece was killed.
 
While diplomats shuttled to talks, Gazans are increasingly on the move too, reluctantly responding to increasing Israeli evacuation orders, telling 
 
 them their sanctuary, not safe.
 
This is the 10th time we've been displaced, he shouts. Where shall we go to? Where shall we go to?
 
We ask all the world, Biden and the others, all the Arab states, to find a solution, Abu Mohammed Hajaj (ph) says. The Palestinian people are dying. 
 
 The people of Gaza are being killed and going through hell.
 
Absent a peace deal, Gaza's unsafe safe zones appear to face extinction.
 
Gazans themselves caught in a roulette with no good options.
 
Nic Robertson, CNN, Tel Aviv.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
GOLODRYGA: Crews have recovered the body of tech mogul, Mike Lynch, from the waters off Sicily. That's according to the Italian Interior Ministry. 
 
 He was among the 22 people on board a luxury yacht that sank Monday during a violent storm.
 <br>[12:25:05]
 
ASHER: Yes. Six bodies have been recovered and one person is still missing. Every efforts are really difficult because the boat is 50 meters 
 
 underwater. That's more than 150 feet. The divers only have around 12 minutes to reach the site. Do their recovery work and then they have to 
 
 resurface.
 
GOLODRYGA: CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau is near the scene and joins us now live. What's the very latest, Barbie?
 
BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: Yes. You know, I mean, we're getting to the end of the day here, the fourth day of the search. And they're still 
 
 looking for what is believed to be the 18-year-old daughter of Mike Lynch.
 
Now, they've been back and forth from this staging area behind us here out to the debris field. And they've been unsuccessful so far in terms of 
 
 finding and bringing that last missing person back in.
 
Now, there are still a few boats out there, but like I said, it's -- the day is ending. And it looks like very well easily could go into a fifth day 
 
 tomorrow if the body's not brought back in yet tonight.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Barbie, it's such a tragic story. You've been covering it for us all well. And as you said, the search and rescue of 
 
 search continues there. Hard to imagine anyone still being alive at this point.
 
ASHER: Yes. Yes, absolutely. And, Barbie, just walk us through the interview process. I mean, obviously, they are interviewing some of the 
 
 victims, the ones who obviously survived, to figure out what exactly happened. Just take us through that.
 
NADEAU: Yes. Yes. You know, there's a criminal investigation going on and that's not exactly, you know, unique here in these situations. Italy opens 
 
 a criminal investigation to try to get access, especially when it's a foreign flag ship like this or any other accident which involves 
 
 foreigners.
 
Now, what they're doing is interviewing of -- there were 15 survivors. Obviously, they're not going to interview the 1-year-old little girl, but 
 
 they're interviewing the rest to try to get an idea of what those final moments were.
 
But they're especially focused on the captain, we understand to be a 51- year-old man from New Zealand living in Spain who was the captain of this particular vessel when it went down.
 
Now, they're trying to determine, of course, if there was some sort of mistake he made or human error that would lead to criminal negligence and 
 
 that -- those investigations and those questions will be key when they finally bring this last body in.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Barbie Latza Nadeau, thank you.
 
ASHER: All right. More than a dozen people have been killed in flooding in Bangladesh and Northeast India as well. Officials say tens of thousands are 
 
 seeking refuge in shelters and in relief camps.
 
GOLODRYGA: Now Bangladesh has deployed 300 medical teams as part of the response saying that around three million people have been affected.
 
CNN's Anna Coren has more on how the disaster happened.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We are in Comilla in Southeast Bangladesh, on the border of India. And this city, like much of the region, 
 
 is now underwater.
 
There's been heavy rains the past few days and it is the end of the monsoon season. But locals say that last night, without warning, suddenly 
 
 everywhere was flooded.
 
Now there are claims that India opened the floodgates of one of its dams. And that the water then surged down the Gomti River into Bangladesh causing 
 
 this flooding.
 
Well, India denies it, saying the dams simply overflow. But it does admit that there was a power outage and it wasn't able to warn Bangladeshi 
 
 authorities that the flood waters were coming.
 
Well, residents are furious. They have come here concerned that the levee is going to break and then flood other parts of the city. They say they 
 
 have never seen such extreme flooding in their lifetime.
 
NAZMA AKTHER, COMILLA RESIDENT (through translator): I'm scared. What will I do with my belongings and my children? Where will I go? Water is all 
 
 around my house.
 
COREN: Authorities say three million people have been affected by these floods. Tens of thousands have already been evacuated.
 
And in the last few minutes, we have seen dozens of families take their belongings and leave.
 
Well, Bangladesh, a country of more than 170 million people is on the front line of climate change, as flooding and cyclones become more extreme in 
 
 recent years.
 
And authorities say that conditions here will worsen with rain predicted in the coming days.
 
Anna Coren, CNN, Comilla, Bangladesh.
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
ASHER: All right. Still to come here, in a few hours from now Kamila Harris becomes the first Indian-American and African-American woman to accept the 
 
 democratic nomination for president. We have that story ahead.
 
Also ahead.
 
GOLODRYGA: We sent our very own Van Jones to check the pulse of those attending the DNC and see what's on their minds. We'll tell you what he 
 
 found.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:30:30]
 
GOLODRYGA: Welcome back to ONE WORLD. I'm Bianna Golodryga.
 
ASHER: And I'm Zain Asher.
 
Tonight, Kamala Harris will formally accept the democratic nomination for president and take a major step in her quest to be the first woman elected 
 
 to the highest office of the United States.
 
GOLODRYGA: Of course, Harris is no stranger to first. She was the first woman, the first African-American, and the first person of South Asian 
 
 descent to be Attorney General of California.
 
She was also the first South Asian American to serve in the Senate. And she is currently the United States first female vice president.
 
Harris has been asked about all these firsts in the past, and she says being first is not what drives her to succeed.

KAMALA HARRIS, THEN-CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: When we do these things, when we break these barriers, as you all know, we're not doing it because 
 
 we're trying to be the first. We're doing it because we actually know that we're the best at the job.
 
And we know we can do the job, and we want to do the job, and we know we can do it well.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Still, being the first is never easy. And last night, at the democratic convention, superstar, Oprah Winfrey, reflected on Harris' 
 
 remarkable journey.

WINFREY: Soon and very soon, we're going to be teaching our daughters and sons about how this child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father to 
 
 idealistic energetic immigrants, immigrants, how this child grew up to become the 47th president of the United States.
 
(CROWD CHEERING)

That is the best of America.

ASHER: Time now for The Exchange with more on Kamala Harris' life story. We're joined by Malaika Adero. She's the author of the book, "Vice 
 
 President Kamala Harris: Her Path to the White House."
 
Malaika, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, obviously this is historic, right? This idea of a woman who is of South Asian descent, 
 
 African-American descent, the child of immigrants, so many firsts here.
 
We saw in 2016 that gender was a factor for Hillary Clinton in terms of her not winning the election. We've had a black president before, but is gender 
 
 less of an issue now than it was eight years ago? What are your thoughts on that?
 
MALAIKA ADERO, AUTHOR, "VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: HER PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE": I think it is. And I think, in part, what she's, Kamala Harris and 
 
 the other women in politics have accomplished in the last eight years, have gotten us to this place. While she may be first in the U.S., the U.S. is 
 
 certainly not first in having a female head of state. So we're just catching up, really, to the rest of the world.
 
GOLODRYGA: Malaika, this is not Kamala Harris' first bid at the presidency. In 2020 -- she ran in 2020 as well before joining the Biden-Harris 
 
 administration. What lessons do you think she learned over the past four years in terms of running a campaign and presenting herself to the country 
 
 as that person who can lead to the future and not go back?
 
ADERO: Yes. I think she was like any other politician. You know, these jobs, and at these highest levels, I mean, there's no preparation for it, 
 
 except for it to do the job. So maybe in retrospect, we can think of it as her trial run.
 
There's Shirley Chisholm broken the ice before, Geraldine Ferraro. You know, we can look back at the history. So -- Hillary Clinton. They've all 
 
 paved the way, you know, wide and the opening for Kamala Harris to step through. And she's widened her own opening. And she did.
 
You know, in the 2020 campaign, she comported herself very well and very respectfully. You know, so now she's just taking it across to a higher 
 
 level and hopefully will take it across the finish line.
 
ASHER: Malaika, I wonder if Kamala Harris wins, will she manage to do what Obama never quite managed to do? And that is healing the divisions in this 
 
 country.
 
You think about the fact that Kamala Harris embodies just so many different cultural background. And even religions, actually. I mean, you talk about 
 
 her childhood as being sort of Christian Baptist and Hindu.
 
And, of course, now she's married to a Jewish man. She embodies so much of what America is.
 
Do you think that because of her background, if she gets to the White House, she will be able to heal what divides so many Americans?
 
ADERO: You know, her background, I think, is incredibly important for what she's trying to do and supports her for this campaign and for being an 
 
 effective president.
 
Because whether you look at her family upbringing, her parents, an intentional effort and success in embedding her in a multicultural 
 
 community, her educational experience, all those things prepare her to do the model for her current family, her blended family, her interfaith 
 
 family. I think all those things bode well for her.
 
But the onus was not on Obama, in my opinion, or Kamala Harris, or one individual to heal the nation in combat on us, the electorate, the 
 
 citizens, the society.
 
To heal ourselves, they have to believe platform. They have the influence. Again, both of them brought extraordinary capabilities and knowledge in 
 
 humanitarianism and compassion, but it's we who have to do it, not her or him.
 
ASHER: Yes. It's interesting because you're right, the onus should not be on any individual, but it is something, I know, that has irked Obama as he 
 
 has reflected many times on his eight years in office.
 <br>[12:40:10]
 
He has said that, yes, despite all of his accomplishments, the one thing that as the first black president, he wished he could have done, was to 
 
 heal some of the divisions. So, yes, of course, I was wondering whether for Kamala Harris, especially just given that it is a much different time and 
 
 how many different backgrounds she embodies, whether she would also be able to contribute to that.
 
But we are out of time. Malaika, thank you so much for being with us. Malaika Adero, Kamala Harris' biographer. Thank you.
 
ADERO: Thank you. Appreciate it.
 
GOLODRYGA: Well, still to come for us.

ASHER: For a political convention, this week's DNC in Chicago has looked like an award show for celebrities.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes. Musicians, actors, and comedians have lent their support to the Harris-Walz ticket in Chicago. Here are some of the highlights.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please welcome, Oprah Winfrey.

ASHER: CNN's entertainment reporter, Lisa Respers France, joins us live now from Atlanta.
 
So, Lisa, I want to start, of course, by talking about Oprah.
 
LISA RESPERS FRANCE, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Of course.
 
ASHER: Of course. Obviously, she has been this sort of spiritual mother figure for the whole country, really. Actually, maybe even more than just 
 
 this country, for many, many decades now. 
 
Of course, she does not have any children of her own. She was, if I remember correctly, raped and sexually abused as a child and gave birth to 
 
 a boy when she was 14. And that boy died about three weeks after she gave birth to him. So she hasn't had any children since then.
 
And the reason why I bring that up is because I'm pretty sure that she would have found J.D. Vance's childless cat lady comments extremely 
 
 triggering, given her own past.
 
I thought of the way she handled it and the way she referenced it, last night, was very classy. It was very, very subtle. And it was a very sort 
 
 of, when they go -- when they go low, we go high moment. Take us through that.
 
FRANCE: Yes. She is one who definitely knows how to use her words.
 
When you see Oprah Winfrey, you're seeing a woman who was raised, speaking in every Easter program at the Black Church. True story, Oprah Winfrey 
 
 spoke at my family's home church when I was a little girl.
 
ASHER: You have all the gossip.
 
FRANCE: I have all the stories. Yes, I'm telling you.
 
GOLODRYGA: We haven't forgotten the J. Lo gossip either. Gosh.
 
FRANCE: Oh, let me tell you, there's a whole story. Oprah Winfrey called me for my birthday last year, but that's a whole another story.
 
But she absolutely -- you guys really have to call me. We need to talk more.
 
ASHER: I need to call you, after the show.
 
FRANCE: Yes. Absolutely.
 
But she really has her finger on the pulse. And she's a reminder as to why she was so influential in helping to get President Obama elected back in 
 
 2008.
 
When Oprah Winfrey speaks, she is one of the most powerful, most successful women to have ever lived, period.
 
And so when she gets on that mic and she talks to people, it feels like you're having a very genuine moment. Even though she's a celebrity and 
 
 she's got more money than many of us will ever see in our lifetimes, she feels like one of us. And that's what made her so incredibly popular on her 
 
 show.
 
And that's what made her really incredibly effective last night when she had her whole little moment about J.D. Vance and, you know, childless cat 
 
 women, it landed in that room like everyone laughed. They just -- and people literally threw back their heads and roared.
 
And so this is why you want an Oprah Winfrey.
 
And let's be very clear. When it comes to the Democratic Party, their celebrity bench is very deep. And you have -- you have got to admit that 
 
 this whole thing has felt like club DNC. Like every night, you have performances, you have people dancing, you have people making us laugh.
 
And I feel like the Oscars need to take a page out of their book because this has been way more entertaining than a lot of the award shows that I 
 
 have to cover.
 
GOLODRYGA: I agree, Lisa. But the thing is, when you have a bench that deep with celebrities, that doesn't always resonate well with a large portion of 
 
 the country.
 
And what makes Oprah unique is that she could resonate to and speak to the people in Tim Walz's hometown of 400 people in Nebraska. The same way she 
 
 can speak to Hollywood, to black men and black women. It's just something about her nature. And that's what drew viewers to her show. And it's what 
 
 made her comments last night so poignant.
 
FRANCE: Absolutely. I mean, we call her in my house, Mama O, because she does feel like the mother of the nation. She -- like you point out, she 
 
 really resonates with so many people all across the board.
 
I did find it interesting that people, as much as they love John Legend, did not, by the way, love John Legend's performance last night. He did a 
 
 tribute along with Sheila E. to Prince. And he did "Let's Go Crazy." And people thought it was a little loungy.
 
And so it's been interesting to watch the conversation around some of the celebrities and who people really enjoyed like an Oprah and who people were 
 
 kind of like maybe not so much.
 
ASHER: Mm-hmm.
 
FRANCE: You know, and even Maren Morris, she sang her protest song. She wore all white, which has come to be very symbolic for women and women's 
 
 power and being supportive of the women's movement.
 <br>[12:50:10]
 
To take like a Kenan Thompson from SNL and have him make jokes about Project 2025, which is very serious, but he tried to, you know, have some 
 
 humor to it.
 
So I feel like what the DNC has been able to do is show us what's possible for an event like this. You have very serious moments with politics, but 
 
 you also have the opportunity to entertain people.
 
And let me tell you, it is a vibe check. You guys are going to be talking about the vibes. It's definitely a vibe check. And people are really 
 
 linking in and connecting with this convention.
 
The ratings are showing that because they are not only learning about these candidates, but they're also learning about how much fun you can still 
 
 have, even though it's in the political arena. It's pretty amazing to watch.
 
ASHER: I also learned how great you could look at 70. Sorry to be shallow, but Oprah looked amazing.
 
FRANCE: Hello.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
ASHER: Amazing.
 
GOLODRYGA: Yes.
 
FRANCE: What is her skincare routine? I'm just convinced -- I'm convinced she just takes dollar -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: The whole outfit. OK.
 
FRANCE: She takes dollar bills and just wipe it on her face.
 
GOLODRYGA: The whole look.
 
OK. We just created a new segment on this show. Lisa Respers, we will call you after the show.
 
ASHER: I know. That is what the segment is going to be called.
 
GOLODRYGA: And Oprah calling you as well.
 
FRANCE: Yes.
 
ASHER: I want to hear about that.
 
FRANCE: Absolutely.
 
GOLODRYGA: All right. Lisa Respers France, thank you.
 
FRANCE: Thank you.
 
ASHER: We'll be back.
 
GOLODRYGA: We'll be back and we're calling you. Answer your phone.
 
ASHER: So funny. Oh, my goodness.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: All right. It is the final day of the Democratic National Convention where Kamala Harris will officially accept the party's nomination as its 
 
 presidential candidate.
 
Before the convention's end, we sent our own Van Jones to check the vibe among the crowd to see if they're fired up, as former President Obama says. 
 
 Here's what we found.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JONES: Why is everybody around here is so happy?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because this is the most pivotal time. Oh, I don't even know. I'm so excited.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It has been the most electric, amazing experience to be in the room. And it feels like the future is here.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, my stomach is a flutter. All the -- it's flutter now. Partly because of you.
 
(LAUGHS)
 
JONES: OK.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But it's a flutter for our country.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, whatever, people were not feeling great, the vibes were not good, the vibes were not immaculate, 
 
 as we say. But now, the vibes are good.
 <br>[12:55:04]
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have someone that's going up against Donald Trump that I am confident can win.
 
JONES: Barack Obama was about hope. So, what -- Kamala is about joy, is that -- is how you see it?
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joy, hope, family, freedom, rights, democracy.
 
JONES: Everybody's so miserable and downbeat.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're fired up. This is going to be a beautiful ticket. Kamala Harris, Tim Walz.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, to the window and to the Walz, everyone. I mean -- I mean, it's real.
 
JONES: How did you feel about Obama and her husband?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, is that who that guy was? OK. OK.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
GOLODRYGA: He caught him right there. How do you feel about Obama's husband?
 
ASHER: It's interesting seeing that contrast from the Obama we saw the other -- the Van Jones we saw the other night dancing to Lil Jon.
 
GOLODRYGA: I can watch that all night.
 
ASHER: That was amazing.
 
GOLODRYGA: We were all dancing. That roll call. I mean, I love Oprah, but I still think the roll call was my favorite highlight thus far this week. I 
 
 didn't expect it.
 
ASHER: Tonight, more celebrities. You've got Pink and -- 
 
GOLODRYGA: And Adam Kinzinger.
 
ASHER: Adam Kinzinger, which you recommend that everyone watch it. And then obviously Kamala Harris.
 
GOLODRYGA: That's right.
 
ASHER: It'll be a great historic night.
 
All right. Tune in for live coverage from the DNC in Chicago, starting tonight at 6:00 P.M., Chicago time, 7:00 P.M., Eastern, right here on CNN.
 
That does it for this hour of ONE WORLD, I'm Zain Asher.
 
GOLODRYGA: And I'm Bianna Golodryga. Thanks for watching. "Amanpour" is up next.
