JESSICA DEAN, CNN HOST: You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
I'm Jessica Dean in New York. 
 
And tonight, a dangerous and destructive tornado outbreak sweeping across the southern United States. New video now of what looks like a tornado touching down in a neighborhood just outside Houston this afternoon. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
DEAN: Several tornadoes confirmed so far. More are expected, with the powerful system now barreling east with millions of people in its path. 
 
Rafael Romo is tracking the damage as these videos start to come in. We also have meteorologist Tyler Mauldin with us. 
 
Tyler, let's start first with you. You're tracking the actual storm. And what are you seeing? 
 
TYLER MAULDIN, AMS METEOROLOGIST: The tornado outbreak is starting to really get its act together. We have a tornado watch in effect for Louisiana, Mississippi, as well as Arkansas. 
 
This is a particularly dangerous situation tornado watch, which is a rare tornado watch, only issued 5 percent of the time. And it's because this line of storms that is beginning to push to the south and east is starting to really again get its act together. 
 
We have multiple confirmed tornadoes on radar right now, one just to the southeast of Monroe, one to the south of Alexandria, Louisiana as well. And then a huge lightning storm right now to the south of Beaumont, Texas. 
 
As the system producing this pushes to the east, we're going to continue to see the chance for strong, violent, long-lived tornadoes increase. That is the reason why we have that PDS tornado watch. And it's also the reason why the Storm Prediction Center has issued a level four out of five severe weather risk for today. That is extremely rare. It has only happened 12 times this year. 
 
It's going to continue through tonight, that severe weather threat. It's also going to continue on into Sunday too, though as it gets closer to the Carolinas, it will start to lose its punch. 
 
Here's the reason why. The system pushes east, and you can see some drier air beginning to push into the system on radar. Eventually, that begins to break up the storm system. It loses its instability. And once we get to Sunday on into Monday, we can say goodbye to this storm system. 
 
Now, typically, Jessica, we see large destructive tornadoes like this during the spring tornado season. However, we do have a secondary tornado season which occurs in fall and early winter. 
 
Right now in the month of December, we typically see 43 tornadoes on average. So it does happen. It's not extremely rare, but it's also not very common. 
 
This is the last weekend of 2024. Notice this statistic here. We have seen above average tornadic activity for the month -- for the year 2024. So we are ending the -- ending 2024 on the exact same note with this tornado outbreak. So it's quite fitting. 
 
And again Jessica, we're watching this system here across the southeast. But there are multiple areas here across the U.S. that we have to keep an eye on. 
 
DEAN: All right. Thank you so much for walking us through this. 
 
Let's go now to Rafael because we're getting some new pictures, videos of the damage. What are you seeing? 
 
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jessica. Very devastating pictures. 
 
And we've been monitoring the impact of the storms Tyler has been telling us about for most of the day, especially the impact to local communities and several states. 
 
As far as we've learned so far, there's plenty of devastation. 
 
And Montgomery County, Texas located just north of Houston where we're getting these images from, a local official's reporting that the storms have knocked down trees and power lines around the area, as well as causing great damage to mobile homes and warehouses. 
 
The same local official says there are mobile homes that have rolled over. Many people have lost power in this part of Texas as well. At this point, officials there in Montgomery County are assessing the damage in a five-mile stretch that was severely hit by the storms, possibly tornadoes. We haven't been able to confirm that. 
 <br>[17:04:47]
 
ROMO: This is what Montgomery County Judge Keough had to say about what this community is going through right now. 
 
Let's take a listen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MARK KEOUGH, MONTGOMERY COUNTY JUDGE: A lot of mobile homes are the ones that are hit. I mean, they are rolled over, they're smashed. I mean, it's amazing. Trees falling on them, monster trees. 
 
Typical stuff you would see in a tornado. It's not as bad as it was (INAUDIBLE), but tell that to the poor people who've lost their homes in the trees, you know, and the trees on their houses and electric out. 
 
But again, like I said, we really did -- it's better than what? What we thought. But it's going to take some time to clean this up. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ROMO: And Jessica, at this point, authorities there in Montgomery County are saying that they have no reports of fatalities. 
 
We're getting footage of firefighters. They are rescuing small children after what appears to be several trees fell all at once in a residential area. One of those trees fell right over a car. There are many driveways that are currently blocked by limbs or trees that have fallen over.
 
A witness in Montgomery County said that in a matter of only a couple of minutes, the weather turned for the worse, putting him and his family in danger. 
 
Of course, this is all part of a weather system that has moved today through parts of Texas, but also Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. 
 
Those are the very heartbreaking images that we've been able to get so far, Jessica. 
 
DEAN: All right. Rafael Romo, thanks so much for that reporting. 
 
We turn now to a New York prisoner who was beaten to death while handcuffed. CNN has learned several Department of Corrections employees are now being suspended without pay, and another has resigned after an investigation. 
 
The deadly beating captured on police body cam video, and we do want to warn you that these images are disturbing. We're going to show you just a part of that video. Authorities saying the inmate Robert Brooks died a day after he was assaulted. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has called for those involved to be
 
 fired, including those who stood by and watched but did not step in to stop that beating. 
 
CNN's Leigh Waldman is here with more. 
 
Leigh, what more are you learning? 
 
LEIGH WALDMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Jessica, 13 Correctional Department employees, including correctional officers, sergeants and a nurse, have been suspended without pay. An additional correctional officer has resigned at this point. We have no information about firings at this point. 
 
Brooks, 43, who had been serving a 12-year sentence for a first-degree assault. He was carried in, you saw on that body camera footage into the Marcy Correctional Facility in Utica on December 9th. He was being taken into a medical examination room where his hands were already cuffed behind his back. 
 
He is then beaten by officers who are surrounding him. You can see that they punched him repeatedly, and at one point even kicked him. 
 
Now, video shows Brooks face is bloodied and it appears something is shoved into his mouth. He is then lifted at one point by those officers by his neck and his collar. His legs are limp. The very next day, Brooks was pronounced dead at Wynn Hospital. 
 
Now this video was released by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is promising a full-scale investigation. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
LETITIA JAMES, NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL: I want to reiterate that we are investigating this case thoroughly and using every tool at our disposal to ensure that there is transparency and accountability for the events that preceded Mr. Brooks' death. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WALDMAN: Brooks' family has seen this footage, and they said they are seeking justice in his honor and for the safety of everyone who is still housed at the Marcy Correctional Facility, Jessica. 
 
DEAN: All right. Leigh Waldman, with the latest reporting of that very, very difficult to watch video. Thank you very much for that. 
 
And for more, we're joined now by CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Joey, it's great to see you on this Saturday. 
 
We have heard from New York's governor. We saw the attorney general there. What else can be done to prevent something like this from happening again? 
 
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes. Jessica, good to be with you. I think there's going to be really three prongs legally that are going
 
 to really take place here. 
 
The first prong, and we have heard from the governor, and we should echo what the governor said. And that is that the vast majority of correctional officers do extraordinary job under very difficult circumstances. These did not, from the looks of it. 
 
And with respect to those three prongs, the first thing is in terms of their firing, there'll be a disciplinary process where that internal investigation will unearth their specific conduct, the nature of that conduct, what specifically they did, why they did it, who was involved, how it occurred. And that will deal with their jobs and whether or not they'll be fired or not. 
 
The second prong will be of the New York state attorney general's investigation to see what criminality is here. And there will be a grand jury that will be convened. 
 
The New York state attorney general's office, Letitia James' office under New York state statute investigates those cases. And if there's criminality, there will be crimes charged and there will be will be officers brought to justice. 
 <br>[17:09:49]
 
JACKSON: The third prong, Jessica, I think we'll see and that is civil litigation. That is the family will look to hold the officers accountable by way of filing a lawsuit that will seek monetary damages for everything and anything that occurred. 
 
And so I think that's what will have to take place. 
 
In addition to that, there will be a full-scale review by the corrections commissioner to see what internal changes could and should be made such that these instances don't occur, can't afford for them to occur. Every life is precious and it should not have taken place. 
 
DEAN: You know what's really striking is they're wearing these body cam videos and it looks like at least they know they have these on. They're not hidden body cam videos. 
 
So it's kind of this -- kind of two competing ideas, which is either they know that they are wearing these videos and they think this kind of behavior is ok, or you know, they just don't care. I don't -- I don't know, but it is kind of striking. 
 
JACKSON: Yes. You know, Jessica, I think that'll certainly be part of the investigation. There is some indication that some officers did not turn them on. There are certain protocols whenever an incident is occurring that you would put it on. And if you didn't, the question will be asked, why or were you trying to really cover up any type of behavior. 
 
In this technological age where there's really recordings everywhere, it's really hard to get out from under that. And so I think there'll be a lot of explaining to do with respect to how this occurred, why it occurred, and why the force was deemed to be necessary under the circumstance. Was it? 
 
And really, if you look from a legal perspective, you look legally whenever you use force. Is there an imminent fear that any of the officers had, and if so, were any of the actions they took proportional to whatever fear or threat they were facing and did they act reasonably? 
 
And those three criteria will be the rubric upon which this is looked at. And if those things are found to be flawed, which on the face of it they are. It didn't seem as though the deceased Mr. Brooks was fighting in any way. He seemed to be restrained. He didn't seem to represent a threat or danger. 
 
And so therefore, the nature of their conduct and whether it was reasonable will be looked at. The proportionality of what they did to him will be looked at. And certainly whether he represented an imminent immediate threat would be looked at. 
 
To this point and looking at that, it just looks like a very, very horrific set of circumstances that could have been prevented. And I think the New York state attorney general will get to the bottom of it. 
 
DEAN: I also want to ask you about the fact that three of the 13 allegedly involved in this, three of those guards have been accused of beating inmates before. And I'm just curious, how does that continue to happen, do you think? And do you think that will be part of this case as well? 
 
JACKSON: So it will be, Jessica. I think what they will do is they will assess the backgrounds of every officers. What other prior force they had. Were those forces appropriate? Were they not appropriate? What were the individual circumstances there? 
 
Was there enough done with respect to looking at those issues and seeing whether or not in those set of circumstances, they -- those other instances could have been prevented. 
 
Were they appropriately disciplined for them? Should they have been in the position they were now, such that they could have access to someone else? And whether or not officials knew, and they took appropriate steps to prevent what occurred before and why they were on the job now. 
 
And so all of that, I think, will be subject to review. These officers will get their due process. But again, those three prongs will be looked at. One their job, number two the criminality if any that was involved, and number three, the lawsuit. 
 
And I think those three things, in addition to a full-scale review of the facility itself, will bring some, you know, measure of really transparency to how this could happen and look to prevent it from happening in the future. 
 
DEAN: All right. Joey Jackson, great to see you. Thanks for being with us. 
 
JACKSON: Thanks, Jessica. 
 
DEAN: Still ahead, Russian President Vladimir Putin apologizing for what he calls the tragic Azerbaijan Airlines crash that killed 38 people on Christmas Day. But he did not admit Russia's responsibility. We're following the latest on that. 
 
Plus, Mike Johnsons future as House Speaker is uncertain as some House Republicans lose confidence. We're looking ahead to a potentially chaotic week in Washington with big ramifications.
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 <br>[17:14:14]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DEAN: An apology, but no admission of responsibility today, as Russian president Vladimir Putin responds to the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner that killed 38 people on Christmas Day. 
 
Putin's remarks about what he calls a, quote, "tragic incident" coming as a U.S. official tells CNN Russian air defenses may have mistaken that commercial jet for a Ukrainian drone. 
 
Putin did acknowledge Russia's air defense systems were active when that flight attempted to land in Chechnya. 
 
CNN's Nada Bashir is covering this for us. And, Nada, we're getting this new information from Putin at the same time, we're hearing from some of the 29 people who miraculously survived that crash. 
 
NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The allegations against Russia and the possible link between Russia's air defenses and this crash appear to be mounting. 
 
But as you mentioned, no clear admission of responsibility just yet from the Russian authorities, not least from the president, Vladimir Putin, who today expressed his condolences and apology for the crash. The incident, taking place after entering Russian airspace. 
 
But he did crucially acknowledge that Russia's air defense systems were active at this point in time in this particular region. He also acknowledged and the kremlin has acknowledged that they were under drone strikes or drone attacks in the area of Grozny, where, of course, the plane was intending to land before it was diverted and made or attempted that emergency landing in the Kazakh city of Aktau. 
 
But of course, there has been mounting speculation around the possible connection between those air defenses and drone activity. We've been hearing, of course, from analysts and experts who have looked at the images and videos which have emerged in the aftermath, showing perforations and holes in the fuselage and the wreckage following that crash, which could be consistent with a shrapnel impact and debris as a result of an explosion. So certainly a lot of pieces that the investigators will be putting
 
 together as part of their analysis. 
 <br>[17:19:45]
 
BASHIR: But again, no clear line of conclusion just yet. Investigators are continuing to look at the evidence. 
 
And of course, we've heard from Azerbaijani officials who say they believe the plane faced external physical and technical interference in the moments ahead of the crash. 
 
So clearly, a lot of information to put together there, but no clear conclusion just yet. 
 
DEAN: And Nada, how much hope is there being placed in these two black boxes that were recovered? 
 
BASHIR: Well, this be -- well, this will be an important part of the puzzle, of course, for investigators. We know that they have recovered two black boxes, which will provide, the hope is, flight data as well as potentially internal recordings from within the cockpit. 
 
And of course, as you mentioned, Jessica, there were survivors following this crash. 29 people out of 67 on board survived this crash. We've been hearing those first-hand testimonies from some of those survivors, as well as seeing footage that was filmed on people's mobile phones in the moments ahead of the crash. 
 
Many of them described the chaos on board the flight, passengers being moved up and down from their chairs, the plane moving unusually and a loud bang being heard before those oxygen masks dropped. 
 
So of course, investigators will be listening to those first-hand testimonies and speaking to survivors, as well as looking at all the other evidence. 
 
But at this stage, authorities say it could take around two weeks before they are able to complete a full assessment of that black box recorded data. 
 
So it may be some time before we hear any firm conclusions from the authorities on this. 
 
DEAN: All right. Nada Bashir with the very latest. Thank you very much for that. 
 
And some breaking news just in to CNN. 
 
We are learning one person is now dead in Texas as tornadoes and severe storms ripped through the south. We will continue to track that thread -- that threat rather ahead. 
 
Plus, we are talking about the big political stories to watch in 2025 as President-Elect Trump prepares to retake the Oval Office. 
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 <br>[17:21:37]
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DEAN: Newly released pictures show then-Vice President Joe Biden meeting Hunter Biden's Chinese business partners. These images also include Hunter Biden meeting President Xi Jinping. It was all during an official trip during again then Vice President Biden's trip to China in 2013. 
 
And for more on this, CNN's Marshall Cohen is joining us now. 
 
And Marshall, this is the first time were seeing these images, though we've known about these photo ops and these meetings for a while. How did these images become public? 
 
MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Hey, Jessica. A right-wing legal group called America First Legal, a pro-Trump organization, filed a public records lawsuit to try to get these pictures from the national archives and they were successful. They got these images. 
 
As you mentioned, we've known that this happened. We knew that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden had some of these meetings and photo ops in China in 2013, but we never saw these pictures before. 
 
Let me walk you through these images, and then I'll explain why they matter. 
 
So the first one you see here, this is President Biden, then-Vice President Biden, introducing his son, Hunter, to Xi Jinping on the left, who, of course, is the president of China. 
 
There are other pictures from that same time where Hunter Biden met the vice president of China, another official, high-ranking government official. You can see that there with, of course, Vice President Biden in the middle. So Hunter getting face time with some very powerful government officials. 
 
But on the other side of it, you have Hunter introducing his father to some of his business partners. These guys here between the two Bidens, father and son, these guys were some of the top executives at a private equity firm in China that Hunter was doing a lot of business with. He briefly had a photo op with the president, the vice president at the time. 
 
So Jessica, this is important because there was a time, and you probably remember this, when Joe Biden denied that there were ever any interactions between him and his sons business associates and that there was no overlap whatsoever. 
 
Those denials have been undercut because we've learned that there were meetings, there were some dinners, there were some phone calls, too.
 
But Hunter Biden, when he testified to lawmakers earlier this year and one of his other business partners, said, yes, there were some meetings, but no business was ever discussed. 
 
They were not substantive. They were photo ops. Essentially, Hunter Biden was selling the illusion of access, but not real access to his father, Jessica.
 
DEAN: And Marshall, have we heard from the White House following the release of these images.
 
COHEN: We reached out to the White House. They did not have anything to say, but Hunter Bidens attorney, Abbe Lowell, did release a statement. I'll read it to you here. We just got this. 
 
It said, quote, "These attacks, trying to twist these images into something they are not is more of the same old, tired misinformation from some Republicans who can't let go of their ridiculous conspiracy theories."
 
So, a blistering rebuke from Hunter Biden's lawyer because, of course, Republicans used these photos and these interactions to try to argue that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were guilty of corruption, guilty of illegal influence peddling. 
 
But of course, their impeachment inquiry hit a wall and went nowhere. And Hunter was never charged with any crimes related to foreign lobbying or corruption, Jessica.
 
DEAN: All right. Marshall Cohen with some breaking news reporting for us on this Saturday evening. Thank you very much for that. 
 
A new Republican-led Congress will be back on Capitol Hill next week, ready to take on President-Elect Trump's ambitious new agenda. 
 
But first, they're going to have to agree on whether or not House Speaker Mike Johnson will continue to be House Speaker. 
 
Joining us now, Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. He's also the editor of "A Return to Normalcy, the 2020 Election That Almost Broke America". 
 
Larry, it is good to see you. 
 
Listen, we're going to see the House come back on January 3rd, and they are going to figure out who's going to be their House Speaker. You don't have a crystal ball even though you, you know, are associated with a crystal ball. 
 
But how do you see this all, you know, going down?
 
LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Well, with this crew, you never know. That's absolutely true. 
 
And second, there's such a close margin in the House and just a couple of votes, two or three votes at the current time for Republicans in the majority. 
 
Having said that, it would be introducing chaos from day one if they in fact deposed the speaker, the current speaker. 
 <br>[17:29:54]
 
SABATO: Now look, Mike Johnson isn't the strongest speaker we've ever seen, even in recent times. Certainly nothing compared to the past in American history. 
 
Having said that, he's there and he has tried to get along with all the factions, and he's tried to get along with President Trump, who has said nothing, by the way. He has not -- he has not encouraged Johnson being dumped. He has also not endorsed Johnson, which I'm sure irritates Johnson. 
 
But a lot would have to come together that questions the leadership of Johnson on that one day to get rid of him. 
 
Who are they going to replace him with? Who is this hidden leader who can unite all of these unusual people in the Republican caucus? Good luck with that. 
 
DEAN: Yes, it took long enough to find Mike Johnson, and we all lived through that as well. So you make a strong point there. 
 
I also want to look -- look back to look ahead. Just some of the big headlines, changes that you're going to see in the new year and what you think you know might be driving the stories, as we head into 2025. What kind of sticks out to you to watch for? 
 
SABATO: Well, we'll be inundated with confirmation hearing information because there are quite a number, more than usual of controversial nominees to the cabinet and other posts, including ambassadorships. 
 
So that will certainly fill the headlines for a while. And all of that is on the Senate side. 
 
On the House side, I would think that they would be going right to work on the big bill and the reconciliation where they -- they're going to put, one would assume, the continuation of the Trump tax cuts from the first term.
 
Maybe more certainly, they'll -- they'll fit some tax cuts in there, extra tax cuts for the very wealthy. 
 
And then immigration. That's such a priority for Trump and was so critical to his victory and to the MAGA base. So that will keep them busy. But lots will be percolating under the surface, I'm sure. 
 
DEAN: Yes, there's no doubt about that. 
 
And you also were -- you told us before our segment that the price of consumer goods and basic staples, does that go down? What happens with that? 
 
SABATO: Well, it's critical because a presidential approval rating sends a message around the world, but particularly to every politician in the United States and everyone in Congress and every governor. If a president is riding high, a president usually gets most of what he wants. But if a president is under 50, if he's below water, it does have an impact. As we've seen with -- with Joe Biden, who was unpopular for three and a half years out of a four year term. 
 
Now, Trump also never went over 50 in his first term, and he still didn't hit 50 even in the election, which he won handily in the Electoral College. So I would think it matters. 
 
And remember, in the election campaign, how many times did Donald Trump say, I'm going to pull those prices down. They're going to tumble. You just wait and see. They're going to be falling. 
 
The dozen eggs that everybody talked about for months and months. Well, you know what, if he's lucky, they won't go up much. But they're certainly not going to fall a lot either. And that really affects the approval rating which affects everything else. 
 
DEAN: Yes. I mean, so many voters in those exit polls and what they've said since, said that was it. That was the reason they were willing to even put things they disagreed with him to the side because of the cost of living and what it is right now in this country. 
 
And then there's also, you know, internationally, they've got the war in Ukraine. What's going on in the Middle East. That's going to drive a lot of the next year as well. 
 
SABATO: Yes. And again, you go back to the pledges and the promises in the campaign, and some people actually hold a president responsible for the promises he makes in a campaign. That may be rare this time. 
 
But remember, he said, in a day, he was going to take care of that Russia, Ukraine business. And then the Middle East. Everybody was going to fall in line because he was president. 
 
Anybody with a grain of sense knows that neither one is going to happen. So I think he'll get a pass on some of that. But he'll have to show some progress, because both of these wars are destabilizing in lots of ways. 
 
DEAN: All right, Larry Sabato, we will look ahead to 2025 together. Thanks so much for being here. We appreciate it. 
 
SABATO: Thank you, Jessica. 
 
DEAN: Still ahead, the new year is now just a few days away. Many of you may be planning to make some resolutions. We're going to run the numbers on the most popular resolutions and how many people follow through with them. 
 <br>[17:34:31]
 
You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
DEAN: Well, with 2025 on the horizon. If you're thinking about a gym membership, maybe a new diet, other big goals, you're not alone. 
 
The new year, of course, , a fresh opportunity to focus on a lot of things your health, your spending, whatever big goal you might have in mind. But how many people actually stick to those resolutions? 
 
Harry Enten joins us now with a special new year's edition of "Run the Numbers." 
 
And, Harry, what can you tell us about -- first, let's just start with getting to the new year. How many people stay awake? 
 
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Yes. Jessica -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
DEAN: -- the clock. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. I'm going to be honest with you. Normally, I, in fact, do not stay awake for the New Year. And it turns out I'm in the minority on this. I like being honest with our viewers. OK? I'm in the 30 percent who do, in fact, usually -- I usually do not stay awake until the New Year's. I'm not a party animal, per se. 
 
This year will be different. I will stay awake this year because -- we'll get to that a little bit later. 
 
The 70 percent, though, who are in the majority, say, yes, people like staying up. They like partying. They like sticking with CNN, perhaps sticking with our dear friends Andy and Anderson and watching our wonderful CNN coverage. 
 
But the bottom line is most people stay awake. But normally, I'm a homebody. I'm like my father who used to go to bed at, I don't know, like 6:00 or 7:00 on New Year's Eve. And then he hit the new year running quite well. 
 
DEAN: Oh, wow. Yes. No, with that, you could get up very early the next day and probably have the city all to yourself. 
 
Let's -- 
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
DEAN: Let's talk resolutions. How many people make a resolution? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. How many people make a resolution. So 40 percent of Americans, you know, they pull this every year and sometimes it's like 35. Sometimes it's like 45, sometimes it's 40, you know? 
 
But I like to take an average for every single poll I can possibly find, including polls on whether people make a New Year's resolution. 
 
And 40 percent make a New Year's resolution. I usually do make a New Year's resolution. But 60 percent, however, do not make a New Year's resolution. 
 <br>[17:40:04]
 
So the bottom line is this. If you don't make a resolution, you're not alone. You're part of the majority. 
 
But look, if you're part of the 40 percent who does, guess what, you got some pretty good looking company with this gentleman on your television screen right now. 
 
DEAN: I mean, look at that. And so what are some of the top ones? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. What are some of the top ones? All right. So let's kind of go through it right? All right. 
 
I don't think these are any big surprises. Jessica. Perhaps one of your New Year's resolutions, if you decide to make one, is on the screen right here. 
 
Exercise more. You know, that's not a bad one. I'd like to keep up with my girlfriend, who runs like, five or six miles every day. Makes me feel pathetic. 
 
Eat healthier. That's definitely one, though. I think I've cut down on my popeyes intake over the years, so that's not half bad. 
 
Save money. I'm probably too good at that one. I don't need to keep up with that one.
 
Up the family time. That's not bad. I will say I'm having dinner a little bit later on with some members of my family, so I'm keeping to that, even though we're not quite to New Year's quite yet.
 
And quit smoking. I should note this has never really been much of a problem for me, because my mother was a pediatrician, former pediatrician. She always told me, wear a seat belt and don't smoke. And I can say I always wear a seat belt, and I've never once smoked. 
 
DEAN: You know, it's funny, my dad is a retired doctor and he said the same thing don't smoke. So there you go. 
 
ENTEN: There you go.
 
DEAN: Those doctors, they know -- they know what they're talking about. 
 
OK, how many people actually keep these resolutions? 
 
ENTEN: Yes. OK. So it's one thing to make the resolution, but the key is to hold the resolution. I feel like Jerry Seinfeld, right? And Seinfeld, the key is to hold the resolution. 
 
So how many people actually keep their New Year's resolution, Jessica? As it turns out, it's less than 50 percent. it's less than 50 percent according to various studies. 
 
I guess my question to you, Jessica, is, do you keep your resolution when you keep it? You have to be honest with the viewers because I've been very honest. 
 
DEAN: You've been very, very honest. 
 
Well, two things. One, I don't I rarely do an actual resolution. Like that's an actual thing. I like more of a mindset for the new year. So this year, I'm going to be more "fill in the blank." 
 
And I will say I'm pretty good about coming back to it. But look, the year is long, and by the time you get to September, October, you know, what are you doing? 
 
So --
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
ENTEN: That's true. And this year was longer than most. It was 366 days instead of 360. 
 
DEAN: That's right. So extra time. 
 
But what -- what will you be? What will your resolution be? 
 
ENTEN: OK, so, you know, I don't have to save really much money. I'm too good at that. I don't have to quit smoking. But this, to me, is my New Year's resolution. And I should say it's basically my New Year's resolution every year, which is be cleaner, be cleaner. 
 
You know, I come across on TV, I think I'm pretty suave for the most part. But I -- if the -- you know, I have some friends off to the side here -- Hey, Lee. Hey, Sabrina -- they can tell you that I'm not that clean. 
 
And that, of course, was my resolution in 2024. And I will note that I failed this resolution, Jessica. I failed this resolution. And in fact, I brought the evidence of failing that resolution right here. 
 
This is a picture of my desk here at Hudson Yards. 
 
DEAN: Oh.
 
ENTEN: I know it's disgusting. It's absolutely disgusting. We can even get the zoom in on the desk. You can tell a few things. One, I'm messy. Two, there's a lot of Buffalo Bills paraphernalia. 
 
And I will note that I am very thankful to Sabrina because I had this idea putting this video into the wall, and I was able to text her just before our segment. And due to the wonders of technology, we were able to show our audience how disgusting my desk truly is. 
 
So this is my failed 2024 resolution. But this year, I promise I'm going to do much better. 
 
DEAN: You can do just a little better, and you will have succeeded in doing something, I think. 
 
ENTEN: Yes. DEAN: And look, being that is a lot of stuff, I don't know how you sit there.
 
But listen, you do you, Harry.
 
ENTEN: I do.
 
DEAN: We support you and we love you. 
 
I do want to ask you what you're doing for New Year's Eve. 
 
ENEN: Yes, I almost gave it away a little bit earlier. 
 
DEAN: I heard it almost slip.
 
ENTEN: Almost slip. But I will be part -- I will be co-hosting with Cari Champion and the wonderful Sara Sidner the central time zone New Year's right here on CNN. 
 
So when they hand off from Andy and Anderson, they'll be handing off to us. We're going to have a great old time down in Austin, Texas, and we're going to get giddy up. And I'll be wearing a nice cowboy hat and having a fun time. 
 
Folks, you should tune in and watch, because what else are you going to do but have a good time with Cari, Sara and myself.
 
DEAN: I love it. Oh, that will be so fun! 
 
Well, a very happy new year to you, Harry. 
 
ENTEN: To you as well. This is always a pleasure. And thanks for putting up with me. Despite my messy desk. 
 
DEAN: We love you just as you are. 
 
ENTEN: Thanks.
 
DEAN: Thank you.
 
ENTEN: Thanks.
