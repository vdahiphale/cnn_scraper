MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company. 
 <br>[00:00:35]
 
Coming up here on CNN, U.S. Republican presidential candidates battling for every single vote under extreme weather conditions, with just hours to go before the Iowa caucuses.
 
As Israel marks more than 100 days since the war with Hamas began, mounting concerns over the prospect of famine in Gaza.
 
And an official U.S. delegation in Taiwan just hours after voters defy China.
 
In just a matter of hours, Republican voters in the U.S. state of Iowa will begin making their choice for the party's next presidential nominee. They will have to brave brutal weather, with wind chills as low as 45 degrees below zero, as the first-in-the-nation caucuses get underway.
 
Presidential hopefuls spent Sunday crisscrossing the state, looking to drum up last-minute support. With the latest polling showing Donald Trump well ahead of his two closest competitors, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are hoping to win over those voters unwilling to commit to Trump.
 
While Iowa is the first contest for Republican presidential hopefuls, each candidate also keeping an eye on the next contest and hoping to head into the New Hampshire primary with as much support as possible. 
 
Our Jeff Zeleny looks at what's at stake on Monday in Iowa.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Brave the weather and go out and save America, because that's what you're doing. 
 
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump is eyeing a knockout victory in Iowa, hoping the first contest sets him on a rocket ride to the Republican nomination.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: USA! USA! USA! 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: USA! USA! USA! 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: USA! USA! USA! 
 
TRUMP: Tomorrow, January 15th, I need each and every one of you to get out. Every -- everybody, you get out, just get out and vote. You got to bring your friend. You know, we say plus ten. So plus ten or plus two or plus 20. But bring them all out, because we have to set the stage for November. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis in a furious scramble for second place, even as they work to sow seeds of doubt about the electability of the former president.
 
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here in Iowa, you have the ability to change the trajectory of American politics. 
 
NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Do something. You can be the start of the solution that we have. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): The closely watched "Des Moines Register" Iowa poll, which showed Trump with a commanding lead, found that 68 percent of likely caucus goers have made up their minds. But a quarter of voters are still deciding. 
 
DESANTIS: You're one of those here today. I hope after this that you commit to us and come out tomorrow and help us. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): The stakes are remarkably high for the Florida governor, who's placed his hopes on a strong Iowa finish. He's counting on a robust organization to ward off the late shift towards Haley.
 
As the former South Carolina governor took the stage at weekend rallies, Drew Klein navigated the snow-covered streets of the Des Moines suburbs, going door to door in search of Haley supporters. 
 
DREW KLEIN, HALEY CAMPAIGN WORKER: Certainly encourage you to get out there. Obviously, we're stumping for Haley. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Some Republicans said they intended to brave the elements. Others did not. 
 
KLEIN: Do you plan on caucusing on Monday?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
 
KLEIN: Not going to get out? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Too cold, buddy. 
 
ZELENY: What do you think the weather is going to do for turnout on caucus day? KLEIN: There are folks that are going to decide to stay home, for
 
 sure. We're trying to overcome that as much as possible by, you know, just kind of laying out to them that the gravity of their votes and their participation, what that means.
 
When you're deciding between the couch at 70 degrees or negative five degrees outside of your front door, it's stuff to get people to go. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): Tonight, the frigid weather remains the biggest wildcard in a race that has been remarkably stable in its dominance by Trump. From summer to winter, with one of his biggest worries now being complacency amongst supporters. 
 
TRUMP: We've got to be sure that we put this thing away. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): The Iowa caucuses come at a critical moment for the Republican Party as voters rendered the first judgments on whether to choose Trump for a rematch with President Joe Biden or move in a new direction.
 
Anne Waggoner (ph) said she intends to skip her weekly Bible study to attend her caucus. She knows Trump holds a commanding lead, but she'll support Haley to keep the Republican primary going beyond Iowa. 
 
ANNE WAGGONER (ph), IOWA VOTER: She needs to know that people are behind her, and the world needs to know that we're serious. 
 
ZELENY (voice-over): In the final hours of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses, the weather certainly is a chief concern for all of the campaigns and the candidates. It is simply out of their hands, with the exception of what they're trying to do to keep their supporters warm and get them to those caucus sites all across Iowa. 
 
As Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis battle for second place, perhaps a bigger question is, can either of them be a roadblock for Trump's march to the nomination?

HOLMES: Israel has now marked a grim milestone: 100 days since the war with Hamas began. 
 
Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv Sunday for the 100 Days of Hell rally, as it was called, held in what is now being called Hostages Plaza. The 24-hour rally drew big numbers, with organizers claiming as many as 120,000 people were present at one point. 
 
Those in attendance observed 100 seconds of silence in honor of the more than 100 Israeli hostages still held captive in Gaza.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
MEIRAV LESHEM GONEN, MOTHER OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE: This was crime against humanity, not crimes against Israel. It was committed against Israeli American, German friends. He doesn't matter. They didn't stop and ask who you are and then where you live.
 
So yes, I want to say to the leaders of the world, this is your responsibility to make sure they're coming back home, all 136 people. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Israeli officials have vowed the fighting will continue until Hamas is defeated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet seeking more funding to make that a reality.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through translator): One of the things that has become clear, beyond any doubt, is that we must conduct this war, and it will take many more months. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Israel says Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the attacks on October 7. Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says nearly 24,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel's military offensive in response.
 
CNN's Jeremy Diamond with more now from Tel Aviv.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Well, 100 days after the October 7 terrorist attacks that sparked this Israel-Hamas war, Israel is facing mounting international pressure as the death toll in Gaza reaches nearly 24,000 people killed, a majority of those women and children. 
 
But amid that international pressure, the Israeli prime minister is defiant, for his part. He says, nobody will stop us from continuing to carry out this war from destroying Hamas and securing the release of those more than 100 hostages still held hostage in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli prime minister promising total victory and warning that this war will take many more months.
 
But it's clear, amid those defiant comments, that there are still concerns that this war between Israel and Hamas could erupt into a broader regional war. That's as we look to the South in Yemen. Houthi rebels there are vowing to continue their attacks on that critical shipping lane in the Red Sea, following strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom, aimed directly at Houthi capabilities in Yemeni. 
 
If you look to the North at the Israel-Lebanese border, there are continuing cross-border clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah.
 
An anti-tank missile fired by Hezbollah hitting a residential home in Northern Israel, killing a 76-year-old woman and her 40-year-old son. 
 
The Israeli military, meanwhile, firing strikes in Southern Lebanon at Hezbollah targets. Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, says that only a ceasefire in Gaza could see the end of those cross-border clashes.
 
Meanwhile, in Israel, as we hit this hundred-day mark, many people across the country are marking 100 days of captivity for those more than 100 hostages who still remain in captivity, held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 
 
Tens of thousands of people flocking to what's become known as Hostages Plaza in Tel Aviv, where a 24-hour rally was held to mark those hundred days of captivity. Messages recorded by leaders across the world flowing in during that ceremony. 
 
And as people mark those hundred days of captivity, we're now learning that negotiators have struck a deal to allow for the entry of medication to the Gaza Strip for some of those 40 hostages who are being held hostage who the Israeli government believes are in need of medication.
 
That medicine will be coming from Qatar, delivered to Egyptian officials, and then to members of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. 
 
But many of the families of those hostages say that they're skeptical that that medication will actually reach those hostages, especially because it's not being delivered by the Red Cross. They say they want to see video proof that that medication is actually reaching those who desperately need it. 
 <br>[00:10:07]
 
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Protests in support of the hostages are popping up outside of Israel, as well. Friends and relatives of German nationals being held in Gaza, marched in Berlin Sunday.
 
Israel has said at least 12 people with German passports were kidnapped on October 7. At least one has died. A few have been released. Supporters say time is running out to return the rest.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): And when each of U.S. sees the pictures of the children, women, men, Holocaust survivors who are being held there, it's clear we must do everything we can to bring them back home. It is really important, because time is running away from us. 
 
IDIT OHEL, MOTHER OF KIDNAPPED PIANIST ALON OHEL: I want to say that it's been 100 days today, and time -- we don't have a lot of time at all. Time is running out, and I feel that we need to do something now now.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Now thousands of people gathered in London for a pro-Israel rally, organized by the Hostage Families Forum U.K. It came just a day after Palestinian supporters held a large demonstration calling for a ceasefire.
 
In the U.K., the Metropolitan Police say they've arrested six people linked to an alleged plot to disrupt the London Stock Exchange. 
 
Authorities believe activists with the Palestine Action Group planned on causing damage and attempting a lock-in to stop the building from opening for trading on Monday morning.
 
Police called the arrest significant, saying they prevented what they described as a damaging stunt, which could have had serious implications, if successful.
 
Detectives launched an investigation after getting tipped off by the British newspaper, "The Daily Express," on Friday.
 
The U.S. says its relations with Taiwan are, quote, "rock solid" as China issues a stern warning after Taiwan held significant elections on Saturday.
 
An unofficial U.S. delegation is in Taiwan, showing unity after the island's ruling party secured an historic third consecutive presidential term. 
 
Responding to the victory, China says any efforts to further Taiwanese independence will be, quote, "severely punished." 
 
CNN's Steven Jiang joins me now from Beijing, but let's start with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout, who is in Hong Kong.
 
And Kristie on the back of Lai's victory, a U.S. delegation there in Taiwan. What's the aim of the visit? What could be the potential fallout? 
 
KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Yes. As you pointed out, this is an an official U.S. delegation. They are currently in Taiwan after that historic presidential election on Saturday. 
 
And this is a move that could very well raise tension. We have -- and I want to show you video of the delegations meeting. It took place this morning with Taiwan president Lai Ching-te, as well as his running mate.
 
Now, the delegation arrived on Sunday, again, an unofficial U.S. delegation, there in Taiwan for some three days of meetings. And Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released photos. Let's bring up the photos for you now.
 
And these photos show an official welcoming the U.S. delegation, including the former national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, also there. The former deputy secretary of state, James Steinberg. Now, during a meeting that they had with President Tsai Ing-wen, which
 
 took place earlier today on Monday. These two former U.S. officials congratulated Taiwan on the election, honest democratic process. And also said that U.S.-Taiwan ties are rock solid. 
 
And according to Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have a statement. They said this: quote, "This visit demonstrates the United States' support for Taiwan and shows that the democratic values cherished and firmly defended by our government and people are the key energy for Taiwan to continue to go global and to face the world." 
 
Ahead of this visit, we heard from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They've warned against any official contact. And they also reiterated that "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," unquote.
 
U.S. officials have said this visit is in line with a longstanding practice of sending, again, former senior U.S. officials to Taiwan after elections. And the purpose of the delegation is to convey the importance of U.S.-Taiwan ties, to reiterate America's "one China" policy. 
 
It was on Saturday where you had that historic election. Taiwan's ruling party, the DPP, pulled off a historic third consecutive presidential victory. Lai Ching-te beat out the two other candidates he received just over 40 percent of the vote.
 
And voter turnout was pretty strong. It came in at over 71 percent. And Lai has said that he would maintain cross-strait status quo, and he would pursue peace through strength. 
 
And he also says that he's open to engagement with Beijing, but China openly loathes his party and has denounced his -- and his views as separatist.
 <br>[00:15:08]
 
Back to you. 
 
HOLMES: All right. Steven Jiang, let's turn to you now in Beijing. It was interesting. The Chinese foreign minister made some comments while he was in Cairo. Talk about that and what option leadership has beyond verbal warnings.
 
STEVEN JIANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Michael. Wang Yi was actually in Cairo on a previously scheduled trip, but without missing a beat, he actually used that location to reinforce Beijing's claim over Taiwan, referring to the 1943 Cairo conference, which of course was about a post-World War II global order to -- to further stakeout this claim that Taiwan has always been part of China, and that has been a global consensus for decades now, that Cairo declaration obviously is not without controversies and has been open to different interpretations. 
 
But while these remarks, as the foreign minister, obviously not surprising than is warning that Taiwan independence is a dead end is also to be expected. But that, of course, stands in contrast to the reality on the ground in Taiwan in terms of that population's growing separate identity and their rejection of Beijing's threats and warnings as shown in this election result. 
 
But even though we have seen quite a bit of added urgency or growing the emphasis on, quote, unquote, "reunification" with Taiwan under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, we may not see too much drastic actions as of now for a variety of reasons.
 
Practically, the weather is not ideal in the Taiwan Strait at this time of the year, so it's not really a good time to stage massive military drills. 
 
And also, Beijing may not want to give Lai Ching-te further ammunition to bolster his argument against Beijing's threats, especially at a time when he received a relatively -- weak mandate, not to mention, perhaps most importantly, Beijing and Xi Jinping himself has invested so much in recent months trying to tamp down tensions with the West, especially with a U.S. at a crucial election year in the U.S., with the campaign season obviously kicking off in earnest. 
 
So that's why we may now see too much, too drastic as of now, but still, they have options. Not just military drills, but also economic coercion and even perhaps flipping another of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic formal -- formal diplomatic, diplomatic allies, Michael. 
 
HOLMES: All right. Steven Jiang in Beijing, Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. Our thanks to you both.
 
Now, North Korea is claiming it successfully tested a ballistic missile on Sunday. According to state media, the country launched a solid fuel intermediate range missile equipped with a hypersonic maneuvering combat unit. 
 
South Korea and Japan say the missile flew about 1,000 kilometers before falling into the waters off the Eastern Korean Peninsula. Seoul says the launch was a clear provocation that, quote, "seriously threatens the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula." 
 
Guatemala was meant to swear in its next -- its new president more than eight hours ago. That -- that hasn't happened yet. 
 
The inauguration ceremony for the incoming president, Bernardo Arevalo was delayed on Sunday after a long debate in the opposition-controlled Congress, whose members need to be sworn in before the president. 
 
You're looking at live pictures, by the way. They're from Guatemala City. Those new lawmakers have now been sworn in, clearing the way to proceed with the inauguration.
 
The hold-up spawned protests, though, outside of Congress, as supporters of Arevalo were seen scuffling with police. Several world leaders and delegates, who traveled to Guatemala for the inauguration, also voiced their support for Arevalo and called on Congress to move forward with the ceremony. Now, a community in Iceland, dealing with a fiery situation, lava surging into a seaside town. We'll have more on the dangerous flow that's forced residents to flee, when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[00:21:15]
 
HOLMES: People rushing to get out of an Icelandic fishing town as molten lava flows into their community. Just have a look at those images. 
 
The country's meteorological office says the lava pouring into the town of Grindavik comes from a new fissure in a nearby volcano. That crack open just North of the town caused by the second eruption this area has seen in recent weeks.
 
Lava sparking fires. You can see it there, burning one house. And the town is now under evacuation orders. So far, 60 households have left. 
 
And turning to Indonesia, where one of that country's most active volcanoes has erupted for the second time in weeks. Mount Marapi began erupting- - erupting on Sunday morning.
 
The country's geological agency warning residents and visitors to stay at least three miles from the crater and told those nearby to wear masks to perfect [SIC] -- protect themselves from falling ash.
 
Nearby homes and evacuation tents were covered in volcanic ash.
 
An eruption in early December killed 23 people hiking the mountain at the time.
 
Authorities in Ecuador have detained more than 1,300 people in an effort to squash an outbreak of gang-based violence. Those arrested include 143 people accused of terrorism, according to the president's office.
 
Authorities claim to have dismantled at least 32 criminal organizations in the last few days. The crackdown coming after last week's explosion of gang violence, which saw an attack on a local TV station, along with explosions and prison riots throughout the country. 
 
National security representatives from more than 80 countries met in Davos to discuss Ukraine's plan for peace, nearly two years since Russia launched its invasion. 
 
Now this was the fourth round of talks based on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's proposals. It was co-chaired by the Swiss foreign minister, who says Russia must be included in these discussions at some point when both sides are ready.
 
The meeting was held on the eve of the annual World Economic Forum, where world leaders gather to discuss the globe's most pressing problems. Zelenskyy says he is preparing to present Ukraine's position, as well
 
 as joint opportunities for those who strive towards a, quote, "world of stability and freedom for their children." 
 
He's expected to address the forum in Davos in person.
 
Well, it seems prison life won't be getting any better for Alexey Navalny after the Russian Supreme Court rejected his claims against the Justice Ministry late last week, according to his spokesperson. 
 
The jailed Kremlin critic was fighting for greater access to religious material in the Siberian penal colony where he's being held. He also talked about the harsh freezing conditions there. 
 
CNN's Matthew Chance gives us an inside look at the facility known as the Polar Wolf. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He seems gaunt, but in good spirits. Alexey Navalny, even cracking jokes and a smile. These first public appearances by the Russian opposition leader since arriving at this arctic penal colony, where temperatures have plunged. 
 
ALEXEY NAVALNY, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): The reality of prison is that it is a very cold place. Do you know why they take newspapers there? To cover up. Because I'm reporting to the court here. It's much warmer to sleep with a newspaper, for example, than without it. And you just need this newspaper to stay warm.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): It's as if the Kremlin is doing everything to make Navalny's sentence, last year extended to more than 30 years, as miserable as possible. 
 <br>[00:25:05]
 
Conditions at the remote Polar Wolf colony -- where he was secretly transferred last month, his family losing contact with him for over two weeks -- are notoriously tough, with dark, freezing winters.
 
In 2021, state controlled Russian television was granted access to the colony where long-term inmates, including some of Russia's most notorious criminals, work in spartan conditions. 
 
Navalny's supporters concern for his welfare say it's far harder now to monitor his condition.
 
KIRA YARMYSH, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S SPOKESPERSON: Just in the North. So it is very old there, and even today the light there is for two hours per day. So I mean, the conditions, like the environment conditions there, are much worse than they were before in Vladimir region. That is close to Moscow. 
 
Now, so from this point of view, they definitely try to isolate Alexey and to make it more difficult to access him there. CHANCE (voice-over): But his previous treatment, Navalny says, was
 
 harsh, too. The opposition figure, his head shaven, telling the judge his ten-minute meal breaks were simply too short in which to eat. 
 
NAVALNY (through translator): I get two mugs of boiling water and two pieces of disgusting bread. And I wanted to drink this boiling water normally and eat this bread normally. But in ten minutes, I must choke on this boiling water. And this is done solely to prevent a person from eating normally.
 
CHANCE (voice-over): But, inevitably, Navalny's complaints against the Russian prison authorities were dismissed by the court. But one of the Kremlin's fiercest critics, there seems little but hardship ahead. 
 
Matthew Chance, CNN, London. 
 
(END VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES: Coming up on the program, experts warning that Gaza is on the brink of famine. What that means for the people trapped inside a brutal war zone with nowhere to go. 
 
That's coming up.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HOLMES: More now on one of the top stories we're following. Israel marking 100 days since the war with Hamas began, Israelis gathering in Tel Aviv Sunday, again calling for the release of more than 100 hostages still in Hamas custody. 
 
Israel's defense minister releasing a statement saying, in part, quote, "We will not let the world forget. We will not leave them behind." 
 
He and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised the war will continue until Hamas is defeated. Officials say they are taking measures to distinguish between civilians in Gaza and Hamas forces.
 <br>[00:30:09]
 
But the Palestinian death toll is nearing 24,000 according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. And now there is worry from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that famine will soon take hold in Gaza, arguing that access to food and water is being used as an instrument of war against the enclave's residents. 
 
Alex De Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, joins me now, and thanks for doing so. It seems extraordinary to even contemplate such a thing at this time in history or in this part of the world. 
 
But this U.N.-affiliated panel says Gaza could tip into famine very soon. Do you agree? Could that happen? 
 
ALEX DE WAAL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD PEACE FOUNDATION: It's very shocking. It's a very rare finding from the famine review committee, which is a highly technical, highly independent body, very widely respected. 
 
And its word has to be taken very, very seriously. And children are already dying of hunger, disease, and the cold in Gaza. And we could very, very soon within weeks be seeing a situation of widespread mass starvation. 
 
HOLMES: With that evidence of malnutrition, if actual famine begins and there's a criteria for that, a technical one, what international laws are there to protect people; and what's the likelihood they be enforced, especially given the stance taken by some Western conflicts on this conflict. Western countries.
 
DE WAAL: The declaration of famine has no legal standing, as such. It's really a moral alarm bell.
 
But a number of international jurists have been warning that Israel is actually committing the war crime of starvation by -- the technical term is destroying objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population and imposing a siege, blocking humanitarian aid, in violation of the Geneva Conventions.
 
And those are war crimes, those that -- those are very serious international war crime.
 
HOLMES: There are always -- I've covered plenty of wars. There are food shortages in war. But do you see this famine risk as less a byproduct of conflict, as opposed to something more deliberate or controlled, because that is a significant difference. 
 
DE WAAL: Well, I think there's several points to make here. One is, as you say, war almost always leads to hunger in one form or another. But the sheer level of destruction and the systematic obliteration of the infrastructure masters, displacement of people and obstruction of relief, is on a scale that we have very, very rarely seen.
 
And both sides are to blame. Hamas is -- has been stealing food, hoarding food, and of course, had a role in provoking this conflict. 
 
But overwhelmingly, the responsibility lies with the state of Israel. 
 
HOLMES: The head of the Israeli agency that oversees policy for the Palestinian territories. It's known as COGAT. The head of that, Colonel Elad Goren, I think his name is. He said at a news conference recently there is sufficient amount of food in Gaza. He blamed humanitarian organizations for the shortages.
 
What do you say to that? 
 
DE WAAL: I think he's denying what is a very obvious reality to a lot of independent humanitarian organizations, journalists, and analysts. And I don't think his statement holds any water. 
 
HOLMES: How how easily can what is a significant risk be mitigated, turned around. What would it take? DE WAAL: Well, some things need to be done immediately. I mean, the mass destruction of what is indispensable to survival needs to stop. A sort of full spectrum aid operation needs to be put in place.
 
But that won't turn around the situation immediately. When you get a humanitarian crisis of this scale and gravity, it's like a huge freight train moving at great speed. And even if the driver puts on the brakes, it's still going to take a long time to stop. So the urgency cannot be underestimated. Action needs to be taken at once. 
 
HOLMES: Yes. We are around 100 days or so into this military action by Israel. I was reading James Elder from UNICEF. He talked about the stunning speed with which the famine risk has been created. Would you agree? What surprises you about the situation as it unfolds? 
 
DE WAAL: I've been studying famine and starvation as a war crime for 40 years, and I've never seen a situation that has unfolded with this speed at this scale. 
 <br>[00:30:13]
 
And the famine warning was issued based on data that was gathered a month ago. And the warning was that, by early February, unless things changed dramatically, Gaza would be in famine. And we are halfway through that, that warning period, and nothing significant has changed. It is very disturbing. 
 
HOLMES: Just seems extraordinary that it could be happening, but Alex de Waal, I got to leave it there. Really appreciate your time. Thank you. 
 
DE WAAL: You're very welcome.
 
HOLMES: Coming up next, it is the beginning of a new royal era in Denmark as the newly crowned king, Frederik X takes the throne. We'll bring you a recap of an historic day, when we come back.
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
 
HOLMES: Scenes there from Copenhagen on Sunday, where the night sky was lit up, like the Danish crown jewels, in celebration of their new sovereign, King Frederik X. 
 
His mother formally abdicated on Sunday afternoon. She is the first Danish monarch to do that in nearly 900 years. 
 
After ascending the throne, the newly crowned king addressed cheering crowds from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KING FREDERIK X, DANISH KING (through translator): Today, the throne has passed on. My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow. It is a task I have approached all my life. It is a task I take on with pride, respect, and great joy.
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
HOLMES: Well, despite the shock of Queen Margrethe's abdication, a Reuters poll indicates that the newly crowned King Frederik and his wife, Queen Mary, will begin their rule with the same high popularity enjoyed by Denmark's beloved former queen. 
 
Here's another look at the day's events.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
HOLMES (voice-over): With the stroke of a pen, Queen Margrethe of Denmark ended her reign of more than five decades, voluntarily giving up her position so her son, King Frederik, could ascend the throne. 
 
Thousands of well-wishers cheered as the new king and his wife, Queen Mary, waved to the crowds who gathered, despite the cold weather.
 
KING FREDERIK (through translator): Today, the throne is passed on. My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Historic transition, even though there was no crowning ceremony, no monarch in Denmark has abdicated in nearly 900 years. It was little more than two weeks ago the now former queen set the stunning succession in motion. 
 <br>[00:40:11]
 
QUEEN MARGRETHE, FORMER QUEEN OF DENMARK (through translator): I will step down as queen of Denmark. I will hand over the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): In royal circles, abdication is rare but not unheard of. In 2019, Emperor Akihito of Japan abdicated in favor of his son. 
 
Five years earlier, King Juan Carlos of Spain also gave up his crown. He said it was time for a new era, but he was also plagued by a series of scandals. 
 
In 2013, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands stepped down, following the tradition of her mother and grandmother, who both abdicated later in life.
 
Until recently, there was no indication Margrethe would follow suit. She said health issues had made her think twice about the future, perhaps not only for herself, but the country.
 
LARS HOVBAKKE SORENSEN, HISTORIAN: She wants, maybe, to avoid a previous situation, where Prince Charles became King Charles when he was more than 70 years. Frederik is 55 years old.
 
HOLMES (voice-over): Denmark's new king, Frederik X, will be roughly the same age as some of his contemporaries. King Felipe of Spain is 55. King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands is 56, all younger than the long-serving monarchs like King Harald of Norway, who is 86 years old, and King Carl Gustaf of Sweden, who's 77. Royal watchers say King Frederik's reign will likely be a more modern
 
 one, focused on lifestyle issues, the environment and social activism.
 
SORENSEN: He's much more interested in sport and in modern music, while his monarch mother has had always an interest in classical music and arts in literature, in ballet. 
 
HOLMES (voice-over): And the people overwhelmingly support him. According to Reuters, a recent survey says 82 percent of Danes expect the new king to do well, or very well, in his new role. 
 
His Australian-born wife, Mary, faring even better, at 86 percent.
