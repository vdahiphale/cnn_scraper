Amen.
 
RISHI SUNAK, BRITHS PRIME MINISTER: The reading is taken from the first chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians. For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.
 
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness. Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
 
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. This is the word of the Lord.
 
ALL: Thanks be to God.
 
SUNAK: Thanks be to God.

DAME SARAH MULLALLY, DEAN OF HM CHAPELS ROYAL:  The Lord be with you. 
 
CONGREGATION:  And with thy spirit.   
 
MULLALLY:  Hear the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke. 
 
CONGREGATION:  Glory be to thee, oh, Lord.   
 
MULLALLY:  Jesus came to Nazareth where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto Him the book of the Prophet Isaiah. And when He'd opened the book, He found the place where it was written, "the spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.   
 
He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And He closed the book, and gave it again to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on Him.   
 
And He began to say unto them, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." This is the gospel of the Lord.   
 
CONGREGATION:  Praise be to thee, oh, Christ.   
 
(ACAPPELLA) 
 
JUSTIN WELBY, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY:  Come, Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with the flame of your love. Amen! 
 <br>[06:35:00] 
 
We are here to crown a king. And we crown a king to serve. What is given today is for the gain of all. For Jesus Christ announced a kingdom in which the poor and oppressed are freed from the chains of injustice. The blind see. The bruised and brokenhearted are healed. That kingdom sets the aims of all righteous government, all authority. 
 
And the kingdom also sets the means of all government and authority. For Jesus doesn't grasp power or hold on to status. The King of Kings, Jesus Christ, was anointed not to be served, but to serve. He creates the unchangeable law of good authority. That with the privilege of power comes the duty to serve. Service is love in action.   
 
We see active love in our care for the most vulnerable. The way we nurture and encourage the young in the conservation of the natural world. We have seen those priorities in the life of duty lived by our king. Today, we have the honor of being in this abbey with so many who show such love.   
 
You work with charities and organizations. You build community. You serve the nation in armed forces, in emergency services and so many other ways. Next door are 400 or more extraordinary young people in St. Margaret's Church whose lives speak of service. Around the world in realms and commonwealth, are so many more.   
 
You live your lives for the sake of others. The unity you show, the example you give is what binds us together and offers societies that are strong, joyful, happy and glorious. They bear heavyweights for us. And the weight of the task given today, your majesties, is only bearable by the spirit of God, who gives us the strength to give our lives to others.   
 
With the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the king is given freely what no ruler can ever attain through will or politics or war or tyranny. The Holy Spirit draws us to love in action. This is promised by Jesus, who put aside all privilege, because as the first reading tells us, God will give all things for our sake, even His own life. His throne was a cross. His crown was made of thorns. His regalia were the wounds that pierced His body.   
 
Each of us is called by God to serve. Whatever that looks like in our own lives, each of us can choose God's way today. We can say to the King of Kings, God himself, as does the king here today, give grace, that in thy service, I may find perfect freedom. In that prayer, there is promise beyond measure, joy beyond dreams, hope that endures.   
 <br>[06:40:00] 
 
By that prayer, for every king, every ruler, and yes, for every person, for all of us, we are opened to the transforming love of God. Amen.   
 
(CHOIR SINGING) 
 
Blessed art thou, sovereign God, upholding with thy grace all who are -- all who called to thy service. The prophets of old anointed priests and kings to serve in thy name, and in the fullness of time, thy only Son was anointed by the Holy Spirit to be the Christ, the savior and servant of all.   
 
By the power of the same spirit, grant that this holy oil may be for thy servant Charles a sign of joy and gladness, that as king, he may know the abundance of thy grace and the power of thy mercy, and that we may be made a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for thine own possession. Blessed be God, our strength and our salvation, now and forever, Amen. 
 
CONGREGATION:  Be God, our strength and our salvation, now and forever, Amen.

(CHOIR SINGING) 
 <br>[06:50:00] 
 
WELBY:  Receive these spurs, symbols of military honor and chivalry, that you may be a brave advocate for those in need. 
 
(CHOIR SINGING) 
 
Hear our prayers, and Lord, we beseech you, and so direct and support thy servant, King Charles, that he may not bear the sword in vain, but may use it as the minister of God to resist evil and defend the good through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.    
 
Receive this kingly sword. May it be to you and to all who witness these things a sign and symbol, not of judgment, but of justice, not of might, but of mercy. 
 
(CHOIR SINGING) 
 
With this sword, do justice. Stop the growth of iniquity, protect the holy Church of God and all people of goodwill. Help and defend widows and orphans. Restore the things that have gone to decay. Maintain the things that are restored. Punish and reform what is amiss, and confirm what is in good order.   
 
That doing these things, you may be glorious in all virtue, and so faithfully serve our Lord Jesus Christ in this life, that you may reign forever with Him in the life which is to come. Amen!
 <br>[06:55:00]
 
(CHOIR SINGING)
 
Receive the bracelets of sincerity and wisdom, token of the Lord's protection, embracing you on every side.   
 
Receive this robe. May the Lord clothe you with the robe of righteousness and with the garments of salvation.   
 
Receive this orb, set under the cross, and remember always that the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our God and of His Christ.   
 
Receive this ring, a symbol of kingly dignity, and a sign of the covenant sworn this day between God and king, king and people.   
 
Receive this glove that you may hold authority with gentleness and grace, trusting not in your own power, but in the mercy of God.</pre>
