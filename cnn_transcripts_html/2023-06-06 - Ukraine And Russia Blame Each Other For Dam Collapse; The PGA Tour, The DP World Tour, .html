ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York. And this is ONE WORLD. 
 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy is blaming Russian terrorists. The Kremlin is accusing Kiev of sabotage. It's still not clear what or who caused the breach of a 
 
 critical dam in Russian-controlled Southern Ukraine, but it's a heightening alarm at Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, a plant that 
 
 relies on dam water to cool its reactors. And right now, that water is flowing out into the Dnieper River in fast-moving currents, threatening to 
 
 flood the region. 
 
Ukrainian authorities are urging residents living downstream to immediately evacuate the area. And Kyiv is calling for an urgent U.N. Security Council 
 
 meeting to address the situation. A Ukrainian lawmaker spoke to CNN a short time ago about why he believes that this was certainly no accident. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN: What evidence do you have at this point? 
 
OLEKSIY GONCHARENKO, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: I want to add now, evidence we have, 70 years this dam was standing, 70 years before Russian 
 
 army came. And now, it collapsed. Also, we know for sure that Russia minded and they said it openly, we have a lot of video recordings and Russian 
 
 military was saying that the dam is mined by Russians. The third thing, the dam was not shot. There was no shelling on the dam from Ukrainian side, but 
 
 just in the night, it collapsed. So the explosion was inside the dam. So it's absolutely clear and the dam is controlled by Russians today, was 
 
 controlled before it collapsed. 
 
So I'm sorry, but I can speak absolutely directly and for 100% that it was destroyed by Russians. There is no other way how this could happen. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: And the IAEA says, at least for now, there is no imminent nuclear safety risk. The dam incident comes amid much speculation as to when 
 
 Ukraine's counteroffensive will begin. CNN's Clare Sebastian has more on why the location of this dam breach is causing so much concern and what 
 
 impact, if any, it might have on Ukraine's counteroffensive. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Novokarhovka Dam sits directly on the front line of this conflict, straddling the Dnieper River, one bank in 
 
 Ukrainian hands, and this red area here is Russian occupied territory. The hydroelectric power plant itself is in Russian controlled territory. Well, 
 
 this satellite image from late May really gives you a sense of the layout. This is Russian held territory here and Ukrainian up here. 
 
Now, the Ukrainian hydroelectric energy operator says the explosion happened in the engine room from the inside, so on Russian occupied 
 
 territory. And while both Russia and Ukraine say the dam was breached overnight Monday into Tuesday, there is actually evidence of damage in the 
 
 days leading up to that. Take a look at these satellite images. You can see from this image at the end of May, this part of the structure is intact. 
 
 Fast forward to June 5th and clearly, there's a piece missing. And it's right in the middle where we see the dam has now been breached. 
 
Well, the biggest immediate risk from this breach is of course flooding. This is the danger zone here, as identified by Ukraine's Interior Ministry. 
 
 And we're already seeing images coming out of Ukrainian-controlled Kherson city. You can see water filling up the streets there and across the river 
 
 in Russian-controlled Novokarhovka, which is the town closest to that hydroelectric power plant. Another risk is that the reservoir that is 
 
 created by that dam supplies water to Crimea, down here in the south, Russian-held Crimea. The head of that region saying there is a risk the 
 
 canal will run too shallow, that they have enough water for now. And Kharovka also supplies water up here to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power 
 
 plant to cool the reactors. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says there is no immediate danger. 
 
Now, the question, of course, given the timing of this, is how it will affect Ukraine's counteroffensive. It's not 100% clear until we have a full 
 
 picture of the damage, but flooding over here could potentially complicate the Ukrainian effort to cross the Dnieper River, to head south even for 
 
 Crimea or even over here to the Azov Sea, if that is in fact part of their plan. It could also of course divert attention and resources away from 
 
 attacking other areas along this Crimea or even over here to the Azov Sea, if that is in fact part of their plan. It could also of course divert 
 
 attention and resources away from attacking other areas along this hundreds of miles of frontline. Clare Sebastian, CNN London.

ASHER: A stunning development in the world of golf. The PGA Tour and the DP World Tour and Liv Golf have announced a partnership. The move ends the 
 
 lawsuits between them. The Saudi-backed Liv Golf series has been controversial after several golfers refused to join it, others quit the PGA 
 
 Tour for the new series. No word yet on what the new entity will be called. 
 
Let's get to CNN Sports Don Riddell, who's been covering this story since it broke. I guess a few hours ago. Don, I mean this would have seems to 
 
 really come out of the blue. You have these two entities who have been embroiled in lawsuits. You also have the Liv golf -- Liv golfers, rather, 
 
 who have been sort of accused of being traitors at the same time and accused of assisting in sports washing. Just explain to us how this deal 
 
 came about. 
 
DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORT: Well, we don't know exactly how it came about. Zain, as you say, it only broke a couple of hours ago. We were surprised by 
 
 it. Most importantly, I think many of the players were completely by this. So the dust is a long way from settling at this point. And I think some of 
 
 the players have a lot of questions. Some of the players, like Rory McIlroy, who went above and beyond to defend the PGA Tour in all of this, 
 
 must now feel somewhat betrayed, because the thing that they were trying to defend has now kind of gone ahead and done a deal with the Liv Tour anyway. 
 
A lot of questions are gonna be asked of the PGA Tour Commissioner, Jay Monahan. He is going to be meeting with the players at 4 o'clock this 
 
 afternoon. This is what he had to say about this deal a short time ago. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
JAY MONAHAN, PGA TOUR COMMISSIONER: There's been a lot of tension in our sport over the last couple of years. But what we're talking about today is 
 
 coming together to unify the game of golf and to do so under one umbrella. And together we're going to move forward and we're going to take efforts to 
 
 grow and expand this great game and to take it to new heights. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
RIDDELL: Now, just a year ago, Jay Monahan, when he was talking about the emergence of this breakaway, Saudi-backed Liv Tour, he talked about the 9-
 
 11 families and just basically how much of a betrayal this must have felt that these players were leaving to join the Liv Tour. Now, he is apparently 
 
 okay with being in business with the Saudis and the Liv Tour. The 9-11 families say that they are shocked. 
 
They had no idea that this was coming. They clearly feel completely blindsided by all of this. And as I say, the dust is still settling. We 
 
 still don't know exactly how this is all going to play out. But as I think you mentioned at the top, Zain, all pending litigation is now over. The 
 
 tours were suing, counter suing, some players were suing. All of that is now over. 
 
I understand that at the end of this season, the 2023 season, players who left, quit the tours or who were excommunicated are now going to be allowed 
 
 to rejoin the tours. And so it's kind of -- it's just going to be so interesting to see how the players on the other side of the fence feel 
 
 about this because it's hard to see how the Liv players aren't big winners in this because they were paid handsomely to join the Liv Tour, and if they 
 
 can now join the DP World Tour and the PGA Tour anyway then they've made out okay I would say. 
 
ASHER: Yeah. I heard you saying earlier that they essentially hadn't had the last laugh. All right. 
 
RIDDELL: Right.
 
ASHER: Don Riddell live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
Protesters are back on the streets in cities across France for the 14th time it's seen as a last ditched effort by unions over pension reform that 
 
 raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Trade unions aren't giving up the fight, even after the bill was signed into law in April. Earlier, 
 
 demonstrators stormed the Olympic headquarters in Paris, chanting, no repeal, no Olympics. About 600,000 people are expected to protest, 
 
 according to a CNN affiliate. CNN's Melissa Bell is live now from Paris. 
 
So, Melissa, it's about half the number compared to the height of previous protests, so about 600,000. I mean, what do the protesters at this point 
 
 hope to achieve given that this reform has now become law? 
 
MELISSA BELL, PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Given, Zain, that the reforms are now going through, there's really nothing they can do about it, either really 
 
 in a parliamentary sense or in a judicial one. But also the main union has announced that this will likely be the last one. And yet, as you can see, 
 
 Zain, they're trying to clear the square even now. We've now made it to the Place d'Italie. This was the aim of the Paris march. You can see the riot 
 
 police. They're trying to clear people out and using tear gas to try and get the protesters' leave. 
 <br>[12:10:01] 
 
What we did see, even though we're now seeing this, were fewer numbers. I mean, really nothing like what we've seen over the course of the last few 
 
 weeks and months. A few clashes like the ones you're seeing there, but nothing like the violence either. There were fewer people on the street. 
 
 And I think the sense that the unions themselves say that this is likely to be the last burst of anger have contributed to the fact that it's 
 
 essentially been a lot calmer than they had been. 
 
Still, what the protesters here today say is this is about showing their anger towards the government. And it is back, it is in September when the 
 
 government comes back. And at that point, announces fresh reforms because he has plenty more plan that you're likely to see this movement pick up 
 
 once again. Zain.
 
ASHER: And just talk us through what is happening behind you. You're around the Place d'Italie from what I understand and you were talking about tear 
 
 gas being dispersed at protesters there. Just set the scene for us, Melissa. 
 
BELL: Well, we've seen a little bit of it today, not as much as we normally see. I mean, you can have days when you find yourself drowning in tear gas. 
 
 Today, there was less of it. There were fewer scuffles. It was a much more orderly march. But again, the numbers were nothing like what we've seen 
 
 over the course of the last few weeks. And still, I'll just show you around this square, the Place d'Italie at this hour, where this is what happens 
 
 every time, the riot police come in, try and get everyone to go home, and generally it ends with a few scuffles. And again, that anger against the 
 
 police, that anger against institutions expressing itself. 
 
But for the government, essentially, they've won this. They've managed to get their reform through. They've had six months of disruption, protest 
 
 strikes. But a movement, and this had been their gamble, that seems at last now to be petering out. Again, those underlying angers, fears that we saw 
 
 during the Yellow Vest that we saw again during this round of protests, still there and likely to come back with future reforms. But for the time 
 
 being, this particular series of protests, this could well be the last this season.
 
ASHER: After 14 of them since January. Melissa Bell live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
And protesters took to the streets of Kenya on Tuesday, angry about a finance bill that proposes a series of new taxes. Police fired tear gas to 
 
 disperse the crowd and arrested 11 protesters. The finance bill would raise taxes on a wide range of items, including food and fuel. Ordinary Kenyans 
 
 say they cannot afford the higher prices. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNKNOWN: We are suffering in short. People need money. And that money is being taxed. You are being taxed twice for something that you need to get 
 
 free. So we need that financial ability to go down. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: Organizers say the police were heavy handed in cracking down on what was an otherwise peaceful protest. The Kenyan government says it needs more 
 
 tax revenues to continue paying its bills. 
 
And for the first time in 132 years, a senior British Royal has taken the witness stand in a court case. In London earlier today, Prince Harry 
 
 testified in his years-long legal battle with a British tabloid press. The Duke of Sussex is suing the Mirror Group newspapers, alleging its 
 
 journalists hacked into his phone and used other illicit methods to snoop into his personal life. 
 
Defense lawyers have grilled him on the specifics of his accusations and even used excerpts from the Duke's book, Spare, to back up that claims that 
 
 there is some cooperation between the palace and the media. He's since left court after a grueling cross-examination. CNN's Royal Correspondent Max 
 
 Foster is joining us live now from London. So Max, just take us through the testimony, because the lawsuit, of course, is dredging up a lot of private 
 
 and embarrassing moments from Harry's past that the public is now passing through again. Take us through.
 
MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, very specific stories of 33 Mirror stories, ranging across everything really, but a lot of it about 
 
 Chelsea Davy, for example, his former girlfriend and how the tabloids were getting information on that relationship. He argues that they could only be 
 
 getting this information from illegal means, mainly hacking, hacking into his phone, hacking into the phones of people around him. And that's what 
 
 his issue is with this particular case, part of a series of cases, which is all for him about reforming the British press. 
 
Under cross examination, he was really taken through each one of those stories and asked to justify where he thought the hacking was and the 
 
 barrister for Mirror Group basically saying that it probably wasn't from hacking in most of those cases. They deny it absolutely, saying it could 
 
 have come from other newspapers or indeed from other palace sources feeding the Mirror stories. 
 
So trying to undermine each of those claims of hacking that Harry's put out there. He wasn't really across a lot of the detail. He did say he wrote his 
 
 own witness statement, but at times, scrambling around to find his way around it. So he didn't seem particularly prepared, but I think that, you 
 
 know, he won't come out there feeling frustrated by that because his point is much bigger and broadly across. 
 <br>[12:15:01] 
 
If you take all of these articles together, they caused the distress which really affected him growing up and that he didn't trust his circle of 
 
 friends and they became ever smaller. That's his wider point here. And the one is trying to push home. 
 
ASHER: All right. Max Foster live for us there. Thank you so much. We'll have much more on this story a little bit later on in the show.
 
Authorities in India are appealing to families to help identify some of the victims after the country's worst trained disaster in decades. A team From 
 
 the Federal Central Bureau of Investigation has reached the site to begin an investigation. At least 275 people were killed and more than a thousand 
 
 injured. CNN's Ivan Watson reports from the crash site in Eastern India.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
IVAN WATSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORREPONDENT: This is what happens when a passenger train moving at 80 miles per hour, that's around 128 kilometers 
 
 per hour, slams into an immovable object. You get enormous -- train cars like this thrown over, overturned as if they were children's toys. Now, 
 
 just days ago, this was the scene of one of the deadliest train disasters in modern Indian history. And already, the railroad has been reopened, and 
 
 we can see what looks like a brand new, modern train moving down the tracks here. That is even as scores of people are still looking for their missing 
 
 loved ones from the accident that took place on Friday night. 
 
Now, the initial accident authorities say was caused by a switching malfunction. So a passenger train was moved onto a track where there was a 
 
 parked freight train loaded with iron ore and that crash sent some of the train cars into the other track, where there was an approaching mistake led 
 
 to absolutely catastrophic results. 
 
As you can see, the railroad here has been reopened. We have another train moving through right now. And the railroad system in India, it dates back 
 
 in origins to when this country was a British colony. And it is essential to this country. More than 13 million people a day move around on trains in 
 
 India. So that's part of why the authorities have worked so hard to reopen the rails after the train crash. I am going to show you over here. This is 
 
 an example of a railroad station in the Indian countryside. And it also happens to be just within sight, if you see the lights down there, of where 
 
 the terrible train crash happened on Friday night. 
 
The very next day, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he was supposed to go inaugurate a brand new high-speed train. Instead, he had to rush to the 
 
 crash, to survey the recovery efforts and to meet with some of the survivors. The Indian government has great ambitions to modernize this 
 
 country but as this terrible tragedy has highlighted, there's also a lot of work to be done to maintain aging and essential infrastructure. Ivan 
 
 Watson, CNN in Odisha State in Eastern India. 
 
ASHER: All right. Coming up here on ONE WORLD, heavy rain unleashes deadly flooding in Haiti, and with it, yet another crisis for the Caribbean island 
 
 nation, already dealing with a growing series of hardships. 
 
And routine maintenance or routine sabotage, why the U.S. government thinks there may be more to the drained pool at Donald Trump's home.

 <br>[12:20:01] 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: The instinct of damage is being increasing -- it is becoming rather increasingly clear in Haiti after a weekend of torrential downpours and 
 
 widespread flooding. At least 42 people are dead, dozens more injured and thousands of homes destroyed. Dramatic scenes like this are taking place 
 
 across the country as residents try to outrun the rising waters, often with little more than the clothes on their backs. 
 
And now, we're learning at least four people were killed and 36 others injured following a 4.9 earthquake that struck Haiti earlier today. The 
 
 Caribbean Island nation is no stranger to hardship. It's already struggling with devastating gang violence and political instability while teetering on 
 
 the brink of economic collapse. The U.N. says even before this weekend's rain, nearly half of Haiti's population was in need of humanitarian 
 
 assistance. 
 
Garry Pierre-Pierre is the founder and editor of the Haitian Times. He joins us live now. So, Gary, thank you so much for being with us. I wish we 
 
 could talk about Haiti in a much more positive context. But here's the thing. Just in terms of the situation on the ground, gangs approximately 
 
 control about 80 percent of Port-au-Prince. 
 
Obviously, you have vigilantes that have sort of now gone up against the gangs and are attacking the gangs and essentially taking the law into their 
 
 own hands. You also have flooding in various parts of the country. On top of that, an earthquake that struck this morning. How is Haiti coping with 
 
 these back-to-back humanitarian disasters?
 
GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, FOUNDER AND EDITOR OF HAITIAN TIMES: Thanks for having me, Zain. And I must say, my heart goes out to my fellow Haitians in Haiti, 
 
 who have been suffering so much. But this is a result of chronic bad governance that's been decades in the making. And we're seeing the results 
 
 right now. There is no functioning government for what it's worth. People are left on their own to survive, to defend for themselves. The state, the 
 
 police can no longer provide that. 
 
And on top of that, we have national disasters. Well, we know Haiti is in the Caribbean. When it comes to May, June, July, August, these are 
 
 hurricane season months. And so, there's very little that the government's past and current have done to mitigate the disasters once they come. And 
 
 so, we need a governance-restored in Haiti, and so that the state can provide the people with the help when they need it. 
 
ASHER: So what are you hearing in terms of what's happening in the ground? I mean, obviously, these particular floods have largely spared Port-au-
 
 Prince, not entirely, but largely. But there are still thousands of people, 13,000 people displaced as a result of these floods. What are you hearing 
 
 from the ground in terms of what is the greatest need at this point? Food, drinking water, I imagine, shelter, especially for those people who no 
 
 longer have a place to live? 
 
PIERRE-PIERRE: The biggest need is shelter right now, because you have to remember, Zain, on top of these displaced people, there were already 
 
 displaced people fleeing gang violence in the country, in the city, as you mentioned. And so, right now, people need water, they need shelter. And we 
 
 have reporters on the ground working, reporting as we speak, on the conditions and what the needs are. 
 <br>[12:24:53]
 
ASHER: So in terms of humanitarian groups and aid agencies, what are they up against? Because yes, on the one hand, you're navigating humanitarian 
 
 crises just in terms of the flooding, which a lot of these aid agencies are used to, but the environment is particularly unique parts of Port-au-
 
 Prince. And then on top of that, you have these vigilantes who, as I mentioned, have taken the law into their own hands and who are now 
 
 attacking and murdering suspected-- this is key-suspected gang members. They don't even know whether they're gang members for sure, but if they 
 
 suspect they're a gang member, they could end up dead at the hands of these vigilante groups. So what are the unique challenges for aid agencies 
 
 operating in this kind of environment? 
 
PIERRE-PIERRE: Well, first of all, many of these aid organizations stopped their work in Haiti, most notably Doctors Without Borders, because the 
 
 situation been so dangerous for them, because they were operating in gang control territory. And other aid organizations left, for the most part, all 
 
 have had their work curtailed significantly. So right now, it's unclear what the government is doing to alleviate the problem. 
 
Because the biggest -- the other challenge is the gang situation, because while you do have the vigilante, the Bwa Kale movement, that's also 
 
 dangerous, because it could go into lawlessness, the likes we haven't seen in Haiti, where suspected people use that movement to settle scores, and 
 
 then you have another mess in our hands. And so, I think the police need to regain control, and also now to help facilitate the humanitarian 
 
 desperately needed right now with this earthquake in the South and the rain across the country. 
 
ASHER: And I remember seeing images of police officers protesting in the streets, because they just didn't know what to do in terms of controlling 
 
 these gangs. Acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry did make an urgent plea to the international community. He wanted outside international intervention, 
 
 possibly led by Canada, or the United States or the U.N. to come and assist in terms of containing the gang violence in the country. Where are we on 
 
 that? Because a lot of these countries were reluctant to lead any such group. Where are we on that, and where does that leave Haiti? 
 
PIERRE-PIERRE: Well, where we are there is CARICOM is trying to broker some kind of movement, a deal with the ANRI and the opposition, the primary 
 
 opposition group is the Montana Accord. And so, you know, CARICOM is not equipped to deal with Haiti. And the international community, the U.N. has 
 
 had a shaky past in its interventions. And the U.S. right now just is not interested in going back to Haiti. 
 
And so, while the international community trying to figure out how to help, I think what needs, what they can do concretely is to help the police 
 
 regain control. Right now, the police department in Haiti is under arms embargo while arms are flowing into the gangs' hands. And so, this is 
 
 unfair. And they need material, they need all kinds of weapons to fight these gangs, so that the country can have a chance to stay. And get back on 
 
 the way to functioning democracy, which, you know, Zain, there is no elected official in Haiti. So right now, Haiti is a democracy in name only. 
 
 It is not a practicing, a functioning democracy. 
 
ASHER: Yeah. And a lot of people have issues with the acting Prime Minister, Ariel Henry. I wish we had time to talk about that a little bit 
 
 longer, but I am out of time. Garry Pierre-Pierre, thank you so much for being with us. 
 
PIERRE-PIERRE: Thank you, Zain. 
 
ASHER: All right, still to come, the link between Prince Harry and his great-great-great-grandfather on the day Harry takes the stand and tries to 
 
 take down the tabloids. That's story next.

ASHER: Hello and welcome back to ONE WORLD. Let's catch up on the headlines. 
 
The Arctic sea ice, that is an essential part of our planet's ecology, is disappearing. A new study says we could see all the sea ice melt in the 
 
 Arctic, sometime in the summer in the 2030s. The bright white ice in the Arctic reflects solar rays away from the Earth. So when it melts, that 
 
 amplifies global warming even more. 
 
France marked the 79 years since the D-Day invasion of Normandy earlier. Dignitaries and veterans from around the world gathered for ceremonies 
 
 honoring the day that changed the course of World War II. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd were among those 
 
 attending.
 
Ten nationals from the Democratic Republic of Congo have been killed in a bombardment near a university in Khartoum. The DRC blamed Sudan's army for 
 
 Sunday's strikes on the campus of the International University of Africa. The DRC is asking Sudan to open a humanitarian corridor to evacuate its 
 
 wounded and stranded citizens. 
 
Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has spent this day making history. He is the first senior Royal to testify in court since his great-great-great-
 
 grandfather, Edward VII, testified in a case of an adamant man who cheated at cards. That was 130 years ago. In dramatic testimony today, Harry called 
 
 the British tabloids vile and said that they have blood on their hands. He said it is likely that millions of articles have been written about him. 
 
And he alleges some of the information in those articles was illegally obtained through phone hacking and other illicit means. This case focuses 
 
 on the Mirror Group, but it is one of multiple lawsuits that Harry has filed against the press. And it's worth noting that this case will not be 
 
 easy for Harry to win. He must prove that the tabloids got the information illegally and not from leaks within the palace walls. 
 
Time now for the Exchange. And we take you to just outside the courthouse in London. Joining me live now is Jim Waterson. He is the Media Editor for 
 
 The Guardian and has been tracking this trial for months. Jim, thank you so much for being with us. So here's the thing. In the Netflix documentary, 
 
 Harry and Meghan, and in Harry's memoir, Spared -- Spare rather, he spent quite a while trying to convince all of us and prove to all of us that 
 
 members of his own family, members of the Royal family essentially traded information about him to members of the tabloids, to the British press, and 
 
 they betrayed him behind his back. 
 
How does he prove, what is he up against in terms of proving that these journalists actually hacked into his phone to obtain some of this 
 
 information, as opposed to the fact that they just had sources within his family within the palace, which is what he spent quite a while trying to 
 
 prove to us in the Netflix documentary. 
 <br>[12:35:15] 
 
JIM WATERSON, THE GUARDIAN MEDIA EDITOR: Well, that is the exact case that the Mirror's lawyers spent today putting to Harry. We do know for a fact 
 
 that some newspaper groups in the U.K. did hack Royal mobile phones. We know that Prince William and Harry were targeted by Rupert Murdoch's News 
 
 of the World in the mid-2000s, and people went to jail for that, and the newspaper was eventually shut down. What we've heard today is a back and 
 
 forth over whether the Mirror group, which was one of the smaller publishers, was doing the same. 
 
Essentially, the argument from Harry's side is, you wrote so much about me and I have no idea where you got a lot of this information from but because 
 
 you were also, and you do admit hacking other people, surely you were also hacking me and a lot of it is circumstantial. And the Mirror says look we 
 
 did hack other people but I'm really sorry Harry, in this case it wasn't you. So it's a lot of a sort of he said, she said and circumstantial 
 
 evidence. There isn't one single smoking gun. But Harry is trying to convince the judge that on the balance of probabilities he was the victim 
 
 of illegal behavior by this one newspaper group. 
 
ASHER: When you think about it, the idea of having your most private, most embarrassing, most intimate moments blasted on front pages, basically since 
 
 you were born, essentially, whether it's to do with your parents' marriage, whether it's to do with the months after the death of your mother, your 
 
 turbulent teenage years, that deserves sympathy, right? However, there doesn't seem to be that much sympathy for Harry. Why not? 
 
WATERSON: Well, certainly not in the British media because one of the good reasons is that Harry's suing most of them. There's only three national 
 
 newspapers in the U.K., The Guardian, the --
 
ASHER: But what about the British public though?
 
WATERSON: -- Telegraph and the Financial Times.
 
ASHER: Among the British public is there something? 
 
WATERSON: Well, I think the polling shows that he has much more favorable ratings in America and elsewhere than in the U.K. You could make the 
 
 argument that the British media is leading the way on that and pushing people to look at it a certain way. Other people think that he's really 
 
 fighting a case that is bringing his family into disrepute, dragging his dad and his brother down. The Royal family always had the dictum of don't 
 
 complain and never explain. 
 
And the idea that Harry has gone against this and has rather than walking away trying to keep his head above the fray, he has decided to get stuck 
 
 in. He's made pretty clear in court filings that he views this as a personal mission, that he's someone who's willing to take the punches, 
 
 willing to take the public attacks and has the money to fight this all the way to the end where other people have settled before court. So it's clear 
 
 that he views this as a personal thing about getting justice for him, his family and particularly his mother Princess Diana. 
 
ASHER: What's interesting is that, you know, and you touched on this, that other members of the Royal family, I mean, even Prince William after the 
 
 death of Diana, I mean, the whole MO, the whole sort of modus operandi, was all about appeasing the tabloids, keeping them happy, playing ball with 
 
 them as much as you could. 
 
The fact that Harry has gone against that, can you just sort of explain? I mean, obviously I've read Spare, you know, I've watched the documentary, 
 
 but just the fact that both boys, both Harry and William have taken such divergent approaches towards the tabloid press. Just explain that to us 
 
 why. 
 
WATERSON: Well, I think the simple answer is that William has to take over the monarchy and the sort of establishment wing of the Royal family, views 
 
 it as keeping the British tabloid press on side is in its long-term benefit. And that means that sort of doing deals, whether or not they exist 
 
 or not, behind closed doors, as Harry alleges, is part of that. 
 
Harry says that his father prioritized good coverage of Queen Camilla over coverage of his own sons. There's also allegations that King Charles' own 
 
 press officers were briefing Harry. Harry essentially feels that the world was closing in on him and other people were turning on him and that he's 
 
 finally had enough. And he comes across almost as a bit of a sort of wounded animal who doesn't care who he lashes out at anymore because it is 
 
 now his mission to bring down these outlets. 
 
So it is a personal thing. And he even talks about it in quite grand tones about democracy being under threat and the government of the U.K. being at 
 
 rock bottom because no one is willing to take on these still powerful newspapers. They're less powerful than they used to be, but they still set 
 
 the national agenda in the U.K. 
 
ASHER: They are extremely powerful, especially compared to the tabloids in other countries. Just talk to us about the sort of outsized role that the 
 
 tabloids in the U.K. have just in terms of their role in British public life. 
 
WATERSON: Yeah, well, they -- you know, 20 years ago when a lot of these stories that Harry's suing over relate to, they were still selling millions 
 
 of copies a day each. Now, their websites have a certain degree of power, but it's been lessened by social media. The real thing though is that they 
 
 still sort of feed the raw material into the sort of sausage machine of news. And they are the ones who are providing the grist that then goes 
 
 around on social media. 
 <br>[12:40:10] 
 
So you end up with these whole narratives being built off just one anonymous Royal source talking to the Daily Mail or the Mirror or the Sun. 
 
 And Harry says that this sort of stuff is what drove him and his wife Meghan out of the U.K. because they just couldn't handle it anymore and 
 
 they chose that California would be a better place for them to live because they just wouldn't be subjected to that level of invasion of privacy. 
 
ASHER: Right. Jim Waterson, Media Editor for the Guardian. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. 
 
All right, still to come here, the investigation into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents takes another strange turn. The details 
 
 after the break. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 
ASHER: Was it an accident or was it intentional? CNN has learned that an employee at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home drained a swimming pool back in 
 
 October that ended up flooding a room where surveillance video was stored on computer servers. It happened a few weeks after FBI agents found 
 
 hundreds of classified documents there. This comes as the Special Counsel's probe into President Trump's handling of classified documents appears to be 
 
 in the final stages. CNN has also learned, the President's lawyers met with the Justice Department on Monday about what they call prosecutorial 
 
 misconduct. 
 
Let's bring in CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. This idea of this employee draining the swimming pool, so many people are so 
 
 suspicious about this. What are authorities saying here? What are your sources saying? 
 
PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Oh, look, it's sort of a silly story. That raises some really serious questions about possible 
 
 obstruction of justice, because if this was done intentionally. And at this point, our reporting is that none of the surveillance footage was damaged, 
 
 but it's one of a series of questionable incidents down at Mar-a-Lago related to the surveillance footage that has been a key piece of evidence 
 
 for investigators. 
 
We know that they have sought multiple times, in multiple different periods of time, surveillance footage from the premises, as they try to determine 
 
 whether anyone intentionally tried to hide classified documents or move them during various searches. We also know that one of the men -- young 
 
 men, who was caught on the surveillance footage moving boxes, we know that for sure, we've reported that, he also reached out to the and been asked 
 
 whether investigators have all the surveillance footage or if anyone has tried to tamper with it. 
 
So again, this incident just raises more questions before the grand jury and been asked whether investigators have all the surveillance footage or 
 
 if anyone has tried to tamper with it. So again, this incident just raises more questions about whether there's been any effort to try to keep some 
 
 surveillance footage from investigators. 
 
ASHER: And Donald Trump's lawyers meeting with the DOJ, what does that tell us about where they are in the investigation, where things stand now? 
 
REID: So it's important to note that this was a meeting that was requested by Trump's defense team. In some criminal investigations, prosecutors will 
 
 reach out, signal to you that it's likely your client will be charged, and then you can come in and explain why that shouldn't happen. But that's not 
 
 what we have here. 
 
Here we have lawyers reaching out saying they would like a meeting. They were granted this meeting. In attendance was Jack Smith in addition to one 
 
 other official inside that meeting where they were able to air their frustrations, their objections to the probe, but they weren't given any 
 
 sense of timing or whether charges are imminent. 
 
So it really doesn't tell us anything about the status of the probe now, but it shows that the attorney general, clearly he was requested at this 
 
 meeting, he didn't want to show up, he wants to make it clear to the American people that this is being handled independently by the Special 
 
 Counsel. And that if they want to come in and air their grievances, just like Hunter Biden's lawyers got to do a few weeks ago, they can do that. 
 
ASHER: All right, Paula Reid live for us there. Thank you so much. 
 
Donald Trump will soon have two more competitors for the Republican nomination for president. In the coming hours, former New Jersey Governor 
 
 Chris Christie is expected to formally announce that he is running in 2024. This will be Chris Christie's second campaign for the White House. And 
 
 former Vice President Mike Pence has already filed the paperwork to run. It's expected to make his announcement on Wednesday ahead of his town hall 
 
 right here on CNN. 
 
That town hall is going to be live from Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa on Wednesday. Pence will take questions from CNN anchor and 
 
 Chief Political Correspondent, Dana Bash. Be sure to tune in. It's Wednesday, June 7th, 8 p.m. in the evening, if you're watching from Des 
 
 Moines, Iowa, early Thursday at 4 am, if you're watching from Nairobi right here on CNN. 
 
All right, coming up, a popular football player has a plan to fight racism in the sport. We'll have part two of his exclusive interview next. 
 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
 <br>[12:49:57] 
 
ASHER: America's largest gay rights organization has declared a state of emergency for the LGBTQ plus community. A human rights campaign says 
 
 millions of Americans are facing real and dangerous threats. The group also released a digital guidebook. It contains health and safety resources, and 
 
 the summary of those by each state. In the first quarter of 2023, at least 417 bills surrounding LGBTQ issues were introduced into state legislatures 
 
 in the U.S. Those laws include pronoun refusal, forced student outing, and anti-drag bans as well. 
 
A prominent football player is calling on the sport and government to do more to fight racism. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Inter Milan 
 
 striker Romelu Lukaku has called for more diversity in positions of power to help improve the situation. Lukaku has been speaking out since Real 
 
 Madrid forward Vinicius Jr. suffered racist verbal abuse on May 21st. As our senior sport analyst Darren Lewis found out, Romelu Lukaku has a clear 
 
 idea of what needs to happen. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)
 
ROMELU LUKAKU, INTER MILAN STRIKER: Disappointing that it happens because disappointing we're in 2023. The world has different cultures, different 
 
 religions, different people of color. And still, we make the same mistakes all the time. All the time, all the time, all the time. And that's the 
 
 thing where like, you know, it rubs me off the wrong way. Because the brand of football, if you want to be represented in a nice way, it also starts 
 
 with the people above that have to fight against this type of things. 
 
And for me, it really doesn't happen enough. Enough, like really, like in a strict manner that fans come to this dance and really respect people of 
 
 different color, people of different religion, sexuality, also online hate. I think you have to also like attack that because a lot of players online 
 
 get a lot of stuff said to them which are not nice 
 
So then I say also like governments they have to start getting involved in that stuff which doesn't happen for me enough.
 
DARREN LEWIS, CNN SENIOR SPORTS ANALYST: I've been speaking to a lot of footballers about this issue. 
 
LUKAKU: Yeah. 
 
LEWIS: All of you understandably have a very similar message to the one that you've just put out just there. But what was quite striking about the 
 
 Asia situation was the reaction from you guys around Europe, Casimiro in England.
 
LUKAKU: Yeah.
 
LEWIS: Mbappe in France, Raphael here. Raffina in Spain. 
 
LUKAKU: Yeah.
 
LEWIS: And it just made me think, given that all of you have been calling for help for so many years now, you talked about 2019, 2021, 2023, in your 
 
 case. 
 
LUKAKU: Yeah.
 
LEWIS: Do you think we could see a union of top players coming together to actually address this issue that affects them, rather than going around in 
 
 circles all the time calling for help that doesn't come for you? 
 
LUKAKU: I think so. I think it will start. But he really takes one player with an older player that paved the way. I'll say like, Clarence Seedorf, 
 
 for me, is the perfect example. I think he wants to start something like that. So I think he really takes effort from the players of our generation 
 
 to come together and speak with the UEFA and the FIFA, and all the other federations of every league to get together and say and speak about how we 
 
 can protect those types of problems. 
 
Because it's like in the last few years, it's been too much of these things, you know what I mean? I think that at one point it was not really 
 
 seen or heard, but now because of the cameras all over the stadiums, social media, we, players, we see everything. We hear also everything. You know, 
 
 so sometimes in the game, I might watch a game at home and I might hear what the fans are saying. And if how -- if I can hear it at the house, the 
 
 referee doesn't hear it on the pitch. 
 
LEWIS: Do you think we need black referees? Maybe if he had black referees, because I don't know yet. You play Italy, have you seen any? 
 
LUKAKU: No. 
 
LEWIS: Do you think we need black referees? Maybe not just to hear that, but to be represented at that level as well? 
 
LUKAKU: I think you need more diversity in position of power, if you understand what I mean. At the top, that's where it needs to start. That's 
 
 where you need to have diversity. People of color, put them in the top of, you know, every boardroom and that's when the change will start. 
 <br>[12:54:55] 
 
That's where, for example, in our Belgian Federation, that's where they're starting. They're trying to put in people of color, different sexuality, 
 
 and stuff like that. So every situation that can happen, if it's racial or every form of type of discrimination can be attacked straightaway. And I 
 
 think that's how it should happen. If you put people of different color in position of power, I think things will get taken care of much faster than 
 
 that. 
 
(END VIDEO tape)
 
ASHER: In a statement to CNN football's world governing body FIFA says it has made important steps towards greater diversity since reforms began in 
 
 2016, and currently has staff from 100 different countries, 40% of which are female. 
 
Right. It is not a Barbie world without pink. And the new Barbie movie needed so much fluorescent pink -- paint rather, for the set. It apparently 
 
 contributed to a global shortage. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
KEN: Can I come to your house tonight? 
 
BARBIE: Sure. I don't have anything big planned, just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies and planned choreography and a bespoke song. You 
 
 should stop by. 
 
KEN: So cool. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
ASHER: As the film's production designer put it, the world ran out of pink. Greta Gerwig, who directed and co-wrote the film, said, quote, I wanted the 
 
 pinks to be very bright and everything had to be almost too much. Mission accomplished, wouldn't you say? Barbie, the movie, produced by CNN's sister 
 
 company, Warner Brothers Pictures hits theaters July 1st. Thank you -- July 21st, excuse me. 
 
Thank you so much for watching ONE WORLD. I'm Zain Asher. And of course, up next, you're watching CNN.
